(Prior Code, § 1.06)  (Ord. 112-91, passed 10-10-1991; Ord. 1-2015, passed 2-

§ 30.06  CODE OF ETHICS.
   (A)   Declaration of policy. The proper operation of democratic government
requires that public officials and employees be independent, impartial and
responsible to the people; that government decisions and policy be made in
proper channels of the government structure; that public office not be used for
personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its
government.  In recognition of these goals, there is hereby established a Code
of Ethics for all village officials and employees, whether elected or
appointed, paid or unpaid, including members of Village Clerk’s Offices,
committees and commissions of the village.  The purpose of this code is to
establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such employees
and officials by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with
the best interests of the village and by directing disclosure by such officials
and employees of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the
village.
   (B)   Responsibility of public office. Public officials and employees are
agents of public purpose and hold office for the benefit of the public.  They
are bound to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution
of this state and carry out impartially the laws of the nation, state and the
village and to observe in their official acts the highest standards of morality
and to discharge faithfully the duties of their office regardless of personal
considerations, recognizing that the public interest must be their prime
concern.  Their conduct in both their official and private affairs should be
above reproach so as to foster respect for all government.
   (C)   Dedicated service. All officials and employees of the village should
be loyal to the objectives expressed by the electorate and the programs
developed to attain these objectives.  Appointive officials and employees
should adhere to the rules of work and performance established as the standard
for their positions by the appropriate authority.  Officials and employees
should not exceed their authority or breach the law or ask others to do so, and

§ 36.01  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. 
   All forfeitures, fees, charges and other fixed sources of revenue paid to
the village, and to related organizations whose budgets are reviewed and/or
approved by the Village Board, shall be listed in this chapter, except special
assessments and charges, utility and property tax rates set by annual budget,
certain recreation program and other fees and charges which change frequently
due to programmatic variation, some time and material charges, and other
incidental fees.
   (A)   This listing is designed to provide citizens, staff and elected
officials with a single reference document for most municipal charges.
   (B)   The intent of this comprehensive listing is to facilitate annual
review of forfeitures, fees, charges and other revenue sources, to assure that,
to the extent feasible, users of specific municipal services continue to bear
the cost of materials, operational costs, related outside charges to the
village, staff review time, staff paperwork-related costs, and related indirect
costs.  To the extent feasible, reviews shall occur prior to or concurrent with
the budgetary process for adoption of appropriate revisions by the Village
Board effective either January 1 or July 1 of each year.
   (C)   It shall be the policy of the village that, to the extent practical,
user costs not be subsidized by property taxes or otherwise shifted to non-
related income sources, and that there be progressive movement toward municipal
service users paying 100% of related costs.  Once established, user fees are
intended to remain at 100% of costs.  Where feasible, cost analyses shall be
prepared on occasion to determine that user fees are neither too low to recover
the cost of service delivery, nor serve as a subsidy for other cost centers.

provisions are not violated. No action shall be taken under this section to
abate a public nuisance unless the officer shall have inspected, or caused to
be inspected, the premises where the nuisance is alleged to exist and have
satisfied himself or herself that a nuisance does in fact exist.
   (B)   Summary abatement.
      (1)   Notice to owner. If the inspecting officer shall determine that a
public nuisance exists within the village and that there is great and immediate
danger to the public health, safety, peace, morals, or decency, the Village
President may direct the Chief of Police to serve notice on the person causing,
permitting, or maintaining such nuisance or upon the owner or occupant of the
premises where such nuisance is caused, permitted, or maintained and to post a
copy of said notice on the premises. Such notice shall direct the person
causing, permitting, or maintaining such nuisance or the owner or occupant of
the premises to abate or remove such nuisance within 24 hours and shall state
that unless such nuisance is so abated, the village shall cause the same to be
abated and will charge the cost thereof to the owner, occupant, or person
causing, permitting, or maintaining the nuisance, as the case may be.
      (2)   Abatement by village. If the nuisance is not abated within the time
provided or if the owner, occupant, or person causing the nuisance cannot be
found, the officer having the duty of enforcement shall cause the abatement or
removal of such public nuisance.
   (C)   Abatement by court action. If the inspecting officer shall determine
that a public nuisance exists on private premises, but that the nature of such
nuisance is not such as to threaten great and immediate danger to the public
health, safety, peace, morals, or decency, he or she shall serve notice on the
person causing or maintaining the nuisance and the owner of the property to
remove the same within ten days. If such nuisance is not removed within ten
days, he or she shall report such fact to the Village President who may direct
the Village Attorney to commence an action in Circuit Court for the abatement
of the nuisance.
   (D)   Other methods not excluded. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed
as prohibiting the abatement of public nuisances by the village or its
officials in accordance with the laws of the state, nor as prohibiting an
action to be commenced in the Circuit Court seeking a forfeiture as provided in
§
90.99.
   (E)   Cost of abatement. In addition to any other penalty imposed by this
chapter for the erection, contrivance, creation, continuance, or maintenance of
a public nuisance, the cost of abating a public nuisance by the village shall
be collected as a debt from the owner, occupant, or person causing, permitting,
or maintaining the nuisance, and if notice to abate the nuisance has been given
to the owner, such cost shall be assessed against the real estate as a special
charge.

§ 130.002  LOUD AND UNNECESSARY NOISE.
   (A)   General. No person shall make or cause to be made any loud,
disturbing, or unnecessary sounds or noises such as may tend to annoy or
disturb a person of ordinary sensibilities in or about any public street,
alley, park, waterway, or any private residence.
   (B)   Public address systems and amplifiers. No person shall use or operate
any public address system, amplifier, or device which increases the volume of
voice, music, or other sounds so loud as to disturb the public peace or the
quiet and peacefulness of the neighborhood.
   (C)   Construction and machinery noise. Except for village employees,
between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., no person shall do construction

similar nature.
(Prior Code, § 9.06)  Penalty, see §
130.999
§ 130.003  LOITERING.
   (A)   A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in a
place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if
it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled
the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a
loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspect’s escape.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a
police officer, or where a “no loitering” sign or signs have been posted, to
loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or quasi-public sidewalk,
street, curb, crosswalk, walkway area, mall or that portion of private property
utilized for public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the free
passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any person
to block, obstruct, or prevent free access to the entrance to any building open
to the public.
   (C)   For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACE has the following
definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles
(whether moving or not), and buildings open to the general public, including
those which serve food or drink or provide entertainment, and the doorways and
entrances to buildings or dwellings and the grounds enclosing them.

agricultural districts.
   (B)   Exception. One Philippine pot-bellied pig (sus scrofa) per single-
family household may be kept as a pet, but not for breeding purposes. Bred pot-
bellied pigs shall be deemed livestock and are subject to the provisions of
division (A) above. In addition, any person having a pot-bellied pig in his or
her possession or under his or her control shall be subject to the running at
large prohibitions provided for in §
130.004.
(Prior Code, § 9.10)  (Ord. 3-97, passed 3-13-1997; Ord. 11-2014, passed 12-11-
2014)  Penalty, see §
130.999
§ 130.006  WILD ANIMALS.
   (A)   Prohibition on keeping. No person shall harbor, maintain, or control a
wild, dangerous, or undomesticated animal within the village.
   (B)   Definition.
      WILD, DANGEROUS, OR UNDOMESTICATED ANIMAL.  That which is not of a
species customarily used as an ordinary household pet but one which would
ordinarily be found in the wilderness of this or any other country, or one
which otherwise causes a reasonable person to be fearful of bodily harm or
property damage. Fish in an aquarium are not included in this definition.
   (C)   Exceptions. The prohibitions of division (A) above shall not apply
where the creatures are in the care, custody, or control of:
      (1)   An itinerant or transient carnival, circus, or other show; or
      (2)   A public or private educational institution and zoological garden
if:

materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, belonging to, on
loan to, or otherwise in the custody of a library.
   (B)   Possession without consent prohibited. Whoever intentionally takes and
carries away, transfers, conceals, or retains possession of any library
material without the consent of a library official, agent, or employee and with
intent to deprive the library of possession of the material may be subject to a
forfeiture as provided by §
10.99.
   (C)   Concealment. The concealment of library material beyond the last
station for borrowing library material in a library is evidence of intent to
deprive the library of possession of the material. The discovery of library
material which has not been borrowed in accordance with the library’s
procedures, or taken with consent of a library official, agent, or employee and
which is concealed upon the person or among the belongings of the person, or
concealed by a person upon the person or among the belongings of another is
evidence of intentional concealment on the part of the person so concealing the
material.
   (D)   Detention based on probable cause. An official or adult employee or
agent of a library who has probable cause for believing that a person has
violated this section in his or her presence may detain the person in a
reasonable manner for a reasonable length of time to deliver the person to a
peace officer, or to the person’s parent or guardian in the case of a minor.
The detained person shall be promptly informed of the purpose of the detention
and be permitted to make telephone calls, but shall not be interrogated or
searched against his or her will before the arrival of a peace officer who may
conduct a lawful interrogation of the accused person. While acting in
compliance with this section, the official, agent, or employee affecting the
detention shall be entitled to the same defense in any action as is available
to a peace officer making an arrest in the line of duty.
   (E)   Damaging material prohibited. No person shall mar, deface, or in any
other way damage or mutilate any library material.
   (F)   Return demanded. No person shall fail, on demand, to return any
library material when such demand has been made in accordance with the rules
and regulations duly made and adopted by the library.

SEX OFFENDER RESIDENCY RESTRICTIONS AND CHILD SAFETY ZONE
§ 130.070  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The village finds and declares that sex offenders are a serious threat to
public safety. Given the high rate of recidivism for sex offenders, the village
believes that in addition to the protections afforded by state law near
schools, day care centers, and other places children frequent, reducing
opportunity and temptation is appropriate to minimizing the risk of re-offense
to better protect the children in these public places. This subchapter is a
regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of children in the
village from the risk that convicted sex offenders may re-offend in locations
close to their residences where children tend to congregate or be regularly
present. It is the intent of this subchapter not to impose a criminal penalty
but rather to serve the village’s compelling interest to promote, protect, and
improve the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the village by
creating safety zones around locations where children regularly congregate in
concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are
prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence and wherein
access by certain sexual offenders and sexual predators shall be restricted and
excluded.

shall, in writing or orally, request inspections by the Building Inspector at
appropriate times required for the enforcement of this code. The Building
Inspector shall perform the requested inspection within 48 hours after
notification, except the final inspection. Construction may not proceed beyond
the point of inspection until the inspection has been completed, except if
inspection has not taken place within 48 hours of notification, excluding
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, unless otherwise agreed upon between the
permittee and the Building Inspector.
   (K)   Permit lapses. A building permit shall lapse and be void unless
building operations are commenced within four months. In any event, all permits
shall lapse one year from the date of issuance unless extended by the Building
Inspector.
   (L)   Revocation. If the Building, Plumbing, or Electrical Inspector shall
find at any time that applicable ordinances, laws, orders, plans, and
specifications are not being complied with and that the holder of the permit
refused to conform after written warning or instruction has been issued to him
or her, he or she shall revoke the building, electrical, or plumbing permit by
written notice posted at the site of the work. When any such permit is revoked,
it shall be unlawful to do any further work thereunder until the permit is

the village to be, in his or her judgment, so old, dilapidated, or so out of
repair as to be dangerous, unsafe, unsanitary, or otherwise unfit for human
habitation, occupancy, or use, and so that it would be unreasonable to repair
the same, he or she shall order the owner to raze and remove it at the owner’s
expense. Such order and proceedings shall be carried out in the manner
prescribed for the razing of buildings in Wis. Stats. § 66.05. Where the public
safety requires immediate action, the Building Inspector shall enter upon the
premises with such assistance as may be necessary and cause the building or

(Prior Code, § 14.14)
§ 150.015  SIGNAL-RECEIVING ANTENNAS.
   (A)   Purpose. This section regulating the placement and installation of
signal-receiving antennas is adopted to:
      (1)   Provide uniform regulation of all signal-receiving antenna devices;
      (2)   Secure placement of such antennas in an aesthetically sensitive
manner while permitting users reasonable reception of signals; and
      (3)   Protect the public from injury from antennas that are inadequately
mounted, unduly susceptible to wind pressure, improperly installed and wired,
or are placed on structures insufficiently designed or constructed to safely
support the antenna.
   (B)   Permit required. Except for satellite antennas with a diameter of two
feet or less, exempt under Wis. Stats. § 62.23(7), no person shall build,
construct, use, or place any type of signal-receiving antenna until a permit
shall have first been obtained from the Building Inspector.
   (C)   Definition. For purposes of this section, a SIGNAL-RECEIVING ANTENNA
is defined as any apparatus capable of receiving communications from a
transmitter or a transmitter relay located in a planetary orbit. This
definition includes all types of signal-receiving antennas including, without
limitation, parabolic antennas, home earth stations, satellite television
disks, UHF and VHF television antennas, and am, fm, ham and short-wave radio
antennas, regardless of the method of mounting.
   (D)   Application. Application for a signal-receiving antenna permit shall
be made in writing to the Building Inspector, together with the appropriate fee
and a sufficient set of mounting plans and specifications, including a general
plot plan showing the location of the proposed signal-receiving antenna with
respect to streets, lot lines, and buildings. If such application meets all
requirements of this section, the application shall be approved.
   (E)   Installation standards. Signal receiving antennas shall comply with
the following provisions.
      (1)   Setbacks.
         (a)   Any signal-receiving antenna and its mounting post shall comply
with the appropriate setbacks required under
Chapter 155.
         (b)   Subject to the provisions herein, signal-receiving antennas
shall only be located in the
rear yard of any lot. If reasonable reception of signals is not possible with a
rear yard placement due to the physical characteristics of the lot and area,
the signal-receiving antenna shall be placed in the side yard of the lot. In
the event that reasonable reception of signals is not possible by locating the
signal-receiving antenna on the rear or side yard of the property, such antenna
may be placed in the front yard or on the roof of structures on the property.
For corner lots, a side yard is only a yard that does not face a street.
         (c)   If side yard, front yard, or roof mounting is requested, the
Building Inspector shall determine where reasonable reception is possible based
on evidence provided by the person seeking to erect or construct the antenna.
      (2)   Mounting. Signal-receiving antennas attached to the wall or roof of
any principal or accessory structure shall be permitted only if the structure
is properly constructed to carry all imposed loading and complies with
applicable state and local building code requirements. The Building Inspector
may require engineering calculations.
      (3)   Diameter. The diameter of the signal-receiving antenna shall not
exceed three feet in diameter, except for systems used to provide community
antenna television services.
      (4)   Height. Any signal-receiving antenna, whether ground- or roof-
mounted, including any platform or structure upon which said antenna is mounted
or affixed, may not exceed ten feet in height above the highest point on the
principal building on the lot, as measured from the base of the antenna,
including any platform or structure upon which said antenna is mounted or
affixed, to the highest point of the antenna or dish.
      (5)   Wind pressure. All signal-receiving antennas shall be permanently
mounted in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications for installation.
All such installations shall meet a minimum wind load design velocity of 80
mph.
      (6)   Electrical installations. Electrical installations in connection
with signal-receiving antennas, including grounding of the system, shall be in
accordance with the National Electrical Safety Code, the state’s Electrical
Code, and the instructions of the manufacturer. In cases of conflict, the
stricter requirements shall govern. All cable used to conduct current or
signals from the signal-receiving antenna to the receivers shall be installed
underground unless installation site conditions preclude underground
installation. The location of all such underground lines, cables, and conduits
shall be shown on the application for a permit. All signal-receiving antennas
shall be grounded against direct lightning strikes.
      (7)   Temporary placement. No portable or trailer-mounted signal-
receiving antenna shall be permitted, except for temporary installation for on-
site testing and demonstration purposes for periods not exceeding five days.
However, such trial placement shall be in accordance with all provisions of
this section. Failure to comply shall result in a citation being issued for
violation of this section. Any person making such temporary placement shall
first give written notice to the Building Inspector of the date when such
placement shall begin and end.
      (8)   Advertising. No form of advertising or identification, sign, or
mural is permitted on the signal-receiving antenna other than the customary
manufacturer’s identification plates.
      (9)   Interference with broadcasting. Signal-receiving antennas shall be
filtered and/or shielded so as to prevent the emission or reflection of an
electromagnetic radiation that would cause any harmful interference with the
radio and/or television broadcasting or reception on adjacent properties. In
the event that harmful interference is caused subsequent to its installation,
the owner of the signal-receiving antenna shall promptly take steps to
eliminate the harmful interference in accordance with Federal Communications
Commission regulations.
      (10)   Compliance with federal regulations. The installation and use of
every signal-receiving antenna shall be in conformity with the Federal Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984 and regulations adopted there under.
      (11)   Aesthetic considerations. Signal-receiving antennas shall be
located and designed to reasonably reduce visual impact from surrounding
properties at street level.

§ 151.01  INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. This chapter is adopted pursuant to the
authorization in Wis. Stats. §§ 61.35 and 61.351 and the requirements in Wis.
Stats. §§ 87.30 and 281.31.
   (B)   Title. This chapter shall be known as the Shoreland-Wetland Zoning
Code for the Village of Newburg, Washington and Ozaukee Counties, Wisconsin.
   (C)   Finding of fact. Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and
pollution of the navigable waters of the municipality would adversely affect
the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare and impair the tax
base.
   (D)   Statement of purpose. The legislature of the state has delegated
responsibility to all municipalities to:
      (1)   Promote the public health, safety, convenience, and general
welfare;
      (2)   Maintain the stormwater and floodwater storage capacity of
wetlands;
      (3)   Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which
filter or store sediments, nutrients, heavy metals, or organic compounds that
would otherwise drain into navigable waters;
      (4)   Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life, and
wildlife by preserving wetlands and other aquatic habitat;
      (5)   Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area;
and
      (6)   Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal
of natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland-wetland excavation,
filling, and other earth moving activities.
(Prior Code, § 23.01)
§ 151.02  RULES OF CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Rules of construction. For the purpose of administering and enforcing
this chapter, the terms or words used herein shall be interpreted as follows:
words used in the present tense include the future; words in the singular
number include the plural number; words in the plural number include the
singular number. The word shall is mandatory, not permissive. All distances,
unless otherwise specified, shall be measured horizontally.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      ACCESSORY STRUCTURE OR USE.  A detached subordinate structure or a use
which is clearly incidental to, and customarily found in connection with, the
principal structure or use to which it is related and which is located on the
same lot as that of the principal structure or use.
      BOATHOUSE.  As defined in Wis. Stats. § 30.121(1), a permanent structure
used for the storage of watercraft and associated materials and includes all
structures which are totally enclosed, have roofs or walls, or any combination
of structural parts.
      CLASS 2 PUBLIC NOTICE.  Publication of a public hearing notice under Wis.
Stats. Chapter 985 in a newspaper of circulation in the affected area.
Publication is required on two consecutive weeks, the last at least seven days
prior to the hearing.
      CONDITIONAL USE.  A use which is permitted by this chapter provided that
certain conditions specified in the chapter are met and that a permit is
granted by the Board of Appeals or, where appropriate, the planning agency
designated by the municipal governing body.
      DEVELOPMENT.  Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate
including, but not limited to, the construction of buildings, structures, or
accessory structures; the construction of additions or substantial alterations
to buildings-structures or accessory structures; the placement of buildings or
structures; ditching, lagooning, dredging, filling, grading, paving,
excavation, or drilling operations; and the deposition or extraction of earthen
materials.
      DRAINAGE SYSTEM.  One or more artificial ditches, tile drains, or similar

discharge.
      ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL FACILITY.  Any facility, temporary or permanent,
which is reasonably expected to abate, reduce, or aid in the prevention,
measurement, control, or monitoring of noise, air, or water pollutants, solid
waste and thermal pollution, radiation, or other pollutants, including
facilities installed principally to supplement or to replace existing property
or equipment not meeting, or allegedly not meeting, acceptable pollution
control standards, or which are to be supplemented or replaced by other
pollution control facilities.
      FIXED HOUSEBOAT.  As defined in Wis. Stats. § 30.121(1), a structure not
actually used for navigation which extends beyond the ordinary high water mark
of a navigable waterway and is retained in place either by cables to the
shoreline or by anchors or spud poles attached to the bed of the waterway.
      NAVIGABLE WATERS.
         (a)   Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, all natural inland lakes within
the state, and all streams, ponds, sloughs, flowages, and other waters within
the territorial limits of this state, including the state’s portion of boundary
waters, which are navigable under the laws of this state. Under Wis. Stats. §
281.31(2)(d), not withstanding any other provision of law or administrative
rule promulgated there under, shoreland ordinances required under Wis. Stats. §
61.351 or 62.231 and Wis. Adm. Code Chapter NR 117 do not apply to lands
adjacent to farm drainage ditches if:
            1.   Such lands are not adjacent to a natural navigable stream or
river;
            2.   Those parts of such drainage ditches adjacent to such lands
were not navigable streams before ditching; and
            3.   Such lands are maintained in nonstructural agricultural use.
         (b)   The state’s Supreme Court has declared navigable bodies of water
that have a bed differentiated from adjacent uplands and levels or flow
sufficient to support navigation by a recreational craft of the shallowest
draft on an annually recurring basis [Muench v. Public Service Commission, 261
Wis. 492 (1952) and DeGavnor and Co. Inc. v. Department of Natural Resources,
70 Wis. 2d 936 (1975)]. For example, a stream which is navigable by skiff or
canoe during normal spring high water is navigable, in fact, under the laws of
this state though it may be dry during other seasons.
      ORDINARY HIGH WATER MARK.  The point on the bank or shore up to which the
presence and action of surface water is so continuous as to leave a distinctive
mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial vegetation,
predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized characteristic.
      PLANNING AGENCY.  The Municipal Plan Commission created under Wis. Stats.
§ 62.23(1), a board of public land commissioners, or a committee of the
municipality’s governing body which acts on matters pertaining to planning and
zoning.
      SHORELANDS. Lands within the following distances from the ordinary high
water mark of navigable waters: 1,000 feet from a lake, pond, or flowage; and
300 feet from a river or stream or to the landward side of the floodplain,
whichever distance is greater.
      SHORELAND-WETLAND DISTRICT.  The zoning district, created in this
shoreland-wetland zoning chapter, comprised of shorelands that are designated
as wetlands on the wetlands inventory maps which have been adopted and made a
part of this chapter.
      UNNECESSARY HARDSHIP.  That circumstance where special conditions, which
were not self-created, affect a particular property and make strict conformity
with restrictions governing area, setbacks, or frontage height or density
unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of this
chapter.
      VARIANCE.  An authorization granted by the Board of Appeals to construct
or alter a building or structure in a manner that deviates from the dimensional
standards of this chapter.
      WETLAND ALTERATION.  Any filling, flooding, draining, dredging, ditching,
tiling, excavating, temporary water level stabilization measures, or dike and
dam construction in a wetland area.
      WETLANDS.  Those areas where water is at, near, or above the land surface
long enough to support aquatic or hydrophytic vegetation and which have soils
indicative of wet conditions.
(Prior Code, § 23.02)
§ 151.03  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Compliance. The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within
the shoreland area of the municipality shall be in full compliance with the
terms of this chapter and other applicable local state or federal regulations.
(However, see §
151.05 for the standards applicable to nonconforming uses.) All permitted
development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless otherwise
expressly excluded by a provision of this chapter.
   (B)   Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically
exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to
comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are
required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13) applies. The construction,
reconstruction, maintenance, and repair of state highways and bridges by the
state’s Department of Transportation are exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.123(6)(b)
applies.
   (C)   Abrogation and greater restrictions.
      (1)   This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. §§ 61.35, 62.23, or 87.30 which relate to
floodplains and shoreland-wetlands, except that where another municipal zoning
ordinance is more restrictive than this chapter, that ordinance shall continue
in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not
otherwise.
      (2)   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing deed restrictions, covenants, or easements. However, where this
chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall
prevail.
   (D)   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall
be liberally construed in favor of the municipality and shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. Where a
provision of this chapter is required by a standard in Wis. Adm. Code Chapter
NR 117, and where the chapter provision is unclear, the provision shall be
interpreted in light of the Chapter NR 117 standards in effect on the date of
the adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text
amendment to this chapter.
   (E)   Severability. Should any portion of this chapter be declared invalid
or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this
chapter shall not be affected.
   (F)   Annexed areas. The county shoreland zoning provisions in effect on the
date of annexation remain in effect administered by the municipality for all
areas annexed by the municipality after May 7, 1982, unless any of the changes
as allowed by Wis. Stats. §§ 59.692(7)(a)1. through 59.692(7)(a)3. occurs.
These annexed lands are described on the municipality’s official zoning map.
The county shoreland zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the
purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the
Municipal Zoning Administrator.
(Prior Code, § 23.03)
§ 151.04  SHORELAND-WETLAND ZONING DISTRICT.
   The Shoreland-Wetland Zoning District is intended to protect wetlands five
acres or greater within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high water mark of navigable
lakes, ponds, or flowages or 300 feet from the ordinary high water mark of
navigable rivers or streams, or the landward side of the floodplain, whichever
distance is greater.
   (A)   District boundaries.
      (1)   The Shoreland-Wetland Zoning District includes all wetlands in the
municipality which are five acres or more and are shown on the surface water
data viewer with the Wetlands, Plant, and Habitat: Wisconsin Wetland Inventory
turned on as well as the Wisconsin Wetland Inventory maps stamped “FINAL” on,
whichever is determined to provide the best available information, that have
been adopted and made a part of this chapter and which are:
         (a)   Within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high water mark of navigable
lakes, ponds, or flowages. Lakes, ponds, or flowages in the municipality shall
be presumed to be navigable if they are shown on the United States Geological
Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated
by reference and made a part of this chapter; or
         (b)   Within 300 feet of the ordinary high water mark of navigable
rivers or streams, or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever
distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be navigable if
they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the
United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which
have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter. Floodplain
zoning maps adopted in division (D) below shall be used to determine the extent
of floodplain areas.
      (2)   Determinations of navigability and ordinary high water mark
location shall initially be made by the state’s Department of Natural
Resources. When questions arise, the Zoning Administrator shall contact the
appropriate district office of the state’s Department of Natural Resources for
a final determination of navigability or ordinary high water mark.
      (3)   When an apparent discrepancy exists between the shoreland-wetland
district boundary shown on the official zoning maps and actual field conditions
at the time the maps were adopted, the Zoning Administrator shall contact the
appropriate district office of the state’s Department of Natural Resources to
determine if the shoreland-wetland district boundary, as mapped, is in error.
If the state’s Department of Natural Resources staff concur with the Zoning
Administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the
Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a
zoning permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct
zoning district. In order to correct wetland mapping errors or acknowledge
exempted wetlands designated in divisions (A)(4) and (A)(5) below, the Zoning
Administrator shall be responsible for initiating a map amendment within a
reasonable period.
      (4)   Wetlands which are filled prior to the date on which the
municipality received final wetland inventory maps, in a manner which affects
their wetland characteristics to the extent that the area can no longer be
defined as wetland, are not subject to this chapter.
      (5)   Wetlands located between the original ordinary high water mark and
a bulkhead line established prior to May 7, 1982, under Wis. Stats. § 30.11 are
not subject to this chapter.

§ 152.07  CONTROL OF EROSION AND POLLUTANTS DURING LAND DISTURBANCE AND
DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   This section applies to the following sites of land development or
land disturbing activities:
      (1)   Those requiring a subdivision plat approval or the construction of
houses or commercial, industrial, or institutional buildings on lots of
approved subdivision plats;
      (2)   Those requiring a certified survey approval or the construction of
houses or commercial, industrial, or institutional buildings on lots of
approved certified surveys;
      (3)   Those involving grading, removal of protective ground cover or
vegetation, excavation, land filling, or other land disturbing activity
affecting a surface area of 4,000 square feet or more;
      (4)   Those involving excavation or filling, or a combination of
excavation and filling, affecting 400 cubic yards or more of dirt, sand, or
other excavation or fill material;
      (5)   Those involving street, highway, road, or bridge construction,
enlargement, relocation, or reconstruction;
      (6)   Those involving the laying, repairing, replacing, or enlarging of
an underground pipe or facility for a distance of 300 feet or more; and
      (7)   The village will enter into letter agreement with utility companies
as to their responsibilities on work performed in the village.
   (B)   The following requirements shall be met on all sites described in
division (A) above.
      (1)   Water pumped from the site shall be treated by temporary
sedimentation basins, grit chambers, sand filters, upslope chambers, hydro-
cyclones, swirl concentrators, or other appropriate controls designed and used
to remove particles of 100 microns or greater for the highest dewatering
pumping rate. If the water is demonstrated to have no particles greater than
100 microns during dewatering operations, then no control is needed before
discharge, except as determined by the Zoning Administrator. Water may not be
discharged in a manner that causes erosion of the site or receiving channels.
      (2)   All waste and unused building materials, including garbage, debris,
cleaning wastes, wastewater, toxic materials, or hazardous materials shall be
properly disposed and not allowed to be carried by runoff into a receiving
channel or storm sewer system.
      (3)   Each site shall have gravel roads, access drives, and parking areas
of sufficient width and length to prevent sediment from being tracked onto
public or private roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or private road
shall be removed by street cleaning (not flushing) before the end of each work
day.
      (4)   All storm drain inlets shall be protected with a straw bale, filter
fabric, or equivalent barrier meeting accepted design criteria, standards, and
specifications.
      (5)   The following criteria apply only to land development or land
disturbing activities that result in runoff leaving the site.
         (a)   Channelized runoff from adjacent areas passing through the site
shall be diverted around disturbed areas, if practical. Otherwise the channel
shall be protected as described in division (B)(5)(c)3. below. Sheet flow
runoff from adjacent areas greater than 10,000 square feet in area shall also
be diverted around disturbed areas unless shown to have resultant runoff
velocities of less than .05 feet per second across the disturbed area for the
set of one year design storms. Diverted runoff shall be conveyed in a manner
that will not erode the conveyance and receiving channels. Soil and
conservation service guidelines for allowable velocities in different types of
channels should be followed.
         (b)   All activities on the site shall be conducted in a logical
sequence to minimize the area of bare soil exposed at any one time.
         (c)   Runoff from the entire disturbed area on the site shall be
controlled by meeting either divisions (B)(5)(c)1. and (B)(5)(c)2. or (B)(5)
(c)1. and (B)(5)(c)3. below.
            1.   All disturbed ground left inactive for seven or more days
shall be stabilized by seeding or sodding (only available prior to September
15), or by mulching or covering, or other equivalent control measure.
            2.   For sites with more than ten acres disturbed at one time, or
if a channel originates in the disturbed area, one or more sedimentation basins
shall be constructed. Each sedimentation basin shall have a surface area of at
least 1% of the area draining to the basin and at least three feet of depth and
constructed in accordance with accepted design specifications. Sediment shall
be removed to maintain a depth of three feet. The basin shall be designed to
trap sediment greater than 15 microns in size, based on the set one year design
storms having durations from 0.5 to 24 hours. The basin discharge rate shall
also be sufficiently low as not to cause erosion along the discharge channel or
receiving water.
            3.   For sites with less than ten acres disturbed at one time,
filter fences, straw bales, or equivalent control measures shall be placed
along all side slope and down slope sides of the site. If a channel or area of
concentrated runoff passes through the site, filter fences shall be placed
along the channel edges to reduce sediment reaching the channel.
         (d)   Any soil or dirt storage piles containing more than ten cubic
yards of material should be located with a down slope drainage length less than
25 feet to a roadway or drainage channel. If remaining for more than seven
days, they shall be stabilized by mulching, vegetative cover, tarps, or other
means. Erosion from piles which will be in existence for less than seven days
shall be controlled by placing straw bales or filter fence barriers around the
pile. In-street utility repair or construction, soil or dirt storage piles
located closer than 25 feet to a roadway or drainage channel, must be covered
with tarps or suitable alternative control if exposed for more than seven days
and the storm drain inlets must be protected with straw bales or other
appropriate filtering barriers.

   (A) Streets, highways, and drainageways. Whenever a tract of land to be
divided encompasses all or any part of an arterial street, public drainageway,
or other public way which has been designated in the Comprehensive Plan, area
plan component, or on the Official Map of the village, said public way shall be
made a part of the plat and dedicated or reserved by the subdivider in the
locations and dimensions indicated on said plan or component and as set forth
in §§
153.073 or by the Official Map, the excess right-of-way shall be reserved for
future acquisition by the village.
   (B)   (1)   Public sites and open spaces. In the design of the plat or
planned development, due consideration shall be given to the reservation of
suitable sites of adequate area for future parks, playgrounds, drainageways,
and other village purposes. If designated on the Comprehensive Plan, plan
component, or Official Map, such areas shall be made a part of the plat or
planned development. Accordingly, each subdivider or developer of residential
land in the village shall, at the discretion and direction of the Plan
Commission, either reserve public sites and open-space lands designated on the
village’s Comprehensive Plan or plan component or, where no public sites or
open-space lands are directly involved, pay a public site fee. The Plan
Commission shall, at the time of reviewing the preliminary plat, planned
development, or certified survey map, select one of the following options and
record such selection in the minutes of the meeting at which the preliminary
plat, planned development, or certified survey map is presented for approval.
      (2)   Reservation of site option. Whenever a proposed park, playground,
drainageway, or other land designated for village purposes on the village’s
Comprehensive Plan or plan component or Office Map is encompassed, all or in
part, within a tract of land to be subdivided or developed, the proposed public
lands shall be made a part of the plat or development and reserved at the time
of final plat approval or site plan approval for a period not to exceed three
years, unless extended by mutual agreement, for acquisition at undeveloped land
prices by the village and the subdivider or developer shall pay a public site
fee at the time of application for final plat or site plan approval at the rate
and according to the procedures set forth in division (B)(2) below. If the land
is not acquired within the three-year period or the time extended by mutual
agreement as set forth herein, the land will be released by the village from
reservation to the owner.
(Prior Code, § 18.02)
§ 153.010  IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Before final approval of the final plat, the subdivider shall enter
into an agreement with the village to install the required improvements and
shall file with the subdivider’s agreement an irrevocable letter of credit, or
other appropriate sureties meeting the approval of the Village Attorney, equal
to the estimated cost of the improvements. Improvement cost estimates shall be
made by the developer, reviewed by the Village Engineer, and approved by the
Village Board.
   (B)   The improvements may be installed after approval of a final plat or
certified survey map by the subdivider or his or her subcontractors, but not
later than one year from the date of recording of the final plat or as provided
in the subdivider’s agreement.
   (C)   The subdivider’s agreement shall specify a completion date for all
improvements. In addition:
      (1)   Plans and specifications for all improvements shall be reviewed and
approved by the Village Engineer, in writing, prior to commencement of
construction. The subdivider may submit an interim final plat with the
improvement plans; however, review and approval of a final plat shall not be
initiated until the improvement plans have been reviewed and approved and until
the subdivider’s agreement has been fully executed;
      (2)   Contracts and contract specifications for the construction of
street and utility improvements on dedicated street rights-of-way, as well as
the contractors and subcontractors providing such work, shall be subject to the
prior written approval of the Village Engineer in accordance with village
standards and specifications;

apply may file, in lieu of said contract and bond, a letter from officers

extraterritorial jurisdictional limits, the subdivider shall install survey
monuments placed in accordance with the requirements of Wis. Stats. § 236.15
and as may be required by the Village Engineer; and
      (5)   Prior to the acceptance of a final plat, the subdivider shall
furnish, when required by the village, a consent and waiver of the statutory
provisions for special assessments for the installation of sanitary sewer,
storm sewer, sewer laterals, curb and gutter, sidewalks or pedestrian ways,
street surfacing, street lighting services, and all other utilities, which
shall be in a form approved by the Village Attorney, pursuant to Wis. Stats. §
66.0703(7)(b). Such consent and waiver shall provide that the installation of
such services shall be made at the discretion of the Village Board.
(Prior Code, § 18.02)
§ 153.011  VARIANCES.
   (A)   General. Where, in the judgment of the Village Board, it would be
inappropriate to apply literally the provisions of §§
153.097 because exceptional or undue hardship would result, the Village Board
may waive or modify any requirement to the extent deemed just and proper. No
variance to the provisions of this chapter shall be granted unless the Village
Board finds that all the following facts and conditions exist and so indicates
in the minutes of its proceedings:
      (1)   Exceptional circumstances. There are exceptional, extraordinary, or
unusual circumstances or conditions where a literal enforcement of the
requirements of this chapter would result in severe hardship. Such hardships
should not apply generally to other properties or be of such a recurrent nature
as to suggest that this chapter should be changed;
      (2)   Preservation of property rights. That such variance is necessary
for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by
other properties in the same vicinity; and
      (3)   Absence of detriment. That the variance will not create substantial
detriment to adjacent property and will not materially impair or be contrary to
the purpose and spirit of this chapter or the public interest.
   (B)   Monuments. The Village Engineer may waive the placing of monuments,
required under Wis. Stats. §§ 236.15(1)(b) through 236.15(1)(d), for a
reasonable time on condition that the subdivider execute a surety bond or
irrevocable letter of credit to ensure the placing of such monuments within the
required time limits established by the village.
(Prior Code, § 18.02)
§ 153.012  LAND SUITABILITY.
   No land shall be subdivided for residential use which is determined to be
unsuitable for such use by the Village Board for reason of flooding, inadequate
drainage, adverse soil or rock formation, unfavorable topography, or any other
feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of the future
residents of the proposed subdivision or of the village. The Village Board, in
applying the provisions of this section shall, in writing, recite the
particular facts upon which it bases its conclusion that the land is not
suitable for residential use and afford the subdivider an opportunity to
present evidence regarding such unsuitability if he or she so desires.
Thereafter, the Village Board, upon the recommendation of the Plan Commission,
may affirm, modify, or withdraw its determination of unsuitability.
(Prior Code, § 18.02)
§ 153.013  SEWER SERVICE AVAILABILITY.
   No lot or parcel shall hereafter be created or divided which will not be

have a valid on-site sewerage system permit located entirely within the
respective lot or parcel created
(Prior Code, § 18.02)
§ 153.014  APPEALS.
   Any person aggrieved by an objection to a plat or a failure to approve a
plat may appeal such objection or failure to approve, as provided in Wis.

   (E)   Survey accuracy. The Village Engineer shall examine all final plats
within the village and may make, or cause to be made, by a registered land
surveyor under the supervision or direction of the Village Engineer, field
checks for the accuracy and closure of survey, the proper kind and location of
monuments, and the legibility and completeness of the drawing. In addition:
      (1)   Maximum error of closure before adjustment of the survey of the
exterior boundaries of the subdivision shall not exceed, in horizontal distance
or position, the ratio of one part in 5,000 nor, in azimuth, four seconds or
arc per interior angle. If field measurements exceed this maximum, new field
measurements shall be made until a satisfactory closure is obtained. When a
satisfactory closure of the field measurements has been obtained, the survey of
the exterior boundary shall be adjusted to form a closed geometric figure; and
      (2)   All street, block, and lot dimensions shall be computed as closed

the Village Engineer and the state’s examination prior to approving the final
plat.
   (H)   Surveying and monumenting. All final plats shall meet all the
surveying and monumenting requirements of Wis. Stats. § 236.15.
   (I)   State plane coordinate system. All plats shall be tied directly to a
section or quarter corner monumented according to the state plane coordinate
system. The exact grid bearing and distance of such tie shall be determined by
field measurements, and the material and state plane coordinates of the
monument marking the section or quarter corner to which the plat is tied shall
be indicated on the plat. The grid bearing and distance of the tie shall be
determined by a closed survey meeting the error of closure specified in
division (E) above for the survey of the exterior boundaries of the
subdivision. All distances and bearings shall be referenced to the state’s
coordinate system.
   (J)   Certificates. All final plats shall provide all the certificates
required by Wis. Stats. § 236.21, and, in addition, the surveyor shall certify

DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 153.065  STREET ARRANGEMENT.
   (A)   In any new subdivision plat or certified survey map, the street layout
shall conform to the arrangement, width, and location indicated on the Official
Map or Comprehensive Plan of the village. In areas for which such plans have
not been completed, the street layout shall recognize the functional
classification of the various types of streets and shall be developed and
located in proper relation to existing and proposed streets, to the topography,
to such natural features as streams and tree growth, to public convenience and
safety, to the proposed use of the land to be served by such streets, and to
the most advantageous development of adjoining areas.
   (B)   The subdivision shall be designed so as to provide each lot with
satisfactory access to a public street. In addition:
      (1)   Arterial streets. Arterial streets shall be arranged so as to
provide ready access to center of employment, centers of governmental activity,
community shopping areas, community recreation, and points beyond the
boundaries of the community. They shall also be properly integrated with and
related to the existing and proposed system of arterial streets and highways
and shall be, insofar as practicable, continuous and in alignment with existing
or planned streets with which they are to connect;
      (2)   Collector streets. Collector streets shall be arranged so as to
provide ready collection of traffic from residential areas and conveyance of
this traffic to the major street and highway system and shall be properly
related to the mass transportation system, to special traffic generators such
as schools, churches, shopping centers, and other concentrations of population,
and to the major streets to which they connect;
      (3)   Local streets. Local streets shall be arranged to conform to the
topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit the design of
efficient storm and sanitary sewerage systems, and to require the minimum
street area necessary to provide safe and convenient access to abutting
property;
      (4)   Proposed streets. Proposed streets shall extend to the boundary
lines of the tract being subdivided unless prevented by topography or other
physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the Village Board, such
extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of
the subdivision or for the advantageous development of the adjacent tracts;
      (5)   Arterial street and highway protection. Whenever the proposed
subdivision contains or is adjacent to an arterial street or highway, adequate
protection of residential properties, limitation of access, and separation of
through and local traffic shall be provided by reversed frontage with screen
planting or an earth berm contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear
or side property line, or by the use of frontage streets;
      (6)   Stream or lake shores. Stream or lake shores shall have a minimum
of 66 feet of public access platted to the low water mark at intervals of not
more than one-half mile as required by Wis. Stats. § 236.16(3);
      (7)   Reserve strips. Reserve strips shall not be provided on any plat to
control access to streets or alleys, except where control of such strips is
placed with the Village Board under conditions recommended by the Plan
Commission;
      (8)   Alleys. Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial areas
for off-street loading and service access of required by the Village Board, but
shall not be approved in residential districts. Deadend alleys shall not be
approved. Alleys shall not connect to a major thoroughfare; and
      (9)   Street names. Street names shall not duplicate or be similar to
existing street names elsewhere in the village and environs, and existing
street names shall be displayed with a sign.
(Prior Code, § 18.08)
§ 153.066  LIMITED ACCESS HIGHWAY AND RAILROAD RIGHT-OR-WAY TREATMENT.
   Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a limited
access highway or railroad right-of-way, the design shall provide the following
treatment.
   (A)   (1)   When lots within the proposed subdivision back upon the right-
of-way of an existing or proposed limited access highway or a railroad, a
planting strip at least 60 feet in depth shall be provided adjacent to the
highway or railroad in addition to the normal lot depth.
      (2)   This strip shall be a part of the platted lots, but shall have the
following restriction lettered on the face of the plat: “This strip is reserved
for the planting of trees and shrubs; the building of structures and placement
of longitudinal easements for utilities hereon is prohibited”.
   (B)   Commercial and industrial properties shall have provided, on each side
of the limited access highway or railroad, streets approximately parallel to
and at a suitable distance from such highway or railroad for the appropriate
use of the land between such streets and highway or railroad, but not less than
150 feet.
   (C)   (1)   Streets parallel to a limited access highway or railroad right-
of-way, when intersecting a high collector street and highway or collector
street which crosses said railroad or highway, shall be located at a minimum
distance of 250 feet from said highway or railroad right-of-way.
      (2)   Such distance, where desirable and practicable, shall be determined
with due consideration of the minimum distance required for the future
separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
   (D)   Local streets immediately adjacent and parallel to railroad rights-of-
way shall be avoided, and the location of local streets immediately adjacent to
high collector streets and highways and to railroad rights-of-way shall be
avoided in residential areas.
(Prior Code, § 18.08)
§ 153.067  STREET DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   The minimum right-of-way and roadway width of all proposed streets and
alleys shall be as specified by the Comprehensive Plan, the plan component, or
the Official Map of the village, or if no width is specified therein, the
minimum widths shall be as shown in §
153.068.
   (B)   Cross-sections for freeways, expressways, and parkways shall be based
upon detailed engineering studies.
(Prior Code, § 18.08)

permanently closed shall terminate in a circular turnaround having a minimum
right-of-way radius of 66 feet and a minimum back of curb radius of 47.5 feet
or 45 feet for rural cross-section streets.
   (C)   Temporary termination of streets at the boundary of a subdivision that
are intended to be extended at a later date and where more than four dwelling
units have driveway access to such street, or when the nearest intersection to
the boundary of the subdivision is greater than 200 feet, shall be accomplished
with a temporary cul-de-sac in accordance with the standards set forth above or
by construction of a temporary “T” turnaround having a crossbar paved width of
at least 22 feet and a length of 60 feet, with the option subject to the
approval of the Plan Commission and the Village Board.
   (D)   Unless necessitated by exceptional topography subject to the approval
of the Plan Commission, the maximum centerline grade of any street or public
way shall not exceed the following:
      (1)   Arterial streets: 6%;
      (2)   Collector streets: 8%;
      (3)   Local streets, alleys, and frontage streets: 10%;
      (4)   Pedestrian ways: 10%, unless steps of acceptable design are
provided; and
      (5)   The grade of any street shall in no case exceed 10% or be less than
0.5%.
   (E)   Street grades shall be established wherever practicable so as to avoid
excessive grading, the promiscuous removal of ground cover and tree growth, and
general leveling of topography. All changes in street grades shall be connected
by vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent in feet to 15 times the
algebraic difference in the rates of grade for all major streets, and one-half
this minimum for all other streets.
   (F)   (1)   When a continuous street centerline deflects at any one point by
more than ten degrees, a circular curve shall be introduced having a radius of
curvature on said centerline of not less than the following:
         (a)   Arterial streets and highways: 500 feet;
         (b)   Collector streets: 300 feet; and
         (c)   Local streets: 100 feet.
      (2)   A tangent at least 100 feet in length shall be provided between
reserve curves on arterial and collector streets.
   (G)   Where, on the date of enactment of this chapter, an existing dedicated
or platted half street is adjacent to the tract being subdivided, the other
half of the street shall be dedicated by the subdivider. The platting of half
streets is not permitted.
(Prior Code, § 18.08)
§ 153.069  STREET INTERSECTIONS.
   (A)   Streets shall intersect each other at as nearly right angles as
topography and other limiting factors of good design permit.
   (B)   In addition:
      (1)   The number of streets converging at one intersection shall be
reduced to a minimum, preferably not more than two;
      (2)   The number of intersections along arterial streets and highways
shall be held to a minimum. Wherever practicable, the distance between such
intersections shall not be less than 750 feet;
      (3)   Intersections on local streets shall be offset at least 250 feet
measured from the centerlines of the two streets;
      (4)   Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a
minimum radius of 20 feet or of a greater radius when required by the Plan
Commission, or shall be terminated by a straight line through the points of
tangency of an arc having a radius of 15 feet; and
      (5)   Local streets shall not necessarily continue across arterial or
collector streets, but if the centerlines of such local streets approach the
major streets from opposite sides within 300 feet of each other, measured along
the centerline of the arterial or collector street, then the location shall be
so adjusted that the adjournment across the arterial or collector street is
continuous and a jog is avoided.
(Prior Code, § 18.08)
§ 153.070  BLOCKS.
   (A)   The widths, lengths, and shapes of blocks shall be suited to the
planned use of the land, zoning requirements, need for convenient access,
control and safety of street traffic, and the limitations and opportunities of
topography.
   (B)   In addition:
      (1)   The length of blocks in residential areas shall not, as a general
rule, be less than 400 feet nor more than 1,200 feet in length unless otherwise
dictated by exceptional topography or other limiting factors of good design;
      (2)   Pedestrian ways are generally not desired and should be avoided;
however, pedestrian ways of not less than ten feet in width may be required
near the center and entirely across any block over 900 feet in length where
deemed essential by the Plan Commission to provide adequate pedestrian
circulation or access to schools, parks, shopping centers, churches, or
transportation facilities;
      (3)   The width of blocks shall be wide enough to provide for two tiers
of lots of appropriate depth except where otherwise required to separate
residential development from through traffic. Width of lots or parcels reserved
or laid out for commercial or industrial use shall be adequate to provide for
off-street service and parking required by the use contemplated and the area
zoning restrictions for such use; and
      (4)   Utility easements. See §
153.073.
(Prior Code, § 18.08)
§ 153.071  LOTS.
   (A)   The size, shape, and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the
location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use
contemplated.
   (B)   The lots should be designed to provide an aesthetically pleasing
building site and a proper architectural setting for the building contemplated.
In addition:
      (1)   Side lot lines shall be at approximately right angles to straight
street lines or radial to curved street lines on which the lots face. Lot lines
shall follow municipal boundary lines rather than cross them;
      (2)   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be prohibited
except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from
through traffic or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and
orientation;
      (3)   Subject to the provision in §
155.026(B), every lot shall front or abut for a distance of at least 60 feet;
      (4)   Area and dimensions of lots shall conform to the requirements of
Chapter 155;
      (5)   Depth of lots shall be a minimum of 100 feet, excessive depth in
relation to width shall be avoided and a proportion of two to one shall be
considered a desirable ratio under normal conditions. Depth of lots or parcels
reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial use shall be adequate to
provide for off-street service and parking required by the use contemplated;
      (6)   Width of lots shall conform to the requirements of
Chapter 155;
      (7)   Corner lots shall have an extra width of ten feet to permit
adequate building setbacks from side streets; and
      (8)   Lands lying between the meander line and the water’s edge and any
otherwise unplatted lands which lie between a proposed subdivision and the
water’s edge shall be included as part of lots, outlots, or public dedications
in any plat abutting a lake or stream.
(Prior Code, § 18.08)  (Ord. 2-02, passed 1-24-2002)
§ 153.072  BUILDING SETBACK LINES.
   Where not controlled by zoning regulations, building setback lines,
appropriate to the location and type of development contemplated, shall be
established as may be required by the Village Board.
(Prior Code, § 18.08)
§ 153.073  EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Electric and communication facilities.
      (1)   Adequate easements shall be provided and dedicated on each side of
all rear lot lines and on side lot lines, across lots or along front lot lines
where necessary, for the installation of electric and communications
facilities. Such easements shall be noted as “utility easements” on the final
plat or certified survey map. Prior to approval of the final plat or certified
survey map, the concurrence of the electric and communications companies
serving the area as to the location and width of the utility easements shall be
noted on the final plat or certified survey map.
      (2)   Where the electric and communications facilities are to be
installed underground, the utility easements shall be graded to within six
inches of final grade by the subdivider, prior to the installation of such
facilities, and earth fill, piles or mounds of dirt, or construction materials
shall not be stored on such easement areas.
      (3)   Where the electric and/or communications facilities are to be
installed underground, a note shall be placed on the final plat or certified
survey map sating that the final grade established by the subdivider on the
utility easements shall not be altered by more than six inches by the
subdivider or his or her agent, or by subsequent owners of the lots on which
such utility easements are located, except with written consent of the utility
or utilities involved.
   (B)   Gas facilities. Distribution gas mains and appurtenances, except
service laterals, shall be installed in the street right-of-way, normally in
the area between sidewalk and curb. However, the Plan Commission may, at the
request of the utility, or where deemed necessary or desirable, require
easements of adequate width for the intended purpose along lot lines or across
lots for such installations, and such easements shall be noted on the final
plat or certified survey map as “utility easements”.
   (C)   Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse,
drainageway channel, or stream, an adequate drainageway or easement shall be
required subject to the approval of the Zoning Administrator; and parallel
streets or parkways may be required in connection therewith. Where necessary,
stormwater drainage shall be maintained by landscaped open channels of adequate
size and grade to hydraulically accommodate maximum potential volumes of flow.
These design details are subject to review and approval by the Village
Engineer.
(Prior Code, § 18.08)
REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
§ 153.085  SURVEY MONUMENTS.
   The subdivider shall install survey monuments placed in accordance with the
requirements of Wis. Stats. § 236.15, and as may be required by the Village
Engineer.
(Prior Code, § 18.09)
§ 153.086  GRADING.
   After installation of temporary block corner monuments by the subdivider and
establishment of street grades by the Village Engineer, the subdivider shall
grade the full width of the right-of-way of all streets proposed to be
dedicated in accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the
Village Engineer. The subdivider shall grade the roadbeds in the streets
rights-of-way to subgrade together with side slopes beyond the street right-of-
way when required. Cut and filled lands shall be graded to a maximum slope of

(Prior Code, § 18.09)
§ 153.093  STORMWATER MANAGEMENT; REQUIRED FACILITIES.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.
      (1)   The purpose of this section is to designate stormwater requirements
and criteria for land disturbance activities. It is intended to prevent and
control damage such as sedimentation, flooding, water pollution, and
degradation of aquatic habitat caused by soil erosion and uncontrolled
stormwater runoff. These stormwater requirements are intended to promote the
health, safety, welfare, and natural resources of the village.
      (2)   The village has completed a comprehensive regional stormwater
management plan that includes current village boundaries as well as tributary,
extraterritorial areas. It is the intent of the village that this plan be
followed as land development activities occur. However, in situations where the
plan is not applicable or unique circumstances exist, as determined by the
Village Board, stormwater management requirements contained in this section
will govern.
   (B)   Applicability. This section shall apply to all land development in the
village and lands subject to extraterritorial land division review.
   (C)   Design criteria and standards. Any land disturbance activity subject
to the provisions of this chapter or
Chapter 152 shall comply with the criteria and standards set forth in the
village’s Stormwater Management Plan and the following standards.
      (1)   Storm sewers.
         (a)   Storm sewers shall be installed where it has been determined by
the Village Engineer that grassed swales are not appropriate because of
physical incompatibilities or aesthetic reasons.
         (b)   Storm sewers shall be designed to accommodate the ten-year
recurrence interval storm, except arterial streets, where they shall be
designed to accommodate the 50-year recurrence interval storm.
         (c)   Storm sewer and ancillary facilities shall be constructed in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Specifications for Sewer and
Water Construction in Wisconsin.
      (2)   100-year flood protection.
         (a)   The lowest building opening shall be set at least two feet above
the 100-year high water level of ponds and floodplain elevations.
         (b)   Overflow routes shall be established to provide relief during
storm events that exceed design conditions.
         (c)   Open channels shall be designed to convey the flows from the
100-year recurrence storm event.
      (3)   Pond water quantity. Where the Village Engineer determines that
water quantity concerns govern the proposed land disturbance, on-site
management techniques shall be used to meet the following minimum performance
standards:
         (a)   Reduce the peak 100-year developed flow of the entire
development down to the two-year presettlement flow. This requirement may be
reduced or increased if the Village Board, upon the recommendation of the
Village Engineer, determines that downstream conditions warrant; and
         (b)   Velocities shall be non-erosive to discharge locations, outfall
channels, and receiving streams.
      (4)   Pond water quality.
         (a)   Where the Village Engineer determines that water quality
concerns govern the proposed land disturbance, on-site management techniques
shall be used to meet the following minimum performance standards:
            1.   Remove 80% of the total suspended solids. To achieve this
level of control, stormwater practices shall be designed to accommodate, at a
minimum, the runoff volume resulting from a one and one-half inch, four-hour
rainfall; and
            2.   Stormwater discharge shall be pretreated prior to release to
wetlands at rates that will not be disturbing to vegetative habitat.
Significant degradation of wetland functional values due to stormwater
pollutants shall be avoided.
         (b)   Complete water quality calculations shall be submitted.
      (5)   Additional pond requirements. Ponds and infiltration devices shall
not be located closer to water supply wells than indicated below without the
approval of the Village Board:
         (a)   One hundred feet from a private water supply well; or
         (b)   A flat access area for maintenance and clean-out shall be
provided.
   (D)   Stormwater management report. A stormwater management report shall be
submitted to the Village Engineer for all land disturbing activities. Approval
of the stormwater management plan by the Village Engineer shall be obtained
prior to any land disturbance activity. This plan shall include the following
items:
      (1)   Existing two-foot contour site topography (U.S.G.S. datum) and
features such as wetlands, floodplains, woodlands, and the like. Enough of the
contiguous property shall be included to show sub-basins and watercourses that
may affect the proposed development;
      (2)   Proposed two-foot contour site topography (U.S.G.S. datum),
including proposed improvements that include stormwater conveyance systems,
drainage easements, stormwater management facilities, outlet details, and other
pertinent features;
      (3)   Detailed planting plan indicating planting materials above and
below the normal water level;
      (4)   Details, cross-sections, and profiles;
      (5)   Hydraulic/hydrologic calculations of the two-year, ten-year, and
100-year recurrence storm and adequate study of downstream capacity conditions.
This work shall include assumptions, backup data, and maps;
      (6)   Copies of review letters and permits from state and federal
agencies; and
      (7)   Additional items deemed necessary by the Village Engineer to ensure
compliance with this section.
   (E)   Required stormwater facilities benefitting other lands. The property
owner shall be required to construct and pay the cost of all required on-site
stormwater facilities. However, in the event that on- or off-site facilities
that also benefit other land are required, the village may construct such
facilities and levy a special assessment upon the benefitting properties in
proportion to the benefit derived.
   (F)   Dedication of stormwater facilities. The property owners shall
dedicate all easements to stormwater facilities to the village in accordance
with §
153.009, including access to ponds from a public street.
   (G)   Construction certification. The developer shall provide the Village
Engineer with certification management facilities. This certification shall
consist of two surveys. The first survey is required when the village
conditionally accepts the improvements, at which time the building permits may
be issued. The second survey shall be submitted to the Village Engineer prior
to final acceptance of the stormwater facilities. These surveys shall establish
the as-built conditions of the stormwater management facilities, including
storage and wet volume presented in the pond.
   (H)   Maintenance of stormwater facilities. The village shall maintain all
stormwater facilities located in public rights-of-way and ponds serving off-
site properties. The property owner shall maintain all on-site stormwater
facilities, including on-site ponds. In the event the property owner fails to
properly maintain such facilities, the village shall provide necessary
maintenance, the cost of which shall be charged to the property owner and, if
not paid, shall be extended on the current or next tax roll pursuant to Wis.
Stats. § 66.0627.
   (I)   Enforcement. The Village Engineer is authorized to administer and
enforce compliance with this chapter. The Engineer shall have the following
powers and duties:
      (1)   Advise the applicant of the requirements of this chapter and assist
them with administrative procedures;
      (2)   Review applications, issue permits, and make all determinations
stated in this section;
      (3)   Conduct inspections of the work and investigate complaints related
to this section; and
      (4)   Carry out long term duties relating to ensuring the long-term
maintenance of the stormwater management facilities such as site inspections
and make recommendations for needed repairs or maintenance.
   (J)   Appeals. Any person aggrieved by any order or determination made by
the Village Engineer may appeal such order or determination by the Village
Board for final determination at the next Village Board meeting.

1998)
§ 153.094  OTHER UTILITIES.
   The subdivider shall have arranged with the affected utility companies for
gas, electric, telephone, or CATV facilities to be installed in such a manner
as to make adequate service available to each lot in the subdivision when
needed. Where underground utility cables are to be installed in a new
residential subdivision, the utility may install conduit for street crossings
before the street is surfaced to facilitate later installation of the necessary
cable to serve such subdivision or portions thereof. The installation of
conduit shall be in lieu of direct installation of the underground cable. Plans
indicating the proposed location of all gas, electrical power, and telephone
distribution and transmission lines required to service the plat shall be
approved by the Village Engineer.
(Prior Code, § 18.09)
§ 153.095  IMPROVEMENTS ON BOUNDARIES OF SUBDIVISIONS.
   Any public improvements occurring on the boundaries of the subdivision shall
use normal assessing values for establishing payments.
(Prior Code, § 18.09)
§ 153.096  STREET LAMPS.
   The subdivider shall install street lamps along all streets proposed to be
dedicated of a design compatible with the neighborhood and type of development
proposed. Such lamps shall be placed on each street intersection and at such
interior block spacing to provide the required footcandles of lighting
intensity as may be required by the Village Engineer.
(Prior Code, § 18.09)
§ 153.097  STREET SIGNS.
   Street signs, as required by the Village Board, shall be obtained and placed
by the village, the cost of which shall be paid by the subdivider.
(Prior Code, § 18.09)
§ 153.098  CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   Commencement. No construction or installation of improvements shall
commence in a proposed subdivision until the preliminary plat or certified
survey map has been approved and the Village Engineer has given written
authorization.
   (B)   Building permits. No building permit shall be issued for erection of a
structure on any lot not of record until all the requirements of this chapter
have been met, unless otherwise provided for in the subdivider’s agreement. In
exceptional circumstances, the Village Board may authorize the issuance of a
building permit prior to the completion of all improvements; however, no
occupancy permit shall be issued prior to the completion of all improvements;
except for the final course of asphalt streets.
   (C)   Plans. The following plans and accompanying construction
specifications may be required by the Village Engineer before authorization of
construction or installation of improvements:
      (1)   Street plans and profiles showing existing and proposed grades,
elevations, and cross-sections of required improvements. A separate plan
designating culvert sizes shall be provided for all streets with rural cross-

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. This chapter is adopted pursuant to the
authorization in Wis. Stats. §§ 61.35 and 62.23 for villages and cities; Wis.
Stats. §§ 59.69, 59.692, and 59.694 for counties; and the requirements in Wis.
Stats. § 87.30.
   (B)   Finding of fact. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains
and rivers of this municipality would impair the public health, safety,
convenience, general welfare, and tax base.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. This chapter is intended to regulate floodplain
development to:
      (1)   Protect life, health, and property;
      (2)   Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects;
      (3)   Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the
taxpayers;
      (4)   Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain;
      (6)   Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the
floodplain;
      (7)   Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers;
      (8)   Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage
and result in conflicts between property owners; and
      (9)   Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable
alternative to locate the activity, use, or structure outside of the
floodplain.
   (D)   Title. This chapter shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Chapter
for the Village of Newburg, Wisconsin.
   (E)   General provisions.
      (1)   Areas to be regulated. This chapter regulates all areas that would
be covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are
derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and are
shown as AE, A1-30, and AH Zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are
displayed as A and AO Zones. Regional Flood Elevations (RFE) may be derived
from other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most
restrictive information shall apply.
      (2)   Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain
districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO, or A1-30 on the maps based on the
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed below. Any change to the base flood
elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway
in the FIS or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and
approved by the DNR and FEMA through the letter of map change process (see §
154.07) before it is effective. No changes to RFEs on non-FEMA maps shall be
effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in
the Village Administrator/Clerk’s office. If more than one map or revision is
referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.
         (a)   Official maps based on the FIS. Official maps based on the FIS
as amended from time to time.
         (b)   Official maps based on other studies. Any maps referenced in
this section must be approved by the DNR and be more restrictive than those
based on the FIS at the site of the proposed development. Including letter of
map revision “Newburg Dam Removal” (case number 15-05-0254P, dated 7-1-2015).
      (3)   Establishment of floodplain zoning districts. The regional
floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows:
         (a)   The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream
and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry
the regional floodwaters and are contained within AE Zones as shown on the
FIRM;
         (b)   The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion between the
regional flood limits and the floodway and displayed as AE Zones on the FIRM;
and
         (c)   The General Floodplain District (GFP) are those areas that may
be covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have a BFE or
floodway boundary determined, including A, AH, and AO Zones on the FIRM.
      (4)   Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on
the Official Floodplain Zoning Map and actual field conditions shall be
resolved using the criteria in divisions (E)(4)(a) or (E)(4)(b) below. If a
significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to §
154.07.
         (a)   If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile
elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood
elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
         (b)   Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of
the boundary shall be determined by the map scale.
      (5)   Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of
this chapter shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless
it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the
fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended
pursuant to §
154.07.
      (6)   Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by
this chapter shall be in compliance with the terms of this chapter and other
applicable local, state, and federal regulations.
      (7)   Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically
exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to
comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are
required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13) applies. The construction,
reconstruction, maintenance, and repair of state highways and bridges by the
state’s Department of Transportation is exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.2022
applies.
      (8)   Abrogation and greater restrictions.
         (a)   This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal
zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. §§ 59.69, 59.692, or 59.694 for
counties; Wis. Stats. § 62.23 for cities; Wis. Stats. § 61.35 for villages; or
Wis. Stats. § 87.30 which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance
shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater
restrictions, but not otherwise.
         (b)   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing deed restrictions, covenants, or easements. If this chapter imposes
greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
      (9)   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this chapter are the minimum requirements liberally construed in
favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on, or repeal of, any
other powers granted by state statutes. If a provision of this chapter,
required by Wis. Adm. Code Ch. NR 116, is unclear, the provision shall be
interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of
this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this
chapter.
      (10)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection
standards in this chapter are based on engineering experience and research.
Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by human-made or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain
areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood
damages. This chapter does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of
action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damage that may result from reliance on this chapter.
      (11)   Annexed areas for cities and villages. The Washington and Ozaukee
Counties floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall
remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed
areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the
requirements of Wis. Adm. Code Ch. NR 116 and 44 C.F.R. parts 59 through 72,
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on
the municipality’s official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are
incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are
on file in the office of the Municipal Zoning Administrator. All plats or maps
of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the floodway
location.
(Ord. 07-2015, passed 9-3-2015)
§ 154.02  GENERAL STANDARDS.
   (A)   Permit applications.
      (1)   The community shall review all permit applications to determine
whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall be designed and anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads; be constructed with flood-resistant materials; be
constructed to minimize flood damages and to ensure that utility and mechanical
equipment is designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the equipment during conditions of flooding.
      (2)   Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above
standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall
include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that
meets the subdivision definition of this chapter and all other requirements in
§
154.03. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazards, and all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems, are located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damages.
   (B)   Hydraulic and hydrologic analyses.
      (1)   No floodplain development shall:
         (a)   Obstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the
conveyance of floodwaters by itself or with other development, causing any
increase in the regional flood height; or
         (b)   Cause any increase in the regional flood height due to
floodplain storage area lost.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall deny permits if it is determined the
proposed development will obstruct flow or cause any increase in the regional
flood height, based on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map, unless
the provisions of §
154.07 are met.
   (C)   Watercourse alterations.
      (1)   No land use permit to alter or relocate a watercourse in a mapped
floodplain shall be issued until the local official has notified, in writing,
all adjacent municipalities, the Department, and FEMA regional offices, and
required the applicant to secure all necessary state and federal permits. The
standards of §
154.07(B) must be met and the flood carrying capacity of any altered or
relocated watercourse shall be maintained.
      (2)   As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the
date of the watercourse alteration or relocation, and pursuant to §
154.07, the community shall apply for a letter of map revision (LOMR) from
FEMA. Any such alterations must be reviewed and approved by FEMA and the DNR
through the LOMC process.
   (D)   State permit. Development which requires a permit from the Department,
under Wis. Stats. Chapters 30 and 31, such as docks, piers, wharves, bridges,
culverts, dams, and navigational aids, may be allowed if the necessary permits
are obtained and amendments to the floodplain zoning ordinance are made
according to §
154.07.
   (E)   Public or private campgrounds. Public or private campgrounds shall
have a low flood damage potential and shall meet the following provisions:
      (1)   The campground is approved by the Department of Health Services;
      (2)   A land use permit for the campground is issued by the Zoning
Administrator;
      (3)   The character of the river system and the campground elevation are
such that a 72-hour warning of an impending flood can be given to all
campground occupants;
      (4)   There is an adequate flood warning procedure for the campground
that offers the minimum notice required under this section to all persons in
the campground. This procedure shall include a written agreement between the
campground owner, the municipal emergency government coordinator, and the chief
law enforcement official which specifies the flood elevation at which
evacuation shall occur, personnel responsible for monitoring flood elevations,
types of warning systems to be used and the procedures for notifying at-risk
parties, and the methods and personnel responsible for conducting the
evacuation;

filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual

addition, or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals
or exceeds 50% of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the
improvement or repair is started. If the structure has sustained substantial
damage, any repairs are considered SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT regardless of the
work performed. The term does not, however, include either any project for the
improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary, or
safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the
minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or any alteration of a
historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as a historic structure.
      UNNECESSARY HARDSHIP.  Where special conditions affecting a particular

models must be supported by certified topographic information, bridge plans,
construction plans, and survey notes; and
               f.   Changes to the hydraulic models shall be limited to the
stream reach for which the revision is being requested. Cross-sections upstream
and downstream of the revised reach shall be identical to those in the
effective model and result in water surface elevations and topwidths computed
by the revised models matching those in the effective models upstream and
downstream of the revised reach as required. The effective model shall not be
truncated.
            3.   Mapping. Maps and associated engineering data shall be
submitted to the Department for review which meet the following conditions:
               a.   Consistency between the revised hydraulic models, the
revised floodplain and floodway delineations, the revised flood profiles,
topographic work map, annotated FIRMs and/or Flood Boundary Floodway Maps
(FBFMs), construction plans, bridge plans;
               b.   Certified topographic map of suitable scale, contour
interval, and a planimetric map showing the applicable items. If a digital
version of the map is available, it may be submitted in order that the FIRM may
be more easily revised;
               c.   Annotated FIRM panel showing the revised 1% and 0.2% annual
chance floodplains and floodway boundaries;
               d.   If an annotated FIRM and/or FBFM and digital mapping data
(GIS or CADD) are used, then all supporting documentation or metadata must be
included with the data submission along with the universal transverse mercator
(UTM) projection and state plane coordinate system in accordance with FEMA
mapping specifications;
               e.   The revised floodplain boundaries shall tie into the
effective floodplain boundaries;
               f.   All cross-sections from the effective model shall be
labeled in accordance with the effective map and a cross-section lookup table
shall be included to relate to the model input numbering scheme;
               g.   Both the current and proposed floodways shall be shown on
the map; and
               h.   The stream centerline or profile baseline used to measure
stream distances in the model shall be visible on the map.

shall expire no more than 180 days after issuance. The permit may be extended
for a maximum of 180 days for good and sufficient cause.
   (C)   Certificate of compliance. No land shall be occupied or used, and no
building which is hereafter constructed, altered, added to, modified, repaired,
rebuilt, or replaced shall be occupied until a certificate of compliance is
issued by the Zoning Administrator, except where no permit is required, subject
to the following provisions:
      (1)   The certificate of compliance shall show that the building or
premises, or part thereof, and the proposed use conform to the provisions of
this chapter;

§ 155.06  NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS.
   (A)   Existing nonconforming uses.
      (1)   Continuation. The lawful nonconforming use of a structure, land or
water existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of this chapter may be
continued although the use does not conform with the provisions of this
chapter, provided, however:
         (a)    Only that portion of the land or water in actual use may be so
continued and the structure may not be extended, enlarged, reconstructed,
substituted, moved or structurally altered, except when required to do so by
law or order or so as to comply with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The total lifetime structural repairs or alterations shall not
exceed 50% of the assessed value of the structure at the time of its becoming a
nonconforming use unless it is permanently changed to conform to the use
provisions of this chapter.
         (c)   Substitution of new equipment may be permitted by the Village
Board if such equipment will reduce the incompatibility of the nonconforming
use with the neighboring uses.
      (2)   Abolishment or replacement of existing nonconforming use.  If such
nonconforming use is discontinued or terminated for a period of 12 months, any
future use of the structure, land or water shall conform to the provisions of
this chapter. When a nonconforming use or structure is damaged by fire,
explosion, flood, the public enemy or other calamity to the extent of more than
50% of its current equalized value, it shall not be restored except so as to
comply with the use provisions of this chapter. From the date of adoption of
this chapter, a current file of all nonconforming uses shall be maintained by
the Village Clerk, listing the following:
         (a)   Owner's name and address.
         (b)   Use of the structure, land or water.
         (c)   Assessed value at the time of its becoming a non-conforming use.
   (B)   Existing nonconforming structures.  Any lawful nonconforming structure
existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of this chapter may be
continued, although its size or location does not conform with the lot width,
lot area, yard, height, parking and loading, and access provisions of this
chapter. However, it shall not be extended, enlarged, reconstructed, moved or
structurally altered except when required to do so by law or order or so as to
comply with the provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   Changes and substitutions. Once a nonconforming use or structure has
been changed to conform, it shall not revert back to a nonconforming use or
structure. Once the Village Board has permitted the substitution of a more
restrictive nonconforming use for an existing nonconforming use, the
substituted use shall lose its status as a legal nonconforming use and become
subject to all the conditions required by the Village Board.
   (D)   Existing substandard lots.
      (1)   A lot which does not contain sufficient area to conform to the
dimensional requirements of this chapter but which is at least 50 feet wide and
7,200 square feet in area may be used as a single-family building site,
provided that the use is permitted in the zoning district, the lot is of record
in the County Register of Deeds Office prior to the effective date of this
chapter, and the lot is in separate ownership from abutting lands. A zoning
permit for the improvement of a lot with lesser dimensions and requisites than
those stated above shall be issued only after a variance by the Zoning Board of
Appeals has been granted.
      (2)   If two or more vacant substandard lots with continuous frontage
have the same ownership as of the effective date of this chapter, the lots
involved shall be considered to be an individual parcel for the purpose of this
chapter.
      (3)   Substandard lots shall be required to meet the setbacks and other
yard requirements of this chapter.

§ 155.18  PUD PLANNED RESIDENTIAL, UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Intent.  Planned Residential Unit Development District (PUD)
regulations are intended to permit greater flexibility and, consequently, more
creative and imaginative design for residential and business development of a
site than is possible under conventional zoning regulations. It is further
intended to promote more economical and efficient use of the land while
providing a harmonious variety of housing choices, a higher level of amenities,
and preservation of the natural qualities of open spaces. The planned
development procedure requires a high degree of cooperation between the
developer and the village. The procedure described herein is designed to give
the developer general plan approval before completing all detailed design work
while providing the village with assurances that the project will retain the
character envisioned at the time of approval.
   (B)   General provisions.  The Plan Commission may recommend and the Village
Board may, upon the request of the owners, establish planned development
overlay districts which will, over a period of time, tend to promote the
maximum benefit from coordinated area site planning by permitting the
diversified location of structures and mixed dwelling and business types and
compatible uses.
      (1)   Permitted uses. Permitted and accessory uses in the PUD shall be
the same as those permitted in the underlying existing zoning district in which
the PUD is located. If a developer desires uses different than those permitted
by the existing zoning, the developer must simultaneously petition for rezoning
of the underlying existing zoning to a zoning district which allows the desired
uses.
      (2)   Mixed uses. A mix of different residential and business uses within
a Planned Unit Development District may be permitted if the Plan Commission and
the Village Board determine that the mix of uses is compatible and necessary to
achieve the objectives of the PUD.
      (3)   Number of buildings on a lot. The Planned Unit Development may
allow more than one residential or business building on a lot.
      (4)   Density. The Planned Unit Development District may permit the
transfer of density from one portion of the subject site to another and will
permit the clustering of buildings in one or more locations within the total
site. However, the density of use shall not exceed the density permitted in the
underlying existing zoning district or districts. In the event a portion of the
development is zoned floodplain, up to 10% of total area for determining
density may be flood fringe. No wetland areas may be used for density purposes.
      (5)   Minimum area for a Planned Unit Development District.  Planned Unit
Development Districts are intended to provide flexibility to encourage more
creative design for all sizes of site that would be allowed under conventional
zoning. To achieve this goal, the minimum site size shall be determined by the
Plan Commission on a case-by-case basis.
      (6)   Setbacks.  Front, side, and rear setbacks abutting the perimeter of
the PUD shall comply with the underlying zoning.
      (7)   Building requirements.  The building regulations of the underlying
zoning shall be applicable for all developers.
      (8)   Temporary uses.  Real estate field offices or shelters for
materials and equipment being used in the construction of a permanent
structure.
   (C)   Application procedure and requirement information.
      (1)   Preliminary consultation. An applicant may meet with the Plan
Commission and appropriate village staff members for a preliminary consultation
prior to formally submitting a rezoning petition for planned development
zoning. The purpose of this preliminary consultation is to discuss the proposed
request and review the local regulations and policies applicable to the project
and discuss the land use implications of the proposal.
      (2)   Rezoning petition and general development plan. The applicant shall
submit a zoning petition in accordance with the application procedure described
in §
155.39. In addition to the required information noted in §
155.39, a general development plan shall be submitted to the Plan Commission
and the Village Board for review 30 business days prior to any rezoning
hearing. The general development plan shall show the locations of buildings,
common open space, parking and drive areas, recreation facilities, principal
landscaping features and other major components of the proposed project.
      (3)   Other information. In addition, other documents or related
information or plans showing the architectural designs of buildings may be
required by the Plan Commission and the Village Board. This information shall
also be submitted to the Plan Commission and the Village Board for review at
least 30 business days prior to any rezoning hearing. Other related information
may include, but is not limited to, maintenance standards, plans of operation
and economic impact and market feasibility.
   (D)   Public inspection.  The general development plan and related
information shall be available for public inspection prior to any rezoning
hearing on the proposed project.
   (E)   Conditions and restrictions.
      (1)   The Plan Commission may recommend and the Village Board may adopt,
by resolution, conditions and restrictions for planned developments that
specify permitted uses, set bulk regulations and density standards for lot
coverage and dwelling unit size and distribution and yard setbacks.
      (2)   Conditions and restrictions adopted to govern any planned
development may include nonstandard or non-uniform requirements, regulations
and provisions recommended by Plan Commission and approved by the Village
Board. Such nonstandard requirements, regulations and provisions shall be
designed to insure proper development and appropriate operation and maintenance
of specific developments on specific sites.
      (3)   Developers shall agree, by a developer's agreement, with the
village to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including any
conditions and restrictions adopted to regulate a specific planned development.
   (F)   Detailed plans and information.   After Planned Unit Development
District zoning has been granted and the general development plan, together
with conditions imposed, as been approved, detailed site plans and information
covering that portion of the total project which is intended for construction
shall be submitted to the Plan Commission for approval prior to the issuance of
building permits. The detailed plans and information shall conform
substantially to the general development plan to the resolution of conditions
and restrictions which were approved at the time of rezoning.
   (G)   Architectural review.  Building plans shall also be subject to
architectural review by the Plan Commission for their review and approval prior
to the issuance of a building permit. See §
155.31.
   (H)   Commencement of project.
      (1)   After the Plan Commission has approved the detailed site plans,
construction of private and public construction may commence in accordance with
§
153.098.
      (2)   No building permit for residences shall be issued until all
applicable fees and assessments required in division (K) below and §
153.016 have been paid and either all public and private construction has been
completed and approved for a developer's agreement, including a letter of
credit, has been approved by the Village Board. For staged development such
developers' agreements shall provide for the construction of improvements and
the use of common areas outside of the subject stage.
      (3)   After the Plan Commission has approved the plans, the project shall
be commenced within one year unless the time is extended in writing by the
Commission. In the event the project is not so timely commenced, the approval
of the Commission shall be deemed to be automatically revoked.
   (I)   Maintenance of project.
      (1)   Should the owner of a planned development, or the condominium
owners association in the event a condominium is created, fail to properly
operate or maintain the premises as provided in the plan or to the extent that
a nuisance is caused to occupants or neighbors, the Plan Commission may refuse
to approve subsequent stages of development until such time as they determine
that the situation and/or the method of operation has been corrected.
      (2)   Should the owner of a planned development or condominium owners or
homeowners or business association fail to adequately perform maintenance
functions such as snow and ice removal, weed cutting or trash disposal, the
village shall have the right to perform such functions or to contract for their
accomplishment at the property owner's expense.
   (J)   Changes or revisions.
      (1)   All proposed changes, revisions and additions to any aspect of an
approved planned development project shall be submitted to the Plan Commission
for its review. The Plan Commission shall determine if the change, revision or
addition is minor or if it materially affects the intended design of the
project and the impact of the project on neighboring uses.
      (2)   If the change is determined to be minor, the Plan Commission shall
review the request and pass its findings to the Village Board, which may
approve the change without a public hearing.  The Plan Commission's decision on
minor changes shall be rendered at a meeting subsequent to the meeting at which
the requested change was initially presented to the Plan Commission.
      (3)   If the requested change is determined by the Plan Commission to be
substantial because of its effect on the intended design of the project or on
neighboring uses, a public hearing shall be held by the Plan Commission to
review and pass its findings to the Village Board for final approval.
   (K)   Application of the Subdivision and Platting Code.  To the extent
applicable, any planned development shall be subject to the procedures and
regulations of
Chapter 153 governing the division and platting of land. However, the design
standards and required improvements established in
Chapter 153 may be modified or waived upon recommendation by the Plan
Commission and approved by the Village Board where strict compliance would
result in not achieving the design flexibility necessary to achieve the
objectives of the planned development.
   (L)   Fees. The developer shall pay to the Village all fees and all
professional expenditures incurred by the village at the time specified for
both the General PUD plan review and the Detailed PUD plan review as provided
in §
36.04.  The professional fees the developer shall reimburse the village for
include all engineering, planning, and legal fees incurred by the village.  The
village shall bill the developer monthly and payment shall be made in ten days
from billing.

(Ord. 03-2016, passed 7-14-2016)
§ 155.26  WASTEWATER TREATMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose.  The Wastewater Treatment Overlay District is created to meet
the requirements of Wis. Adm. Code NR 110.15(3)(d) which prescribes standards
for the separation distances of sewage treatment facilities from residential
properties and commercial establishments. Specifically, that section requires a
500 foot separation between mechanical treatment facilities, effluent holding
and polishing ponds and residential properties and commercial establishments.
The 500 foot separation requirement was designated based upon both health and
aesthetic concerns in the village. These concerns include any potential odor,
noise or nuisances caused by the sewage treatment facility. The boundaries of
the wastewater treatment overlay district shall lie at all points 500 feet from
the mechanical treatment facilities, effluent holding and polishing ponds.
   (B)   Definition.  COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENTS, as that term is used in this
section, shall be defined as those establishments providing on-site retail and
customer services and a regular flow of on-site consumer traffic.
   (C)   Building permit required.  No building in the district shall be
demolished, constructed or altered until a building permit is issued by the
Building Inspector.
   (D)   Review of building plans.  Within the Wastewater Treatment Overlay
District, all plans for new construction, additions, enlargement or exterior
remodeling shall be reviewed and approved by the Plan Commission prior to the
issuance of a building permit.
   (E)   Application requirement.   Any application for a building permit
within the boundaries of the Wastewater Treatment Overlay District shall be
submitted to the Building Inspector who shall transmit same to the Plan
Commission for review and approval. In addition to the information required by
the Building Code, the applicant shall include any additional information as
may be required by the Building Inspector for the Plan Commission pursuant to
the plan review guidelines set forth below.
   (F)   Plan review guidelines.  In furtherance of the purposes of the
creation of the Wastewater Treatment Overlay District, no new construction,
additions, enlargement, exterior remodeling or replacement of residential or
commercial establishments shall be permitted within the overlay district unless
there is a finding by the Plan Commission of mitigating factors which reflect
the health and aesthetic concerns referred to in division (A) above. Those
mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   The existence of a berm or natural land mass that effectively
separates the residential property or commercial establishment from the sewage
treatment facilities and creates a natural barrier to protect the residential
property or commercial establishment from the health and aesthetic concerns
outlined in this section.
      (2)   The existence of a vegetation screen that effectively separates the
residential property or commercial establishment from the sewage treatment
facility and creates a natural barrier to protect the residential property or
commercial establishment from the health and aesthetic concerns outlined in
this section.
   (G)   Plan review procedure.  The Plan Commission Chairperson shall schedule
a meeting of the Commission to consider the application. The Commission shall
take final action to approve, deny or conditional approve the application
within 45 days of the date of Plan Commission Preliminary Review. Conditions of
approval may include landscaping deemed necessary to fulfill the purpose and
intent of this division.
   (H)   Informal meeting recommended.  Applicants are encouraged to submit
conceptual plans or meet with the Plan Commission for preliminary review and
discussion prior to formal submittal of detailed plans.
   (I)   Issuance of building permit.  A building permit shall be issued to the
applicant, stating the official action of the Plan Commission and shall be
referred to the Zoning Administrator for enforcement of this section. Approved
building permits shall expire in 12 months unless substantial work has been

         (g)   Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or
alternative technology.  No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant
demonstrates that no existing tower, structure or alternative technology that
does not require the use of towers or structures can accommodate the
applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to determine that no existing
tower, structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's
proposed antenna may consist of any of the following:
            1.   No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographic area which meet the applicant's engineering requirements.
            2.   Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to
meet the applicant's engineering requirements.
            3.   Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient
structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related
equipment.
            4.   The proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference
with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the
existing towers or structures would cause interference with the proposed
antenna.
            5.   The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the
owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing
tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower
development are presumed to be unreasonable.
            6.   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting
factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
            7.   The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that
does not require the use of towers or structures such as a cable microcell
network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to a
wireline system is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new
tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology
unsuitable.
         (h)   Aesthetics.
            1.   Towers shall maintain either a galvanized steel finish or,
subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a light gray so as
to reduce visual obtrusiveness and blend into the natural setting and built
environment.
            2.   At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related
structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures,
screening and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural
setting and built environment.
            3.   If an antenna is installed on a structure other that a tower,
the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment shall be of a
neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of
the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unobtrusive as possible.
         (i)   Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially illuminated unless
required by the FAA or any other applicable authority. If lighting is required,
the lighting alternatives and design chosen shall cause the least disturbance
to the surrounding views.
         (j)   Fencing. A tower shall be enclosed by security fencing not less
than eight feet in height and secured so that it is not accessible by the
general public. Fence design, materials and colors shall reflect the character
of the surrounding area.
         (k)   Landscaping. A buffer of plant materials to effectively screen
the tower compound from public view and from adjacent properties shall be
provided. The minimum buffer shall consist of a landscape strip of at least
five feet in width outside the perimeter of the tower compound. Existing mature
tree growth and natural landforms shall be preserved to the maximum extent
possible. In some cases, such as towers placed on large, wooded lots, natural
growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer.
         (l)   Accessory equipment and buildings. The equipment cabinet or
structure used in association with an antenna shall be suited in accordance
with the development standards of the underlying zoning district. Equipment
cabinets or structures shall be screened from view by an evergreen hedge or
other suitable landscape treatments, except where the use of non-vegetative
screening would better reflect and complement the architectural character of
the surrounding neighborhood.
         (m)   Signs. No signage or advertising is permitted to be placed on a
wireless communication tower.
      (3)   Permitted uses. The installation of a tower or antenna as follows:
         (a)   Antennas or existing towers. The attachment of a new antenna on
an existing tower may be permitted to minimize adverse visual impacts
associated with the proliferation and clustering of towers provided that:
            1.   The height of the existing tower is not increased.
            2.   No building addition is required.
         (b)   Cable microcell network. The installation of a cable microcell
network may be permitted through the use of multiple low-powered transmitters/
receivers attached to existing wireline systems such as conventional cable or
telephone wires or similar technology that does not require the use of towers.
      (4)   Conditional uses. The installation of towers and antennas,
including the placement of accessory equipment or buildings, may be permitted
by conditional use permit in all M-2 Manufacturing Districts. In addition to
the standards identified in this section, any request for a conditional use
permit shall also comply with the standards identified by §
155.28.
      (5)   Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. An antenna or tower that
is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered
abandoned and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove the same within
90 days of receipt of notice from the village notifying the owner of such
abandonment. Failure to remove the antenna or tower within 90 days shall be
grounds to remove the antenna or tower at the owner's expense. If there are two
or more users of a single tower, this provision shall not become effective
until all users cease using the tower.

§ 155.31  ARCHITECTURAL CONTROL.
   (A)   Compliance. For the purpose of promoting compatible development,
aesthetics, stability of property values, and to prevent impairment or
depreciation of the commercial-industrial community in the village, no
structure, including signs, in any Business, Manufacturing, Multi-Family
District and Conservation Outdoor Recreation District shall hereafter be
erected, moved, reconstructed, extended, enlarged, or have its exterior altered
or changed in such a manner as to violate the principles set forth in division
(B) below. Small accessory structures not requiring a zoning permit pursuant to
§
155.03 are herewith exempt from the requirements of §
155.03.
   (B)   Principles.  To implement and define criteria for the purposes set
forth in division (A) above, the following principles are established:
      (1)   No building or sign shall be permitted, the design or exterior
appearance of which is of such unorthodox or abnormal character in relation to
its surroundings as to be unsightly or offensive to generally accepted taste
and community standards.
      (2)   No building or sign shall be permitted, the design or exterior
appearance of which is so identical with those adjoining as to create excessive
monotony or drabness.
      (3)   No building or sign shall be permitted where any exposed facade is
not constructed or faced with a finished material which is aesthetically
compatible with the other facades and presents an attractive appearance to the
public and to surrounding properties.
      (4)   No building or sign shall be permitted to be sited on the property
in a manner which would unnecessarily destroy or substantially damage the
natural beauty of the area, particularly insofar as it would adversely affect
values incident to ownership of land in that area; or which would unnecessarily
have an adverse erect on the beauty and general enjoyment of existing
structures on adjoining properties.
   (C)   Administration.  The Zoning Administrator shall require that each
zoning permit application in any Business, Manufacturing, Conservation Outdoor
Recreation or  Multi-Family District be accompanied by plans showing the

upon which the Board is required to consider.
      (3)   To authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, such variance from the

      (4)   Permit the erection and use of a building or premises in any

such order, requirement, decision or determination as, in its opinion, ought to
be made in the premises and to that end shall have all the powers of the
administrative official. The concurring vote of four members of the Board shall

area otherwise required by the village.
   (E)   Appeals to the Board.
