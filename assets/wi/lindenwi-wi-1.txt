§ 37.03 PUBLIC ACCESS TO RECORDS; DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   In recognition of the fact that a representative government is dependent
upon an informed electorate, it is declared to be the public policy of the
village that all persons are entitled to the greatest possible information
regarding the affairs of government and the official acts of those officers and
employees who represent them. Further, providing persons with such information
is declared to be an essential function of a representative government and an
integral part of the routine duties of officers and employees whose
responsibility it is to provide such information. To that end, the provisions
of this chapter shall be construed in every instance with a presumption of
complete public access, consistent with the conduct of government business. The
denial of public access generally is contrary to the public interest, and only
in an exceptional case may access be denied. Any matter pertaining to public
access to records which is not included in this chapter is governed by Wis.
Stats. §§ 19.31 through 19.39 and other applicable laws.
(Ord. 38-07, passed - -07)
§ 37.04 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter only, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   AUTHORITY.  Any of the following having custody of a village record: a
village office, elected or appointed official, agency, board, commission,
committee, department or public body corporate and politic created by
constitution, law, ordinance, rule or order; or a formally constituted subunit
of any of the foregoing. AUTHORITIES include but are not limited to the Village
Clerk/Treasurer, who shall also have custody of the records of the Village
Board, the Police Chief, the Director of Public Works, the Assessor, the
Building Inspector, the Attorney, and such other authorities as may be
established or created from time to time unless at the time of their
establishment or creation some other custodian is expressly designated.
   CUSTODIAN. Means authority.
   RECORD. Any material on which written, drawn, printed, spoken, electronic
mail or electronic messages, visual or electromagnetic information is recorded
or preserved, regardless of physical form or characteristics, which has been
created or is being kept by an authority. RECORD includes but is not limited to
handwritten, typed or printed pages, maps, charts, photographs, films,
recordings, tapes (including computer tapes), electronic mail or electronic
messages and computer printouts. RECORD does not include drafts, notes,
preliminary computations and like materials prepared of a person for whom the

authority for its review, consideration or action; materials which are purely
the personal property of the custodian and have no relation to his or her
office; materials to which access is limited by copyright, patent or bequest;
and published materials in the possession of an authority other than a public
library which are available for sale, or which are available for inspection at
a public library.
   REQUESTER. Any person who requests inspection or copies of a record.
(Ord. 38-07, passed - -07)
§ 37.05 ACCESS TO RECORDS.
   (A)   General right to inspect. Except as otherwise provided by law, any
requester has a right to inspect any record. Substantive common law principles
construing the right to inspect, copy or receive copies of records shall remain
in effect. The exemptions to the requirement of a governmental body to meet in
open session under Wis. Stats. § 19.85 are indicative of public policy with
respect to exemptions to open records requests. However, these criteria may be
used as grounds for denying public access to a record only if the authority or
legal custodian makes a specific demonstration that there is a need to restrict
public access at the time that the request to inspect or copy the record is
made.
(Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1)(a))
   (B)   Right to inspect personal records. In addition to any right under
division (A) above, any requester who is an individual or person authorized by
the individual has a right to inspect any record containing personally
identifiable information pertaining to the individual that is maintained by an
authority and to make or receive a copy of any such information. When access is
sought to any records which pertain to an individual, the targeted individual
has a right to notification and to seek court review of the decision if the
record custodian agrees to release the information. The right to inspect or
copy a record under this division does not apply to any of the following:
      (1)   Any record containing personally identifiable information that is
collected or maintained in connection with a complaint, investigation or other
circumstances that may lead to an enforcement action, administrative
proceeding, arbitration proceeding or court proceeding, or any such record that
is collected or maintained in connection with such an action or proceeding;
      (2)   Any record containing personally identifiable information that, if
disclosed, would do any of the following:
         (a)   Endanger an individual’s life or safety;
         (b)   Identify a confidential informant;
         (c)   Endanger the security of any state correctional institution, as
defined in Wis. Stats. § 301.01(4); jail, as defined in Wis. Stats. § 165.85(2)
(bg); secured correctional facility, as defined in Wis. Stats. § 938.02(15g);
mental health institute, as defined in Wis. Stats. § 51.01(12); center for the
developmentally disabled, as defined in Wis. Stats. § 51.01(3); or the
population or staff of any of these jails, institutions or facilities; or
         (d)   Compromise the rehabilitation of a person in the custody of the
department of corrections or detained in a jail or facility identified in
division (B)(2)(c).
(Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1)(am)2.d.)
      (3)   Any record that is part of a records series, as defined in Wis.
Stats. § 19.62(7), that is not indexed, arranged or automated in a way that the
record can be retrieved by the authority maintaining the records series by use
of an individual’s name, address or other identifier.
(Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1)(am)3.)
   (C)   Copies of written records. Except as otherwise provided by law, any
requester has a right to inspect a record and to make or receive a copy of a
record, which appears in written form. If a requester requests a copy of the
record, the authority having custody of the record may, at his or her option,
permit the requester to photocopy the record or provide the requester with a
copy substantially as readable as the original.
(Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1)(b))
   (D)   Copies of audio tapes. Except as otherwise provided by law, any
requester has a right to receive from an authority having custody of a record
which is in the form of a comprehensible audio tape recording, a copy of the
tape recording substantially as audible as the original. The authority may
instead provide a transcript of the recording to the requester if he or she
requests.
(Wis. Stats. § 19.35 (1)(c))
   (E)   Copies of video tapes. Except as otherwise provided by law, any
requester has a right to receive from an authority having custody of a record
which is in the form of a video tape recording a copy of the tape recording
substantially as good as the original.
(Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1)(d))
   (F)   Incomprehensible records to be reduced to written form. Except as
otherwise provided by law, any requester has a right to receive from the
custodian of a record which is not in a readily comprehensible form a copy of
the information contained in the record assembled and reduced to written form
on paper.
(Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1)(e))
   (G)   Inspection of non-copyable records. Except as otherwise provided by
law, any requester has a right to inspect any record not specified in divisions
(C) through (F), the form of which does not permit copying. If a requester
requests permission to photograph the record, the authority having custody of
the record may permit the requester to photograph the record. If a requester
requests that a photograph of the record be provided, the authority shall
provide a good quality photograph of the record.
   (H)   Exception. Divisions (A) to (D), (F) and (G) do not apply to a record
which has been or will be promptly published with copies offered for sale or
distribution.
(Ord. 38-07, passed - -07)
Statutory reference:
   Right to inspect, see Wis. Stats. § 19.35
§ 37.06 FACILITIES.
   The authority shall provide any person who is authorized to inspect or copy
a record with facilities comparable to those used by village employees to
inspect, copy and abstract the record during established business hours.
(Ord. 38-07, passed - -07)
§ 37.07 FEES.
   (A)   Amount. The following fees shall be charged by the Village Clerk or
other village authority for copying or locating village records:

                                        Village Board resolution; actual cost
                                        if exceeds $50, in which case the
Locating a record                       actual, necessary, and direct cost of
                                        location shall be determined by the
                                        Village Treasurer and collected by the
                                        custodian and charged to the requester
 
   (B)   Prepayment. The Treasurer may require prepayment by a requester of any
fee or fees imposed under this section if the total amount exceeds $5.
   (C)   Exceptions. No fee shall be charged for copying or locating a public
record in the following instances:
      (1)   Elected and appointed officials of the village shall not be
required to pay for copies of records reasonably required for the proper
performance of their official duties; or
      (2)   An authority may provide copies of a record without charge or at a

(Ord. 38-07, passed - -07)
§ 37.08 ACCESS PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Availability of records. A requester may have access to village
records during all regular office hours at the Village Hall. If a record is
occasionally taken to a location other than the Village Hall, the record shall
be made available for inspection at the Village Hall upon one business day’s
notice.
   (B)   Making a request. A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made
to the Village Clerk. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably
describes the requested record or the information requested. However, a request
for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of
time represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A
request shall be made in writing.
   (C)   Filling a request. The Village Clerk shall, as soon as practicable and
without delay, either fill the request or notify the person making the request
of the custodian’s determination to deny the request in whole or in part and
the reasons therefor. If the Clerk determines that a written request is so
general as to be unduly time-consuming, the party making the request may first
be required to itemize his or her request in a manner which would permit
reasonable compliance.
   (D)   Denial of a request.  If a request is made orally, the Clerk may deny
it orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons for denying
the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral
denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, a written statement
of the reasons for denying the request shall be given to the requester. Every
written denial or a request shall inform the requester that where a request is
made in writing, the denial is subject to review upon petition for a writ of
mandamus in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 19.37(1), or upon application to the
Attorney General or the Iowa County District Attorney.
   (E)   Restriction in inspection. Notwithstanding §
37.05(A), (B) and (G), the custodian may require supervision during inspection
or may impose other reasonable restrictions on the manner of access to an
original record if the record is irreplaceable or easily damaged.
(Ord. 38-07, passed - -07)
§ 37.09 LIMITATION ON ACCESS TO RECORDS.
   (A)   Exempt records. The following records shall be exempt from inspection
and reproduction:
      (1)   Records specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal
law or authorized to be exempted from disclosure by state law;
      (2)   Any record relating to investigative information obtained for law
enforcement purposes if federal law or regulations require exemption from
disclosure or if exemption from disclosure is a condition to receipt of aids by
the state;
      (3)   Computer programs, although the material used as input for a
computer program or the material produced as a product of the computer program
shall be subject to inspection;
      (4)   A record or any portion of a record containing information
qualifying as a common law trade secret, per Wis. Stats. § 19.36(5); and
      (5)   Records naming or identifying any applicant for a position with the
Village who has indicated in writing he or she does not wish the Village to
reveal his or her identify except a final candidate for the position as defined
in Wis. Stats. § 19.36(7).
   (B)   Denial of access because of harm to public interest. An authority may
deny a request to inspect a record which is not specifically exempt from
disclosure, in whole or in part, only if he or she determines that the harm to
the public interest resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public
interest in full access to the requested record. Inspection may be denied, for
example, when the requisite determination has been made and:
      (1)   The records were obtained under official pledges of confidentiality
which were necessary and given in order to obtain the information contained in
them.
      (2)   The record relates to current deliberations in a quasi-judicial
hearing.
      (3)   The record relates to current deliberations concerning employment,
dismissal, promotion, demotion, compensation, performance or discipline of any
village officer or employee, or the investigation of charges against a village
officer or employee, unless such officer or employee consents to disclosure.
      (4)   The record relates to the formulation of current strategy for crime
detection or prevention.
      (5)   The record relates to current deliberations or negotiations
concerning the purchase of public property, investment of public funds, or
other public business whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require
nondisclosure.
      (6)   The record contains financial, medical, social or personal
histories or disciplinary data of specific persons which, if disclosed, would
be likely to have a substantial adverse effect upon the reputation of any
person referred to in such history or data.
      (7)   The record contains communications between legal counsel for the
village and any officer, agent or employee of the village, wherein advice is
rendered concerning strategy with respect to current litigation in which the
village or any of its officers, agents or employees is or is likely to become
involved.
      (8)   The record is subject to any privilege created by Chapter 905 of
the Wisconsin Statutes.
   (C)   Mixed records. If a record contains a mixture of information that may
be made public and of information that may not be made public, the custodian
shall provide the information that may be made public and delete the
information that may not be made public from the record before permitting the
record to be inspected. If an authority receives a request to inspect or copy a
record that is in handwritten form or a record that is in the form of a voice
recording which the authority is required to withhold or from which the
authority is required to delete information under Wis. Stats. § 19.36(8)(b),
because the handwriting or the recorded voice would identify an informant, the
authority shall provide to the requester, upon his or her request, a transcript
of the record or the information contained in the record if the record or
information is otherwise subject to public inspection and copying under this
chapter. If, in the judgment of the custodian, there is no feasible way to
separate the exempt material from the nonexempt material without unreasonably
jeopardizing disclosure of the exempt material, the entire record shall be
withheld from disclosure.

(Ord. 38-07, passed - -07)
§ 37.11 ELECTRONIC FILES.
   (A)   Official records.  Prior to establishing retention requirements to an
e-mail message, it first must be determined if the e-mail message is a public
record, and if it is, what type of public record. The following criteria need
to be considered, and will determine if the message is a public record:
      (1)   Definition: “Any writing containing information relating to the
conduct of the public’s business... prepared, owned, used or retained by a
public body regardless of physical form or characteristics.” Convenience/
duplicate copies are not public record. Information created or received by an
e-mail system is a record if it meets this definition.
      (2)   Content and function: This needs to be determined for each e-mail
message. Content and function will determine record type. Additional criteria,
as listed below, provides for the value of the e-mail message to the user/
agency. Audit and federal requirements also need to be looked at. In some
cases, this may change the required minimum retention, or provide added value
to the user/agency.
      (3)   Administrative value: means the usefulness of records in conducting
an agency’s current business.
      (4)   Fiscal value: means the usefulness of records in documenting an
agency’s fiscal transactions and obligations.
      (5)   Legal value: means the usefulness of records in documenting legally
enforceable rights or obligations, both those of the city and those of persons
directly affected by an agency’s action.
      (6)   Audit: if the record is of a fiscal nature, an audit period will be
required.
      (7)   Federal: if the record is part of a federally funded program,
federal retentions will apply. If in doubt, assume e-mail is a public record.
   (B)   Retention application and management responsibility. Once an e-mail
message has been determined to be a public record, a retention needs to be
applied. A wide variety of information can be transmitted by e-mail; therefore,
the retention periods for the records created will vary according to their
content and function.
      (1)   E-mail records which pertain to a program or function should be
filed with other records related to the program or function. The e-mail then
has the same retention as the rest of the file. The e-mail record must be kept
for the minimum retention period of 120 days.
      (2)   Attached records need to be filed according to their function and
content, and they will assume the retention of the records they are filed with.
Messages must be stored with a copy of the attachment in its original form.
Message transmission and receipt data must be stored along with the message. If
it has been determined that the e-mail record has an audit requirement, the
record retention must take this into consideration. Additionally, if it has
been determined that the record is part of a federally funded program, then
retention requirements must meet the Code of Federal Regulations retention.
Basically, if the department/division’s paper and electronic records have been
scheduled, this same schedule will apply to the e-mail records. Records must be
maintained for the full retention period. Note: if a hard copy (paper) of the
e-mail record is generated, the e-mail record can be discarded, and the
retention applied to the hard copy.
   (C)   Records management responsibility. To provide for consistent record
retention and management of an e-mail record, the following will apply:
      (1)   Originator: has the responsibility of identifying the record copy
and therefore applying a retention, and subsequently, managing the record copy.
      (2)   Recipient(s), internal sources: staff receiving copies will know
that their convenience copies can be deleted as soon as the copies are no
longer needed for personal reference purposes. For example, if an e-mail
message is sent within the village and three employees are copied, the three
identical copies of the message do not have to be maintained for the full
retention period required for the record as long as the originating record is
retained by the originator.
      (3)   Recipient(s), external sources: has the responsibility of
identifying the record copy, and therefore applying a retention, and
subsequently managing the record copy. For example, if an e-mail message is
received from outside the village, and the message contains information
relating to the conduct of the public’s business and is owned, used, or
retained by the village, then the information falls within the scope of the
Public Records Law. Responsibility for the retention and maintenance of records
can be determined within each department and/or division. Additionally,
procedures should be established, where applicable, for providing public access
and inspection. Departments and divisions should monitor compliance with
village policy and procedures.
   (D)   File management.  Files should periodically be reviewed for possible
archiving on other media, such as paper, or possible deletion. Review can be
accomplished by scanning directory listings and looking for file creation dates

§ 37.12 DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS.
   (A)   Destruction of records. Village officers may destroy records which are
considered obsolete of which they are legal custodians after completion of any
required audit by the Bureau of Municipal Audit or by a public accountant
licensed to practice in Wisconsin, but in not less than the time period
established under the Records Retention Schedule set forth in §
37.13.
   (B)   Historical records.  Under Wis. Stats. § 19.21(4)(a), municipalities
must notify the State Historical Society of Wisconsin (SHSW) prior to
destroying records. However, the SHSW has waived the required 60 days’ notice:
      (1)   For any records marked “W” (waived notice).
      (2)   SHSW must be notified prior to destruction of a record marked “N”
(non-waived).
      (3)   Notice is also required for any record not listed in this chapter.
      (4)   “N/A” indicates not applicable and applies to any record designated
for permanent retention.
   (C)   Destruction after request for inspection. No requested records may be
destroyed until after the request for inspection is granted or 60 days after
the request is denied. If an action is commenced under Wis. Stats. § 19.37, the
requested record may not be destroyed until after a court order is issued
authorizing the destruction and all appeals have been completed.
   (D)   Destruction pending litigation. No record subject to pending
litigation shall be destroyed until the litigation is resolved.
   (E)   Review and approval by Public Records and Forms Board. This chapter
and the retention periods of less than seven years has been reviewed and
approved by the Wisconsin Public Records and Forms Board.

§ 39.01 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   (A)   The proper operation of democratic government requires that public
officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the
people; that government decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the
governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and
that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In
recognition of these goals, there is hereby established in this chapter a code
of ethics for all Village of Linden officials and employees, whether elected or
appointed, paid or unpaid, including members of boards, committees and
commissions of the village, as well as any individuals who are candidates for
elective office as soon as such individuals file nomination papers with the
village.
   (B)   The purpose of this ethics code is to establish guidelines for ethical
standards of conduct for all such officials and employees by setting forth
those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the
village and by directing disclosure by such officials and employees of private
financial or other interests in matters affecting the village. The Village
Board believes that a code of ethics for the guidance of elected and appointed
officials and employees will help them avoid conflicts between their personal
interests and their public responsibilities, will improve standards of public
service and will promote and strengthen the faith and confidence of the
citizens of this village in their elected and appointed officials and
employees. The Village Board hereby reaffirms that each elected and appointed
village official and employee holds his or her position as a public trust, and
any intentional effort to realize substantial personal gain through official
conduct is a violation of that trust. The provisions and purpose of this ethics
code and such rules and regulations as may be established are hereby declared
to be in the best interests of the village.
(Ord. 46-10, passed 2-4-10)

(Ord. 46-10, passed 2-4-10)

himself or for a member of his or her immediate family.
   (D)   Political contributions. No official shall personally solicit from any

this section.
   (G)   Any law enforcement officer, health officer or animal control officer
with reasonable cause to believe an animal has bitten a person or been in
contact with a rabid animal shall issue a quarantine order. A quarantine order
may be delivered by personal service, registered mail or by posting a
quarantine sign in two conspicuous places on the property.
   (H)   If a quarantine cannot be imposed because the animal cannot be
captured, the officer may kill the animal. The officer may kill the animal only
as a last resort, or if the owner agrees. The officer shall attempt to kill the
animal in a humane manner and in a manner which avoids damage to the animal's
head. An officer may order killed, or may kill, an animal other than a dog or
cat if the officer has reason to believe that the animal bit a person and may
be infected with rabies.
   (I)   Failure of the owner to deliver an animal to a veterinarian as
directed by the Police Department or any authorized law enforcement officer
within Iowa County, within 24 hours after notice, shall be sufficient cause for
a judge to issue an order authorizing the animal control officer or responsible
agency to seize the animal and make such delivery as intended, at the owner's
expense. The officer may order the animal to be quarantined on the premises of
the owner if the animal is immunized currently against rabies as evidenced by a
valid certificate of rabies vaccination.

of time. A pup born to a female wolf/dog hybrid so registered shall be removed

wolf/dog hybrid in the village which has not been registered on or before
January 31, 2003, that person shall, to the satisfaction of the court, remove
said animal from the village until a trial on the citation. If the animal has
not been so removed within 48 hours of the service of the citation, the animal
may be impounded as directed by the Police Department until the trial on the
citation. In that case, the owner of any such animal shall pay all expenses
incurred due to impoundment, including but not limited to the cost of shelter,

to the village.
   (D)   The owner of any wolf/dog hybrid permitted to be kept in the village,
and the owner of any property on which such wolf/dog hybrid is kept, shall see
that the animal is at all times confined according to the minimum requirements
of this section.
   (E)   A wolf/dog hybrid may be kept only in enclosures that meet the
following minimum requirements:
      (1)   The first enclosure shall be constructed of not less than nine-
gauge galvanized chain link fencing, with mesh openings not greater than two
inches, which shall be securely anchored by stainless steel or copper rings,
placed at intervals not greater than six inches apart, to a poured concrete
base as described herein. Such enclosure shall be not less than 500 square feet
in area, plus 250 square feet for each additional canine animal kept therein.
Such enclosure shall be the location in which any wolf/dog hybrid is primarily
kept.
      (2)   The first enclosure shall extend to a height of not less than eight
feet and shall be surrounded from ground level to a height of not less than
four feet by 1/4-inch galvanized mesh screening.
      (3)   The first enclosure shall have a full top, which shall also be
constructed of not less than nine-gauge chain link fencing with mesh openings
not greater than two inches, and which shall be securely anchored to the sides
of the enclosure. The entire base of the first enclosure shall be poured
concrete slab floor at least four inches thick.
      (4)   The second enclosure shall consist of a securely anchored fence at
least six feet in height, which shall entirely surround the first enclosure,
and no part of which shall be nearer than six feet from any part of the first
enclosure. Said fence shall be a vision barrier fence, no more than 5% open for
through vision, except, however, that the portion of the fence facing the
dwelling of the owner of the animals or of the property on which they are kept
shall be constructed of not less than nine-gauge chain link fencing, to provide
for observation of the animals. If any portion of the fencing is made of wood,
the finished or painted side thereof shall face outward from the first
enclosure.
      (5)   Both enclosures shall be kept locked with case hardened locks at
all times when an animal is unattended by an adult. The first (innermost)
enclosure shall have double entrance gates or doors situated and constructed in
such a fashion as to prevent an animal from escaping past an open gate or door.
The gates or doors providing access to the first (innermost) enclosure shall be
spring-loaded, so as to shut of their own accord behind anyone entering that
enclosure.
      (6)   Within the first enclosure, shelter shall be proved adequate to
protect the animals confined against weather extremes. The first enclosure
shall be regularly cleaned to remove excreta and other waste materials, dirt
and trash, in a manner adequate to minimize health hazards and avoid offensive
odors.
      (7)   The above-described enclosures shall be located in the rear yard of
any property on which a wolf/dog hybrid is kept.
   (F)   A wolf/dog hybrid may be transported only if confined in a secure,
locked container, covered with 1/4-inch galvanized fine mesh screen. This
division shall not prohibit the walking of the animals, provided they are
muzzled and restrained by a leather lead, at least one inch in diameter and not
exceeding three feet in length, attached to a metal choker-type collar, under
the control of an adult. The muzzle must be made in a manner that will not
cause injury to the wolf/dog hybrid or unduly interfere with its vision or
respiration, but will prevent it from biting any person or animal.
   (G)   To insure compliance with this section, any person possessing any
registration papers, certificate, advertisement or other written evidence
relating to the bloodlines or ownership of a canine animal found with the
village shall produce the same for inspection on demand of any law enforcement,
conservation, or public health officer, or court.
   (H)   No person shall own, harbor or keep in his/her possession on any one
parcel of property more than three wolf/dog hybrids over five months of age at
any one time, nor shall any person retain a litter or portion of a litter of
wolf/dog hybrids longer than five months.
   (I)   No person shall willfully or negligently release or abandon a wolf/dog
hybrid as defined herein within the village.

on which such animal is kept signs warning that there is a wolf/dog hybrid on
the property as provided herein. Signs shall be visible and capable of being

APPENDIX: POLICY GUIDELINES – ALCOHOL BEVERAGE LICENSES
Section
   
1.   Intent
   
2.   Guidelines for denial, revocation, nonrenewal, or suspension
   
3.   Grounds for suspension, nonrenewal, or revocation
   
4.   Malt beverage licenses
   
5.   Point values for violations, revocations, suspensions, and nonrenewals
1. INTENT.
   (A)   As it is the responsibility of the Village Board to screen
applications for alcohol beverage licenses within the village under the
licensing authority granted by Chapter 125, Wis. Stats. and
Chapter 110 of this code, the Village Board adopts the following guidelines in
order to specify the reasons for denying, non-renewing or revoking an alcohol
beverage license. The Board retains broad discretionary authority in this area.
However, if a decision is made to deny a license, the Board is required to
provide the applicant with a written reason for the denial. These guidelines
are adopted to meet that requirement.
   (B)   Since alcohol beverage license holders must act in cooperation with
law enforcement to enforce the alcohol beverage laws and drunk driving laws,
and assist with minimizing disturbances of the peace and maintaining the safety
of the community, individuals with a past history of negative or uncooperative
contacts with police agencies should be scrutinized; provided, however, that
the Village Board shall not discriminate against such applicants based on a
prior arrest or conviction record, pursuant to Wis. Stat. §§ 111.321, 111.322,
111.335 and 125.12(1)(b), unless said arrest or conviction record substantially
relates to the circumstances of the particular licensed activity. This also
applies to corporations, limited liability companies, agents, and partnerships.
However, this requirement does not apply if a corporation has terminated its
relationship with the individual whose actions directly contributed to the
conviction (Wis. Stat. § 125.04(5)(C)). It is with these goals in mind, as
well, that these guidelines are adopted.
   (C)   The following guidelines are established by the Village Board to
determine which applicants are eligible for issuance of an alcohol beverage
license. There is broad discretion retained on behalf of the Board to consider
each case on an individual basis. Deviation from the guidelines may be allowed
if there are mitigating circumstances, which may include, but are not limited
to, the particular circumstances documented by the applicant, or the length of
time that has expired since the applicant was last convicted of violation of
any law, statute, rule or ordinance. For purposes of this policy, the
definition of “person” shall be as stated in §
10.05.
2. GUIDELINES FOR DENIAL, REVOCATION, NONRENEWAL, OR SUSPENSION
   (A)   The following guidelines for denial are adopted by the Village Board
for consideration of applicants for alcohol beverage license. A copy of these
guidelines shall be provided to each applicant for a license that files said
application.

incarceration in a state or federal prison system or a county jail for, or

limited to homicide, aggravated battery, sexual assault, injury by negligent

or manufacturing, distributing or delivering a controlled substance or
controlled substance analog under the law of another state that is
substantially similar to Wis. Stat. § 961.41(1) or 961.41(1m).
      (3)   Guideline 3. Any applicant who has been convicted of, released from
incarceration in a state or federal prison system or county jail for, or
released from parole or probation status for any offense with the last three
years in the following subcategories will not be eligible for an alcohol
beverage license (if the offense constitutes a felony, Guideline 1 shall
apply):
         (a)   Alcohol beverage offenses, including but not limited to sale of
alcohol beverages without a license or permit, furnishing alcoholic beverages
to underage persons (furnishing alcohol beverages to underage persons shall not
be used as grounds for suspension, revocation, or non-renewal of an existing
license unless the licensee has committed two violations within a one-year
period), furnishing alcohol beverages to intoxicated persons, or any other
violation of Chapter 125, Wis. Stats. or a local ordinance enacted in
conformity therewith. This does not include offenses for possession or
consumption of alcohol by a minor, which is covered in Guideline 4.
         (b)   Perjury, false swearing, disorderly conduct or criminal damage
to property.
      (4)   Guideline 4. Any applicant who has had two or more convictions
within the last two years for any offense in any combination of the following

include, but not be limited to, a person or applicant, other than an applicant
for a retail license, who has been convicted of, or charged with, four or more
violations of any rule, ordinance, statute or law, within the five years before
the most recent application, the circumstances of which violations
substantially relate to the licensed activity. In the case of an applicant for
a retail license, an habitual law offender shall include, but not be limited to
violations as set forth under §
10.99. If one of the violations constitutes a felony, Guideline 1 shall apply.
      (6)   Guideline 6. The village reserves its rights under Chapter 125,
Wis. Stats. and
Chapter 110 to revoke, non-renew, or suspend any alcohol beverage license it
has issued, based on information of conviction of violations covered by this

application. The Village Board may waive the provisions of this paragraph,
allow the applicant to submit a corrected application, with the appropriate
fee, and grant an alcohol beverage license to the applicant, if it appears to
the Board that any falsifications on the application were the result of
inadvertence, excusable neglect, or a mistake.
   (B)   Only convictions or charges during the current licensing year for the
individual shall be considered for denial or renewal of applications, unless
the Police Chief demonstrates that convictions from previous license years were
not considered in granting the current license.
3. GROUNDS FOR SUSPENSION, NONRENEWAL, OR REVOCATION.
Violation of any limitations and requirements imposed upon a licensee or upon
licensed premises by the policy shall constitute grounds for revocation, non-
renewal or suspension of the license.
4. MALT BEVERAGE LICENSES.
Revocation, non-renewal or suspension of the licensee's malt beverage license
shall constitute cause for revocation, nonrenewal or suspension of any
intoxicating liquor license issued for the same premises.
5. POINT VALUES FOR VIOLATIONS, REVOCATIONS, SUSPENSIONS, AND NONRENEWALS.
   (A)   Purpose. This policy establishes an alcohol beverage demerit point
system to assist in determining which retail license holders should to subject
to suspension or revocation procedures.
   (B)   Point schedule. The following scale of demerit points is listed

(Ord. 2014-2, passed 2-6-14)
§ 130.42 USE OF NON-NICOTINE VAPOR PRODUCTS.
   (A)   Statement of purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of this section is to protect the public health, safety
and welfare of the property and persons in the city by prohibiting persons
under 21 years of age from possessing vapor products.
      (2)   Persons under age of 18 are prohibited by law from purchasing or
possessing cigarettes and other tobacco products, and retailers are prohibited
from selling them to minors. There are new tobacco-less products, however,
commonly referred to as “electronic cigarettes,” “e-cigarettes,” “e-cigars,”
“e-cigarillos,” “e-pipes,” “e-hookahs,” or “electronic nicotine delivery
systems,” which allow the user to simulate cigarette smoking. These products
may be purchased by persons under the age of 21 and are being marketed with
only federal age restrictions.
      (3)   The use of e-cigarettes and similar devices has increased
significantly in recent years.
      (4)   Existing studies on electronic smoking devices' vapor emissions and
cartridge contents have found a number of dangerous substances including
chemicals known to cause cancer such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, lead,
nickel and chromium as well as PM 2.5, acrolein, tin, toluene, and aluminum,
which are associated with a range of negative health effects such as skin, eye,
and respiratory irritation, neurological effects, damage to reproductive
systems, and even premature death from heart attacks and stroke.
      (5)   Clinical studies about the safety and efficacy of these products
have not been submitted to the FDA for the over 400 brands of electronic
smoking devices that are on the market and for this reason, consumers have no
way of knowing whether electronic smoking devices are safe, what types of
potentially harmful chemicals the products contain, and what dose of nicotine
the products deliver.
      (6)   Electronic smoking devices often mimic conventional tobacco
products in shape, size, and color, with the user exhaling a smoke-like vapor
similar in appearance to the exhaled smoke from cigarettes and other
conventional tobacco products.
      (7)   The use of electronic smoking devices in smoke-free locations
threatens to undermine compliance with smoking regulations and reverse the
progress that has been made in establishing a social norm that smoking is not
permitted in public places and places of employment.
      (8)   It is the intent of this Board, in enacting the ordinance codified
in this section, to provide for the public health, safety and welfare by
facilitating uniform and consistent enforcement of smoke-free
air laws; by reducing the potential for re-normalizing smoking in public places
and places of employment; by reducing the potential for children to associate
the use of electronic smoking devices with a normative or healthy lifestyle;
and by prohibiting the sale or distribution of electronic smoking devices to
minors.
      (9)   Therefore, the Village Board determines that prohibiting the sale,
giving, or furnishing of e-cigarettes to persons under the age of 21 and
prohibiting the purchase, possession, or use of e-cigarettes by persons under
the age of 21 is in the village's best interest, is consistent with federal law
and will promote public health, safety, and welfare.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of construction and application of this
section, the following definitions shall apply:
      (1)   ELECTRONIC DELIVERY DEVICE shall include any component part of such
a product whether or not sold separately. Electronic delivery device shall not
include any product that has been approved or otherwise certified by the United
States Food and Drug Administration for legal sales for use in tobacco
cessation treatment or other medical purposes, and is being marketed and sold
solely for that approved purpose.
      (2)   LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER has the meaning given in Wis. Stats. §
30.50(4s).
      (3)   POSSESSION OF A VAPOR PRODUCT shall mean either actual physical
control of the vapor product without necessarily owning that product, or the
right to control the vapor product even though it is in a different room or
place than where the person is physically located
      (4)   PUBLIC PLACE means a public street, sidewalk, or park or any area
open to the general public in a publically owned or operated building or
premises, or in a public place of business or a school.
      (5)   UNDERAGE PERSON means an individual who is less than 21 years of
age.
      (6)   USE A VAPOR PRODUCT means to smoke, chew, suck, inhale, or
otherwise consume a tobacco product or vapor product.
      (7)   VAPOR PRODUCT means any product containing or delivering lobelia,
or any other substance intended for human consumption except nicotine that can
be used by a person to simulate smoking in the delivery of the substance
through inhalation of vapor from the product.
   (C)   Prohibited conduct. Except as provided in division (E) below, no
underage person may do any of the following:
      (1)   Purchase or attempt to purchase any vapor product.
      (2)   Possess or attempt to possess a vapor product.
      (3)   Use a vapor product in a public place.
      (4)   Falsely represent his or her age for the purpose of receiving any
vapor product.
   (D)   School property. No individual, regardless of age, who is enrolled in
secondary school may possess or attempt to possess a cigarette, tobacco product
or vapor product while on school property.
   (E)   Exceptions. A person under 21 years of age may purchase vapor products
for the sole purpose of resale in the course of employment.
   (F)   Enforcement. A law enforcement officer shall seize any cigarette,
vapor product or tobacco product involved in any violation of division (C) or
(D) above committed in his or her presence.
   (G)   Penalty. An individual who violates this section shall, upon
conviction, be subject to a forfeiture as provided in §
35.03 of this Code.
(Ord. 2020-04, passed 11-11-20)
§ 130.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person who shall violate §
130.01 of this code shall, upon conviction, be subject to a forfeiture of not
less than $25 nor more than $100 for each offense.
(Ord. 68, passed 8-4-94)
   (B)   Except as provided in the Children’s Code (Wis. Stats. Chapter 48)
with respect to minors, any person found guilty of violating §§
130.15 through
130.18 of this code of ordinances, upon the first conviction, shall forfeit not
less than $20 nor more than $100, and for each subsequent conviction shall
forfeit not less than $50 nor more than $200. Each person convicted also shall

costs, shall be imprisoned in the County Jail until the forfeiture and costs of
prosecution are paid, but not to exceed six months.

Commission. Also, unless such a certificate has been granted by the Commission,
the Building Inspector shall not issue a permit for any such work.
   (B)   Upon filing of any application for a Certificate of Appropriateness

      (1)   In the case of a designated historic structure or historic site,
the proposed work would detrimentally change, destroy, or adversely affect any
exterior feature of the improvement or site upon which the work is to be done;

VARIANCES
§ 153.070 CIRCUMSTANCES.
   (A)   Where the Village Board finds that extraordinary hardships or
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these
regulations, or that the purposes of these regulations may be served to a
greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve variances to these
subdivision regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public
interest secured, provided that a variance shall not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations, and further provided
that the Village Board shall not approve variances unless it shall make
findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case as
follows.
   (B)   The following findings are required for a variance to be approved:
      (1)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare, or injurious to other property as located;
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought, and not applicable to
other property;
      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these regulations is carried out; and
      (4)   The variance will not in any manner vary the provisions of the
zoning code or official map.
(`99 Code, § 8.11) Penalty, see §
153.999

CONDITIONAL USES
154.050 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   One of the purposes of this chapter is to divide the village into districts
within which the use of land and buildings, and the bulk and location of
buildings in relation to the land are mutually compatible and substantially
uniform. There are certain uses that may be entirely appropriate and not
necessarily incompatible with the basic uses permitted in any district,
conditions being imposed by reason of unique problems the use of a particular
location presents from a zoning standpoint, including the impact on those uses
upon neighboring land or public facilities, and the public need for particular
use at a particular location. Such uses may be necessary or desirable to be
allowed in a particular district provided that due consideration is given to
their location, development, and operation. Such uses are hereby classified as
conditional uses and are subject to the provisions specified herein.
   (A)   Approval required. Any conditional uses shall be permitted only when
authorized by the Village Board.
   (B)   Basis of approval. Conditions related to landscaping, architectural
design, type of construction, construction commencement and completion dates,
sureties, lighting, fencing, operational control, hours of operation, traffic
and parking requirements, may be required by the Plan Commission upon its
finding that such conditions are necessary to fulfill the purposes and intent
of this chapter.
    (C)   Conditional uses. Conditional uses shall comply with all other
provisions of this chapter such as lot width and area, yards, height, parking
and loading.
(Ord. passed 5-12-04)
§ 154.051 PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Application. Application for a Conditional Use Permit shall be made to
the Zoning Administrator who shall promptly refer the application to the
Village Plan Commission. In addition to the information required for a Land Use
Permit, the Plan Commission may require the applicant to submit other pertinent
data and information necessary to properly evaluate the request.
   (B)   Fees. The fee for filing of applications for Conditional Use Permits
shall be established by the Village Board. A copy of the current fee schedule
shall be kept on file in the offices of the Zoning Administrator and the
Village Clerk.
   (C)   Hearing. The Village Plan Commission shall schedule a public hearing
on the application within 30 days after it is filed.
   (D)   Determination. The Plan Commission shall report its decision within 40
days after the filing of the application. Its decision shall include an
accurate description of the use permitted, or the property on which it is
permitted, and all conditions made applicable thereto.
   (E)   Mapping and recording. When a Conditional Use Permit is granted, an
appropriate record shall be made of the land use, and building permits, and
such grant shall be applicable solely to the structures, use and property so
described.
   (F)   Termination. Where a permitted conditional use does not continue in
conformity with the conditions of the original approval, the Conditional Use
Permit shall be terminated by the Village Board.

155.10   Definitions
§ 155.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDING OF FACT, STATEMENT OF PURPOSE, TITLE
AND GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. This chapter is adopted pursuant to the
authorization in Wis. Stats. §§ 62.23 and 61.35; and the requirements in Wis.
Stats. § 87.30.
   (B)   Finding of fact. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains
and rivers of this municipality would impair the public health, safety,
convenience, general welfare and tax base.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. This chapter is intended to regulate floodplain
development to:
      (1)   Protect life, health and property;
      (2)   Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects;
      (3)   Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the
taxpayers;
      (4)   Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain;
      (6)   Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the
floodplain;
      (7)   Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers;
      (8)   Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage
and result in conflicts between property owners; and
      (9)   Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable
alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain.
   (D)   Title. This chapter shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance
for Linden, Wisconsin.
   (E)   General provisions.
      (1)   Areas to be regulated. This chapter regulates all areas that would
be covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the flood insurance
rate map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are
derived from the flood profiles in the flood insurance study (FIS) and are
shown as AE, Al-30, and AH zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are
displayed as A and AO zones. Regional flood elevations (RFE) may be derived
from other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most
restrictive information shall apply.
      (2)   Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain
districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or Al -30 on the maps based on the
flood insurance study (FIS) listed below. Any change to the base flood
elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway
in the FIS or on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must be reviewed and
approved by the DNR and FEMA through the letter of map change process (see §
155.08 Amendments) before it is effective. No changes to RFE's on non-FEMA maps
shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on
file in the office of the Village Clerk. If more than one map or revision is
referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.
   OFFICIAL MAPS:
   Based on the FIS: Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel number 55049C0345D
dated December 16, 2015;with corresponding profiles that are based on the flood
insurance study (FIS) dated December 16, 2015, Volume number 55049CV000A;
   Approved by: The DNR and FEMA.
      (3)   Establishment of floodplain zoning districts. The regional
floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows:
         (a)   The Floodway District (FW), is the channel of a river or stream
and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry
the regional floodwaters and are contained within AE zones as shown on the
FIRM.
         (b)   The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion between the
regional flood limits and the floodway and displayed as AE zones on the FIRM.
         (c)   The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that may be
covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have a BFE or
floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO zones on the FIRM,
      (4)   Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on
the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be
resolved using the criteria in divisions (a) or (b) below. If a significant
difference exists, the map shall be amended according to §
155.08 Amendments. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a boundary derived from
a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map
amendment is required. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for
documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which
the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments
required under this section. Disputes between the Zoning Administrator and an
applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to §
155.07(D)(3)(c) and the criteria in (a) and (b) below. Where the flood profiles
are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve
any map amendment or revision pursuant to §
155.08.
         (a)   If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile
elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood
elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
         (b)   Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of
the boundary shall be determined by the map scale.
      (5)   Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of
this chapter shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless
it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the
fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended
pursuant to §
155.08.
      (6)   Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by
this chapter shall be in compliance with the terms of this chapter, and other
applicable local, state, and federal regulations.
      (7)   Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically
exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to
comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are
required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13) applies. The construction,
reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the
Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.2022
applies.
      (8)   Abrogation and greater restrictions.
          (a)   This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any village
zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. §§ 62.23 and 61.35 or Wis. Stats. §
87.30, which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance shall continue
in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not
otherwise.
         (b)   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this chapter imposes
greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
      (9)   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this chapter are the minimum requirements liberally construed in
favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other
powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this chapter,
required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be
interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of
this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this
chapter.
      (10)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection
standards in this chapter are based on engineering experience and research.
Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain
areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood
damages. This chapter does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of
action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damage that may result from reliance on this chapter.
      (11)   Severability. Should any portion of this chapter be declared
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder
of this chapter shall not be affected.
      (12)   Annexed areas for cities and villages. The Iowa County floodplain
zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect
and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the
municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of
ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and 44 CFR 59-72, National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning
map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the
purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the
Municipal Zoning Administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the
regional flood elevation and the floodway location.
(Ord. 2015-54, passed 11-5-15)
§ 155.02 GENERAL STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO ALL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS.
   (A)   The community shall review all permit applications to determine
whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall be designed and anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads; be constructed with flood-resistant materials; be
constructed to minimize flood damages and to ensure that utility and mechanical
equipment is designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the equipment during conditions of flooding.
   (B)   Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above
standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall
include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that

hazards and all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damages.
      (1)   Hydraulic and hydrologic analyses.
         (a)   No floodplain development shall:
            1.   Obstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the
conveyance of floodwaters by itself or with other development, causing any
increase in the regional flood height; or
            2.   Cause any increase in the regional flood height due to
floodplain storage area lost.
         (b)   The Zoning Administrator shall deny permits if it is determined
the proposed development will obstruct flow or cause any increase in the
regional flood height, based on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted
map, unless the provisions of §
155.08 are met.
      (2)   Watercourse alterations.
         (a)   No land use permit to alter or relocate a watercourse in a
mapped floodplain shall be issued until the local official has notified in
writing all adjacent municipalities, the Department and FEMA regional offices,
and required the applicant to secure all necessary state and federal permits.
The standards of §
155.02(B)(1) must be met and the flood carrying capacity of any altered or
relocated watercourse shall be maintained.
         (b)   As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after
the date of the watercourse alteration or relocation and pursuant to §
155.08, the community shall apply for a letter of map revision (LOMR) from
FEMA. Any such alterations must be reviewed and approved by FEMA and the DNR
through the LOMC process.
      (3)    Wis. Stats. Chapters 30, 31 development. Development which
requires a permit from the Department, under Wis. Stats. Chapters 30 and 31,
such as docks, piers, wharves, bridges, culverts, dams and navigational aids,
may be allowed if the necessary permits are obtained and amendments to the
floodplain zoning chapter are made according to §
155.08.
      (4)   Public or private campgrounds. Public or private campgrounds shall
have a low flood damage potential and shall meet the following provisions:
         (a)   The campground is approved by the Department of Health Services;
         (b)   A land use permit for the campground is issued by the Zoning
Administrator;
         (c)   The character of the river system and the campground elevation
are such that a 72-hour warning of an impending flood can be given to all
campground occupants;
         (d)   There is an adequate flood warning procedure for the campground
that offers the minimum notice required under this section to all persons in
the campground. This procedure shall include a written agreement between the
campground owner, the municipal emergency government coordinator and the chief
law enforcement official which specifies the flood elevation at which
evacuation shall occur, personnel responsible for monitoring flood elevations,
types of warning systems to be used and the procedures for notifying at-risk
parties, and the methods and personnel responsible for conducting the
evacuation;
         (e)   This agreement shall be for no more than one calendar year, at
which time the agreement shall be reviewed and updated by the officials
identified in division (d) above to remain in compliance with all applicable
regulations, including those of the state Department of Health Services and all
other applicable regulations;
         (f)   Only camping units that are fully licensed, if required, and
ready for highway use are allowed;
         (g)   The camping units shall not occupy any site in the campground
for more than 180 consecutive days, at which time the camping unit must be
removed from the floodplain for a minimum of 24 hours;
         (h)   All camping units that remain on site for more than 30 days

Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) or North American Vertical Datum (NAVD);
            8.   Data sufficient to determine the regional flood elevation in
NGVD or NAVD at the location of the development and to determine whether or not
the requirements of §
155.03 or §
155.04 are met; and
            9.   Data to determine if the proposed development will cause an
obstruction to flow or an increase in regional flood height or discharge
according to §
155.02(B)(1). This may include any of the information noted in §
155.03(C)(1).
         (c)   Hydraulic and hydrologic studies to analyze development. All
hydraulic and hydrologic studies shall be completed under the direct
supervision of a professional engineer registered in the state. The study
contractor shall be responsible for the technical adequacy of the study. All
studies shall be reviewed and approved by the Department.
            1.   Zone A floodplains.
               a.   Hydrology. The appropriate method shall be based on the
standards in ch. NR 116.07(3), Wis. Admin. Code, Hydrologic Analysis:
Determination of Regional Flood Discharge.
               b.   Hydraulic modeling. The regional flood elevation shall be
based on the standards in ch. NR 116.07(4), Wis. Admin. Code, Hydraulic
Analysis: Determination of Regional Flood Elevation and the following:
                  i.   Determination of the required limits of the hydraulic
model shall be based on detailed study information for downstream structures
(dam, bridge, culvert) to determine adequate starting WSEL for the study.
                  ii.   Channel sections must be surveyed.
                  iii.   Minimum four foot contour data in the overbanks shall
be used for the development of cross section overbank and floodplain mapping.
                  iv.   A maximum distance of 500 feet between cross sections
is allowed in developed areas with additional intermediate cross sections
required at transitions in channel bottom slope including a survey of the
channel at each location.
                  v.   The most current version of HEC RAS shall be used.
                  vi.   A survey of bridge and culvert openings and the top of
road is required at each structure.
                  vii.   Additional cross sections are required at the
downstream and upstream limits of the proposed development and any necessary
intermediate locations based on the length of the reach if greater than 500
feet.
                  viii.   Standard accepted engineering practices shall be used
when assigning parameters for the base model such as flow, Manning's N values,
expansion and contraction coefficients or effective flow limits. The base model
shall be calibrated to past flooding data such as high water
marks to determine the reasonableness of the model results. If no historical
data is available, adequate justification shall be provided for any parameters
outside standard accepted engineering practices.
                  ix.   The model must extend past the upstream limit of the
difference in the existing and proposed flood profiles in order to provide a
tie-in to existing studies. The height difference between the proposed flood
profile and the existing study profiles shall be no more than 0.00 feet.
               c.   Mapping. A work map of the reach studied shall be provided,
showing all cross section locations, floodway/floodplain limits based on best
available topographic data, geographic limits of the proposed development and
whether the proposed development is located in the floodway.
                  i.   If the proposed development is located outside of the
floodway, then it is determined to have no impact on the regional flood
elevation.
                  ii.   If any part of the proposed development is in the
floodway, it must be added to the base model to show the difference between
existing and proposed conditions. The study must ensure that all coefficients
remain the same as in the existing model, unless adequate justification based
on standard accepted engineering practices is provided.
            2.   Zone AE Floodplains.
               a.   Hydrology. If the proposed hydrology will change the
existing study, the appropriate method to be used shall be based on ch. NR
116.07(3), Wis. Admin. Code, Hydrologic Analysis: Determination of Regional
Flood Discharge.
               b.   Hydraulic model. The regional flood elevation shall be
based on the standards in ch. NR 116.07(4), Wis. Admin. Code, Hydraulic
Analysis: Determination of Regional Flood Elevation and the following:
                  i.   Duplicate effective model. The effective model shall be
reproduced to ensure correct transference of the model data and to allow
integration of the revised data to provide a continuous FIS model upstream and
downstream of the revised reach. If data from the effective model is available,
models shall be generated that duplicate the FIS profiles and the elevations
shown in the floodway data table in the FIS report to within 0.1 foot.
                  ii.   Corrected effective model. The corrected effective
model shall not include any man-made physical changes since the effective model
date, but shall import the model into the most current version of HEC-RAS for
Department review.
                  iii.   Existing (pre-project conditions) model. The existing
model shall be required to support conclusions about the actual impacts of the
project associated with the revised (postproject) model or to establish more
up-to-date models on which to base the revised (post-project) model.
                  iv.   Revised (post-project conditions) model. The revised
(post-project conditions) model shall incorporate the existing model and any
proposed changes to the topography caused by the proposed development. This
model shall reflect proposed conditions.
                  v.   All changes to the duplicate effective model and
subsequent models must be supported by certified topographic information,
bridge plans, construction plans and survey notes.
                  vi.   Changes to the hydraulic models shall be limited to the
stream reach for which the revision is being requested. Cross sections upstream
and downstream of the revised reach shall be identical to those in the
effective model and result in water surface elevations and topwidths computed
by the revised models matching those in the effective models upstream and
downstream of the revised reach as required. The effective model shall not be
truncated.
               c.   Mapping. Maps and associated engineering data shall be
submitted to the Department for review which meet the following conditions:
                  i.   Consistency between the revised hydraulic models, the
revised floodplain and floodway delineations, the revised flood profiles,
topographic work map, annotated FIRMs and/or flood boundary floodway maps
(FBFMs), construction plans, bridge plans.
                  ii.   Certified topographic map of suitable scale, contour
interval, and a planimetric map showing the applicable items. If a digital
version of the map is available, it may be submitted in order that the FIRM may
be more easily revised.
                  iii.   Annotated FIRM panel showing the revised 1% and 0.2%
annual chance floodplains and floodway boundaries.
                  iv.   If an annotated FIRM and/or FBFM and digital mapping
data (GIS or CADD) are used then all supporting documentation or metadata must
be included with the data submission along with the Universal Transverse
Mercator (UTM) projection and State Plane Coordinate System in accordance with
FEMA mapping specifications.
                  v.   The revised floodplain boundaries shall tie into the
effective floodplain boundaries.
                  vi.   All cross sections from the effective model shall be
labeled in accordance with the effective map and a cross section lookup table
shall be included to relate to the model input numbering scheme.
                  vii.   Both the current and proposed floodways shall be shown
on the map.
                  vii.   The stream centerline, or profile baseline used to
measure stream distances in the model shall be visible on the map.
         (d)   Expiration. All permits issued under the authority of this
chapter shall expire no more than 180 days after issuance. The permit may be
extended for a maximum of 180 days for good and sufficient cause.
      (3)   Certificate of compliance. No land shall be occupied or used, and
no building which is hereafter constructed, altered, added to, modified,
repaired, rebuilt or replaced shall be occupied until a certificate of
compliance is issued by the Zoning Administrator, except where no permit is
required, subject to the following provisions:
         (a)   The certificate of compliance shall show that the building or
premises or part thereof, and the proposed use, conform to the provisions of

Board shall:
         (a)   Uphold the denial where the Board agrees with the data showing
an increase in flood elevation. Increases may only be allowed after amending
the flood profile and map and all appropriate legal arrangements are made with
all adversely affected property owners as per the requirements of §
155.08 Amendments; and
         (b)   Grant the appeal where the Board agrees that the data properly
demonstrates that the project does not cause an increase provided no other
reasons for denial exist.
   (F)   Floodproofing standards for noncomforming structures or uses. 
      (1)   No permit or variance shall be issued for a non-residential
structure designed to be watertight below the regional flood elevation until
the applicant submits a plan certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect that the floodproofing measures will protect the structure or
development to the flood protection elevation and submits a FEMA floodproofing
certificate.
      (2)   For a structure designed to allow the entry of floodwaters, no
permit or variance shall be issued until the applicant submits a plan either:
         (a)   Certified by a registered professional engineer or architect; or

contents of buildings subject to flooding, for the purpose of reducing or
eliminating flood damage.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional flood
discharge.
   FREEBOARD. A safety factor expressed in terms of a specified number of feet

parcels) of land, divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or
sale.
   MOBILE/MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION, EXISTING. A parcel of land,
divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale, on which the

grading or the pouring of concrete pads.
   MOBILE/MANUFACTURED HOME PARK, EXPANSION TO EXISTING. The preparation of
additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed. This includes installation of
utilities, construction of streets and either final site grading, or the

is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. Manufactured
homes that are towed or carried onto a parcel of land, but do not remain
capable of being towed or carried, including park model homes, do not fall
within the definition of mobile recreational vehicles.

model or corrected effective model to reflect any man made modifications that
have occurred within the floodplain since the date of the effective model but
prior to the construction of the project for which the revision is being
requested. If no modification has occurred since the date of the effective
model, then this model would be identical to the corrected effective model or
duplicate effective model.
   MODEL, REVISED (POST-PROJECT). A modification of the existing or pre-project
conditions model, duplicate effective model or corrected effective model to
reflect revised or post-project conditions.
   MUNICIPALITY or MUNICIPAL. The Village of Linden.

level datum, 1929 adjustment.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. For floodplain management purposes, NEW CONSTRUCTION means
structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the
effective date of floodplain zoning regulations adopted by this community and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For the purpose of
determining flood insurance rates, it includes any structures for which the
start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of an initial
FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE. An existing lawful structure or building which is
not in conformity with the dimensional or structural requirements of this
chapter for the area of the floodplain which it occupies. (For example, an
existing residential structure in the floodfringe district is a conforming use.
However, if the lowest floor is lower than the flood protection elevation, the
structure is nonconforming.)
   NONCONFORMING USE. An existing lawful use or accessory use of a structure or
building which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter for the
area of the floodplain which it occupies. (Such as a residence in the
floodway.)

chapter, as described in §
155.01(E)(2), which has been approved by the Department and FEMA.
   OPEN SPACE USE. Those uses having a relatively low flood damage potential
and not involving structures.
   ORDINARY HIGHWATER MARK. The point on the bank or shore up to which the

predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized characteristic.
   PERSON. An individual, or group of individuals, corporation, partnership,
association, municipality or state agency.
   PRIVATE SEWAGE SYSTEM. A sewage treatment and disposal system serving one
structure with a septic tank and soil absorption field located on the same
parcel as the structure. It also means an alternative sewage system approved by
the Department of Safety and Professional Services, including a substitute for
the septic tank or soil absorption field, a holding tank, a system serving more
than one structure or a system located on a different parcel than the
structure.
   PUBLIC UTILITIES.  Those utilities using underground or overhead
transmission lines such as electric, telephone and telegraph, and distribution

land or damage structures to be removed from the floodplain and that any
subsurface waters related to the base flood will not damage existing or
proposed buildings.
   REGIONAL FLOOD. A flood determined to be representative of large floods
known to have occurred in Wisconsin. A regional flood is a flood with a 1%
chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, and if depicted on the
FIRM, the RFE is equivalent to the BFE.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual start of
construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other
structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. Any manmade object with form, shape and utility, either
permanently or temporarily attached to, placed upon or set into the ground,
stream bed or lake bed, including, but not limited to, roofed and walled
buildings, gas or liquid storage tanks, bridges, dams and culverts.
   SUBDIVISION. Has the meaning given in Wis. Stats. § 236.02(12).
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure, whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its pre-damaged condition would equal or
exceed 50% of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the
improvement or repair is started. If the structure has sustained substantial
damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the
work performed. The term does not, however, include either any project for the
improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary or
safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the
minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or any alteration of a
historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure.
   UNNECESSARY HARDSHIP. Where special conditions affecting a particular
property, which were not self-created, have made strict conformity with
restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or density
unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of this
chapter.
   VARIANCE. An authorization by the Board of Adjustment or Appeals for the
construction or maintenance of a building or structure in a manner which is
inconsistent with dimensional standards (not uses) contained in this chapter.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without required
permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, floodproofing certificates or
required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation
until such time as that documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE PROFILE. A graphical representation showing the elevation of
the water surface of a watercourse for each position along a reach of river or
stream at a certain flood flow. A water surface profile of the regional flood
is used in regulating floodplain areas.
   WATERSHED. The entire region contributing runoff or surface water to a
watercourse or body of water.
   WELL. An excavation opening in the ground made by digging, boring, drilling,
driving or other methods, to obtain groundwater regardless of its intended use.
