§ 51.027 CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL PROGRAM.
   (A)   Description.  The Village Water Utility, under the direction of the
Department of Natural Resources Code, Wis. Adm. Code, NR 811.09, is required to
develop and implement a cross-connection control program. The objective of this
program is to prevent contamination of the municipal potable water supply
through illegal interconnections between private, auxiliary or emergency water
supplies and the village’s potable water distribution system.
      (1)    Residential. Local plumbers are the designated inspectors for all
residential properties. For clarification purposes, rental properties
containing four or fewer rental units will be deemed to be residential
properties. The inspection guidelines are outlined in the Department of
Commerce Code, Wis. Adm. Code Chapter SPS 382. The plumber shall determine if a
cross-connection exists, inform the customer whether or not a cross-connection
exists, assess the severity of the interconnection and determine if it can be
corrected while still on-site. In the case that the cross-connection can be
corrected immediately, corrections shall be made and the plumber will note that
the residence is in compliance. If the cross-connection cannot be corrected
while on-site, the plumber will inform the customer of the cross-connection and
then schedule an appointment no less than 30 days from the initial inspection
date to determine if the corrections were made.
      (2)    Commercial/industrial. The Water Utility shall mail a letter and
an inspection form to all commercial/industrial accounts, requiring each to
have a licensed inspector or plumber perform a cross-connection inspection on
their premises. Each commercial/industrial customer is then required to correct
all illegal interconnections at his, her or its expense. The inspecting
authority (plumber) shall then indicate that the inspection is in compliance.
The business representative and the inspector must then sign the inspection
form, keep their designated copies and forward the completed inspection form to
the Water Utility.
   (B)   Local authority. The local authority is as set forth in this section.
   (C)   Schedule for inspection/reinspection. Inspection of residential
consumers shall take place every ten years unless otherwise authorized by the
Department of Natural Resources. The program may include public education
materials in lieu of inspections of low hazard portions of residential or
commercial facilities (normal kitchen and bathroom fixtures). Inspection of
commercial/industrial consumers shall take place every two to five years.
Records of inspections shall be kept at the Village Water Utility office,
located at 380 East Main Street, Gilman, Wisconsin and saved until the next
compliant inspection is completed.
   (D)   Description of approved methods and devices. The Water Utility
references the Department of Commerce Code, Wis. Adm. Code Chapter SPS 382 for
a list of approved methods and devices.
   (E)   Denial or discontinuance of water service.
      (1)   Residential. The local plumber shall make at least three attempts,
no less than two months apart, to contact and schedule appointments with
customers. Contacts may include phone conversations, phone messages, face-to-
face conversations and written notices left at the customer’s residences. All
attempts at contacts, no-shows and cancelled appointments will be documented.
In the event the Water Utility deems it necessary, the plumber shall provide
records of contacts and noncompliance to the Village Board. The Utility and/or
Village Board then reserves the right to follow the steps outlined in the
Department of Commerce Code, Wis. Adm. Code § PSC 185.37 (11a. through 11f.).
      (2)   Commercial/industrial. The Water Utility shall mail an initial
letter outlining the cross-connection inspection directive, along with a
commercial cross-connection inspection form. Commercial customers will be given
three months to have their inspections completed. Documentation of completed
inspections will be kept on record at the Water Utility. Commercial customers
who neglect to have the inspection completed after the initial three months
shall be sent a follow-up letter and given an additional month to comply. In
the event that a completed inspection is not submitted by the end of the four-
month period, the Water Utility shall forward records of contact and
noncompliance to the Village Board. The Utility/Village Board then reserves the
right to follow the steps outlined in the Department of Commerce Code, Wis.
Adm. Code PSC 185.37 (11a. through 11f.).

Quarterly Service Charges: Amounts can be found on the PSC rate file online at
the PSC website and also at the office of the Village Clerk
Plus Volume Charges:
   Amounts can be found at the office of the Village Clerk
Billing: Bills for water service are rendered quarterly and become due and
payable upon issuance following the period for which service is rendered. A
late payment charge of 1 percent per month will be added to bills not paid
within 20 days of issuance. This late payment charge will be applied to the
total unpaid balance for utility service, including unpaid late payment
charges. The late payment charge is applicable to all customers. The utility
customer may be given a written notice that the bill is overdue no sooner than
20 days after the bill is issued. Unless payment or satisfactory arrangement
for payment is made within the next ten days, service may be disconnected
pursuant to Wis. Adm. Code Ch. PSC 185.
Combined Metering: Volumetric meter readings will be combined for billing if
the utility for its own convenience places more than one meter on a single
water service lateral. Multiple meters placed for the purpose of identifying
water not discharged into the sanitary sewer are not considered for utility
convenience and shall not be combined for billing. This requirement does not
preclude the utility from combining readings when metering configurations
support such an approach. Meter readings from individually metered separate
service laterals shall not be combined for billing purposes.

   (K)   Water Utility operating rules.
   Schedule No. X-l
Public Service Commission of Wisconsin    Amendment No. 11
   WATER UTILITY OPERATING RULES
Compliance with Rules
All persons now receiving water service from this Water Utility, or who may
request service in the future, shall be considered as having agreed to be bound
by the rules and regulations as filed with the Public Service Commission of
Wisconsin.
Establishment of Service
Application for water service may be made in writing on a form furnished by the
Water Utility. The application will contain the legal description of the
property to be served, the name of the owner, the exact use to be made of the
service, and the size of the service lateral and meter desired. Note
particularly any special refrigeration, fire protection, or water-consuming
air-conditioning equipment.
Service will be furnished only if (1) the premises have a frontage on a
properly platted street or public strip in which a cast iron or other long-life
water main has been laid, or where the property owner has agreed to and
complied with the provisions of the Water Utility’s filed main extension rule,
(2) the property owner has installed or agrees to install a service lateral
from the curb stop to the point of use that is not less than 6 feet below the
surface of an established or proposed grade and meets the Water Utility’s
specifications, and (3) the premises have adequate piping beyond the metering
point.
The owner of a multi-unit dwelling has the option of being served by individual
metered water service to each unit. The owner, by selecting this option, is
required to provide interior plumbing and meter settings to enable individual
metered service to each unit and individual disconnection without affecting
service to other units. Each meter and meter connection will be treated as a
separate Water Utility account for the purpose of the filed rules and
regulations.
No division of the water service lateral to any lot or parcel of land shall be
made for the extension and independent metering of the supply to an adjoining
lot or parcel of land. Except for duplexes, no division of a water service
lateral shall be made at the curb for separate supplies for two or more
separate premises having frontage on any street or public service strip,
whether owned by the same or different parties. Duplexes may be served by one
lateral provided (1) individual metered service and disconnection is provided
and (2) it is permitted by local ordinance.
Buildings used in the same business, located on the same parcel, and served by
a single lateral may have the customer’s water supply piping installed to a
central point so that volume can be metered in one place.
The Water Utility may withhold approval of any application where full
information of the purpose of such supply is not clearly indicated and set
forth by the applicant property owner.
Reconnection of Service
Where the Water Utility has disconnected service at the customer’s request, a
reconnection charge shall be made when the customer requests reconnection of
service. See Schedule R-l for the applicable rate.
A reconnection charge shall also be required from customers whose services are
disconnected (shut off at curb stop box) because of nonpayment of bills when
due. See Schedule R-l for the applicable rate.
If reconnection is requested for the same location by any member of the same
household, or, if a place of business, by any partner of the same business, it
shall be considered as the same customer.
Temporary Metered Service, Meter, and Deposits
An applicant for temporary water service on a metered basis shall make and
maintain a monetary deposit for each meter installed as security for payment
for use of water and for such other charges which may arise from the use of the
supply. A charge shall be made for setting the valve and furnishing and setting
the meter. See Schedule BW-1 for the applicable rate.
Water for Construction
When water is requested for construction purposes or for filling tanks or other
such uses, an application shall be made to the Water Utility, in writing,
giving a statement of the amount of construction work to be done or the size of
the tank to be filled, etc. Payment for the water for construction may be
required in advance at the scheduled rates. The service lateral must be
installed into the building before water can be used. No connection with the
service lateral at the curb shall be made without special permission from the
Water Utility. In no case will any employee of the Water Utility turn on water
for construction work unless the contractor has obtained permission from the
Water Utility.
Customers shall not allow contractors, masons, or other persons to take
unmetered water from their premises without permission from the Water Utility.
Any customer failing to comply with this provision may have water service
discontinued and will be responsible for the cost of the estimated volume of
water used.
Use of Hydrants
In cases where no other supply is available, permission may be granted by the
Water Utility to use a hydrant. No hydrant shall be used until the proper meter
and valve are installed. In no case shall any valve be installed or moved
except by an employee of the Water Utility.
Before a valve is set, payment must be made for its setting and for the water
to be used at the scheduled rates. Where applicable, see Schedule BW-1 for
deposits and charges. Upon completing the use of the hydrant, the customer must
notify the Water Utility to that effect.
Operation of Valves and Hydrants and Unauthorized Use of Water - Penalty
Any person who shall, without authority of the Water Utility, allow
contractors, masons, or other unauthorized persons to take water from their
premises, operate any valve connected with the street or supply mains, or open
any fire hydrant connected with the distribution system, except for the purpose
of extinguishing fire, or who shall wantonly damage or impair the same, shall
be subject to a fine as provided by municipal ordinance. Utility permission for
the use of hydrants applies only to such hydrants that are designated for the
specific use.
Refunds of Monetary Deposits
All money deposited as security for payment of charges arising from the use of
temporary water service on a metered basis, or for the return of a hydrant
valve and fixtures if the water is used on an unmetered basis, will be refunded
to the depositor on the termination of the use of water, the payment of all
charges levied against the depositor, and the return of the Water Utility’s
equipment.
Service Laterals
No water service lateral shall be laid through any trench having cinders,
rubbish, rock or gravel fill, or any other material which may cause injury to
or disintegration of the service lateral, unless adequate means of protection
are provided by sand filling or such other insulation as may be approved by the
Water Utility. Service laterals passing through curb or retaining walls shall
be adequately safeguarded by provision of a channel space or pipe casing not
less than twice the diameter of the service connection. The space between the
service lateral and the channel or pipe casing shall be filled and lightly
caulked with an oakum, mastic cement, or other resilient material and made
impervious to moisture.
In backfilling the pipe trench, the service lateral must be protected against
injury by carefully hand tamping the ground filling around the pipe. There
should be at least 6 inches of ground filling over the pipe, and it should be
free from hard lumps, rocks, stones, or other injurious material.
All water service laterals shall be of undiminished size from the street main
into the point of meter placement. Beyond the meter outlet valve, the piping
shall be sized and proportioned to provide, on all floors, at all times, an
equitable distribution of the water supply for the greatest probable number of
fixtures or appliances operating simultaneously.
Replacement and Repair of Service Laterals
The service lateral from the main to and through the curb stop will be
maintained and kept in repair and, when worn out, replaced at the expense of
the Water Utility. The property owner shall maintain the service lateral from
the curb stop to the point of use.
If an owner fails to repair a leaking or broken service lateral from the curb
to the point of metering or use within such time as may appear reasonable to
the Water Utility after notification has been served on the owner by the Water
Utility, the water will be shut off and will not be turned on again until the
repairs have been completed.
Abandonment of Service
If a property owner changes the use of a property currently receiving water
service such that water service will no longer be needed in the future, the
Water Utility may require the abandonment of the water service at the water
main. In such case, the property owner may be responsible for all removal and/
or repair costs, including the water main and the utility portion of the water
service lateral.
Charges for Water Wasted Due to Leaks
See Wis. Adm. Code § PSC 185.35.
Thawing Frozen Service Laterals
See Wis. Adm. Code § PSC 185.88.
Curb Stop Boxes
The curb stop box is the property of the Water Utility. The Water Utility is
responsible for its repair and maintenance. This includes maintaining, through
adjustment, the curb stop box at an appropriate grade level where no direct
action by the property owner or occupant has contributed to an elevation
problem. The property owner is responsible for protecting the curb stop box
from situations that could obstruct access to it or unduly expose it to harm.
The Water Utility shall not be liable for failure to locate the curb stop box
and shut off the water in case of a leak on the owner’s premises.
Installation of Meters
Meters will be owned, furnished, and installed by the Water Utility or a
utility-approved contractor and are not to be disconnected or tampered with by
the customer. All meters shall be so located that they shall be protected from
obstructions and permit ready access for reading, inspection, and servicing,
such location to be designated or approved by the Water Utility. All piping
within the building must be supplied by the owner. Where additional meters are
desired by the owner, the owner shall pay for all piping. Where applicable, see
Schedule Am-1 for rates.
Repairs to Meters
Meters will be repaired by the Water Utility, and the cost of such repairs
caused by ordinary wear and tear will be borne by the Water Utility.
Repair of any damage to a meter resulting from the carelessness of the owner of
the premises, owner’s agent, or tenant, or from the negligence of any one of
them to properly secure and protect same, including any damage that may result
from allowing a water meter to become frozen or to be damaged from the presence
of hot water or steam in the meter, shall be paid for by the customer or the
owner of the premises.
Service Piping for Meter Settings
Where the original service piping is installed for a new metered customer,
where existing service piping is changed for the customer’s convenience, or
where a new meter is installed for an existing unmetered customer, the owner of
the premises at his/her expense shall provide a suitable location and the
proper connections for the meter. The meter setting and associated plumbing
shall comply with the Water Utility’s standards. The Water Utility should be
consulted as to the type and size of the meter setting.
Turning on Water
The water may only be turned on for a customer by an authorized employee of the
Water Utility. Plumbers may turn the water on to test their work, but upon
completion must leave the water turned off.
Failure to Read Meters
Where the Water Utility is unable to read a meter, the fact will be plainly
indicated on the bill, and either an estimated bill will be computed or the
minimum charge applied. The difference shall be adjusted when the meter is
again read, that is, the bill for the succeeding billing period will be
computed with the gallons or cubic feet in each block of the rate schedule
doubled, and credit will be given on that bill for the amount of the bill paid
the preceding period. Only in unusual cases shall more than three consecutive
estimated or minimum bills be rendered.
If the meter is damaged (see Surreptitious Use of Water) or fails to operate,
the bill will be based on the average use during the past year, unless there is
some reason why the use is not normal. If the average use cannot be properly
determined, the bill will be estimated by some equitable method.
See Wis. Adm. Code § PSC 185.33.
Complaint Meter Tests
See Wis. Adm. Code § PSC 185.77.
Inspection of Premises
During reasonable hours, any officer or authorized employee of the Water
Utility shall have the right of access to the premises supplied with service
for the purpose of inspection or for the enforcement of the Water Utility’s
rules and regulations. Whenever appropriate, the Water Utility will make a
systematic inspection of all unmetered water taps for the purpose of checking
waste and unnecessary use of water.
See Wis. Stat. § 196.171.
Vacation of Premises
When premises are to be vacated, the Water Utility shall be notified, in
writing, at once, so that it may remove the meter and shut off the water supply
at the curb stop. The owner of the premises shall be liable for prosecution for
any damage to the Water Utility’s property. See “Abandonment of Service” in
Schedule X-l for further information.
Deposits for Residential Service
See Wis. Adm. Code § PSC 185.36.
Deposits for Nonresidential Service
See Wis. Adm. Code § PSC 185.361.
Deferred Payment Agreement

   (WATER UTILITY NAME)
Collection of Overdue Bills
An amount owed by the customer may be levied as a tax as provided in Wis.
Stats. § 66.0809.
Surreptitious Use of Water
When the Water Utility has reasonable evidence that a person is obtaining
water, in whole or in part, by means of devices or methods used to stop or
interfere with the proper metering of the Water Utility service being
delivered, the Water Utility reserves the right to estimate and present
immediately a bill for unmetered service as a result of such interference, and
such bill shall be payable subject to a 24-hour disconnection of service. If
the Water Utility disconnects the service for any such reason, the Water
Utility will reconnect the service upon the following conditions:
A.   The customer will be required to deposit with the Water Utility an amount
sufficient to guarantee the payment of the bills for Water Utility service.
B.   The customer will be required to pay the Water Utility for any and all
damages to Water Utility equipment resulting from such interference with the
metering.
C.   The customer must further agree to comply with reasonable requirements to
protect the Water Utility against further losses.
See Wis. Stat. §§ 98.26 and 943.20.
Repairs to Mains
The Water Utility reserves the right to shut off the water supply in the mains
temporarily to make repairs, alterations, or additions to the plant or system.
When the circumstances will permit, the Water Utility will give notification,
by newspaper publication or otherwise, of the discontinuance of the water
supply. No credit will be allowed to customers for such temporary suspension of
the water supply.
See Wis. Admin. Code § PSC 185.87.
Duty of Water Utility with Respect to Safety of the Public
It shall be the duty of the Water Utility to see that all open ditches for
water mains, hydrants, and service laterals are properly guarded to prevent
accident to any person or vehicle, and at night there shall be displayed proper
signal lighting to insure the safety of the public.
Handling Water Mains and Service Laterals in Excavation Trenches

§ 52.35 BASIS OF SEWER SERVICE CHARGE.
   (A)   Authority.  
      (1)   The village shall have the authority to establish and collect a
sewer service charge for the use of the wastewater treatment works maintained
and operated by the village.
      (2)   It shall be the policy of the village to obtain sufficient revenues
through a user charge system to pay for the costs of annual debt retirement,
operation and maintenance expenses, replacement account, administration costs
and any other related costs. The user charge system (UCS) shall assure that
each user of the wastewater treatment works pay an equitable share of all costs
necessary to operate the utility. These charges are to be reviewed annually and
all excess revenues shall be applied to the replacement account. The initial
user charge system shall be as set forth in this subchapter, which may then be
changed from time to time by the village, with the then current resolution to
be included in the appendix attached to the ordinance establishing this
subchapter, which is hereby adopted by reference as if set out in full herein.
   (B)   Classes of users.
      (1)   For the purpose of billing there shall be two classes of users:
         (a)   Industrial, being any industry that has wastewater strength in
excess of domestic; and
         (b)   Residential (this includes residential, commercial,
institutional, public authority and any industry that discharges domestic
strength wastewater).
      (2)   All users will pay at the residential rate plus any appropriate
surcharges.
   (C)   Usage. The service charge shall be based on water or wastewater meter
readings, when available. When such meter readings are unavailable, the service
charges will be a flat charge based on the estimate. This estimate shall be
12,000 gallons per quarter. Where the flat charge must be used, it will be paid
for the full quarter and shall not be prorated.
   (D)   Debt service charge. All or a portion of the charges incurred for
debts for capital improvements for the wastewater treatment works shall be paid
for by a debt service charge, which is a part of the total sewer service
charge. The amount of this charge will be reviewed when required and adopted by
resolution.
   (E)   Minimum charge. The minimum charge per connection shall be the
administration charge based upon meter size, plus the debt service charge based
upon meter size plus capital improvements cost based upon meter size. This
charge will be made regardless of the amount of use but credits the user a
minimum of 2,000 gallons and shall be adopted by resolution (this is referred
to as a standby charge under Wis. Stats. § 66.0821(4)(b)).
   (F)   Replacement fund charge (short-lived assets). This charge represents
the total yearly replacement cost necessary to cover the expenditures for
replacement and installation of equipment, accessories or appurtenances that
are necessary to maintain the capacity and performances during the service life
of the wastewater treatment works for which such works were designed and
constructed.
   (G)   Administration charge. All or a portion of the costs related to the
cost of billing, collection, administration of accounts, insurance, outside
services and administration of the Sewer Utility.
   (H)   Operation and maintenance charge. Operation and maintenance charge
shall be the sum of all non-fixed annual costs, such as but not limited to:
labor, electrical power, testing, supplies, repairs, maintenance, chemicals,
fees and the like.
   (I)   Capital improvements charge. Capital improvements charge shall be the
sum of all annual costs spent on construction projects that are not financed
through the debt service charge.
   (J)   Surcharge. Surcharge is an additional fee charged per pound of BOD, SS
and phosphorus discharged in excess of domestic strength.
   (K)   Treatment charge. Treatment charge is the sum of operation and
maintenance costs, plus replacement fund costs expressed as a charge per 1,000
gallons of use.
   (L)   User charge. The user charge for all users discharging domestic
wastewater shall be based on a minimum charge per meter size, plus the
treatment charge according to the volume used. Those discharging wastewater in
excess of domestic strength shall also pay the surcharges. The amount of this
charge will be reviewed annually and adopted by resolution.
   (M)   Billing periods. The total sewer service charge shall be billed
quarterly. The due date shall be as set forth on the quarterly bill.
   (N)   Late penalties. Charges levied in accordance with this section shall
be a debt due to the village and shall be a lien upon the property. If this
debt is not paid within 30 days after it is due and payable, it shall be deemed
delinquent, and a late payment charge is added. The late payment charge is
equal to 1.5% per month. This debt may then be recovered by civil action in the
name of the village against the property owner, the person or both. If
delinquent payments are not received by November 1 of the calendar year, a 10%
charge shall be added to delinquent bills. Thereafter, if payment is not
received prior to November 15, the delinquent bill will be forwarded to the
county for placement on the succeeding tax roll.
   (O)   Failure to pay, removal or closure of connection, restoration of
service.
      (1)   In the event of failure to pay sewer service charges after they
become delinquent, the village shall have the right to remove or close sewer
connections and enter upon the property for accomplishing such purposes.
      (2)   The expense of such removal or closing, as well as the expense of
restoring service, shall likewise be a debt to the village and a tax lien upon
the property, and may be recovered by a civil action in the name of the village
against the property owner, the person or both.
      (3)   Sewer service shall not be restored until all charges, including
the expense of removal, closing and restoration shall have been paid.
      (4)   Change of ownership or occupancy of premises found delinquent shall
not be cause for reducing or eliminating these penalties.

of the withholding of building permits, imposition of forfeitures and
injunctive action. Forfeitures shall be not less than $25 nor more than $1,000
for each day of noncompliance.
(Prior Code, Ch. 26 § 1.7)
   (C)   Any person who violates any provision of §§
151.20 through
151.37 shall be subject to forfeiture as prescribed in §
10.99. Each day of violation shall constitute a separate offense. In any such
action, the fact that a permit was issued shall not constitute a defense, nor
shall any error, oversight or dereliction of duty on the part of the Village
Clerk constitute a defense.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wis. Stats. §§
61.35 and 62.23, for villages and cities; Wis. Stats. §§ 59.69, 59.692 and
59.694 for counties; and the requirements in Wis. Stats. § 87.30.
(Prior Code, Ch. 19 § 1.1) (Ord. passed 7-8-2009)
§ 153.002 FINDING OF FACT.
   Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this
municipality would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general
welfare and tax base.
(Prior Code, Ch. 19 § 1.2) (Ord. passed 7-8-2009)
§ 153.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   This chapter is intended to regulate floodplain development to:
   (A)   Protect life, health and property;
   (B)   Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects;
   (C)   Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the
taxpayers;
   (D)   Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain;
   (F)   Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the
floodplain;
   (G)   Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers;
   (H)   Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage
and result in conflicts between property owners; and
   (I)   Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable
alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain.
(Prior Code, Ch. 19 § 1.3) (Ord. passed 7-8-2009)
§ 153.004 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the “Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for Gilman,
Wisconsin”.
(Prior Code, Ch. 19 § 1.4) (Ord. passed 7-8-2009)
GENERAL REGULATIONS
§ 153.015 AREAS TO BE REGULATED.
   This chapter regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood
or base flood. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the
Flood Insurance Study. Regional flood elevations may be derived from other
studies. Areas covered by the base flood are identified as A Zones on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map.
(Prior Code, Ch. 19 § 1.5(1)) (Ord. passed 7-8-2009)
§ 153.016 OFFICIAL MAPS AND REVISIONS.
   (A)   The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as
floodplains or A Zones on the maps listed below and the revisions in the
Village Floodplain Appendix, which is hereby adopted by reference as if set out
in full herein. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be
reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA before it is effective. No changes to
regional flood elevations (RFEs) on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until
approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the
Clerk in the village. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most
restrictive information shall apply.
   (B)   Official maps are based on the FIS.
      (1)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel number 550433 001 C, dated
January 5, 1989; with corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) dated January 5, 2009; and
      (2)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM), panel number 550433 001 C; dated
March 26, 1982; approved by the DNR and FEMA.
(Prior Code, Ch. 19 § 1.5(2)) (Ord. passed 7-8-2009)
§ 153.017 ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS.
   The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows.
   (A)   The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and
those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the
regional floodwaters.
   (B)   The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion of the floodplain
between the regional flood limits and the floodway.
   (C)   The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that have been or
may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood.
(Prior Code, Ch. 19 § 1.5(3)) (Ord. passed 7-8-2009)
§ 153.018 LOCATING FLOODPLAIN BOUNDARIES.
   (A)   Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map
and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in divisions
(B)(1) or (B)(2) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be
amended according to §
153.082. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile
elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is
required. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual
pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary
was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this
section. Disputes between the Zoning Administrator and an applicant over the
district boundary line shall be settled according to §
153.078(C) and the criteria in divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) below.
   (B)   (1)   If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile
elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood
elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
      (2)   Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary
shall be determined by the map scale, visual on-site inspection and any
information provided by the Department.
   (C)   Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood
elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must also approve any map amendment pursuant to §
153.082.
(Prior Code, Ch. 19 § 1.5(4)) (Ord. passed 7-8-2009)
§ 153.019 REMOVAL OF LANDS FROM FLOODPLAIN.
   (A)   Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be grounds
for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet
above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land
outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to §
153.082.
   (B)   This procedure does not remove the requirements for the mandatory
purchase of flood insurance. The property owner must contact FEMA to request a
letter of map change (LOMC).
(Prior Code, Ch. 19 § 1.5(5)) (Ord. passed 7-8-2009)
§ 153.020 COMPLIANCE.
   Any development or use within the areas regulated by this chapter shall be
in compliance with the terms of this chapter, and other applicable local, state
and federal regulations.
(Prior Code, Ch. 19 § 1.5(6)) (Ord. passed 7-8-2009)
§ 153.021 MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE AGENCIES REGULATED.
   Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns and
counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary
permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13)
applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state
highways and bridges by the State Department of Transportation is exempt when
Wis. Stats. § 30.2022 applies.
(Prior Code, Ch. 19 § 1.5(7)) (Ord. passed 7-8-2009)
§ 153.022 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   (A)   This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. §§ 59.69, 59.692 or 59.694 for counties;
Wis. Stats. § 62.23 for cities; Wis. Stats. § 61.35 for villages; or Wis.
Stats. § 87.30, which relate to floodplains. If another ordinance is more
restrictive than this chapter, that ordinance shall continue in full force and
effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
   (B)   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this chapter imposes
greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
(Prior Code, Ch. 19 § 1.5(8)) (Ord. passed 7-8-2009)
§ 153.023 INTERPRETATION.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter are
the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and
are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin
Statutes. If a provision of this chapter, required by Wis. Adm. Code Chapter NR
116, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards
in effect on the date of the adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date
of the most recent text amendment to this chapter.
(Prior Code, Ch. 19 § 1.5(9)) (Ord. passed 7-8-2009)
§ 153.024 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The flood protection standards in this chapter are based on engineering
experience and scientific research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height
may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply
or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be
free from flooding and flood damages. Nor does this chapter create liability on
the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this
chapter.
(Prior Code, Ch. 19 § 1.5(10)) (Ord. passed 7-8-2009)
§ 153.025 ANNEXED AREAS FOR CITIES AND VILLAGES.
   The county floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation
shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all
annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which
meets the requirements of Wis. Adm. Code Chapter NR 116 and the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the
municipality’s official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are
incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are
on file in the office of the Municipal Zoning Administrator. All plats or maps
of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the location of the
floodway.
(Prior Code, Ch. 19 § 1.5(12)) (Ord. passed 7-8-2009)
§ 153.026 GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed
building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall be designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with materials resistant to
flood damage; be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood
damages; and be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and
air conditioning equipment and other service facilities designed and/or located
so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components
during conditions of flooding. Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance
with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured
home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any
development that meets the subdivision definition of this chapter.
(Prior Code, Ch. 19 § 1.5(13)) (Ord. passed 7-8-2009)
GENERAL STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO ALL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS

§ 153.044 NONCONFORMING USES GENERALLY.
   (A)   Applicability. If these standards conform with Wis. Stats. § 59.69(10)
for counties or Wis. Stats. § 62.23(7)(h) for cities and villages, they shall
apply to all modifications or additions to any nonconforming use or structure
and to the use of any structure or premises which was lawful before the passage
of this chapter or any amendment thereto.
   (B)   Conditions. The existing lawful use of a structure or its accessory
use which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter may continue
subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   (a)   No modifications or additions to a nonconforming use or
structure shall be permitted unless they comply with this chapter. The words
MODIFICATION and ADDITION include but are not limited to any alteration,
addition, modification, structural repair, rebuilding or replacement of any

these include painting, decorating, paneling and the replacement of doors,
windows and other nonstructural components and the maintenance, repair or
replacement of existing private sewage or water supply systems or connections
to public utilities. Ordinary maintenance repairs do not include any costs
associated with the repair of a damaged structure.
         (b)   The construction of a deck that does not exceed 200 square feet
and that is adjacent to the exterior wall of a principal structure is not an
extension, modification or addition. The roof of the structure may extend over
a portion of the deck in order to provide safe ingress and egress to the
principal structure.
      (2)   If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming structure is
discontinued for 12 consecutive months, it is no longer permitted and any
future use of the property, and any structure or building thereon shall conform
to the applicable requirements of this chapter;
      (3)   The municipality shall keep a record which lists all nonconforming
uses and nonconforming structures, their present equalized assessed value, the
cost of all modifications or additions which have been permitted, and the
percentage of the structure’s total current value those modifications
represent;
      (4)   No modification or addition to any nonconforming structure or any
structure with a nonconforming use, which over the life of the structure would

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
§ 154.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wis. Stats. §§
61.35 and 61.351 for villages or Wis. Stats. §§ 62.23 and 62.231 for cities,
and Wis. Stats. §§ 59.692, 87.30 and 281.91.
(Prior Code, Ch. 20 § 1.1) (Ord. 84, passed 9-9-1987; Ord. passed 3-11-1992)
§ 154.02 FINDING OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and pollution of the
navigable waters of the municipality would adversely affect the public health,
safety, convenience and general welfare and impair the tax base.
   (B)   The Legislature of Wisconsin has delegated responsibility to all
municipalities to:
      (1)   Promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare;
      (2)   Maintain the storm and flood water storage capacity of wetlands;
      (3)   Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which
filter or store sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that
would otherwise drain into navigable waters;
      (4)   Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life and
wildlife by preserving wetlands and other aquatic habitat;
      (5)   Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area;
and
      (6)   Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal
of natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland-wetland excavation,
filling and other earth moving activities.
(Prior Code, Ch. 20 § 1.2) (Ord. 84, passed 9-9-1987; Ord. passed 3-11-1992)
GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.15 COMPLIANCE.
   The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within shoreland area of
the municipality shall be in full compliance with the terms of this chapter and
other applicable local, state or federal regulations. (However, see §
154.39 for the standards applicable to nonconforming uses.) All permitted
development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless otherwise
expressly excluded by a provision of this chapter.
(Prior Code, Ch. 20 § 2.1) (Ord. 84, passed 9-9-1987; Ord. passed 3-11-1992)
§ 154.16 MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE AGENCIES REGULATED.
   Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns and
counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary
permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13)
applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state
highways and bridges by the State Department of Transportation are exempt when
Wis. Stats. § 30.12 applies.

   (A)   This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. §§ 61.35, 62.23 or 87.30, which relate to
floodplains and shoreland-wetlands, except that where another municipal zoning
ordinance is more restrictive than this chapter, that ordinance shall continue
in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not
otherwise.
   (B)   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this chapter
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
(Prior Code, Ch. 20 § 2.3) (Ord. 84, passed 9-9-1987; Ord. passed 3-11-1992)
§ 154.18 INTERPRETATION.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter
shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in
favor of the municipality and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any
other powers granted by the state statutes. Where a provision of this chapter
is required by a standard in Wis. Adm. Code Chapter NR 117, and where the
ordinance provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of
the Chapter NR 117 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this
chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this
chapter.

or words used herein shall be interpreted as follows. Words used in the present
tense include the future; words in the singular number include the plural
number; words in the plural number include the singular number. The word
“shall” is mandatory, not permissive. All distances, unless otherwise
specified, shall be measured horizontally.
   (B)   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      ACCESSORY STRUCTURE OR USE. A detached subordinate structure or a use
which is clearly incidental to, and customarily found in connection with, the
principal structure or use to which it is related and which is located on the
same lot as that of the principal structure or use.
      BOATHOUSE. As defined in Wis. Stats. § 30.121, means a permanent
structure used for the storage of watercraft and associated materials and
includes all structures which are totally enclosed, have roofs or walls or any
combination of structural parts.

Stats. Chapter 985, in a newspaper of circulation in the affected area.
Publication is required on two consecutive weeks, the last at least seven days
prior to the hearing.
      CONDITIONAL, USE. A use which is permitted by this chapter, provided that
certain conditions specified in this chapter are met and that a permit is
granted by the Board of Appeals or, where appropriate, the planning agency
designated by the municipal governing body.
      DEPARTMENT. The State Department of Natural Resources.
      DEVELOPMENT. Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to the construction of buildings, structures or
accessory structures; the construction of additions or substantial alterations

Stats. §§ 59.692 and 281.91, notwithstanding any other provision of law or
administrative rule promulgated thereunder, shoreland ordinances required under
Wis. Stats.§ 61.351 and Wis. Adm. Code Chapter NR 117, do not apply to lands
adjacent to farm drainage ditches if:

   (A)   The Shoreland-Wetland Zoning District includes all wetlands in the
municipality are shown on the final Wetland Inventory Map that has been adopted
and made a part of this chapter and which are:
      (1)   Within 1,000 feet of the ordinary highwater mark of navigable
lakes, ponds or flowages. Lakes, ponds or flowages in the municipality shall be
presumed to be navigable if they are shown on the United States Geological
Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated
by reference and made a part of this chapter.
      (2)   Within 300 feet of the ordinary highwater mark of navigable rivers
or streams, or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is
greater. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be navigable if they are
designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the United States
Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been
incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter. Floodplain zoning
maps adopted in §
154.35 shall be used to determine the extent of floodplain areas.
   (B)   Determinations of navigability and ordinary highwater mark location
shall initially be made by the Zoning Administrator. When questions arise, the
Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the
Department for a final determination of navigability or ordinary highwater
mark.
   (C)   When an apparent discrepancy exists between the Shoreland-Wetland
District boundary shown on the official zoning maps and actual field conditions
at the time the maps were adopted, the zoning administrator shall contact the
appropriate district office of the Department to determine if the Shoreland-
Wetland District boundary, as mapped, is in error. If Department staff concur
with the Zoning Administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as
a wetland, the Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to immediately
grant or deny a zoning permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to
the correct zoning district. In order to correct wetland mapping errors shown
on the official shoreland-wetland zoning maps, the Zoning Administrator shall
be responsible for initiating a map amendment within a reasonable period.

(Prior Code, § 17.03)
§ 155.04 PROCEDURE FOR SUBDIVIDING.
   In planning and developing a subdivision, the subdivider or his or her agent
shall in every case pursue the following course unless excused by the Village
Board.
   (A)   Pre-application procedure. Previous to the filing of an application
for preliminary plat, the subdivider may consult the Village Board and its
staff for advice and assistance. This step does not require formal application,
fee or filing of a plat, but is intended to informally inform the subdivider of
the objectives of these regulations and the Master Plan and Official Map and to
informally reach mutual conclusions regarding the general program and
objectives of the development.
      (1)   The subdivider shall cause to be prepared a preliminary plat and
supplementary materials by a state registered land surveyor and shall file with
the Village Clerk, a written application for conditional approval of said plat,
accompanied by five blueline prints, or other acceptable reproductions, at
least ten days prior to the meeting of the Village Board at which action is
desired.
      (2)   The preliminary plat shall cover the entire area owned by the
subdivider even though only a small portion is proposed for development at the
time. The Village Board may waive this requirement where it is unnecessary to
fulfill the purpose of this chapter and undue hardship would result from strict
application thereof.
      (3)   Following review of the preliminary plat and other material
submitted for conformity with all ordinances, administrative rules and
regulations, negotiations with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and
the kind and extent of public improvements which will be required, the Village
Board shall within 90 days of the filing of the plat, in writing, approve,
approve conditionally or reject the plat. Such time may be extended by
agreement with the subdivider.
      (4)   The action of the Village Board shall be noted on three copies of
the preliminary plat, one copy to be returned to the subdivider with the data
and action endorsed thereon and, if approved conditionally or rejected, the
conditions or reasons thereof.
      (5)   Conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute
approval of the final plat; rather, it shall be deemed an expression of
approval or conditional approval of the layout submitted as a guide to the
preparation of the final plat which will be subject to further consideration of
the Village Board.
   (B)   Final plat procedure.
      (1)   The final plat, a written application for approval, and such copies
thereof as shall be required by the Village Board shall be submitted to the
Village Clerk within six months of approval of the preliminary plat and at
least seven days prior to the meeting of the Village Board at which action is
desired. The Village Board, may, however, waive compliance within the six
months’ time limit.
      (2)   The subdivider shall not submit the final plat until the approval
of the state as required by Wis. Stats. § 236.12, or of such other officer or
division of the state as shall from time to time be vested with the authority
to review and approve plats, shall have been first obtained. The Village Board
shall approve or reject the final plat within 60 days of its submission to the
Village Clerk, unless the time is extended by agreement with the subdivider.
Reasons for rejection shall be forwarded to the subdivider in writing.
      (3)   The final plat may constitute only that portion of the approved
preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to record at that time.
      (4)   If the original of the final plat has been filed with another
approving authority, the subdivider may file a true copy in lieu of the
original. However, before approval of the Village Board shall be inscribed on
the original of the final plat, the surveyor or the subdivider shall certify
the respects in which the original of the plat differs from the true copy and
all modifications must first be approved.
(Prior Code, § 17.04)
§ 155.05 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Monuments. The subdivision shall be monumented in accordance with the
requirements of Wis. Stats. § 236.15 and as may be required by the Village
Board. The Village Board may waive the placing of monuments for a reasonable
time on condition that the subdivider executes a surety bond to ensure placing
of such monuments. Required block corners shall be fully encased with minimum
of four inches of concrete and shall be set so that the top of the monument
shall be at the final sidewalk elevation. If the topography is such that
extensive grading is required at the block corners, the subdivider may, with
permission of the Village Board, place the monuments after the grading is
completed.
   (B)   Improvements. Unless alternative arrangements are made with the
village and such arrangements are approved by resolution of the Village Board,
before final approval of any residential plat located within the corporate
limits of the village, the subdivider shall install street and utility
improvements as hereinafter provided.
      (1)   Water. The subdivider shall have filed, prior to approval of the
final plat, a petition with the Village Clerk petitioning the village for
installation of water mains in the plat.
      (2)   Sanitary sewer. The subdivider shall have filed prior to approval
of the final plat a petition with the Village Clerk petitioning the village for
installation of sewers in the plat. If public sewer facilities are not
available, lot sizes shall be such that effective private disposal systems can
be provided on the individual premises, and shall be determined on the basis of
recommendations of the Village Board and the state. Approval of the county must
also be submitted.
      (3)   Street grading. The subdivider shall furnish drawings which
indicate the existing and proposed grades of streets shown on the plat. After
review and approval of the proposed grades by the Village Board, the subdivider
shall grade or cause to be graded the full width of the right-of-way of the
streets proposed to be dedicated. The bed for the roadways in the street right-
of-way shall be graded to subgrade. The subsoil condition shall be of adequate
bearing value for street construction or shall be undercut and backfilled with
select materials.
      (4)   Sidewalk grades. Sidewalk grades, whether sidewalks are
subsequently installed or not, shall be proposed and approved by the Village
Board at the same time as the street grades are proposed and approved.
      (5)   Sodding or mat-type seeding. Where lot grades exceed 10%, sodding
or mat-type seeding shall be required.
   (C)   Payments for improvements. Unless alternative arrangements are made
with the village and such arrangements are approved by resolution of the
Village Board, when filing a petition with the Village Clerk for the above-
mentioned water main, sanitary sewer and street improvements, the subdivider
shall accompany said petitions with a certified or cashier’s check for the
following items:
      (1)   The estimated cost, prepared by the Village Clerk, for construction
of water mains;
      (2)   The estimated cost, prepared by the Village Clerk, for construction
of sanitary sewer;
      (3)   The estimated cost, prepared by the Village Clerk, for providing
six-inch crushed stone base for the street; and
      (4)   Public sites and open spaces contributions shall be provided as
hereinafter specified in these regulations.
   (D)   Payments for improvements by contract. The payment provisions for the
installation of improvements, hereinabove set forth, shall not preclude the
village from entering into a contract with a subdivider or land developer for
construction of the required improvements at his or her own expense, provided
that the work is done pursuant to the requirements of these regulations and
under the supervision of the Village Board by contractor approved by the
village, and upon the filing with the Village Clerk of a performance bond
executed by the subdivider or his or her contractors and a corporate surety
licensed to do business in this state.
(Prior Code, § 17.05)
§ 155.06 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Streets and alleys; general requirements. The streets shall be
designed and located in relation to existing and proposed streets, to the
topography, to economical utility service, to such natural features as streams
and tree growth to public convenience and safety, and to the proposed use of
the land to be served by such streets. The arrangements, width grade and
locations of all streets shall conform to the Official Map and Master Plan, and
where applicable, the plans of any political subdivision superseding the
authority of the village.
   (B)   Arrangement.
      (1)   Major streets and highways. Major streets and highways shall be
properly integrated with the existing and proposed system of major streets and
highways and insofar as practicable shall be continuous and in alignment with
existing planned or platted streets with which they are to connect.
      (2)   Collector streets. Collector streets shall be properly related to
the mass transit system, to special traffic generating from facilities such as
schools, churches and shopping centers, to population concentrations and to
major streets into which they feed.
      (3)   Minor streets. Minor streets shall be designed to conform to the
topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit the design of
efficient drainage and sewer system, and to require the minimum amount of
street necessary to provide convenient safe access to abutting property.
      (4)   Treatment of railroad right-of-way or limited-access highways.
Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited-
access highway right-of-way, the Village Board may require a street
approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land as for park purposes,
in residential districts or for commercial or industrial purposes in other
districts. Location of minor streets immediately adjacent and parallel to
railroad rights-of-way shall be avoided.
      (5)   Protection of major streets and highways where a subdivision
borders on or contains a major street or highway. The Village Board may require
that marginal access streets be provided, or that the backs of lots (reversed
frontage) be provided with screen planting contained in a non-access
reservation along the real property line.
   (C)   Alleys. Alleys shall be provided in commercial or industrial districts
for off-street loading and service access unless otherwise required by the
Village Board but shall not be approved in residential districts. No dead-end
alleys shall be approved; nor shall any alley have its point of connection on a
major thoroughfare. The width of an alley shall not be less than 30 feet.
   (D)   Intersections.
      (1)   Streets shall intersect each other as nearly as possible at right
angles, as good design and topography permit.
      (2)   Not more than two streets shall intersect at one point unless
approved by the Village Board.
      (3)   Property lines at street intersections shall not be rounded except
in industrial areas or on major or collector streets when required by the
Village Board.
      (4)   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
avoided. Where streets intersect major streets, their alignment shall be
continuous.
   (E)   Street width. The right-of-way and roadway of all streets shall be the
width specified on the Official Map or Master Plan. If no width is specified
thereon, they shall be not less than the width specified below, nor more than
the maximum grade also specified below:
 
Type of Street     R.O.W. Width Road Width Max. Grade
Major and highways 120          36x2       4%
Collector          80           44         6%
Minor              66           40         8%
Alleys             30           24         -
 
   (F)   Vertical curves. All changes in street grades shall be connected by
vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent in feet to 15 times the
algebraic difference in the rates of grade for arterial and collector streets,
and one-half this minimum for local streets.
   (G)   Radii of curvature. When a continuous street centerline deflects at
any one point more than five degrees, a circular curve shall be introduced
having a radius of curvature on said centerline of not less than the following:
 
Major streets     300 feet
Collector streets 200 feet
Minor streets     100 feet
 
   (H)   Tangents. A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between
reverse curves on arterial and collector streets. On all streets at least 100
feet of tangent shall be provided between the curve and any intersection.
   (I)   Cul-de-sac or dead-end streets. Streets designed to have one end
permanently closed shall not exceed 500 feet in length and shall terminate with
a turnaround of not less than 120 feet in diameter of right-of-way and a
roadway turnaround of 94 feet in diameter.
   (J)   Half-streets. Where an existing half street is adjacent to the tract
bring subdivided, the other half of the street shall be dedicated by the
subdivider.
   (K)   Reverse strip. There shall be no reverse strips controlling access to
streets except where control of such strips is definitely place in the village
under conditions approved by the Village Board.
      (1)   Cluster development. The standards application to street right-of-
way and roadway widths may be waived by consent of the Village Board for
special situations such as cluster developments, where other well-planned
interior street systems are provided.
      (2)   Easements.
         (a)   Easements of widths deemed adequate by the Village Board for the
intended purpose across lots or on rear or side lot lines shall be provided
where necessary for the construction and maintenance of telephone, electric,

compatibility with other permitted uses and with the residential character of
the neighborhood, plus a clearly secondary or incidental status in relation to
the residential use of the main building as the criteria for determining
whether a proposed accessory use qualifies as a home occupation.
   (B)   Standards. Home occupations shall be subject to the following
standards.
      (1)   The occupation or profession shall be carried on wholly within the
principal building or other structure accessory thereto, and it shall utilize
no more than 50% of the gross floor area of the building.
      (2)   The home occupation is to be conducted only by members of the
family residing in the dwelling unit, plus no more than six nonresident
assistants or employees employed on the premises at any one time. Persons
engaged in building trades, similar fields and other activities using their
dwelling units or residential premises as an office for business activities
carried on off the premises, may have more employees than the limitations set
forth in this division (B)(2) if they are not employed on the premises.
      (3)   The home occupation shall be incidental and subordinate to its use
for residential purposes.
      (4)   In no way shall the appearance of the structure be altered or the
occupation within the residence be conducted in a manner which would cause the
premises to differ from its residential character either by the use of
materials, construction and lighting.
      (5)   No home occupation shall create noise, dust, vibration, smell,
smoke, glare, electrical interference, fire hazard or any other hazard of
nuisance beyond what normally occurs in the applicable zoning district.
      (6)   There shall not be outside storage of any kind related to the home
occupation.
      (7)   The home occupation shall not involve the use of commercial
vehicles, other than those owned by the applicant for delivery of products or
materials to and from the premises. This shall not be interpreted to include
delivery and/or pickup services such as United Parcel Service, Federal Express
and the like, in the conduct of their normal operations.
      (8)   Activities which involve the manufacture, utilization, processing
or storage of chemicals or inflammable and explosive material shall not be
permitted.
   (C)   Permitted home occupations. Permitted home occupations include but are
not necessarily limited to the following:
      (1)   Artists or sculptors;
      (2)   Authors or composers;
      (3)   Home crafts such as model making, rug weaving and cabinet making;
      (4)   Office facility of a minister, rabbi or priest;

surveyor, landscape architect, insurance agent or real estate agent;
      (6)   Private tutoring;
      (7)   Musical instruction limited to two pupils at a time; and
      (8)   Dressmaking.
   (D)   Home occupations not permitted. The following uses, by the nature of
the investment or operation, have a pronounced tendency once started to rapidly
increase beyond the limits permitted for home occupations and thereby impair
the use and value of a residentially zoned area for residence purposes.
Therefore, home occupations not permitted include but are not necessarily
limited to:
      (1)   Barber shops and beauty salons;
      (2)   Antique shops;
      (3)   Stables and kennels;
      (4)   Medical offices, including but not necessarily limited to
physicians, surgeons, dentists, chiropractors or optometrists for the general
practice of the profession, except for consultation or emergency treatment;
      (5)   Automobile repair or paint shops; and
      (6)   Restaurants and bakeries.
   (E)   Conditional use. Any proposed home occupation that is neither
specifically permitted by division (C) above nor specifically prohibited by
division (D) above shall be considered a conditional use and be granted or
denied by the Village Board upon consideration of those standards contained in
division (B) above and in accordance with the procedures as required in §
157.133.

as may be required by the Planning Committee to facilitate the determination.
      (2)   Investigation. The Planning Committee shall make or have made such
investigations as it deems necessary in order to compare the nature and
characteristics of the proposed use with those of the uses specifically listed
in this chapter and to determine its classification.
      (3)   Public hearing. The Planning Committee shall fix a reasonable time
and place for a public hearing following the receipt of an application for the
determination of a classification of an unlisted use, publish a Class 2 notice
thereof and shall give due notice to the parties in interest and the Zoning
Administrator.
      (4)   Determination. The determination of the Planning Committee shall be
rendered in writing within 40 days from the date of the public hearing and

manner which will least interfere with traffic movement.
      (3)   Computing requirements. In computing the number of spaces required,
the following rules shall govern:
         (a)   Floor space shall mean the gross floor area of the specific use.
See §
157.010; and
         (b)   Provision of parking stalls, shared jointly by several persons
in the same block or in the same vicinity is permissible, in which case the
number of stalls required shall be the sum total of the individual
requirements, provided that where it is found by the Planning Committee, upon
application thereto, that the parking demand generated by the different uses
included in any joint arrangement to provide parking stalls required herein
occurs at distinctly different times, as in the case of a theater generating
demand for parking after normal daytime business hours and a store generating
demand for parking during such daytime hours, and in similar cases, the
Planning Committee may reduce the total number of parking stalls to be jointly
provided.
      (4)   Location of parking facilities. All parking spaces required herein
shall be located on the same lot with the building or use served, except that
where the number of spaces are provided collectively or used jointly by two or
more buildings or establishments, the required spaces may be located not to
exceed 300 feet from any building served.
      (5)   Lighting. Lights provided in any parking area shall be hooded or
beamed so as not to create undesirable glare or illumination on adjacent
residential property.
      (6)   Surfacing. Any off-street parking area, other than that provided
for single- and two-family dwelling units, having a capacity for more than four
vehicles shall be concrete, blacktop or gravel.

§ 157.062 GWP GROUNDWATER PROTECTION OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose. The residents of the village depend exclusively on
groundwater for a safe drinking water supply. Certain land use practices and
activities can seriously threaten or degrade groundwater quality. The purpose
of this section is to establish a groundwater protection overlay district to
institute land use regulations and restrictions within a defined area which
contributes water directly to the municipal water supply providing protection
for the aquifer and municipal water supply of the village and promoting the
public health, safety and general welfare of village residents.
   (B)   Authority. Statutory authority of the village to enact these
regulations was established by the Wisconsin Legislature in 1983, Wisconsin Act
410 (effective May 11,1984), which specifically added groundwater protection,
in Wis. Stats. §§ 59.97(1) (which has since been renumbered as § 59.69(1)) and
62.23(7)(c), to the statutory authorization for county and municipal planning
and zoning to protect the public health, safety and welfare. In addition, Wis.
Stats. § 61.35, the village has the authority to enact this section, effective
in the incorporated areas of the village, to encourage the protection of
groundwater resources.
   (C)   Application. The regulations specified in this Wellhead Protection
section shall apply within the area surrounding each municipal water supply
well that has been designated as a "wellhead protection area" by the village in
the most recent and up-to-date wellhead protection plan, and are in addition to
the requirements in the underlying zoning district, if any. If there is a
conflict between this chapter and the zoning ordinance, the more restrictive
provision shall apply.
   (D)   (1)   GWP Groundwater Protection Overlay District boundaries. The
location and boundaries of the zoning districts established by this chapter are
set forth in the village’s most recent and up-to-date wellhead protection plan
on the map titled "Wellhead Protection Area" (on file in the village office)
incorporated herein and hereby made a part of this section. Said figures,
together with everything shown thereon and all amendments thereto, shall be as
much a part of this chapter as though fully set forth and described herein.
This section thus promotes public health, safety, and welfare. The Groundwater
Protection Overlay District is intended to protect the groundwater recharge
area for the water supply from contamination.
      (2)   Note: Wellhead protection areas are derived from hydrologic studies
and are based on the area surrounding a well where groundwater takes five years
or less to travel from the land surface to the pumping well.

§ 157.096 FINDINGS.
   No variance to the provisions of this chapter shall be granted by the Board
of Appeals unless it finds beyond a reasonable doubt that all the following
facts and conditions exist and so indicates in the minutes of its proceedings:
   (A)   Preservation of intent. No variance shall be granted that is not
consistent with the purpose and intent of the regulations for the district in
which the development is located. No variance shall have the effect of
permitting a use in any district that is not a stated permitted use, accessory
use or conditional use in that particular district;
   (B)   Exceptional circumstances. There must be exceptional, extraordinary or
unusual circumstances or conditions applying to the lot or parcel, structure,
use or intended use that do not apply generally to other properties or uses in
the same district and the granting of the variance would not be of so general
or recurrent nature as to suggest that this chapter should be changed;
   (C)   Economic hardship and self-imposed hardship not grounds for variance.
No variance shall be granted solely on the basis of economic gain or loss.
Self-imposed hardships shall not be considered as grounds for the granting of a
variance;
   (D)   Preservation of property rights. Such variance is necessary for the
preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights of subject property
which are the same or similar to property rights possessed by other properties
in the same district and same vicinity; and
   (E)   Absence of detriment. The variance will not create substantial
detriment to adjacent property and will not materially impair or be contrary to
the purpose and spirit of this chapter or the public interest.

Board of Appeals shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision
or determination of any such administrative official or to decide in favor of
the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this
chapter or to affect any variation therefrom.
   (E)   Form of decision. The final disposition of an appeal or requested
variance shall be in the form of a written decision or order stated in the
minutes. Such decision shall state the reasons for the Board’s determination
and its findings of fact and shall either affirm, reverse, vary or modify the
order, requirement, decision or determination appealed, in whole or in part,
dismiss the appeal or grant or deny the application for a variance.
   (F)   Conditions. The Board of Appeals may impose such requirements and
conditions with respect to location, construction, maintenance and operation,

(Prior Code, § 22.25(3)) (Ord. passed - -2011; Ord. 2023-02, passed 7-12-2023)
§ 157.133 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   (A)   Purpose. The formulation and enactment of a comprehensive zoning
ordinance is based on the division of the entire village into districts in each
of which are permitted specified uses that are mutually compatible.
      (1)   In addition to such permitted compatible uses, however, it is
recognized that there are other uses which may be necessary or desirable to
allow in a given district, but which because of their potential influence upon
neighboring uses or public facilities, need to be carefully regulated with
respect to location or operation for the protection of the community. Such uses
are classified in this chapter as conditional uses.
      (2)   In some cases, traditionally more restrictive uses such as single-
family dwellings are only allowed in less restrictive districts such as Light
Industrial. While there may be merit in segregating such uses because of
incompatibility with the less restrictive use, the size of the village and
necessity to preserve the tax basis may be considered in determining that such
more restrictive use shall be permitted as a conditional use.
      (3)   Conditional uses may but are not required to be permitted in the
district in which listed upon petition for such grant to the Village Board, and
subject to the recommendation of the Planning Committee, approval of the Board
and to such other conditions as hereinafter designated.
   (B)   Application for conditional use permit. A request for conditional use
grant shall be submitted in writing to the Village Clerk by the person
requesting such action on forms furnished by the Village Clerk.

   (F)   Standards for conditional use permit approval. The Planning Committee
and Village Board shall apply the following general standards when reviewing,
recommending and approving or disapproving a conditional use permit.
      (1)   No grant of a conditional use shall violate the spirit or intent of
this chapter.
      (2)   No conditional use shall be allowed which could be contrary to the
public health, safety or general welfare, or which would be substantially
adverse to property value in the neighborhood affected.
      (3)   No use shall be permitted by conditional use permit that would
constitute a nuisance by reason of noise, dust, smoke, odor or other similar
factors.
      (4)   The conditional use will not be injurious to the use, value and
enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for purposes already
permitted.
      (5)   The conditional use will not, in any way, impede or diminish the
normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property or
the district.
      (6)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and other necessary
facilities have been or are being provided.
      (7)   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide sufficient
off-street parking and loading space to serve the proposed use.
   (G)   Authority to impose conditions.  The Planning Committee and the
Village Board may make the granting of an application for a conditional use
permit contingent upon such express conditions as it considers necessary to
further the aims of this chapter and to achieve the standards of division (F)
above. The applicant must agree to the conditions prior to the approval of a
conditional use permit. These conditions may include but are not limited to
specifications of:
      (1)   The period of time in which all or part of the use may be
permitted;
      (2)   Setback and yard dimensions;
      (3)   Specified sewage disposal and water supply facilities;
      (4)   Landscaping and planting screens;
      (5)   Operational controls;
      (6)   Sureties;
      (7)   Deed restrictions;
      (8)   Location of structures, docks, piers or signs;
      (9)   Location and amount of parking facilities;
      (10)   Type of construction;
      (11)   Type of shore cover;
      (12)   Sign and lighting limitations; and
      (13)   Number of employees.
   (H)   Notation of approval.  When a conditional use permit is approved, the
building permit shall be appropriately noted and such permit shall be
applicable solely to the structures, use and property so described. Indication
of such permit shall also be made on the Zoning District Map by appropriate
symbol.
   (I)   Dimensions. Except as may be specifically otherwise provided, any use
shall conform to the building location, height, lot size and open space
regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (J)   Lapse of conditional use permit. A conditional use permit shall lapse
and become void one year after passage by the Village Board unless the
conditional use is fully established or a building permit has been issued and/
or construction has commenced and is being pursued diligently according to the
requirements of the permit. A conditional use permit may be renewed for an
additional period of one year by application to and approval of the Village
Board.
   (K)   Automatic termination of conditional use permit. In the event the use
for which the permit was granted shall cease or be abandoned for a period of
one continuous year, the conditional use permit granted herein shall
automatically cease.
   (L)   Revocation of conditional use permit. If, in the opinion of the
Village Board, the terms of a conditional use permit have been violated, or
that the use is substantially detrimental to persons of property in the
neighborhood, the Village Board shall, following notice to all parties, hold a
public hearing on the revocation of the permit. If, upon finding of act that
the terms of the permit have been violated, the Village Board may revoke,
modify or leave the permit unchanged. The Village Board may thereafter direct
the Village Attorney to secure such additional court orders as are necessary to
implement its action.
   (M)   Fees.  All conditional use petitions shall be accompanied by the
appropriate fee to defray the cost of giving notice, investigation and other
administrative processing, as provided for in §
157.134.
