Open Meeting Law Guide
General Requirements
1.   Wisconsin's Open Meeting Law provides that all meetings of governmental
bodies, including subcommittees, shall be open to all citizens at all times.
Sec. 19.81(2), Wis. Stats.
2.   Meetings of local governing bodies or their subunits must be held in
places reasonably accessible to the public.
3.   Meetings are open to all members of the public unless specifically
provided otherwise by law.
4.   When members of a governmental body gather in sufficient numbers to
compose a quorum, that meeting is presumed to be convened for the purpose of
conducting official business. Such a meeting is in violation of The Open
Meeting Law if proper notice was not given and the meeting is not open to the
public. Sec. 19.82(2), Wis. Stats.
5.   The Open Meeting Law applies when members of a governmental body meet with
a purpose to engage in government business and the number of members present is
sufficient to determine the parent body's course of action regarding the
proposal being discussed. State ex rel. Newspapers v. Showers, 135 Wis.2d 77,
398 N.W.2d 154 (1987).
6.   A meeting is covered by the Open Meeting Law even where the governmental
body is not empowered to exercise the final powers of its parent body (ex.
advisory committee to governing body). State v. Swanson, 92 Wis.2d 310, 284
N.W.2d 655 (1979).
A private home may qualify as a "meeting place" under Sec. 19.82(3), Wis.
Stats. 67 Atty. Gen. 125.
A telephone conference call involving members of a governmental body is a
"meeting" under the Open Meeting Law and it shall be reasonably accessible to
the public and proper notice of such meeting must be given. 69 Atty. Gen. 143.
No duly elected or appointed member of a governmental body may be excluded from
any meeting of such body. Sec. 19.89, Wis. Stats.
Public Notice
Who Must Receive Notice. For any meeting, the presiding officer, or his/her
designee, shall give notice to the official newspaper and to any other members
of the news media who have filed a written request to receive such notices, or
if neither exists, in a manner likely to give notice to the public. News media
who have filed written requests for notices of public meetings cannot be
charged fees by governmental bodies for sending such media notices. 77 Atty.
Gen. 312. However, a newspaper (or other media outlet) is not obligated to
print a notice received under such a standing meeting notice request, nor is
the governmental body obligated to pay for the publication of such a notice.
(Martin v. Wray, 473 F. Supp. 1131 (1979). Notice must also be given as
required by any other state statutes.
Construction of Notice. The notice for the meeting shall include:
The governmental body holding the meeting;
The time, date and place of the meeting; and
The subject matter of the meeting, including subject matter to be considered in
closed session.
Time for Notice. Notice must be given at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to
the commencement of the meeting unless for good cause such notice is impossible
or impractical, in which case shorter notice may be given. In no case may
notice be provided less than two (2) hours in advance of the meeting. Sec.
19.84(3), Wis. Stats.
Committees and Subunits Exemption to Notice Requirement. A legally constituted
subunit of a parent government body may conduct a meeting during the recess of
the governing body's meeting or immediately after the lawful meeting to act or
deliberate upon a matter which was the subject of that meeting. For this
exemption to apply, the presiding officer must publicly announce the time,
place and subject matter of the subunit's meeting in advance at the meeting of
the governing body.
Procedure for Closed Sessions.
Required notice must be given if the presiding officer or his/her designee
knows that a closed session is being contemplated. Notice is required
regardless of whether a majority of members will or will not support going into
closed session at the meeting. Sec. 19.84(2), Wis. Stats.
After first meeting in open session, with proper notice, a motion made and
recorded, supported by majority vote, is required to close, with the vote of
each member recorded in the minutes. Sec. 19.85(1), Wis. Stats.
If the motion to go into closed session is carried, the presiding officer shall
announce to those present at the meeting (to be recorded in the minutes) the
nature of the business to be considered in the closed session and the specific
exemption(s) relied upon in Sec. 19.85, Wis. Stats., under which the closed
session is permitted.
Only matters contained in the presiding officer's announcement of the closed
session may be considered during the closed session.
An open session, with adequate notice, must precede a closed session, even
where it was decided at a prior open session to go into a closed session at a
subsequent meeting.
A governmental body may vote to go into closed session at a properly convened
open session, for a permitted purpose, where specific notice of intent to
consider going into closed session was not included on the agenda at the time
notice of the open session was given. However, such procedure requires that the
presiding officer or his/her designee did not contemplate or have knowledge
that any of the other members contemplated a closed session at the time notice
of the agenda was given.
Specific Exemptions Allowing Closed Sessions
Sec. 19.85(1)(a), Wis. Stats., creates an exemption for governmental bodies
deliberating after quasi- judicial trials or hearings. However, boards of
review cannot rely on this exemption, for Sec. 70.47(2m), Wis. Stats., requires
all board of review meetings to be held in open session.
Sec. 19.85(1)(b), Wis. Stats., is a limited exception to the Open Meeting Law
allowing the use of a closed session when a governmental body is considering
the demotion, dismissal, licensing, discipline or tenure of a public employee
or a person licensed by a board or commission. This exception permits
preliminary discussion and investigation without the necessity of providing
actual notice to the individual involved. However, before any evidentiary
hearing can be conducted or formal action taken, notice must be given to the
person involved so that he or she can exercise his or her right to request an
open session for those purposes.
Sec. 19.85(1)(c), Wis. Stats., sanctions the use of closed sessions where
governmental bodies are considering employment, promotion, compensation or
performance evaluation of any public employee. Governmental bodies should
exercise caution when considering performance to avoid discussing matters that
are covered by Sec. 19.85(1)(b), Wis. Stats.
Sec. 19.85(1)(c), Wis. Stats., permits the use of closed sessions when
applications for parole or probation are being considered, or when crime
detection or prevention strategy is to be discussed.
Sec. 19.85(1)(e), Wis. Stats., allows closed sessions for the purpose of
deliberating or negotiating the purchase of public properties, the investing of
public funds, or the conducting of other specified public business, as long as
competitive or bargaining reasons require a closed session. Under this
exception, a governmental body could meet in closed session for the purpose of
forming negotiation strategies, although the body must give notice that an open
session will be held for the purpose of taking a vote to convene in closed
session for the purpose of discussing labor negotiation strategies.
Discussions by governmental bodies considering the financial, medical, social
or personal histories or disciplinary data of specific persons which, if
conducted in public, would have a "substantial adverse effect upon the
reputation of any person referred to" may be held in closed session under Sec.
19.85(1)(f), Wis. Stats. However, this exemption is unavailable where Sec.
19.85(1)(b), Wis. Stats., is applicable.
Sec. 19.85(1)(g), Wis. Stats., allows a governmental body to confer with its
legal counsel in closed session for the purpose of obtaining oral or written
advice concerning strategy to be adopted by the body with respect to present
and prospective litigation directly involving the governmental body.
Closed sessions may be utilized by governmental bodies to consider requests for
confidential written advice from ethics boards under Sec. 19.85(1)(h), Wis.
Stats.
Limitations on Closed Sessions
Sec. 19.85(2), Wis. Stats., makes it impermissible for a governmental body to
reconvene in open session within twelve (12) hours after a closed session,
unless public notice of the subsequent open session was given at the same time
and in the same manner as was required for the original open session.
Final ratification or approval of a collective bargaining agreement is required
to be in open session under Sec. 19.85(3), Wis. Stats. However, a governmental
body can vote to preliminarily approve bargaining proposals in closed session,
in order to reach a consensus, as long as final ratification occurs in open
session.
Ballots, Votes and Records
Unless provided elsewhere by statute, no secret ballot may be utilized by a
governmental body to determine any election or decision, except the election of
the officers of such body. This narrow exception does not permit the use of
secret ballots to elect members of committees, officers of the governmental
units such as department heads, or fill vacancies on the body itself.
Any member may require the ascertainment and recording of each vote.
Records of motions and roll-call votes must be preserved and open for public
inspection.
Use of Equipment in Meetings
A governmental unit must make a reasonable effort to accommodate the media's
equipment.
Any person may record, film or photograph a meeting in open session, provided
that the use of this equipment does not interfere with the conduct of the
meeting(s).
A member of a governmental body does not have the right to tape record a closed
session of the governmental body.

   (f)   General Rule. All words, phrases and ordinances shall be construed

technical or special meaning shall be understood and construed according to
that technical or special meaning if such is the intent of the Ordinances.

singular number only shall also be construed to apply to several persons or
things, and every word in these Ordinances referring to a plural number shall

Sec. 2-1-1 Village Government.
   (a)   Village Government Organization. The Village of Edgar is a body
corporate and politic with the powers of a municipality at common law and
governed by the provisions of Chapters 61 and 66, Wis. Stats., laws amending
those chapters, other acts of the legislature and the Constitution of the State
of Wisconsin.
   (b)   Division of Government.
      (1)   Legislative Branch. The Village Board is the legislative branch of
the Village government. Its primary business is the passage of law in the form
of ordinances or resolutions which shall prescribe what the law shall be, not
only in relation to the particular facts existing at the time, but as to all
future cases arising under it. The Village Board shall fix the salaries of all
officers and employees of the Village, and be charged with the official
management of the Village's financial affairs, its budget, its revenues and the
raising of funds necessary for the operation of the Village of Edgar.
      (2)   Executive Branch. The Village President shall take care that all
Village ordinances and state laws are observed and enforced, and that all
Village officers, boards and commissions discharge their duties. When present,
the Village President shall preside at the meetings of the Village Board. The
Village President shall from time to time give the Village Board such
information and recommend such measures as he/she may deem advantageous to the
Village of Edgar.
State Law Reference:  Wis. Const., Art. XI, Sec. 3.
Sec. 2-1-2 Candidates for Elective Office; Caucus for Nomination of Candidates.
Every candidate for an elective Village of Edgar office shall be nominated by
use of a caucus as prescribed by Sec. 8.05(1), Wis. Stats.
State Law Reference:  Sec. 8.05(1), Wis. Stats.
Sec. 2-1-3 Election Hours; Voter Registration.
   (a)   Election Poll Hours. The voting polls in the Village of Edgar,
Marathon County, Wisconsin shall be opened from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. for all
elections. Voting shall be conducted at the Edgar Village Hall.
   (b)   Voter Registration. All electors for all elections shall be required
to be registered. The Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer shall receive
applications for registration at his/her office during regular office hours
throughout the year, except that registration may also be completed at Village
polling places on election days upon presentation of proper identification and
proof of residency.
Sec. 2-1-4 Election Officials.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. The process for the appointment of election
officials set forth in Sec. 7.30, Wis. Stats., shall be followed. Pursuant to
Section 7.30(1), Wis. Stats., there shall be at least seven (7) election
inspectors at the polling place at each election conducted in the Village of
Edgar, except as otherwise provided below in Subsections (b)(2)-(4). That
statute further authorizes the Village Board to provide for the selection of
alternate officials or the selection of two (2) or more sets of election
officials to work at different times on election day.
   (b)   Appointment of Officials. At its regular meeting in December of each
odd-numbered year, the Village Board shall appoint not less than five (5)
election inspectors. At such meeting, the Village Board may appoint additional
inspectors in a number it deems necessary so that there are two (2) or more
sets of inspectors available to work at different times on election day.
Provided, however, the additional election inspectors shall be appointed in
such a manner that the total number of officials is an odd number.
   (c)   Hours of Work. Pursuant to Sec. 7.30(1), Wis. Stats., the Village
Board authorizes the Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer to determine the
inspectors who will work at each election and to determine the hours each
inspector will work.
   (d)   Reduction or Addition of Election Officials.
      (1)   Section 7.32, Wis. Stats., authorizes the Village Board to reduce
the required number of election officials at a polling place to no less than
three (3), and the Village Board has determined that would be advantageous to
the Village of Edgar to have only as many election officials on duty as are
needed for any given election. Pursuant to Section 7.32, Wis. Stats., the
Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer is authorized, at the discretion of the
Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer, to reduce the number of election
officials, provided that at all time there shall be a minimum of three (3)
election officials on duty. The Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer shall
determine in advance of each election whether the number of election officials
for such election should be reduced from the number prescribed by the Wisconsin
Statutes, and if such a reduction is so determined, the Village Administrator-
Clerk-Treasurer shall further redistribute duties among the remaining
officials.
      (2)   At the discretion of the Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer, the
requisite number of election officials may be increased for any election;
however, the number of election officials working at a given election shall
always be an odd number.
   (e)   Sets of Election Officials. Because Section 7.30(1), Wis. Stats.,
allows for the selection of two (2) or more sets of officials to work at
different times on each election day, the Village Board authorizes the
selection of two (2) sets of election officials to staff the polls on election
day if deemed necessary by the Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer. The
Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer is hereby authorized to schedule election
officials in shifts on any said election day. The Village Administrator-Clerk-
Treasurer shall redistribute the duties of such election officials to reflect
scheduling by shift. The second, or last, shift shall end with completion of
all required election day duties that follow the closure of the polls.
   (f)   Polling Place Greeter. As prescribed by Section 7.30(1)(b), Wis.
Stats., the Village Board authorizes the Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer
for each election to appoint, at the Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer's
discretion, one (I) additional election worker per shift to serve as a greeter
to answer questions and to direct electors to the proper locations for
registration and voting, and who shall be available to substitute for other
election officials who must leave the polling place room during the voting
process.
   (g)   Tabulators. The Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer may deem
necessary from time to time to select and employ tabulators for certain
elections due to the high projected voter turnout. Tabulators shall assist and
be under the direction of the election officials after the close of the polls.
The Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer shall select and employ tabulators,
if needed, for any election.
   (h)   Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer's Service as Alternate. The Edgar
Village Board appoints:
      (1)   The Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer to serve as an election
official in the absence of an appointed election official.
      (2)   The Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer to serve as an alternate
election official in the absence of an appointed alternate election official.
State Law Reference:  Secs. 7.30 and 7.32, Wis. Stats.
Sec. 2-1-5 Official Newspaper; Legal Posting.
   (a)   Publication. The official Village newspaper shall be the Record-Review
or Wausau Daily Herald, as determined by the Village Administrator-Clerk-
Treasurer, and is to be used for the publication of legal and/or official
notices when publication is used instead of legal posting as prescribed by the
Wisconsin Statutes.
   (b)   Legal Posting. As prescribed by Section 61.50(1), Wis. Stats., legal
posting shall be done in either of the following ways:
      (1)   The notice is posted in at least one (1) public place likely to
give notice to persons affected and is also placed electronically on an
internet site maintained by the municipality; or
      (2)   The notice is posted in a minimum of three (3) designated public
places likely to give notice to persons affected. The three (3) designated
posting locations are:
         a.   U.S. Post Office - Edgar.
         b.   Village of Edgar Municipal Building.
         c.   Edgar IGA grocery store.

Sec. 2-5-1 Statement of Purpose.
   (a)   The proper operation of democratic government requires that public
officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the
people; that government decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the
governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and
that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In
recognition of these goals, there is hereby established in this Chapter a Code
of Ethics for all Village of Edgar officials and employees, whether elected or
appointed, paid or unpaid, including members of boards, committees and
commissions of the Village, as well as any individuals who are candidates for
elective office as soon as such individuals file nomination papers with the
Village of Edgar.
   (b)   The purpose of this Ethics Code is to establish guidelines for ethical
standards of conduct for all such officials and employees by setting forth
those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the
Village of Edgar and by directing disclosure by such officials and employees of
private financial or other interests in matters affecting the Village. The
Village Board believes that a Code of Ethics for the guidance of elected and
appointed officials and employees will help them avoid conflicts between their
personal interests and their public responsibilities, will improve standards of
public service and will promote and strengthen the faith and confidence of the
citizens of this Village in their elected and appointed officials and
employees. The Village Board hereby reaffirms that each elected and appointed
Village official and employee holds his or her position as a public trust, and
any intentional effort to realize substantial personal gain through official
conduct is a violation of that trust. The provisions and purpose of this Ethics
Code and such rules and regulations as may be established are hereby declared
to be in the best interests of the Village of Edgar.

   (f)   Ad Hoc Committee Exceptions. No violation of the conflict of interest
restrictions of this Section shall exist, however, where an individual serves
on a special ad hoc committee charged with the narrow responsibility of
addressing a specific issue or topic in which that individual, or the employer
or a client of that individual, has an interest so long as the individual
discloses to the Village Board that such interest exists.
   (g)   Contracts with the Village. No official or employee who, in his or her
capacity as such officer or employee, participates in the making of a contract
in which such officer or employee has a private pecuniary interest, direct or
indirect, or performs in regard to that contract some function requiring the
exercise of discretion on the part of such official or employee, shall enter
into any contract with the Village unless:
      (1)   The contract is awarded through a process of public notice and
competitive bidding;
      (2)   The contract or activity is exempt from or otherwise deemed
appropriate by Sec. 946.13, Wis. Stats.;
      (3)   The Village Board waives this requirement after determining that it
is in the best interest of the Village to do so.
   (h)   Disclosure of Interest in Legislation.
      (1)   To the extent known, any member of the Village Board who has a
financial or personal interest in any proposed legislation before the Board
shall disclose on the record of the Village Board the nature of and extent of
such interest.
      (2)   Any other official or employee who has a financial interest or
personal interest in any proposed legislative action of the Village Board or
any board, commission or committee upon which the official or employee has any
influence or input or of which the official or employee is a member that is to
make a recommendation or decision upon any item which is the subject of the
proposed legislative action, shall disclose on the records of the Village Board
or the appropriate board, commission or committee the nature and extent of such
interest.
Sec. 2-5-8 Sexual and Other Unlawful Harassment.
   (a)   Harassment Prohibited.
      (1)   Village of Edgar officials and employees are responsible for
maintaining high standards of honesty, integrity, impartiality, and
professional and courteous conduct to assure proper performance of Village
business and to maintain the confidence of the public. The Village of Edgar is
committed to providing a positive and respectful work environment that is free
of discrimination and unlawful or inappropriate harassment.
      (2)   Actions, words, jokes, comments or other harassment or
discrimination based on gender, color, ancestry, physical or mental disability,
marital or family status, actual or perceived race, ethnicity, national origin,
creed, religion, age, arrest or conviction record, honesty testing, pregnancy
or childbirth, sexual preference or orientation, gender identity or preference,
genetic testing, military service membership or veteran status, or political
preferences or beliefs, or any other legally protected characteristic are a
form of official employee misconduct and shall not be tolerated. Prohibited
harassment includes gender-based harassment by a person of the same sex.
      (3)   This Section is applicable to officials when acting in their
official capacity or as otherwise engaged in Village-related work or activities
as an official with the Village.
      (4)   It is also expressly prohibited for an official or employee to
retaliate against another employee(s) or citizen who files a harassment
complaint or who assists in investigating allegations. Retaliation is a
violation of this Section and may result in discipline up to and including
termination in the case of an employee or other sanctions or actions under this
Section in the case of an official. No employee will be discriminated against,
or discharged, because of bringing or assisting in the investigation of a
complaint of harassment, including, but not limited to, sexual harassment. This
prohibition against retaliation is not limited to the person who makes the
formal complaint, but is equally applicable to witnesses, others involved in
the complaint investigation, and those associated with the complainant, such as
a spouse or domestic partner.
      (5)   Included in the scope of prohibited retaliation are retaliatory
adverse employment actions such as discharge. Also prohibited are material
changes to the terms and conditions of employment made in response to a
complaint; examples would include a change of assignments, ostracism by other
employees/officials, or making negative remarks about the complainant in the
community. Even if a complaint is found to lack legal merit, retaliation is
prohibited.
      (6)   The conduct underlying a complaint can occur not only in the
workplace but also at municipal-sponsored and social events or away from the
workplace. [Example: An employee pursuing a romantic relationship with a co-
worker by repeatedly calling him/her at home.]
      (7)   Harassment via email, text messages and/or social media are within
the scope of prohibited conduct under this Section. A post on an employee's
private social media page could fall within this policy if of a harassing or
retaliatory nature directed against a co-worker.
   (b)   Sexual Harassment. Sexual harassment, both overt and/or subtle, is
demeaning to another person, undermines the integrity of the workplace and
employment relationship, and is strictly prohibited. Sexual harassment is a
specific form of official or employee misconduct which undermines the integrity
of the workplace and employment relationship. All Village of Edgar officials
and employees must be able to work in an environment free from unsolicited and
unwelcome sexual overtones or threats.
   (c)   Definitions.
      (1)   Harassment.  Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
harassment generally rs:
         a.   Unwelcome verbal or physical conduct or other acts;
         b.   Engaged in because of the recipient's protected class status
when:
            1.   Submission to the conduct is a condition of employment or
benefits ("quid pro quo"), or
            2.   The conduct unreasonably interferes with the recipient's work
or can reasonably be seen to create a hostile, intimidating, or offensive
environment ("hostile environment").
         c.   Harrassment can include, regardless of whether the recepient is
part of a protected class:
            1.   Verbal or physical abuse.
            2.   Epithets, name-calling, slurs.
            3.   Threats.
            4.   Demands that an official or employee engage in actions or
practices contrary to state law or local ordinances, or which are contrary to
proper decisions of the governing body.
            5.   Vulgar, obscene or derogatory language.
            6.   Mimicry.
            7.   Lewd or offensive gestures or pranks.
            8.   Offensive jokes.
            9.   Offensive, threatening or hostile comments directed at an
employee or official, and also including emails, telephone messages, and other
electronic communications, including through the use of social media.
      (2)   Sexual Harassment. A situation where an official or employee
experiences unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or other
verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature under any of these conditions:
         a.   Submission by the employee to such conduct is made either
explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment; or
         b.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an employee is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting the employee; or
         c.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment.
      (3)   Sexual Harassment Examples.  Such prohibited behavior can be
verbal, nonverbal or physical in nature. Examples of sexual harassment could
include, but not be limited to, the following:
         a.   Sexual advances.
         b.   Requests for sexual favors.
         c.   Sexual comments of a provocative or suggestive nature;
         d.   Jokes or innuendos intended for and directed to another employee;
         e.   Suggestive or demeaning looks or leering;
         f.   Creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working
environment;
         g.   Making acceptance of unwelcome sexual conduct or advances or

         I.   Unwelcome social invitations.
         m.   Sexually charged emails or texts.
         n.   Implicitly or explicitly making or permitting acquiescence in or
submission to sexual harassment a term or condition of employment.
         o.   Making or permitting acquiscence in, submission to or rejection
of sexual harassment the basis or any part of the basis for any employment
decision affecting an employee, other than an employment decision that is
disciplinary action against an employee for engaging in sexual harassment in
violation of this paragraph; or
         p.   Permitting sexual harassment to have the purpose or effect of
substantially interfering with an official's or employee's work performance or
of creating an intimidating, hostile or offense work environment. Substantial
interference with an official's or employee's work performance or creation of
an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment is established when the
conduct is such that a reasonable person under the same circumstances as the
official or employee would consider the conduct sufficiently severe or
pervasive to intefere substantially with the person's work performance or to
create an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.
   (d)   Reporting of Harassment or Discrimination.
      (1)   Any employee or official who believes he or she has been subjected
to, or witnesses, an incident of prohibited harassment or discrimination must
report the incident to the Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer. If the
Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer is unavailable or the employee believes
it would be inappropriate to contact that person, the employee shall
immediately contact the Village President, as appropriate. Supervisors who
become aware of prohibited harassment or discrimination shall promptly bring
the matter to the attention of the Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer or
Village President, as appropriate. Village employees may raise concerns and
make reports without fear of reprisal, as any form of retaliation shall not be
tolerated by the Village of Edgar.
      (2)   Complaint procedures herein are not limited to employees and
officials who have experienced harassment - employees and officials who witness
inappropriate conduct may file a complaint under this Section.
      (3)   Employees and officials can report harassing conduct that is not
unlawful. For example, a stray inappropriate comment or incident still does not
mean such conduct will be tolerated in the workplace.
      (4)   After appropriate investigation, any official or employee found to
have engaged in prohibited harassment or discrimination shall be subject to
appropriate discipline and sanctions. Depending upon all the circumstances,
such sanctions could include termination of employment in the case of an
employee. In the case of an official, penalties may include an official censure
by the governing body and/or removal or reassignment from serving on Village
committees or commissions.
      (5)   The Village recognizes that the question of whether a particular
action or incident is purely a personal, social matter without discriminatory
effect requires a factual determination based on the facts. The Village also
recognizes that false accusations of prohibited harassment or discrimination
can have serious adverse effects. The Village expects all employees to act
honestly and responsibly in complying with and enforcing this policy. It is a
primary goal of the Village to maintain a pleasant working environment free of
harassment or discrimination for all employees and officials.
      (6)   Any employee with questions or concerns regarding this policy or
any suspected harassment or discrimination in the workplace to contact the
Village President or Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer.
Sec. 2-5-9 Advisory Opinions.
Any questions as to the interpretation of any provisions of this Code of Ethics
shall be referred to the Village Board, which, if it deems necessary or
appropriate, may request an advisory opinion from the Village Attorney.
Sec. 2-5-10 Sanctions.
   (a)   Upon the written complaint of any person alleging facts which, if
true, would constitute improper conduct under the provisions of this Chapter,
the Village Board shall conduct an investigation of the facts of the complaint,
if the investigation indicates there may be a reasonable basis for the
complaint justifying further investigation, the Village Board shall conduct a
hearing in accordance with the common law requirements of due process including
notice, an opportunity to be heard, an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses
and to present testimony and other evidence in support of the accused's
position and an opp01iunity to be represented by counsel or other
representative at the expense of the accused. The Council shall make written
findings of fact and issue a written decision concerning the propriety of the
conduct of the subject official or employee.
   (b)   A determination that a public official's or public employee's actions
constitute improper conduct under the provisions of this Chapter may constitute
a cause for removal from office, termination of employment, suspension,
reprimand, removal from committee assignment, or other appropriate disciplinary
action. As an alternative or in addition to sanctions imposed herein, any
individual violating the Ethics Code shall be subject to a non-reimbursable
forfeiture of not less than Ten Dollars ($10.00) nor more than Two Hundred
Dollars ($200.00) as determined by the Village Board.
   (c)   Sanctions, including any disciplinary action, that may affect
employees covered under a labor agreement will be consistent with the terms and
conditions set forth in the labor agreement.

or other Village official contacts said Village Attorney, Village Engineer or
any of the Village's professional staff or a property owner contacts the

the Village of Edgar as a whole, then and in that event the Village
Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer shall, pursuant to the provisions of Sec.
66.0627, Wis. Stats., charge that service to said property owner for the fees

professional assistance.

Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer. When a credit card order is placed via
telephone, the employee shall request that an email confirmation be sent.
      (4)   At no time shall a Village credit card number be saved on a website
for internet purchases.
      (5)   The Village employee using a Village credit card should take the
necessary steps at the time of purchase to ensure that such purchases are sales
tax exempt, except in those instances when it is cost-effective to pay the
sales tax.
      (6)   The Village, or an employee cardholder if a Village credit card is
issued to that employee by name, will receive a monthly statement including an
itemization of transactions from the card issuer. Such statements, with
supporting receipts, shall be timely filed with the Village Administrator-
Clerk-Treasurer to avoid late payment finance charges. Such statements shall be
signed by the employee.
      (7)   When the requisite charge information has been filed, the Village
Administrator-Clerk- Treasurer shall compare the purchases itemized on the
statement with the documentation of purchases submitted. Upon verification, the
Village Administrator- Clerk-Treasurer will process the credit card statements
for payment. Failure of an employee to submit the required documentation may
result in revocation of credit card purchasing privileges.
   (f)   Department Supervisor Responsibilities.
      (1)   If a department supervisor designates another department employee
to use a Village credit card, the department supervisor remains responsible for
all billings. If there are receipts which have not been turned in, that portion
of the statement will not be paid and the department supervisor will be
responsible for any resulting late fees.

credit card purchases comply with the Wisconsin Statutes and Village ordinances
and policies.

credit card, the Village Administrator- Clerk-Treasurer, in consultation with

resolved by the Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer.
      (3)   Cash returns of merchandise are prohibited. Supplies and items
returned to a supplier shall be credited to the Village's account. If a
merchandise credit is issued by telephone, the supplier shall be asked to

credit card company and notify the Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer the
following business day.

Subsection does not apply to members of the Village Board.
Sec. 3-3-5 Access Procedures.
   (a)   A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal
custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the
requested record or the information requested. However, a request for a record
without a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of time
represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A request
may be made orally, but a request must be in writing before an action to
enforce the request is commenced under Sec. 19.37, Wis. Stats. Except as
provided below, no request may be refused because the person making the request
is unwilling to be identified or to state the purpose of the request. No
request may be refused because the request is received by mail, unless
prepayment of a fee is required under Section
3-3-4(f)(6). A requester may be required to show acceptable identification
whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever
security reasons or federal law or regulations so require.
   (b)   Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as
practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester
of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole or in part and
the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring with the Village
Attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time
consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize his or
her request in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance.
   (c)   A request for a record may be denied as provided in Section
3-3-6. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a
demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by
the requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written
request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written
statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a
request shall inform the requester that, if the request for the record was made
in writing, then the dete1mination is subject to review upon petition for a
writ of mandamus under Sec. 19.37(1), Wis. Stats., or upon application to the
attorney general or a district attorney.
Sec. 3-3-6 Limitations on Right to Access.

refused include, but are not limited to, the following:

include land or buildings but shall include fixtures and such salvage as may be
taken from a building without structural damage when such fixtures and salvage
are not part of a demolition contract. Surplus Village property shall not
include property which is obtained by the Village as a result of abandonment or
loss by the property's original owner. Surplus Village property shall not
include items of property which are traded in for newer items.
   (b)   Designation of Surplus Village Property; Designating Authorities.
Items may be designated as surplus Village property, generally by the Village
Administrator, based on the estimated fair market value of the item as follows:

($5,000.00) or less: The designating authority is the Village Administrator.
      (2)   Property with an estimated value of Five Thousand and One Dollars

      (1)   The method of disposition of surplus Village property shall be
determined by the applicable designating authority, generally the Village
Administrator. In the event multiple items are to be disposed of
simultaneously, the designating authority shall be determined based on the
combined value of all such items.
      (2)   Surplus Village property shall be disposed of in the manner which
is likely to obtain the most benefit to the Village, with due consideration to

Sec. 5-3-6 False Alarms.
   (a)   Purpose.
      (1)   False alarms, regardless of their cause, represent a significant
public cost and endanger public safety by unnecessarily deploying fire, law
enforcement, EMS or other emergency resources that would otherwise be available

      (1)   To false alarms resulting from personal medical alert signals by
personal devices carried by individuals with heightened medical factors to
summon assistance in case of a medical emergency.
      (2)   Where a test of the alarm system is being conducted upon notice to
fire, law enforcement, EMS and other agencies that might reasonably be expected
to respond to such alarm.
      (3)   Where an alarm is activated by weather and such activation could
not have reasonably been prevented.
      (4)   To alarms related to activities referenced in Sec. 66.0627(7), Wis.
Stats.
   (d)   Intentional False Alarm or Bomb Threats. No person shall intentionally
make a false alarm or cause the activation of a burglar/fire alarm device
knowing that no criminal activity, fire or other emergency exists, or in any
other manner make or convey a false alarm or bomb threat.
   (e)   False Alarm Charges. The owner or occupant of any premises in the
Village of Edgar shall pay a special false alarm response charge per Sections
1-3-1 for false alarms involving such premises occurring within the same
calendar year.
   (f)   Collection. The Village Administrator shall provide written notice by
regular mail of all charges due under this Section to the owner and, if
applicable, the occupant of the premises where the false alarm occurred. Such
notice shall inform the owner and occupant of the right to appeal the charges
being imposed under this Section. Except as provided in Subsection (g) below,
those charges shall be paid by the owner or occupant within thirty (30) days,
they shall be considered a delinquent special charge and included in the
current or next tax roll pursuant to Sec. 66.0627, Wis. Stats.
   (g)   Appeals. Any property owner or occupant who receives a notice that
false alarm charges are being imposed against him/her under this Section may
appeal the imposition of said charges by filing a written appeal upon the
Village Administrator within fifteen (15) days after the date that the notice
of such false alarm is mailed to him/her. Such appeal shall include a statement
of grounds for appeal. The Village Administrator may prescribe a form to be
used for appeals. If an appeal is filed, the time for payment under Subsection
(f) shall be suspended until the appeal is decided by the Village Board. The
charge will be reimposed if the appeal is denied.

Sec. 5-3-14 Rapid Entry System (Knox Box).
   (a)   Rapid Entry Key Boxes Required.
      (1)   The Village of Edgar encourages the use of rapid entry lock box
devices and associated equipment (Knox Box System) for all commercial,
industrial and residential buildings which have a fire sprinkler system and/or
alarm systems with an annunciator panel. The Fire Department utilizes a key box
system ("Knox Box") requiring the installation of miniature vaults on the
exterior of buildings, gateposts, and/or other applicable locations to
facilitate entry into such places in a timely manner during an emergency.
Contained within these vaults are the keys necessary to gain entry into the
facility and/or also keys to gain access to any locked equipment rooms or
hazardous locations. Pertinent property information may also be contained in
the vaults.
      (2)   Key boxes are recommended in all new public buildings, places of
employment, and multi-family residential buildings that contain a fire alarm or
a combination of fire alarms as well as any detection and/or fire suppression
systems. Key boxes may be required on buildings that do not contain any of the
above equipment by order of the Fire Chief or Building Inspector if the type of
occupancy has contents or processes that warrant immediate access during an
emergency when it would be impractical or unsafe to wait for a key holder.
Gated facilities may also be required to install a padlock compatible with the
key box system master key. In such cases the padlock could be double locked
along with facility's padlock so as not to disrupt their normal operation.
Required equipment shall be purchased by the owner/occupant.
   (b)   Rapid Entry Key Boxes Recommended. The Village of Edgar recommends the
use of lock box devices and associated equipment as described in Subsection (a)
above in the following types of buildings; where building owners elect to
provide such rapid entry box devices to facilitate access by the Fire
Department, such devices and associated equipment shall be provided by a
commercial vendor and be of the type authorized by the Fire Department:
      (1)   In all commercial and/or industrial buildings other than those
described in Subsection (a) above.
      (2)   In all multi-family residential structures containing three (3) or
more living units, other than those described in Subsection (a) above, that
have restricted access through locked doors and have a common corridor for
access to the living units or mechanical rooms.
      (3)   In any other building where lack of access may result in loss of
life or significant property or environmental damage, based on factors
including, but not limited to, fire load, occupancy, exposures, type of
building construction, building age, and storage or use of hazardous materials
(single and two-family dwellings are exempt from this requirement).
   (c)   Retroactivity. Participation in this key box system for existing
occupancies that would be covered under this Section will be voluntary, except
that businesses that have a change of occupancy or a change of use will be
required to comply with this Section. Any keys that the Fire Department
currently has in its possession will be returned to the rightful owner. The
Fire Department will no longer accept or carry loose keys. Occupancies wishing
to participate in the key box system master key. In such cases th padlock could
be double locked along with the facility's padlock so as not to disrupt their
normal operation. Required equipment shall be purchased by the owner/occupant.
   (d)   Special Circumstances/Multiple Residential False Alarms. The Fire
Chief or Building Inspector may require the installation of a key box system on
a private dwelling that contains a monitored fire alarm or fire suppression
system where multiple false alarms have occurred.
   (e)   Location.
      (1)   The key box shall be installed in an accessible location approved
by the Fire Department. The key box shall be mounted not less than five (5)
feet or more than seven (7) feet above ground level immediately below the
installation.
      (2)   Depending on the type and size of the occupancy, the Fire Chief or
Building Inspector may require one or more key boxes to be placed on the
structure. Public buildings that contain multiple occupancies may be required
to have separate vaults for each separate occupancy. The key box will typically
be placed near the main entrance to the occupancy. The mounting location of the
box must be approved. The type and size of the key box to be installed must
also be approved. The only acceptable equipment will be from the Knox Company.
In most cases a Knox 4400 series box will be required. In certain cases where
it may be necessary to keep MSDS, Hazmat data or building plans in the vault, a
larger box may be required. For smaller occupancies and multi-family
residential occupancies required storage for less than ten (10) keys, a Knox
3200 series box bill be required.
   (f)   Security. Security will be maintained through the use of Key Secure
master key retention systems. All vaults will be keyed alike utilizing a master
key that is proprietary to the Edgar Volunteer Fire Department. The Edgar
Volunteer Fire Department will be the sole agency that has access to the vault.
The master key can only be released after entering a PIN code. All activity
will be recorded electronically to add to the security of the system. Boxes
shall only be accessed for fire or EMS emergencies, during routine fire
inspections, or to update contents.
   (g)   Vault Contents. The key box vault shall contain keys for the
following: the main entrance, all locked points of access in the interior of
the building, mechanical rooms, alarm rooms or panels, sprinkler rooms,
electrical rooms, elevators and elevator control rooms, and any other locked
areas that may be determined by the Fire Chief. Buildings containing hazardous
processes and/or hazardous materials may also be required to place information
regarding these hazards within the vault. This information shall be, at a
minimum, the MSDS for all products, a list of responsible parties and emergency
contact numbers, the list of hazards and quantities and their location within
the facility, and any other information requested by the Fire Chief.
   (h)   Owner's Responsibility.
      (1)   Building owners are required:
         a.   To purchase an approved key box by contacting the Fire Department
and obtaining the necessary authorizations.
         b.   To provide to the Fire Department the proper keys for the
required access.
         c.   To notify the Fire Department when the locks or keys have
changed.
         d.   To keep the immediate area of the key box free and clear of any
obstructions.
      (2)   The owner or occupant of buildings utilizing the key box system
shall ensure that the keys and any other information contained within the vault
will be kept up to date. The keys and any other contents will be verified and/
or tested at the time of installation and also during regular fire inspections.
If at any time the keys or information contained with the vault become
outdated, or items must be added to the vault, arrangements must be made with
the Fire Department to gain access to place the updated items in the vault.
   (i)   Violations. It shall be unlawful to tamper with or remove any key box
without the permission of the building owner and Fire Department.
Sec. 5-3-15 Damage Involving Emergency Vehicles.
   (a)   Damage to Emergency Vehicles. If any emergency vehicle suffers damage
because of insufficient access to any property within the Village of Edgar, the
property owner shall be liable for the amount required to remedy or repair any
such damage to the emergency vehicle.

Sec. 6-1-5 Village Right-of-Way Use By Utilities.
   (a)   Statement of Purpose.
      (1)   Utilities Accommodation Generally. The Village of Edgar constructs,
maintains, and operates a Village street and highway system, providing critical
infrastructure to citizens and businesses alike. Utility companies provide
service to neighborhoods and businesses as well as to individual users. Both
the Village of Edgar and utility companies typically provide facilities which
consider future as well as present infrastructure needs. Cooperation between
these entities is essential if the public is to be served in a cost-efficient
manner consistent with the respective public service needs, obligations, and
interests.
      (2)   Purpose of the Village Street System.  The primary purpose of the
Village of Edgar street system is to provide a safe and convenient means for
the vehicular transportation of people and goods. Any permitted use and
occupancy of Village street, highway and road right-of-way for non-
transportation purposes is subordinate to the primary interests of the
traveling public.
      (3)   Purpose of Utility Accommodation Standards. The purpose of this
Section is to describe the standards that shall be satisfied by any utility
whose facility currently occupies, or will occupy in the future, any street,
highway or road right-of-way or bridge over which the Village of Edgar has
jurisdiction and maintains.
   (b)   Utility Accommodation.
      (1)   Permitted Accommodation. The Village of Edgar will generally permit
utility facilities on and within right-of-ways of Village streets, highways,
roads, and bridges when:
         a.   Such use and occupancy does not adversely affect the primary
functions of the Village streets, highways, roads, and/or bridges or materially
impair their safety, operational, and/or visual qualities;
         b.   There would be no conflict with the provisions of federal, state,
or local laws, ordinances, or regulations or the accommodation provisions
stated herein; and
         c.   The occupancies would not increase the difficulty or future cost
of street, highway, road, or bridge construction or maintenance.
      (2)   Additional Provisions. Nothing in this Section shall be construed
as limiting the rights of the Village of Edgar to impose additional
restrictions or requirements and/or deviations from those prescribed in this
Section in any permit where the Village Board or its designee deems it
advisable to do so.
      (3)   Alteration Requests.
         a.   If the utility encounters a hardship during installation that
prevents installation in accordance with the Village-issued permit, the utility
can:
            1.   Make a request for an alteration in writing to the Village
Board, which shall consider such request within ten (10) business days; or
            2.   The utility may make changes to the permitted installation, at
the risk of having to relocate the installation at its own cost if there is not
subsequent agreement with the Village.
         b.   In all cases, the utility shall explain in writing the changes
made or proposed to be made. Such notification shall identify the hardship and
include maps indicating the permitted locations of the installations and the
actual as-built locations of the installations.
         c.   The Village Board has the final determination authority as to the
validity of the hardship. If the Village Board determines that the changes were
made primarily due to the contractor's preference, and not due to a hardship,
the Village shall direct that the utility take appropriate corrective action
within ten (10) days of written notice from the Village. For clarification
purposes, but not limited to, examples of hardships are: solid rock,
uncrossable swamps or wetlands, cemeteries, or similar features or
circumstances that make construction physically or economically unfeasible.
Financial hardship alone might not constitute a hardship.
   (c)   Alterations to Permitted Facilities. The utility shall properly alter
the permitted facilities as necessary to facilitate alteration, improvement,
safety control, or maintenance of the street, highway, road, bridge, or right-
of-way as may be ordered by the Village Board. All costs for constructing,
maintaining, altering, and relocating the permitted facilities shall be the
sole responsibility of the utility, unless a specific Village-executed utility
parcel or agreement otherwise provides.
   (d)   Permit Required.
      (1)   When Permit Required. A utility shall obtain a permit from the
Village of Edgar before any use or occupancy of a Village street, highway,
road, or bridge right-of-way is allowed or authorized.
      (2)   Permit Authorization To Use and/or Occupy Village Right-of-Way:
         a.   By issuance of a permit, the Village officially determines that,
subject to all applicable provisions and conditions of this Section, the
permit, and the Village of Edgar Code of Ordinances, a specified utility use
and/or occupancy of Village right-of-way is not adverse to the public interest
at the time of permit approval.
         b.   In issuing a permit, the Village of Edgar does not warrant that
public title to the right-of-way is free and clear, does not certify that the
Village has sole ownership, and does not indicate any intention to defend the
utility in its peaceful use and occupancy of said lands. The permit does not
transfer or convey any land nor grant, give, or convey any land right, right in
land, or easement.
         c.   Written permit authorization from the Village of Edgar does not
relieve the utility from compliance with all applicable federal and state laws
and codes, and local ordinances and regulations, which affect the design,
construction, materials, and/or performance of the work. The Village's
authorization shall not be construed as superseding any other governmental
agency's more restrictive requirements.
         d.   Each Village-issued permit shall require that proper
indemnification language protecting the Village be a part of the approval
document.
         e.   The utility shall retain a copy of the permit in its files, at a
minimum, during the entire time the facility is located on, over, or under
Village right-of-ways.
   (e)   Required Permit Application Information.
      (1)   General Requirements. A utility's request to use and occupy the
right-of-way cannot be considered until adequate required information is
provided to the Village by the applicant; an application request shall not
proceed to review until such that time sufficient application information is
filed with the Village Administrator, as determined by the Village. The amount
of application detail will vary with the complexity of the installation and
right-of-way involved, but must include the appropriate permit form, drawings
and sketches, and installation information so that the effect on the street,
highway, road or bridge operation, traffic safety, and visual qualities can be
evaluated.
      (2)   Permit Application Form.
         a.   Utilities shall file a permit application form with the Village
Administrator. Alteration of a Village permit application form, if provided, by
the applicant if prohibited and shall be canse for application rejection or
permit revocation. Additional information can be provided as an attachment.
         b.   One (1) original of the permit application, with attachments,
shall be submitted per application to the Village Administrator via regular
mail, courier service, or delivered in person.
         c.   As applicable, the applicant shall provide on the application:
name and business address; telephone, cellphone and fax numbers; email address;
and a specific contact person.
      (3)   Permit Application Illustrations. Each permit application shall
provide adequate drawings, illustrations or sketches sufficient to show the
existing and/or proposed location of all utility facilities within the Village
right-of-way with respect to the existing street, highway, road, and/or bridge,
and any planned improvements to such infrastructure. The details provided shall
include dimensions from the proposed utility installation to the commonly
accepted right-of-way line and to the edge of the traveled way. For highway/
road crossings, a cross-section detail showing the depth of bury or overhead
clearance is required along with the location of any bore pits, if needed. The
distance reference from the crossing to the nearest public roadway intersection
is also required. Approximate distances from the proposed installation/facility
to side road intersections, county lines, etc., shall be submitted to the
Village with all permit application illustrations.
      (4)   Installation Information.  The utility shall provide the following
installation information to the Village:
         a.   This information shall include, but is not limited to, a general
description of the location, size, type, nature, and extent of the utility
facilities proposed to be installed or to be adjusted, and the impact of the
proposed facilities on the utility's existing facilities that remain in place
within the right-of-way.
         b.   The utility shall provide a description of proposed construction
procedures, special traffic control and protection measures, proposed access
points, coordination of activities with the highway contractor (when
applicable), and vegetation proposed to be removed.
         c.   When an attachment to a road structure, such as a bridge, is
proposed, additional information is required. This information shall include,
but not be limited to, bridge number, weight of lines, hanger spacing, hanger
details, and expan- sion/contraction details.
      (5)   Fees. Under this Section, the following fees shall be paid to the
Village at the time of permit application:

improvements.
         b.   Permit servicing or expanding such lines without obstruction or
interference to the free flow of traffic.
         c.   Provide adequate vertical and horizontal clearance between an
underground utility facility and a structure or other highway facility to allow
maintenance of all facilities.

      (2)   Crossing Location. Utility facilities and installations shall
satisfy the following:
         a.   Utility facilities shall cross the highway or road on a line as
nearly perpendicular to the highway/road alignment as possible.
         b.   Conditions which are generally unsuitable or undesirable for
underground crossings should be avoided. Crossing locations to be avoided
include:
            1.   Deep cuts.
            2.   Near footings of bridges and retaining walls.
            3.   Across highway/road intersections at grade or ramp terminals.
            4.   At cross drains where the flow of water may be obstructed.

            6.   In wet or rocky terrain where it will be difficult to attain
minimum burial depth.
      (3)   Underground Longitudinal Location.
         a.   The longitudinal location of underground utility facilities
within the right-of-way shall provide as much clearance from the traveled way
as conditions will allow. Such lines shall be on uniform alignment and be
located at or as near as practical to the right-of-way line.
         b.   To maintain a reasonable uniform utility alignment, location
variances may be allowed when irregular-shaped portions of the right-of-way
extend beyond the normal right-of-way limits. No utility lines are allowed in
the ditch bottom or on the slope from the road shoulder.
      (4)   Above-Ground Longitudinal Location.
         a.   The longitudinal location of above-ground utility facilities
shall be outside of the clear zone. Such lines shall be on a uniform alignment
and be located at or as near as practical to the right-of-way line. Exceptions

      (3)   Village to Act as Own Contractor. Because it is in the public
interest to expedite construction as required, the Village of Edgar shall act,
where feasible, as its own contractor on any sidewalk project or shall select a
private contractor to perform such work.
   (d)   Village Contract or Permit Required. No person shall hereafter lay,
remove, replace or repair any public sidewalk within the Village of Edgar
unless he/she is under contract with the Village to do such work or has

fee as prescribed in Section
1-3-1 shall be charged for such permit.
   (e)   Standard Specifications for Sidewalk.
      (1)   General. Concrete sidewalk construction shall meet the
specifications and provisions set forth in this Section and shall be
constructed in locations and to line and grade as established by the Village of
Edgar. All sidewalks constructed in the Village shall conform to the line and
grade established by the ordinances or resolutions of the Village of Edgar.
Where no grade has been established as ascertained by the records, the Village
Engineer shall prepare and report a grade for the approval of the Village
Board; and, when the same has been established, the Village Engineer or Public
Works Department shall stake out the sidewalk as ordered by the Village Board.
No sidewalk shall be laid under the provisions of this Section until a grade
therefor has been established by the Village of Edgar.
      (2)   Subgrade. All earth, dirt and material shall be removed to a depth,
not less than eight (8) inches, ten (10) inches across private driveways, below
the grade line; and the space shall be filled with crushed stone, sand or
gravel. The base shall be left four (4) inches thick after being tamped, with
the stone or gravel to be not larger than one and one-half (1-1/2) inches in
diameter and to be free from dirt, dust and foreign matter. Soft, porous and
unsuitable subgrade material shall be removed and replaced with sand, gravel,
or other satisfactory material, and the subgrade shall be thoroughly and
uniformly compacted and moistened immediately before the concrete is placed. On
embankments, the subgrade shall extend at least one (1) foot beyond each edge
of the sidewalk.
      (3)   Surplus Excavation and Fill Between Sidewalk and Curb. All surplus
earth and other material excavated from the line of work, which may not be
required for filling, shall be hauled. Where the sidewalk does not abut the
curb, gutter, pavement or other structures and when the concrete has been cured
and forms removed, the space along the sides shall be backfilled with a
satisfactory soil thoroughly compacted. Backfill shall be approved by the
Public Works Department.
      (4)   Concrete. The minimum quantity of cement per cubic yard shall be
six (6) sacks of ninety-four (94) pounds each. Concrete shall be mixed for at
least one (1) minute. Gravel shall be of good quality and washed. Concrete
shall test three thousand (3,000) pounds compression in twenty-eight (28) days.
Bituminous sidewalks are prohibited except on special use walking trails.
      (5)   Forming. Concrete shall be placed in straight forms of wood or
metal of sufficient strength to resist springing, tipping or other displacement
during the process of depositing and consolidating the concrete. Concrete shall
be placed in the forms on a moist subgrade, deposited just above the finished
grade and consolidated and spaded sufficiently to bring the mortar to the
surface and to prevent honeycombing. It shall then be struck off level with the
top of the forms and finished with wooden flats. Forms shall be securely
fastened, staked, braced and held firmly to required line and shall be
sufficiently tight to prevent leakage of mortar, and all forms shall remain in
place for twenty-four (24) hours after pour.
      (6)   Jointing, Floating and Finishing. Soon after screening and while
the concrete is still pliable, the surface shall be floated with wood, cork or
metal floats or by a finishing machine. At all places where the sidewalk
intersects another sidewalk or curb-line, a one-half (1/2) inch expansion joint
shall be placed. Transverse expansion joints of one-half (1/2) inch thick and
four (4) inches wide and five (5) feet long or premolded material shall be
located every thirty (30) feet. Sidewalks must be marked off to make blocks
five (5) foot square and be at right angles to the parallel lines. Any new
sidewalk adjoining an old sidewalk or a sidewalk which abuts curb and gutter
shall have one-half (1/2) by four (4) inch expansion joints of premolded
material.
      (7)   Slope.
         a.   All forms must be approved by the Public Works Department or
other inspector designated by the Village Administrator before concrete is
poured. To provide adequate drainage, the sidewalk shall slope toward the curb
at a minimum rate of one-half (1/2) inch per foot of width of sidewalk. All
joints and edges shall be finished with a one-fourth (1/4) inch radius edging
tool.
         b.   In cases where the grade exceeds fifteen percent (15%), steps or
special construction shall be required to fit the existing conditions. Such
details shall be prepared by the Village Engineer and approved by the Village
Board before construction of the walk is started.
         c.   Sidewalks shall be constructed within the limits of the street
right-of-way (terrace), and unless otherwise specifically indicated, there
shall be a one (1) foot strip of street property left between the property line
and the edge of the sidewalk.
      (8)   Width and Thickness.
         a.   Residential walks shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in width
and not less than four (4) inches thick, or shall match existing sidewalk width
in that block. However, in driveway approaches, the minimum sidewalk thickness
shall be six (6) inches. Such sidewalks shall have a grade one (1) inch higher
than the adjacent curb on the curb side of the sidewalk. All such sidewalks
shall be constructed eight (8) inches from the adjacent lot line.
         b.   In the case of a laydown type curb, the pitch shall be one-half
(1/2) inch per foot from the curb in the parkway to the sidewalk with a three
(3) inch minimum.
         c.   Sidewalks in front of commercil{'}'}l or industrial
establishments shall have a width as determined by the Village Board and be
five (5) inches thick, except within driveway approaches where the minimum
thickness shall be seven (7) inches.
         d.   One-half (1/2) inch reinforcement rod shall be used when
replacing or repairing sidewalks over alley entrances.
      (9)   Finishing. The concrete shall be struck off true to grade, finished
smooth and given a broom finish in transverse direction. Edges and joints shall
be given a finish with a one-quarter (1/4) inch radius edging tool. Dry cement
shall not be spread on a wet surface to take up excess water. Finishing
operations shall be delayed until water has disappeared. No tool marks shall be
left on exposed surfaces. In case of rain, the walk shall be covered to protect
the surface from being damaged. Sidewalks shall be kept free from all traffic
at normal temperatures for forty-eight (48) hours and in cold weather [below
fifty (50) degrees F.] for ninety-six (96) hours.
      (10)   Curing and Drying.  As soon as any of the concrete work herein
before mentioned has been finished and hardened sufficiently to prevent
excessive marring of the surface, it shall be cured and protected against rapid
drying. Failure to comply with this requirement shall be deemed sufficient
cause for suspension of the work. Curing shall be accomplished by the
"Impervious Coating," "Wet Fabric" or "Paper" methods. For impervious coating
or membrane curing, only those materials meeting requirements of ASTM Spec.
Cl56-44T, "Method of Test for Efficiency of Materials for Curing Concrete"
shall be used. Said specifications are hereby adopted by reference as if fully
set forth herein. Concrete shall be kept moist by sprinkling, covering or a
combination of both for a period of five (5) days.
      (11)   Cold Weather Requirements. When the temperature is less than forty
degrees Fahrenheit (40°F), all concrete placed in the forms shall have a
temperature between fifty degrees Fahrenheit (50°F) and seventy degrees
Fahrenheit (70°F) and shall meet the requirements as per Wisconsin Department
of Transportation (WisDOT) specifications for cold weather concrete.
      (12)   Variances. Where the location of a sidewalk in accordance with the
specifications established herein would severely conflict with the location of
trees, or the root systems thereof, a written variance to the specifications
may be issued by the Public Works Department permitting the sidewalk to be
located so as to reduce such conflict. No variance shall be issued if the
public safety or welfare would be adversely affected thereby.
      (13)   Higher Standards. Where deemed necessary by the Village of Edgar,
higher sidewalk standards may be required by the Village Board or Public Works
Department.
   (f)   Repair or Replacement of Defective or Damaged Sidewalks.

improvements affecting or altering existing curbs, gutters, sidewalks or
driveway approaches shall be responsible for effecting repairs or
reconstruction of such curbs, gutters, sidewalks or driveway approaches and
shall be responsible for the cost of such construction, repair, or
reconstruction. Property owners who damage such improvements shall also be
responsible for the cost of such repair or reconstruc- tion (i.e. damage due to
construction equipment or the placement of a dumpster).
         c.   Pursuant to Sec. 66.0907, Wis. Stats., the Village Board may
order at any time property owners to repair or remove and replace any sidewalk
which is unsafe, defective or insufficient, or which is damaged by the acts of
the property owner or his/her agents. If the property owner shall fail to so
repair or remove and replace such sidewalk within twenty (20) days after
service of the notice provided in the Wisconsin Statutes, the Village Board or
its designee shall repair or construct such sidewalk and the Village
Administrator shall enter the total cost thereof upon the tax roll as a special
tax against said lot or parcel of land. If an emergency situation exists which
is caused by a sidewalk in need of repair, the Village Board or its designee
shall immediately direct the property owner to immediately make repairs. If the
property owner shall fail to repair such sidewalk within the required period,
the Village Board shall make the necessary repairs and the Village
Administrator shall enter the total cost thereof on the tax roll as a special
tax against said parcel.
      (2)   Repair Criteria.
         a.   The Village Board may determine that any sidewalk which is
unsafe, defective, or insufficient be repaired or removed and replaced with a
sidewalk in accordance with this Section. The existence of any one or more of
the hereinafter enumerated characteristics may determine whether a sidewalk is
defective or insufficient:
            1.   Three-fourths (3/4) inch or more vertical differential between
adjacent individual sidewalk blocks (crack in slab).
            2.   One and one-fourth (1-1/4) inch horizontal distance between
adjacent individual sidewalk blocks.
            3.   Deterioration of the surface to a vertical depth of one-half
(1/2) inch or more within each individual sidewalk block.
            4.   Cracked blocks (regardless of the width of the crack) on
either side of the block that is defective per these specifications.
            5.   Poles, trees or other objects creating hazards.
            6.   Sidewalk sections which are out of conformance with design
grade to the degree that water ponds.
            7.   Broken corners which are greater than three (3) inches in any
dimension.
            8.   Blocks deemed to be unsafe because of surface deterioration.
            9.   Sidewalk blocks which were previously found to be defective
upon subsequent inspection.
      (3)   Deficiency Formula. If sixty-five percent (65%) of a property
owner's sidewalk blocks are determined to be defective or insufficient, the
entire sidewalk shall be replaced.
      (4)   Procedure.
         a.   Authority of Board; Inspections.
            1.   The Village Board may order by ordinance or resolution
sidewalks to be repaired as provided in this Subsection.

days after service of notice under Sub tion (e)(3) to lay, remove, replace or
repair the sidewalk he/she has damaged, the Village of Edgar may cause the work
to be done at the expense of the owner. All work for the construction of
sidewalks shall be let by contract to the lowest responsible bidder except as
provided in the Wisconsin Statutes.
         e.   Minor Repairs. If the cost of repairs or any sidewalk damaged by
a property owner in front of any lot or parcel of land does not exceed the sum

taxes upon real estate. The Village Board, by resolution or ordinance, may
provide that the expense incurred may be paid in three (3) annual installments,
and the Village Administrator shall prepare the expense statement to reflect
the installment payment schedule. If annual installments for sidewalk expenses
are authorized, the Village Administrator shall charge the amount to each lot
or parcel of land and enter it on the tax roll as a special tax against the lot
or parcel each year until all installments have been entered, and the amount
shall be collected like other taxes upon real estate. The Village Board may
provide that the Public Works Department or Village Engineer perform the duties
imposed by this Section on the Village Board.
   (g)   Illegal Sidewalks. No sidewalk which shall be constructed contrary to
the provisions of this Section shall be considered a legal sidewalk and the

so handled and placed as to be of as little inconvenience as practical to
public travel and adjoining tenants.
   (g)   Backfilling.
      (1)   Trench backfilling shall be accomplished as follows:
         a.   The backfill from the bottom of the utility pipe/conduit to an
elevation one (1) foot above the pipe/conduit shall be fine granular material
carefully placed by hand and well-tamped to fill completely all the spaces
under and adjacent to the pipe/conduit so as to form a bed that will preclude
subsequent settling. Compaction shall achieve a ninety-five percent (95%) of
maximum dry density at optimum moisture as determined in accordance with Method
of Test for Moisture-Density Relations of Soils, AASHTO Designation Tl80-74.
         b.   The remainder of the backfill may consist of suitable native
soils with proper moisture content for maximum compaction. The contractor shall
have and use at the job site a vibrating compactor before starting to backfill.
The backfill shall be uniformly compact to at least ninety-five percent (95%)
maximum dry density at optimum moisture as determined by the Method of Test for
Moisture-Density Relations of Soils, AASHTO Designation T 180-74.
      (2)   All backfill material shall be free from cinders, ashes, refuse,
vegetable or organic matter, boulders, rocks or stones greater than six (6)
inches in their greatest dimension, frozen Jumps or other material which in, in
the opinion of the Public Works Department or its designee, is unsuitable.
      (3)   In refilling the excavation, if there is not sufficient material
excavated suitable for refilling, the deficiency shall be made up with
material, approved prior to use by the Public Works Department or its designee,
hauled in.
      (4)   Wherever an excavation crosses an existing utility, pipe or other
structure, backfill shall be carefully compacted in stages from the bottom of
the excavation. Any sanitary sewer, storm sewer, water, telephone, natural gas
or other service shall not be interrupted by the permittee. It shall be the
permittee's responsibility to have the various utilities locate and mark their
facilities prior to excavation.
      (5)   The Village of Edgar may perform compaction control tests at such
frequency and at such depths as it deems necessary to verify compliance with
the compaction requirements of state highway construction standards.
      (6)   All excavations shall be subject to testing by the Village of
Edgar. Backfilled material not achieving the above compaction requirements
shall be removed and recompacted by the permittee. The cost of any retesting
shall be paid by the permittee.
      (7)   When the sides of the trench will not stand perpendicular,
sheathing and braces shall be used to prevent caving. No timber, bracing,
Jagging, sheathing or other lumber shall be left in any trench. At no time
shall any street pavements be permitted to overhang the excavation.
   (h)   Notice. It shall be the duty of the permittee to notify the Public
Works Department and all public and private individuals, firms and corporations
affected by the work to be done at least one (1) business day before such work
is to commence. The Public Works Department shall also be notified at least

restoration operation, the balance of the opening to the original sutface
elevation shall be backfilled with compacted three-quarter (3/4) inch crushed
stone.
      (2)   Bituminous pavement shall be placed the full depth of the existing
pavement or three (3) inches, whichever is greater. Bituminous pavement shall
be placed in a maximum of one and one-half (1-1/2) inch layers with each layer
compacted to maximum density and shall consist of Wisconsin Department of
Transportation Gradation No. 1 for the binder course and Wisconsin Department
of Transportation No. 3 for the sutface course. The finished sutface shall be
smooth and free of sutface irregularities and shall match the existing pavement
and any castings or street appurtenances. Allowable deviations shall be no more
than one-quarter (1/4) inch as measured with a ten (10) foot straight edge. If
hot mix is temporarily not available, the hot mix shall be temporarily replaced
with cold mix. The cold mix shall be removed and replaced with hot mix upon
availability.
      (3)   Concrete pavement shall be placed to the full depth of the existing
pavement or seven (7) inches, whichever is greater. Concrete used shall not
contain calcium chloride. The sutface shall be given a light broom finish. The
edges shall be tooled to prevent spalling at the saw cut edge. The sutface

minimum length shall be sixty (60) inches. All replaced sidewalk shall be four
(4) inches thick, except at driveways where it shall be six (6) inches thick.
The new walk shall slope to conform to existing construction across the width
of the walk toward the street.
      (7)   In emergency excavations during winter months when it is not
possible to replace the removed pavement with a like material, the excavation
shall be temporarily resurfaced with a minimum of three and one-half (3-1/2)
inches of cold mix bituminous material. This temporary wearing surface shall be
compacted and rolled smooth. These temporary wearing surfaces shall be removed
and replaced with material as specified above by not later than the following
June 1st, except as provided above. Permanent pavements shall be replaced
within sixty (60) days of the date of the permit.
      (8)   When a street is reconstructed, utility laterals shall also be

the Village shall notify in writing each person, utility or other agency owning
or controlling any sewer, water main, conduit or other utility in or under said
street or any real property abutting said street, that all such excavation work
in such street must be completed within thirty (30) days. After such permanent
improvement or repaving, no permit shall be issued to open or excavate said
street for a period of five (5) years after the date of improvement or repaving
unless, in the opinion of the Village Board, or committee thereof, conditions
exist which make it absolutely essential that the permit be issued. Every
effort shall be made to place gas, electric, telephone and televi- sion cable
lines in street terraces.
   (I)   Repair by Village. The Village of Edgar may elect to make the pavement
repair for any street or sidewalk opening, in which case the cost of making
such repair and of maintaining it for one (1) year shall be charged to the
person making the street opening. In the event such charges are not paid within
ninety (90) days of actual notice of the same having been furnished the
applicant and owner of the premises for which said permit was issued, it shall
become a lien against said premises and thereafter be assessed and collected as
a special tax.
   (m)   Settlement of Work Performed. Settlement of the street surfacing, curb
and gutter and/or driveway approaches, irregardless of who installed such the
same, within one (1) year from the date of trench backfilling shall be
construed as evidence of inadequate compaction and the contractor who

prevent obstruction of free and clear vision;
         d.   Away from existing roadside obstructions, such as, but not
limited to, utility poles, guardrails, bridges, blind spots caused by curves or
hills, and other physical limitations; where there are guardrails, mailboxes
shall be installed behind the guardrails, projecting enough for the mail
carrier to reach the mailbox;
         e.   Away from any location where, by reason of the mailbox's shape,
color or position, it may interfere with, obstruct the view of, or be confused
with any authorized traffic control sign or device; and
         f.   In such a location that no portion of the roadside face of the
mailbox extends over the traveled portion of the highway or the outside edge of
the usable shoulder.
      (4)   Mailbox Support Posts; Permissible Mountings. Mailbox support posts

preferred. The post-to-box attachment shall be of sufficient strength to
minimize the possibility of the mailbox separating from the mounting post if
struck by a vehicle.
         h.   Prior to any digging of postholes, it is the responsibility of
the property owner to first call Diggers Hotline to locate any possible
underground utilities [800-242-8511].
         i.   Plastic-housed mailboxes may be used provided that the internal
mounting post complies with the standards of this Section.
         j.   Pursuant to Sec. 346.41(3), Wis. Stats., only blue reflectors may
be attached to any mailbox.
         k.   Newspaper tubes are permitted on the mailbox support post only if
they are of a design that will not interfere with the standards of this Section
or present a hazard to the public use of the right-of-way.
      (5)   Cluster-Type Mailbox Mountings. Multiple mailbox installations may
be permitted as an alternative mounting system provided permission is received
from the Postmaster and the Village of Edgar, and the following standards are
met:
         a.   No more than two (2) mailboxes may be mounted on one support
post. A light- weight newspaper box mounted on a mailbox structure will not be
counted toward this limit. For a multiple installation of two (2) mailbox
posts, support posts shall be spaced a minimum longitudinal distance apart
which is equal to three-quarters of the height of the posts in the
installation. [Example: Where several two (2) mailbox installations are mounted
four (4') feet above the ground on single posts, the posts shall be spaced
three (3') feet apart]. The height and other standards of this Section shall be
complied with.
         b.   Up to four (4) mailboxes may be co-mounted on two (2) connected
supporting posts a minimum of thirty-six (36") inches apart. The height and
other standards of this Section shall be complied with.
         c.   Cluster-type or multiple mailbox installations may not originally
be placed on a parcel without the express permission of the parcel's owner.
   (d)   Prohibited Mailboxes. Due to hazards presented by being located in a
public right-of- way, nonstandard mailboxes are expressly prohibited. A mailbox
installation that does not conform to the standards of this Section is an
unauthorized encroachment and the Village may require that the owner remove or
modify the nonstandard mailbox. This Section is not intended to and shall not
be construed as creating any affirmative duty on the part of the Village of
Edgar to locate and remove every nonconforming mailbox. Examples of nonstandard
mailboxes include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Masonry, concrete or stone columns, standards or landscaping.
      (2)   Receptacles, barrels or milk cans filled with sand, soil or
concrete.
      (3)   Metal or wooden posts exceeding the standards specified in this
Section.

when located in the right-of-way, such as plow blades, wagon or implement
wheels, vehicle parts, comic installations, etc.
      (5)   Railroad ties.
   (e)   Mailboxes Damaged by Village Maintenance Activities.
      (1)   Any mailbox located in a right-of-way potentially may be damaged or
destroyed as a result of traffic or Village maintenance activities. Village
maintenance activities include, but are not limited to, snow removal, pavement
repairs, street cleaning, brush collection, and maintenance/repairs to public
utilities.
      (2)   The Village of Edgar shall not assume any legal liability regarding
any mailbox of any type constructed within the public right-of-way.
      (3)   In the event a mailbox is significantly damaged or destroyed in the
course of Village operations, the Village may provide for reimbursement under
this Subsection. In the case of alleged damage from Village snow removal
activities, payment may only be made for damage resulting from direct contact
damage to a mailbox, not from plow- thrown snow or slush; the Village shall not
be responsible for pieces of a mailbox which have been damaged due to plow-
thrown snow or slush.
      (4)   If the mailbox was not in compliance with the placement and
mounting standards of this Section or was improperly maintained, reimbursement
shall not be made.
      (5)   If it is alleged that a mailbox has been significantly damaged or
destroyed in the course of Village maintenance activities, the Village shall be
contacted by the property owner and a Village representative will inspect the
mailbox and make a determination regarding reimbursement. This determination
shall be final.
      (6)   The Village does not repair or replace damaged mailboxes. The
repair or replacement of a mailbox is the responsibility of the property owner.
If Village responsibility has been determined and the criteria of this
Subsection are met, the Village will provide the property owner with
reimbursement in the amount of Fifty Dollars ($50.00) regardless of whether the
mailbox was of standard or customized design. No additional allowance will be
made for decorative or customized mailboxes. This is the maximum payment amount
and shall apply to damage from all Village maintenance activities and is not
limited to direct contact snow removal damage.
   (f)   Variances. Upon written request, the Village Board may grant a
variance on a case-by- case basis to the requirements of this Section provided
that unique circumstances exist and such variance does not compromise public
safety. Such variance shall be in writing.

person, firm or corporation shall construct, reconstruct, alter or enlarge any
private driveway within the limits of the dedicated portion of any public
street under the control and jurisdiction of the Village of Edgar without first
obtaining a driveway permit therefor as provided by this Chapter from the
Public Works Department. A driveway permit is not required when a new driveway
is to be constructed in conjunction with the construction of a new principal
structure; the driveway is included in the building permit process in such
cases. For bond and insurance requirements, see provisions of Section
6-2-3(g) and (h).
   (c)   Application.

private driveway to be constructed, recon- structed, altered or enlarged lying
within the dedicated portion of the public street, the dimensions thereof and a
statement of the materials proposed to be used. The applicant shall pay a fee
as prescribed in Section
1-3-1. Upon receipt of the application and the fee if required, unless the
proposed private driveway is a part of construction for a building or other
structure for which a building permit has been applied for, in which case no
additional fee is required, the Public Works Department shall approve such
application if the proposed driveway complies with the terms and conditions of
this and any other applicable Village of Edgar ordinances.
      (2)   All applications for permits shall be made on a form prescribed by
the Village Administrator and be accompanied by a sketch in duplicate showing
exact location of any naming:
         a.   Driveway and approaches.
         b.   Property lines.

the applicant's statement that:
      (1)   The applicant represents all parties in interest, and that such
proposed driveway is for the bona fide purpose of securing access to his/her
property and not for the purpose of parking or servicing vehicles, advertising,
storage or merchandising of goods within the dedicated portion of the Village
street, or for any other purpose.
      (2)   The Village of Edgar, notwithstanding the construction of such
driveway, reserves the right to make any changes, additions, repairs or
relocations within the dedicated portion of the Village street at any time,
including relocation, reconstruction, widening and maintaining the street
without compensating the owner of such private driveway for the damage or
destruction of such private roadway.
      (3)   The permittee, his/her successors or assigns, agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless the Village of Edgar, its officials, officers, agents or
employees, against any claim or any cause of action for personal injury or
property damage sustained by reason of the exercise of such permit.
      (4)   The Village of Edgar does not assume any responsibility for the
removal or clearance of snow, ice or sleet or the opening of any windrows of
such material upon such portion of such driveway within the dedicated portion
of the Village street.
Sec. 6-3-2 Driveway and Culvert Location, Design and Construction Requirements.
   (a)   General Requirements. The location, design and construction of
driveways shall be in accordance with the following:
      (1)   General Design. Private driveways shall be of such width and so
located that all of such driveways and their appurtenances are within the
limits of the frontage abutting the street of the property served. Driveways
shall not provide direct ingress or egress to or from any street intersection
area and shall not encroach upon or occupy areas of the street right-of-way
required for effective traffic control or for street signs or signals. A
driveway shall be so located and constructed that vehicles approaching or using
it shall have adequate sight distance along the street. Driveway approaches
shall be at least ten (I 0) feet apart except by special permission from the
Village Board where special circumstances exist, and driveways shall in all
cases be placed wherever possible as not to interfere with utilities in place.
The minimum width of a residential driveway approach shall be ten (10) feet at
the curb line.
      (2)   Number. The number of driveways to serve an individual property
fronting on a street shall be one (1), except where deemed necessary and
feasible by the Village Board for reasonable and adequate service to the
property, considering the safety, convenience and utility of the street.
      (3)   Island Area. The island area in the street right-of-way between
successive driveways or adjoining a driveway and between the highway shoulder
and right-of-way shall constitute a restricted area and may be filled in and
graded only as provided in Subsection (a)(6).
      (4)   Drainage. The surface of the driveway connecting with street cross
sections shall slope downward and away from the highway shoulder a sufficient
distance to preclude ordinary surface water drainage flowing onto the street
roadbed. No driveway apron shall extend out into the street further than the
face of the curb, and under no circumstances shall such driveway apron extend
into the gutter area. All driveway entrances and approaches shall be so
constructed that they shall not interfere with the drainage of streets, side
ditches, or roadside areas or with any existing structure on the right-of-way.
      (5)   Reconstruction of Sidewalks and Curb and Gutter. When the
construction of a driveway requires the removal of a curb or gutter the new
connections shall be of equivalent acceptable material and curb returns shall
be provided or restored in a neat, workmanlike manner. The driveway surface
shall be connected with the highway pavement and the sidewalk, if any, in a
neat, workmanlike manner. The driveway construction shall include the
replacement of such sidewalk areas which are inadequate or which are or may be
damaged by means of vehicle travel across the sidewalk. All driveway entrances
and approaches which are constructed across sidewalks shall be paved in
accordance with the requirements for sidewalk construction in Section
6-2-2 of this Code of Ordinances insofar as such requirements are applicable,
including thickness requirements. Standard thickness of residential driveway
approaches will be six (6) inches thick.
      (6)   Restricted Areas. The restricted area between successive driveways
may be filled in and graded only when the following requirements are complied
with:
         a.   The filling and/or draining shall be to grades approved by the
Public Works Department and, except where highway drainage is by means of curb
and gutter, water drainage of the area shall be directed away from the street
roadbed in a suitable manner.
         b.   Culvert extensions under the restricted area shall be of the same
size and of equivalent acceptable material as the culvert under the driveway.
Intermediate manholes adequate for cleanout purposes may be required where the
total culvert length is excessive.
         c.   Where no street side ditch separates the restricted area from the
street roadbed, permanent provision may be required to separate the area from
the street roadbed to prevent its use for driveway or parking purposes by
construction of a border, curb, rail or posts as may be required by the Public
Works Department.
      (7)   Relocation of Utilities. Any costs of relocating utilities shall be
the responsibility of the property owner with approval of the Public Works
Department necessary before any utility may be relocated and the driveway
installed.
      (8)   Construction Across Sidewalks. All driveway entrances and
approaches which are constructed across sidewalks shall be paved in accordance
with the requirements for sidewalk construction in Section
6-2-2 of this Code of Ordinances insofar as such requirements are applicable,
including thickness requirements.
      (9)   Special Requirements for Driveways Over 150 Feet in Length; Special
Situations.
         a.   In addition to those driveway requirements prescribed herein,
private driveways one hundred and fifty (150) feet and over in length, measured
from the edge of the traveled surface of the intersecting highway to the
structure, shall meet the following standards to permit access to principal
buildings by the Fire Department and/or other public safety authorities:
            1.   A minimum of a twenty-four (24) foot right-of-way;

            4.   A minimum height clearance of fifteen (15) feet; and
            5.   A minimum width of twenty (20) feet for all aprons and
approaches.
         b.   Driveways of one hundred fifty (150) feet and over accessing
parcels on which there are no structural improvements are exempt from the
requirements of this Subsection. However, if a structure is subsequently built,
all standards and requirements for driveways and culverts prescribed by this
Section shall then be fully complied with.
         c.   The Public Works Department, based on recommendations of the Fire
Department, may require additional clear-cut width clearances and extra driving
surface widths to alleviate concerns caused by sharp curves, steep inclines or
other situations which could interfere with emergency vehicles properly and
safely utilizing the driveway.
      (10)   Variances. Any of the above requirements may be varied by the
Village Board in such instances where the peculiar nature of the property or
the design of the street may make the rigid adherence to the above requirements
impossible or impractical.
   (b)   Special Requirements for Commercial and Industrial Driveways. The
following regulations are applicable to driveways serving commercial or
industrial establishments:
      (1)   Width of Drive. The maximum permitted width of a commercial or
industrial driveway approach shall be thirty-five (35) feet at the curb line,
except as increased by permisssible radii. In instances where the unique nature
of the commercial or industrial activity or the physical characteristics of the
land would require a driveway of greater width than herein specified, the
Village Board in its discretion may permit a driveway of additional width.
      (2)   Angular Placement of Driveway. The angle between the center line of
the driveway and the curb line shall not be less than 45°.
      (3)   Island Areas. Where the public sidewalk is adjacent to the curb, an
island of a minimum length of six (6) feet measured along the curb line shall
be placed between each entrance to a Village street. The curb shall be left
intact for the length of this island. Where the public sidewalk is remote from
the curb, an island of a minimum length of ten (10) feet measured along the
right-of-way line shall be maintained along each entrance to the Village
street. All flares shall be tangent to the curb line. A curb length of not less
than three (3) feet shall be left undisturbed adjacent to each property line to
serve as an island area in the event an adjoining property owner applies for a
driveway permit to serve his/her property.
   (c)   Special Requirements for Residential Driveways. The following
regulations are applicable to driveways serving residential property:
      (1)   Width. Unless special permission is first received from the Village
Board, a residential single-type driveway shall be no greater than twenty-four
(24) feet wide or less than ten (10) feet wide at the outer or street edge of
the sidewalk; residential double-type driveways shall be no greater than
twenty-four (24) feet wide at the curb line and eighteen (18) feet wide at the
outer or street edge of the sidewalk.
      (2)   Angular Placement. The center line of the drive may be parallel to
the property line of the lot where access is required or at right angles to the
curb line.
   (d)   Appeal from Permit Refusal. Any person feeling himself/herself
aggrieved by the refusal of the Public Works Department or Village
Administrator to issue a permit for a private driveway may appeal such refusal
to the Village Board within fourteen (14) days after such refusal to issue such
permit is made.
   (e)   Prohibited Driveways.
      (1)   No person, firm or corporation shall place, construct, locate in,
or cause to be placed, constructed or located in, any obstruction or structure
within the limits of any public road, highway or street in the Village of Edgar
except as permitted by this Section. As used herein the word "structure"
includes private driveways, a portion of which extends into any public road,
highway or street, and which is in non-conformance with this Chapter.
      (2)   No driveway shall be closer than thirty-five (35) feet to the
extended street line at an intersection. At street intersections a driveway
shall not provide direct ingress or Driveways; Private Streets egress to or
from the street intersection area and shall not occupy areas of the roadway
deemed necessary by the Village for effective traffic control or for highway
signs or signals.
      (3)   The grade of that portion of any private driveway or pedestrian
path located within the limits of any public road, highway or street shall be
such as shall meet the grade of the existing public roadway at its edge and not
cause an obstruction to the maintenance or clearing of such public roadway.
Whenever possible, the driveway area located within the right-of-way area shall
consist of at least four (4) feet of flat surface area from the pavement edge.
      (4)   No driveway apron shall extend out into the street further than the
facing of the curb and under no circumstances shall such driveway apron extend
into any gutter area. All driveway entrances and approaches shall be
constructed as not to interfere with the drainage of streets, side ditches or
roadside areas, or with any existing structure on the right-of-way.
      (5)   No portion of any curb, parapet or retaining wall, rising above the
grade of the driveway, erected by the owner of the premises involved shall
extend beyond the culvert spanning the water course located in such public way.
   (f)   Culvert Construction and Standards.
      (1)   Culvert Requirement. The Village Board may require the property

property owner shall provide any necessary culvert pipe at his/her expense.
      (2)   Culvert Permit.
         a.   No person shall lay, remove, replace or repair any culvert within
the Village of Edgar unless he/she is under contract with the Village to do
such work or has obtained a permit therefor from the Public Works Department at
least three (3) days before work is undertaken. The Public Works Department
shall determine the diameter of the culvert to be installed which shall not be
less than twelve (12) inches and shall approve of the laying of said culvert so
as to provide proper drainage.
         b.   No person, not under contract to the Village of Edgar, shall lay,
remove, replace or repair any culvert until a permit has been obtained from the
Public Works Department at least three (3) days before work is undertaken. The
fee for such permit shall be as prescribed in Section
1-3-1. The Public Works Department shall view the site for installation of the
culvert and determine the position and diameter of the culvert necessary to
provide adequate drainage.
      (3)   Existing Driveway Situations. The owner of a driveway existing at
the time this Section originally became effective may be required to install a
culvert if such existing driveway shall impede the flow of surface waters. The
Public Works Department shall advise the Village Board of any driveway which
intersects with a public street that impedes the flow of surface water, and the
Village Board shall order the owner thereof to install a proper culvert as
directed by the Public Works Department. The cost of such installation shall be
borne by the owner. If the owner refuses or neglects to install a culvert, the
Village shall, after notice to the owner, proceed to make such installation and
charge the cost therefor to the owner. If such costs are not paid by November
1st, the Village Administrator shall place the charges on the tax roll in the
same manner as a special assessment to be collected with real estate taxes.
      (4)   Size.  Culverts shall be installed prior to construction work being
commenced on the property served. No pipe smaller than twelve (12) inches in
diameter (or equivalent elliptical or arch pipe) will be allowed. All culverts
shall be constructed of galvanized steel or reinforced concrete, and shall be

responsible for the cost thereof. The property owner shall keep his/her
culverts unobstructed and clean.
      (12)   Appeal. Persons may request a variance from the culvert
requirements of this Section by filing a written appeals request with the
Village Administrator, who shall place the matter as an agenda item for the
Village Board's next meeting. The Village Board may only waive the requirement
for a culvert upon a finding that unique physical characteristics of the
location in question render a culvert unnecessary. The Village Engineer or
Public Works Department may be asked to render an opinion on the request.
Sec. 6-3-3 Construction Standards for Private Streets.
   (a)   Standards. All private streets shall be constructed in accordance with
the specifications and requirements of Title 14 of the Village of Edgar Code of
Ordinances for public roads.
   (b)   Drainage.  Street ditch construction along private streets shall be
required in those areas where storm water runoff would otherwise be forced onto
the traveled street's surface due to the topography. All drainage easements

   (a)   Intent and Purpose. It is the policy of the Village of Edgar to
regulate and establish policy for the control of planting, removal, maintenance
and protection of trees and shrubs in or upon all public areas and terrace
areas of the Village to eliminate and guard against dangerous conditions which
may result in injury to persons using the streets, alleys, sidewalks or other
public areas; to promote and enhance the beauty and general welfare of the
Village of Edgar; to prohibit the undesirable and unsafe planting, removal,

   (b)   Kennel Permits; Multiple Dog or Cat Licenses; Kennel Construction

         a.   Any person who keeps more than three (3) animals over the age of
five (5) months shall obtain a kennel permit. In the case of dog or cats, any
person who keeps more than three (3) dog or cats shall, instead of the license
tax for each dog or cat required by this Chapter and state law, apply for a
multiple dog or cat license for the keeping of the dog or cats. Such person
shall pay for the license year a license tax as prescribed in Section
1-3-1 for twelve (12) or fewer dog or cats and an additional fee for each dog
or cat in excess of twelve (12). A kennel permit is required in addition to the
multiple dog or cat license.
         b.   Any person wanting to operate an animal kennel, non-commercial or
commercial, shall apply for a kennel permit with the Village Administrator and
pay a one-time kennel permit application review fee per Section
1-3-1, in addition to any other required licensing fees. An application for a
kennel permit shall state the name and address of the owner of the proposed
kennel, the location of where the kennel is proposed to be located, and the
number of animal and means of confinement proposed to be kept. In the case of
dog or cats, upon payment of the required multiple dog or cat license tax, and
upon presentation of evidence that all dog or cats over five (5) months of age
are currently immunized against rabies, the Village Administrator shall issue
the multiple dog or cat license and a number of tags equal to the number of dog
or cats authorized to be kept following Village Board approval of a kennel
permit application; the multiple dog or cat license is a requirement separate
from the kennel permit. Kennel construction standards in Section
7-1-27 shall be complied with.
         c.   Village Board approval is required for all kennels. With all
kennel permit applications, the Police Department shall provide a written
recommendation to the Village Board. A kennel may only be located in a
residential area following a public hearing and approval by the Village Board;
the Village Board may attach conditions to such approval as a conditional use
under the Village Zoning Code. The Village Board may revoke any kennel permit
for violation of this Chapter after reasonable notice and opportunity to be
heard is given the kennel permit holder.
      (2)   Multiple Dog or Cat License Tags; Requirements; Exceptions. The
owner or keeper of multiple dog or cats shall keep at all times a multiple dog
or cat license tag attached to the collar of each dog or cat over five (5)
months old kept by the owner or keeper under a multiple dog or cat license but
this requirement does not apply to a show dog or cat during competition, to a
dog or cat securely confined indoors or to a dog or cat securely confined in a
fenced area. The rabies vaccination tag or substitute tag shall remain attached
to the dog or cat for which it is issued at all times but this requirement does
not apply to a show dog or cat during competition, to a dog or cat securely
confined indoors or to a dog or cat securely confined in a fenced area.
      (3)   Confinement/Leash Requirement. No dog or cat bearing a multiple dog
or cat tag shall be permitted to stray or to be taken anywhere outside the
limits of the owner's premises unless the dog or cat is on a leash or
temporarily unconfined/unleased for the purposes of hunting, breeding, trial,
training or competition.
      (4)   Humane Animal Treatment Requirement.  No kennel permit or multiple
dog or cat license shall be issued to the keeper or operator of multiple dog or
cats or animals who fails to provide proper food and drink and proper shelter
for the animals or who neglects or abandons said animals. Village enforcement
officials shall investigate any complaints regarding the failure to maintain
proper standards or investigate any multiple dog or cat premises upon his/her
own initiative. Expressly incorporated by reference in this Section as minimum
standards for kennel permit holders or multiple dog or cat keepers are the
relevant provisions of Ch. 174, Wis. Stats.
      (5)   Inspection Consent. A condition of being issued a kennel permit or
multiple dog or cat license shall be that the licensed premises may be entered
and inspected at any reasonable hour by appropriate Village officials without
any warrant, and the application for a license hereunder shall be deemed a
consent to this provision. Any refusal to permit such inspection shall
automatically operate as a revocation of any license issued hereunder and shall
be deemed a violation of this Section. Should any premises with a kennel permit
or multiple dog or cat license be found to constitute a public nuisance, the
license or permit shall be revoked and the nuisance abated pursuant to Village
ordinances.
      (6)   Kennel Construction and Operation; Setback for Pens and Leashed
Dog. The following requirements apply to kennels:
         a.   No kennel permit shall be granted to any owner for the operation
of an outdoor kennel unless the area within which the animals are to sleep, eat
or exercise shall be completely enclosed with a wire mesh fence of appropriate
height and strength to ensure proper confinement of said animals. A building
permit shall be obtained from the Village for any dog pen or kennel structure.
         b.   No dog or animal outdoor pen/house/run may be constructed closer
than ten (10) feet from a property line. No dog shall be tied so that it is
closer than ten (10) feet from a property line.
         c.   Every kennel or animal outdoor confinement structure shall be
maintained and operated in a neat and sanitary manner. All refuse and animal
waste shall be removed at regular intervals to minimize odors and infestations
of insects or vermin. No owner of the kennel shall permit any of the animals to
create an unusual or excessive noise from howling, barking, or in any other
manner create a disturbance or nuisance of any kind which unduly impairs the
quiet and peaceful enjoyment of the surrounding area by other residents.
   (c)   Exemption for Leader Dogs and Service Animals.
      (1)   Service Animals. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all service animals

all times when an animal is unattended by an adult. The first (innermost)
enclosure shall have double entrance gates or doors situated and constructed in

person possessing any registration papers, certificate, advertisement or other

Sec. 7-1-25 Keeping of Chickens on Residential Parcels.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to provide standards for the
keeping of a limited number of domesticated chickens and other poultry on
residential parcels in the Village of Edgar on a non-commercial basis while
limiting the potential adverse impacts on the surrounding neighborhood. The
Village recognizes that the keeping of backyard chickens helps provide locally
produced, affordable and sustainable food. In addition, the keeping of such
chickens can also provide animal companionship, weed and insect control, and
nitrogen-rich fertilizer. The Village of Edgar recognizes, however, that
potential adverse impacts may result from the keeping of domesticated chickens
as a result of odor, unsanitary waste removal and storage practices, noise,
improper living conditions, non- confined poultry leaving the owner's property,
and the attraction of predators, rodents or insects. This Section is intended
to balance these interests. This Section is not intended to apply to indoor
non-poultry birds kept as pets, including, but not limited to, parrots and
parakeets, nor to the lawful transportation of fowl through the Village of
Edgar.
   (b)   Definitions. The following definitions shall be applicable in this
Section:

chickens, ducks, pigeons, doves, and quail. [Note: Other poultry types are

      (2)   Chicken Coop. A structure or building for the sheltering of
chickens or other poultry. An existing shed or garage may be utilized for this
purpose if it meets the standards of this Section, including required distances
to property lines and neighboring residences. Also known as a "hen house" or
"chicken house".
      (3)   Chicken Pen. An outdoor fenced area for poultry grazing and
exercise use associated with a chicken coop structure. Also known as a "run".
   (c)   Where Permitted. Chickens may be raised on one- or two-family
residential-zoned parcels, as defined in the Village of Edgar Zoning Code, in
accordance with the regulations prescribed in this Section where a principal
residence exists on the parcel.
   (d)   Permit Required; Application Requirements. No chickens may be kept in
the Village of Edgar on parcels with a residential zoning classification except
pursuant to a permit obtained from the Village of Edgar under this Section. A
permit may be issued upon the applicant's meeting of the application
requirements below and the husbandry and location standards of this Section:
      (1)   Consent From Adult Residents. The applicant must provide the
written consent from all adult residents residing on the parcel for which the
permit is sought.
      (2)   Consent From Two-Family/Three Family Neighbors. In the case of an
applicant residing on a parcel with a two-family or three-family residence, the
applicant must furnish with an application the written consent from the adult
occupants of the other residential unit(s) on the parcel.
      (3)   Site Plan. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing the
location and dimensions of the proposed chicken coop and any associated pen,
and the distance of the coop and pen from all lot lines and principal
structures located on adjacent lots.
      (4)   Fee. The applicant shall make payment of the initial permit fee or
renewal fee prescribed in Section
1-3-1. Permit fees will not be pro-rated in the case of mid-year applications.
      (5)   Inspection Consent. Application and issuance of a permit under this
Section constitutes consent by the applicant to the Village of Edgar and any of
its employees or agents to enter upon the applicant's property to ascertain
compliance with this Section and with the terms of the permit, for as long as a
permit is in effect.
      (6)   Permit Issuance; Appeals.
         a.   Permits will be issued by the Village Administrator upon a
finding that all conditions for a permit have been met. Written notice of the
granting or denial of an application shall be provided to the applicant and to
any person who has filed an objection to the granting of the permit. If a
permit is denied, the Village will provide the reasons for such denial.
         b.   The Village may specify maximum size limits for a chicken coop
and/or pen as a condition of permit issuance.
         c.   Any person aggrieved by the granting or denial of a permit may
have such grant or denial reviewed by the Village Board by filing a written
request for review with the Village Administrator no later than ten (10) days
after the mailing date of the notice of grant or denial.

any such person notice of a non-revocation on the basis of such complaint.
      (4)   Permit Revocation Appeals. Any person aggrieved by the revocation
or non- revocation of a permit may appeal such decision and have the action
reviewed by the Village Board by filing a written request for review with the
Village Administrator no later than ten (10) days after the mailing date of the
notice of action.

be necessary to determine whether the applicant and the premises sought to be
licensed comply with the regulations, ordinances and laws applicable thereto,
including those governing sanitation in restaurants, and whether the applicant
is a proper recipient of a license. These officials shall furnish to the
Village Administrator in writing, who shall forward to the Village Board, the
information derived from such investigation, accompanied by a recommendation as
to whether a license should be granted or refused. No license shall be renewed
without a re- inspection of the premises and report as originally required.
Sec. 7-2-9 Approval of Application.
   (a)   Unpaid Taxes and Municipal Obligations. No license shall be issued for
operation on any premises or with any equipment for which taxes, assessments,
forfeitures or other financial claims of the Village of Edgar are delinquent
and unpaid.
   (b)   Sanitary, Health and Safety Standards. No license shall be issued
unless the premises conform to the fire, sanitary, safety and health
requirements of the State and Village Building Code, the regulations of the
State Board of Health and local Board of Health applicable to restaurants, and
State and Village Fire Codes. The premises must be properly lighted and
ventilated, must be equipped with separate sanitary toilet and lavatory
facilities equipped with running water for each sex and must conform to all

   (c)   Application Review Criteria. Consideration for the granting or denial
of a license will be based on, but not linited to:

      (2)   The financial responsibility of the applicant;
      (3)   The appropriateness of the location and the premises where the
licensed business is to be conducted; and
      (4)   Generally, the applicant's fitness for the trust to be reposed.
   (d)   Consideration of Past Offenses. An application may be denied based
upon the applicant's arrest and conviction record if the applicant has been
convicted of a felony (unless duly pardoned) or if the applicant has habitually
been a law offender. For purposes of this licensing procedure, "habitually been
a law offender" is generally considered to be an arrest or conviction of at
least two (2) offenses which are substantially related to the licensed activity
within the five (5) years immediately preceding the license application.
Because a license is a privilege, the issuance of which is a right granted
solely to the Village Board, the Village Board reserves the right to consider
the severity, and facts and circumstances of the offense when making the
determination to grant, deny or not renew a license. Further, the Village
Board, at its discretion, may, based upon an arrest or conviction record of two
(2) or more offenses which are substantially related to the licensed activity
within the five (5) years immediately preceding, act to suspend such license
for a period of one (1) year or more.
Sec. 7-2-10 Granting of License.

the Village of Edgar. The full license fee shall be charged for the whole or
fraction of any year.

   (c)   Denial of License. If the Village Board denies the license, the
applicant shall be notified in writing, by registered mail or personal service,
of the reasons for the denial. The notice shall also inform the applicant of
the opportunity to appear before the Village Board and to provide evidence as
to why the denial should be reversed. In addition, the Village Board shall
inform the applicant that the reconsideration of the application shall be held
in closed session, pursuant to Sec. 19.85(1)(b), Wis. Stats., unless the

reissuance of said license and the Village of Edgar, as the licensing
authority, shall in no way be bound to reissue said license to said subsequent
purchaser.
   (b)   Change in Corporate Agent. Whenever the agent of a corporate holder of
a license is for any reason replaced, the licensee shall give Village

new appointment. Until the next regular meeting or special meeting of the
Village Board, the successor agent shall have the authority to perform the

Sec. 7-2-20 Nude Dancing in Licensed Establishments Prohibited.
   (a)   Authority.
      (1)   The Village Board of the Village of Edgar has explicit authority
under Sec. 125.10(1), Wis. Stats., to adopt regulations governing the sale of
alcohol beverages which are in addition to those set forth in Ch. 125, Wis.
Stats.; and
      (2)   The Village Board has authority under its general police powers set
forth in Ch. 62, Wis. Stats., to act for the good order of the municipality and
for the health, safety and welfare of the public; and may carry out its powers
by regulation and suppression; and
      (3)   The Village Board recognizes it lacks authority to regulate
obscenity and does not intend by adopting this Section to regulate obscenity,
since nudity in and of itself is not obscene, it declares its intent to enact
an ordinance addressing the secondary effects of live, totally nude, non-
obscene, erotic dancing in bars and taverns; and
      (4)   Bars and taverns featuring live totally nude, non-obscene, erotic
dancing have in other communities tended to further the increase of criminal
and other offensive activity, to disrupt the peace and order of the
communities, to depreciate the value of real property, to harm the economic
welfare of the communities and to negatively affect the quality of life of the
communities; and such secondary effects are detrimental to the public health,
safety and general welfare of citizens; and
      (5)   The Village Board recognizes the U.S. Supreme Court has held that
nude dancing is expressive conduct within the outer perimeters of the First
Amendment to the United States Constitution and therefore entitled to some
limited protection under the First Amendment, and the governing body further
recognizes that freedom of speech is among our most precious and highly
protected rights, and wishes to act consistently with full protection of those
rights; and
      (6)   However, the Village Board is aware, based on the experiences of
other communities, that bars and taverns in which live, totally nude, non-
obscene, erotic dancing occurs may and do generate secondary effects which the
governing body believes are detrimental to the public health, safety and
welfare of the citizens of the Village of Edgar; and
      (7)   Among these secondary effects are:
         a.   The potential increase in prostitution and other sex-related
offenses, as well as other crimes and offenses;
         b.   The potential depreciation of property values in neighborhoods
where bars and
taverns featuring nude dancing exist;
         c.   Health risks associated with the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases; and
         d.   The potential for infiltration by organized crime for the purpose
of unlawful conduct.
      (8)   The Village Board desires to minimize, prevent and control these
adverse effects and thereby protect the health, safety and general welfare of
the citizens of the Village of Edgar; protect the citizens from increased
crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and character
of surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the spread of urban blight; and
      (9)   The Village Board has determined that enactment of an ordinance
prohibiting live, totally nude, non-obscene, erotic dancing in bars and taverns
licensed to serve alcohol beverages promotes the goal of minimizing, preventing
and controlling the negative secondary effects associated with such activity.
   (b)   Nude Dancing in Licensed Establishments Prohibited. It is unlawful for
any person to perform or engage in, or for any licensee or manager or agent of
the licensee to permit any person, employee, entertainer or patron to perform
or engage in any live act, demonstration, dance or exhibition on the premises
of a licensed establishment which:
      (I) Shows his/her genitals, pubic area, vulva, anus, anal cleft or
cleavage with less than a fully opaque covering; or
      (2)   Shows any portion of the female breast below a point immediately
above the top of the areola; or
      (3)   Shows the covered male genitals in a discemably turgid state.
   (c)   Exemptions. The provisions of this Section does not apply to the
following licensed establishments; theaters, performing arts centers, civic
centers, and dinner theaters where live dance, ballet, music and dramatic
performances of serious artistic merit are offered on a regular basis and in
which the predominant business or attraction is not the offering to customers
of entertainment which is intended to provide sexual stimulation or sexual
gratification to such customers and where the establishment is not
distinguished by an emphasis on, or the advertising or promotion of, employees
engaging in nude erotic dancing.
   (d)   Definitions. For purposes of this Section, the term "licensed
establishment" means any establishment licensed by the Village Board of the
Village of Edgar to sell alcohol beverages pursuant to Ch. 125, Wis. Stats. The
term "licensee" means the holder of a retail "Class A", "Class B", Class "B",
Class "A", or "Class C" licensee granted by the Village Board of the Village of
Edgar pursuant to Ch. 125, Wis. Stats.
   (e)   Penalties. Any person, partnership or corporation who violates any of
the provisions of this Section shall be subject to a forfeiture pursuant to
Section
1-1-6. A separate offense and violation shall be deemed committed on each day
on which a violation occurs or continues. In addition, violation of this
Section constitutes sufficient grounds for suspending, revoking or non-renewing
an alcohol beverage license under Sec. 125.12, Wis. Stats.

   (b)   Denial Notice; Reconsideration.
      (1)   If the application is denied by the Village Administrator, the
Village Administrator shall, in writing, inform the applicant of the denial,
the reasons therefore, and of the opportunity to request a reconsideration of
the application by the Village Board in a closed session. Such notice must be
sent by registered mail to, or served upon, the applicant at least ten (10)

125.12(2)(d), Wis. Stats., for review.
   (c)   Licensing Criteria.
      (1)   Consideration for the granting or denial of a license will be based
on:
         a.   Arrest and conviction record of the applicant, subject to the
limitations imposed by Sections 111.321, 111.322, and 111.335, Wis. Stats.;
         b.   The financial responsibility of the applicant;
         c.   The appropriateness of the location and the premises where the
licensed operator's work is to be conducted; and
         d.   Generally, the applicant's fitness for the trust to be reposed.
      (2)   If a Licensee is convicted of an offense substantially related to
the licensed activity, the Village Board may act to revoke or suspend the
license.
   (d)   Consideration of Past Offenses. An application may be denied based
upon the applicant's arrest and conviction record if the applicant has been
convicted of a felony (unless duly pardoned) or if the applicant has habitually
been a law offender. For purposes of this licensing procedure, "habitually been
a law offender" is generally considered to be an arrest or conviction of at
least two (2) offenses which are substantially related to the licensed activity
within the five (5) years immediately preceding the license application.
Because a license is a privilege, the issuance of which is a right granted to
the Village Administrator, the Village Administrator or the Village Board on
appeal, reserves the right to consider the severity, and facts and
circumstances of the offense when making the determination to grant, deny or
not renew a license. Further, the Village Administrator, or the Village Board
on Appeal, at their discretion, may, based upon an arrest or conviction record
of two (2) or more offenses which are substantially related to the licensed
activity within the five (5) years immediately preceding, act to suspend such
license for a period of one (I) year or more.

Synthetic Drug Establishments
   
7-9-1   Findings of Fact; Statement of Purpose
   
7-9-2   Definitions
   
7-9-3   Licensing of Synthetic Drug Establishments
   
7-9-4   Prohibited Acts and Conduct
Sec. 7-9-1 Findings of Fact; Statement of Purpose.
   (a)   Findings of Fact. The Village Board of the Village of Edgar finds the
following facts to exist:
      (1)   Law enforcement authorities have advised Village officials that the
increased use of synthetic drugs is negatively affecting the health, safety and
welfare of the public.
      (2)   Synthetic drugs are commonly marketed as a safe and legal
alternative to marijuana or other controlled substances regulated by Chapter
961, Wis. Starts.
      (3)   Ingestion of synthetic drugs has been shown to produce dangerous
side effects such as, but not limited to:
         a.   Nausea;
         b.   Vomiting;
         c.   Hallucinations;
         d.   Blurred vision;
         e.   Delusions;
         f.   Headaches;
         g.   Agitation;
         h.   Anxiety;
         i.   Insomnia;
         j.   Convulsions;
         k.   Addiction;
         I.   Psychosis;
         m.   Elevated blood pressure;
         n.   Loss of consciousness;
         o.   Tremors;
         p.   Suicidal thoughts;
         q.   Seizures;
         r.   Paranoid behavior;
         s.   Elevated or irregular heart rates; and
         t.   death.
      (4)   Due to the manner in which such synthetic substances are marketed,
the manufacture and sale of synthetic drugs is purportedly not fully regulated
by the federal Food And Drug Administration (FDA) and/or federal drug
enforcement authorities.
      (5)   Because slight molecular alterations can be made to chemical
compounds, law enforcement authorities have often found it difficult to take
enforcement actions against manufacturers and sellers of synthetic drug
products. Synthetic drugs are currently being sold without even basic
regulation and licensing requirements of the type other businesses in the
Village of Edgar must comply with.
      (6)   Like the marketing of synthetic cannabinoids [such as, but not
limited to, Spice/K2], as incense, these substances are commercially available
and in some instances are marketed as "bath salts" under such names as Bliss,
Vanilla Sky, White Lightning, Ivory Snow, Red Dove and Hurricane Charlie, or
are packaged or marketed as potpourri, incense, plant food, spice, tobacco, or
dietary supplements.
      (7)   The establishment of retail points of sale for synthetic drug
products in the Village of Edgar would increase the use of synthetic drugs, and
would likely have negative secondary effects on nearby businesses and
residences.
   (b)   Statement of Purpose. This Chapter provides certain minimum licensing
standards for establishments making available to the public synthetic drugs.
The purpose of this Chapter is not to condone illegal activity nor is it to
legitimize activity that may now, or in the future, be considered illegal
activity under state or federal laws or local ordinances.
Sec. 7-9-2 Definitions.
For purposes of this Chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the
following meanings:

      (2)   A substance that a reasonable person would believe is being
purchased, sold or given away as a synthetic drug;
      (3)   A substance which has been listed as a regular synthetic drug in
the Wisconsin Statutes or Village ordinances, and their derivatives, analogues,
homologues, salts, optical isomers and salts of optical isomers with
substantially similar chemical structure and pharmacological activity as a
synthetic drug or other controlled substance; or
      (4)   A substance that a person knows or should have known was intended
to be consumed by ingestion, inhalation, injection or any other immediate
means, and consumption was intended to cause or simulate a depressant,
stimulant or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is
substantially similar to or greater than the depressant, stimulant or
hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a controlled substance
on Schedule I through Vas defined in Chapter 961, Wis. Stats. "Synthetic drug"
does not mean legal food or drug ingredients, prescription drugs, alcohol,
tobacco or dietary supplements.

person engages in the sale or giving away of synthetic drugs.
Sec. 7-9-3 Licensing of Synthetic Drug Establishments.

         c.   The full names and addresses of the property owner, business
owner, business manager or agent, lessee, and business operator, and the date
of birth and contact information (email address; cellphone, landline and fax
numbers) of each;
         d.   If the applicant is a partnership, limited liability corporation
or corporation, the full names and residence addresses of each of the partners
including limited partners, and the address of the business entity if different

         e.   A statement from each of the above individuals as to whether any
of the aforementioned individuals have ever been convicted of any crime or

including date, time, place and disposition.
      (2)   An annual license per Section
1-3-1 shall be paid at the time the application is filed with the Village

or operated a business concerning the applicant's arrest and conviction record.
      (2)   Based upon such investigations, the law enforcement authorities,

provided for such recommendation.
      (3)   No license shall be renewed without an investigative report as
originally required.
      (4)   No license shall be issued for operations on any premises or with
any equipment for which taxes, assessments, forfeitures or other financial
claims of the Village of Edgar are delinquent and unpaid.
   (d)   License Determination.
      (1)   Opportunity shall be given by the Village Board to any person to be
heard for or against the granting of a license.
      (2)   If the Village Administrator or other Village official finds that
they have insufficient information to evaluate the license application, they
may request that the applicant or his/her agent file an amended application or
appear at a reasonable time and place to give under oath information concerning
the application. No license shall be granted to any applicant who refuses to
cooperate with the investigation process or who fails to appear, personally or
by his/her agent, before the Village Board when the license application is

the law;

procedure, "habitually been a law offender" is generally considered to be an
arrest or conviction of at least two (2) offenses which are substantially
related to the licensed activity within the five (5) years immediately
preceding the license application. Because a license is a privilege, the
issuance of Synthetic Drug Establishments which is a right granted solely to
the Village Board, the Village Board reserves the right to consider the
severity, and the facts and circumstances of the offense when making its
determination to grant, deny or not renew a license. In addition, the Village
Board, at its discretion, may, based upon an arrest or conviction of two (2) or
more offenses which are substantially related to the licensed activity within
five (5) years immediately preceding, act to suspend such license for a period
of up to one (1) year or revoke the license.
      (5)   If the Village Board denies the license, the applicant shall be
notified, in writing, by personal service or certified mail, of the reasons for
the denial. The notice shall also inform the applicant of the opportunity to
appear before the Village Board and to provide evidence as to why the denial
should be reversed. Written notice of any reconsideration shall be mailed to
the applicant a minimum of seven (7) days prior to the Village Board meeting at
which the application is to be reconsidered.
   (e)   Posting of License. Every person licensed in accordance with the
provisions of this Chapter shall post such license and keep the same posted in
a conspicuous place on the premises.
   (f)   Suspension or Revocation of Licenses. The Village Board may suspend or
revoke any license issued under this Chapter, if, after giving the licensee the
opportunity to be heard on the matter, the Village Board finds:
      (1)   The licensee has violated a provision of this Chapter or any other
law relating to the conduct of its operation including, but not limited to,
federal, state or local laws;
      (2)   The licensee secured the license through misrepresentation or fraud
regarding any material fact in the license application;
      (3)   The failure of the licensee to cooperate with law enforcement, fire
or health authorities in any investigation relating to their operations or
failure to admit law enforcement officers into the establishment at any time
when people are present in the establishment;
      (4)   The establishment is operated in such a way as to endanger public
health or safety; or
      (5)   The establishment is operated in such a way as to constitute a
public nuisance under Sec. 823.07, Wis. Stats., or Village ordinances.
   (g)   Consent to Entry. Every applicant procuring a license thereby consents
to the entry of law enforcement authorities or duly authorized representatives
of the Village of Edgar at all reasonable hours for the purpose of inspection
and search, and consents to the removal from said premises of all things and
articles that are in violation of Village ordinances or state laws, and
consents to the introduction of such things and articles in evidence in any
prosecution that may be brought for such offenses.
   (h)   Licensee or Permittee Responsible for Acts of Help. A violation of
this Chapter by a duly authorized agent or employee of a licensee under this
Chapter shall constitute a violation by the licensee.

Sec. 7-10-1 Finding of Fact; Purpose.
   (a)   Findings of Fact. For purposes of this Chapter, the Village Board of
the Village of Edgar makes the following findings of fact:
      (1)   It is a lawful purpose of the Village Board of the Village of Edgar
to enact regulatory ordinances under its police powers protecting and promoting
the general welfare, orderly conduct, health and safety of its citizens; and
      (2)   The Village Board of the Village of Edgar believes that it is in
the best interests of the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of
the Village to regulate and thereby diminish the dangerous and/or negative
secondary effects that accompany adult oriented establishments; and
      (3)   Such dangerous and/or negative secondary effects associated with
adult oriented businesses include, but are not limited to, increased criminal
activity of both a sexual and violent nature; lowered property values; urban
blight; a loss of pride in a community; and an increase in sexually transmitted
diseases; and
      (4)   The Village Board of the Village of Edgar has knowledge of studies
conducted by Phoenix, Arizona; Whittier, California; Adams County, Colorado;
Indianapolis, Indiana; New York, New York; New Hanover County, North Carolina;
Austin, Texas; Beaumont, Texas; Dallas, Texas; El Paso, Texas; and Newport
News, Virginia, that indicate that adult oriented establishments have either a
strong or direct correlation to increased crime; and
      (5)   A land use study conducted by the City of Phoenix, Arizona, which
studied the link between adult oriented establishments and their relationship
to increased crime found that the number of sex offenses was five hundred and
six percent (506%) greater in neighborhoods where adult oriented establishments
were located, and which also concluded that the crimes of sexual assault, lewd
and lascivious behavior and child molestation were one hundred and thirty-two
percent (132%) greater in neighborhoods in which adult oriented establishments
were located; and
      (6)   The Village Board of the Village of Edgar has knowledge of studies
conducted by Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Indianapolis,
Indiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Las Vegas, Nevada; New York, New York; New
Hanover County, North Carolina; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Austin, Texas; El
Paso, Texas; Newport News, Virginia; and St. Croix County, Wisconsin, that
indicate a correlation between the location of adult oriented establishments
and decreased property values of the surrounding areas; and
      (7)   A study surveying one hundred (100) Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, real
estate appraisers concluded that a concentration of adult oriented businesses
may mean large losses in area property values; and
      (8)   The Village Board of the Village of Edgar has knowledge of studies
conducted by Minneapolis, Minnesota; Elliotsville, New York; Islip, New York;
New Hanover County, North Carolina; Amarillo, Texas; and El Paso, Texas, which
conclude that when adult oriented establishments are allowed to concentrate in
one area the negative secondary effects of adult oriented establishments may be
magnified; and
      (9)   The Elliotsville, New York, Village Board of Trustees found that
isolation of adult oriented establishments limits their negative secondary
effects; and
      (10)   A report by the Islip, New York, Department of Planning found that
the location of two (2) adult oriented establishments located near each other
created a "dead zone" in an otherwise healthy business district; and
      (11)   A legislative report prepared by the Sexually Oriented Business
Revision Committee for the Houston, Texas, City Council concluded that due to
criminal activity associated with adult oriented establishments, licenses
should be required of all adult oriented establishment employees; and
      (12)   A report based on a memorandum from the Tuscon Police Department
Investigative Services Division to the City Prosecutor conducted by the City of
Tuscon, Arizona, dated May I, 1990, concluded that police officers found a wide
variety of illegal sexual conduct at all adult oriented establishments and that
virtually every establishment had employees arrested for prostitution or
obscene sex shows and which found that one of the employees arrested for such
acts was a 15 year old girl; and
      (13)   A legislative report prepared by the Sexually Oriented Business
Revision Committee for the Houston, Texas, City Council concluded that the lack
of clear lines of view, insufficient lighting and locked rooms decreases the
ability of adult oriented establishment owners, managers and employees from
monitoring behavior and preventing lewd behavior on the part of customers, and
that this is behavior which may lead to unsanitary conditions and the spread of
communicable diseases.

issue a permit to the applicant subject to the foregoing requirements of this
Chapter, unless the Village Board concludes that:
      (1)   The policing of the usage will require so large a number of persons
and vehicles, including ambulances, as to prevent adequate service of the needs
of the rest of the municipality; or
      (2)   The usage will substantially hinder the movement of law enforcement
and fire and other emergency vehicles as to create a substantial risk to
persons and property; or
      (3)   The conduct of the usage will substantially interrupt the safe and
orderly movement of other traffic contiguous to its route; or
      (4)   The usage is so poorly organized that participants are likely to
engage in aggressive or destructive activity.

forty-five (45) days in advance shall be taken within fifteen (15) days after
the application is filed, but in no case later than forty-eight (48) hours in
advance of the time applied for. The Village Administrator shall immediately,
by the most reasonable means of communication, notify the applicant of such
action and, if the application is denied, the reasons for denial of the permit.
      (2)   Modification of Requested Permit. In lieu of denying a permit, the
Village Administrator or designee may authorize the changing of assembly areas
or dispersal areas or the conducting of the usage at a date or time or over a

may accept such modification by immediately notifying the Village Administrator
in writing of such acceptance.

permittee to make an additional payment into the general fund of the Village in
an amount equal to the increased costs.
   (l)   Emergency Revocation. The Village President, Village Administrator or
a law enforcement officer may revoke a permit already issued if the official
deems that such action is justified by an actual or potential emergency due to
weather, fire, riot, other catastrophe or likelihood of a breach of the peace
or by a major change in the conditions forming the basis of the standards of
issuance. In lieu of revoking a permit, an above- named official may require
the permittee to file evidence of good and sufficient sureties, insurance in

Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000.00).
   (g)   Revocation Of An Approved Natural Landscape Management Plan Permit.
The Weed Commissioner, Building Inspector, Zoning Administrator, Village
Administrator or Jaw enforcement officer shall have the authority to revoke an
approved Natural Landscape Management Plan Permit if the owner fails to
maintain the natural landscape or comply with the provisions set forth in this
Section. Notice of intent to revoke an approved Natural Landscape Management
Plan Permit shall be appealable to the Village Board. All applica- tions for
appeal shall be submitted within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of the
written Notice of Intent to revoke the approved Natural Landscape Management
Plan. Failure to file an application for appeal within the fifteen (15)
calendar days shall result in the revoking of the Natural Landscape Management
Plan Permit. All written applications for appeal filed within the fifteen (15)
calendar day requirement shall be reviewed by the Village Board in an open
meeting. The decision rendered by the Village Board shall be final and binding.
   (h)   Public Nuisance Defined - Abatement After Notice.
      (1)   The growth of a natural landscape as defined in this Section shall
be considered a public nuisance unless a Natural Landscape Management Plan has
been filed and approved and a permit is issued by the Village of Edgar as set
forth in this Section. Violators shall be served with a notice of public
nuisance by certified mail to the last- known mailing address of the property
owner.
      (2)   If the person so served with a notice of public nuisance violation
does not abate the nuisance within ten (I 0) days, the enforcement officer may
proceed to abate such nuisance, keeping an account of the expense of the
abatement, and such expense shall be charged to and paid by such property
owner. Notice of the bill for abatement of the public nuisance shall be mailed
to the owner of the premises and shall be payable within ten (10) calendar days
from receipt thereof. Within sixty (60) days after such costs and expenses are
incurred and remain unpaid, the Village Administrator shall enter those charges
onto the tax roll as a special tax as provided by state statute.
      (3)   The failure of the Village Administrator to record such claim or to
mail such notice or the failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not
affect the right to place the Village expense on the tax rolls for unpaid bills
for abating the public nuisance as provided for in this Section.
   (i)   Penalty.
      (1)   Any person, firm or corporation which does not abate the nuisance
within the required time period or who otherwise violates the provisions of
this Section shall be subject to the general penalty found in Section
1-1-6.
      (2)   In addition to any penalties herein provided, the Village of Edgar
may issue stop work orders upon owners of lots where work is unfinished under a
previously issued permit for any violation of this Section.
Sec. 8-1-6 Regulation of Length of Lawn and Grasses.
   (a)   Purpose.
      (1)   General Intent. This Section is adopted due to the unique nature of
the problems associated with lawns, grasses and noxious weeds being allowed to
grow to excessive length in the Village of Edgar, adversely impacting the
public health and safety. Except as provided in Section
8-1-5, the owner or occupant of any lot or parcel in the Village which is one
(1) acre or less in area around a residence shall install and maintain
landscaping, plantings and other decorative surface treatments, including turf
grass, so as to present an attractive appearance in all yard areas in
accordance with generally accepted landscaping practices in Wisconsin.
Plantings shall be maintained so as not to present hazards to adjoining
properties or to persons or vehicles traveling on public ways and shall be
maintained so as to enhance the appearance and value of the property on which
located and thereby the appearance and value of the neighborhood and the
Village of Edgar.
      (2)   Definitions. The terms used in this Section and Section
8-1-5.
         a.   Turf Grass. Grass commonly used in regularly cut lawns or play
areas such as, but not limited to, blue grass, fescue and rye grass blends.
         b.   Natural Lawn. Any land managed to preserve or restore native
Wisconsin grasses and forbes, native trees, shrubs, wildflowers and aquatic
plants.
   (b)   Public Nuisance Declared.
      (1)   Occupied Residential Lots. The Village Board finds that lawns,
grasses and noxious weeds on non-agricultural occupied residential lots or
parcels of land one (1) acre or under around a residence, as classified under
the Village Zoning Code, within the Village of Edgar which exceed eight (8)
inches in length adversely affect the public health and safety of the public in
that they tend to emit pollen and other discomforting bits of plants,
constitute a fire hazard and a safety hazard in that debris can be hidden in
the grass, interferes with the public convenience and adversely affects
property values of other land within the Village. For that reason, any non-
agricultural lawn, grasses or weeds on an occupied residential lot or other
parcel of land one (I) acre or under in size which exceeds eight (8) inches in
length is hereby declared to be a public nuisance, except for property located
in a designated floodplain area and/or wetland area or where the lawn, grass or
weed is part of a natural lawn approved pursuant to Section
8-1-5 above.
      (2)   Vacant or Undeveloped Lots.
         a.   Grasses and weeds on vacant lots shall be maintained to the eight
(8) inch height standard of this Section in the area of the lot within ten (10)
feet of a sidewalk, or where there is no sidewalk within twenty (20) feet of
the street edge.
         b.   If a vacant lot is adjacent to a developed and occupied lot, the
entire vacant lot shall be maintained to the eight (8) inch weeds and grasses
height standard.
      (3)   Commercial Lots. In the case of commercial parcels, the owner of
the parcel shall comply with the eight (8) inch height restrictions of this
Section in the area of the parcel from the street to the back side of the
building (if present) or for a distance of one hundred (100) feet, whichever is
less restrictive.

public nuisance as defined in Subsections (a) or (b) above to remain on any
premises owned or controlled by him/her within the Village of Edgar.
   (d)   Inspection. A Village representative will inspect lawns when a
complaint is received or notice given by a Village official to determine
whether any public nuisance as defined in Subsection (b) above exists.
   (e)   Abatement of Nuisance.
      (1)   If the Village official determines with reasonable certainty that
any public nuisance as defined in Subsection (b) above exists, he/she shall
notify the Village Administrator who in turn will send out written notice to
the property owner, or tenant if the owner is unknown, to have the lot grass or
lawn cut so as to conform with this Section and Section
8-1-5.
      (2)   The notice shall be served at least five (5) days prior to the
cutting of the lawn.
   (f)   Due Process Hearing.
      (1)   If the owner believes that his/her grasses or weeds are not a
nuisance, he/she may request a hearing before the Village Board. The request
for said hearing must be made in writing to the Village Administrator's office
within the five (5) day period that the notice was sent. Upon application for
the hearing, the property owner shall deposit a One Hundred Dollar ($100.00)
bond. If a decision is rendered in the property owner's favor, the One Hundred
Dollar ($100.00) will be returned to the property owner. If the property owner
fails to appear for the hearing or if the decision is rendered against the
property owner, the deposit shall be forfeited and applied to the cost of
Village personnel abating the nuisance, if necessary. The property in question
will not be mowed by the Village of Edgar or designee/ contractor until such
time as the hearing is held by the Village Board.
      (2)   At the hearing, the owner may appear in person or by his/her
attorney, may present witnesses in his/her own behalf and may cross-examine
witnesses presented by the Village as well as subpoena witnesses for his/her
own case.
      (3)   At the close of the hearing, the Village Board shall make its
determination in writing specifying its findings, facts, and conclusions. If
the Village Board of Appeals determines that a public nuisance did exist, the
Village Board shall order the Village or a person or company designated by the
Village to mow the property in question unless the property has been mowed by
the owner within seventy-two (72) hours of the Village Board's decision. If the
owner does not abate the nuisance within the prescribed seventy-two (72) hours,
the Weed Commissioner or other Village representative shall cause the same
nuisance to be abated and cost in excess of the forfeited fee billed or
assessed accordingly. [See Subsection (g).]
   (g)   Village's Option To Abate Nuisance. In any case where the owner,
occupant or person in charge of the property shall fail to cut his/her lawn,
grass or weeds as set forth above, then, and in that event, the Village may
elect to cut said lawn, grass or weeds as follows:
      (1)   The written notice required in Subsection (e) shall inform said
person that in the event of his/her failure to abate the nuisance within the
prescribed time, the Village shall abate the same and the cost thereof shall be
assigned to the property owner as a special charge. In addition, the Village
may also cause a citation to be issued for failure to comply with this Section.
      (2)   The Village shall cut, or cause to be cut by its agent, all grass
and weeds from the subject's property and shall charge the expenses of so doing
at a rate as established by the Village Board. Such charge shall be comprised
of all costs associated with the mowing, plus a surcharge for Village
administrative costs. The property owner shall also be responsible for any
equipment repair costs incurred by the Village while mowing on the property.
The charges shall be set forth in a statement to the Village Administrator who,
in turn, shall mail the same to the owner, occupant or person in charge of the
subject premises. If said statement is not paid in full within thirty (30) days
thereafter, the Village Administrator shall enter the charges in the tax roll
as a special tax against said lot or parcel of land, and the same shall be
collected in all respects like other taxes upon real estate, or as provided
under Sec. 66.615(3)(f), Wis. Stats.
   (h)   Definition. For purposes of this Section, "Village official" shall
mean any member of the Public Works Department, a law enforcement officer,
Building Inspector, Zoning Administrator, Village Administrator or Weed
Commissioner of the Village of Edgar.
Sec. 8-1-7 Compulsory Connection to Village Sewer and Water System.
   (a)   When Required. Whenever a sewer or watermain becomes available to any
building used for human habitation, the owner of the property upon which the
building is located shall connect the building to such main or mains in the
manner prescribed by law, except the Village Board may defer connection to such
water or sewer main or mains for those properties which have existing operable
septic systems or wells or whose construction was permitted by the Village of
Edgar.
   (b)   Notice; Payment.
      (1)   The owner of any parcel of land adjacent to a water or sewer main
upon which there exists a need for water supply, or sewer service, whether now
or in the future, and for whatsoever reason, or in a block through which such
system is extended shall connect the available water or sewer main/system
within one hundred eighty (180) days of notice in writing from the Village to
so connect. Upon failure to do so, the Village of Edgar may cause such
connection to be made and billed to the property owner for such costs. Such
costs may include, without limitation, the cost of disconnecting any private
wells so as to provide for adequate cross-connection controls within the
municipal water system. If such costs are not paid within thirty (30) days of
billing to the property owner by the Village, such costs shall be assessed as a
special tax lien against the property; however, that the owner may, within
thirty (30) days after the completion of the work, file a written option with
the Village Administrator stating that he/she cannot pay such amount in one (1)
sum and ask that there be levied in not to exceed five (5) equal installments
and that the amount shall be so collected with interest at the rate of twelve
percent (12%) per annum from the completion of the work, the unpaid balance
being a special tax lien, all pursuant to Sec. 144.06, Wis. Stats.
      (2)   In lieu of the above, the Village of Edgar, at its sole option, may
impose a penalty for the period that the violation continues, after ten (10)
days written notice to any owner failing to make a connection to the municipal
water or sewer system in an penalty amount to be as great as the current
average residential user cost plus ten percent (10%) interest for
administrative costs per month for each residential unit equivalent for the
period in which the failure to connect continues, and upon failure to make such
payment said charge shall be assessed as a special tax lien against the
property, all pursuant to Sec. 144.06, Wis. Stats.
      (3)   This Section ordains that the failure to connect to the water or
sewer system is contrary to the minimum health standards of said Village and
fails to assure preservation of public health, comfort, and safety of the
Village of Edgar.
   (c)   Building Inspector May Cause Connection at Expense of Owner. In the
alternative to Subsection (b), the owner or his/her agent fails to comply with
the notice of the Building Inspector within ten (10) days of service or mailing
thereof, the Building Inspector may cause connection to be made and the expense
thereof shall be assessed as a special charge against the property.
   (d)   Privies, Cesspools, Etc., Prohibited After Connection With Sewer.
After connection of any building used for human habitation to a sewer main, no
privy, cesspool or waterless toilet shall be used in connection with such human
habitation.

stored or remaining on said premises any garbage, junk, rubbish, rubble, trash,
construction materials, rotting yard and orchard waste, merchandise or parts,
accumulation of grease or food wastes in a grease trap or other place or
depository which presents a risk of clogging or blocking a sewer system, or any
other unhealthy, hazardous or unsightly materials or thing which create a fire
or health hazard, or which is detrimental to the appearance, neatness and
cleanliness of the immediate neighborhood or the Village of Edgar in general,
such official shall issue his/her written order to the owner and/or occupant of
the premises to remove such offending items.
      (2)   Said written order shall provide that such removal shall be
accomplished within ten (10) days after service of said order upon the owner or
occupant of the premises involved. Such written order, in addition to
specifying and describing the material or things to be removed, shall also set
forth on the face thereof the provisions of Subsection (b).
      (3)   Prosecution of violators under this Section shall not preclude
other enforcement actions allowed by law, including other actions under this
Code of Ordinances.
   (b)   Appeal. Any person aggrieved by an order of a Village official under
this Section may, within thirty (30) days from the date of such order, request
a hearing before the Village Board. The request for said hearing must be made
in writing to the Village Administrator's office within thirty (30) days of the
date of said order. The Village Board shall hold a hearing within seven (7)
days from the date of the aggrieved party's request. The Village shall take no
abatement action until such time as the requested hearing is held, except when
necessary to remove a human health hazard in accordance with Subsection (e). At
the hearing, the person aggrieved may appear in person and/or by attorney and
may subpoena, present and cross-examine witnesses. At the close of the hearing,
the Village Board shall make its determination in writing specifying its
findings of facts and conclusions. If the Village Board determines that a
public nuisance did exist, the Village Board may order the Village to proceed
under Subsection (e), (f) and/or (h) of this Section.
   (c)   Exceptions. Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to
prohibit the depositing of rubbish, rubble, junk, trash, abandoned, outmoded or
nonsalable merchandise or parts or unsightly materials or things which are:
      (1)   Lawfully sited pursuant to the Village Zoning Code and operated in
a manner not constituting a nuisance; or
      (2)   Temporarily deposited due to an emergency; or
      (3)   Materials during construction; or
      (4)   Collected and piled for immediate collection and disposal by the
Village or by a private service.
   (d)   Nonconforming Uses. It shall not be a defense to the provisions of
this Section that the owner or occupant of the premises involved has a
nonconforming use, but the provisions of this Section shall be complied with
notwithstanding that the owner or occupant of any given premises is using or
occupying such premises under a valid nonconforming use.
   (e)   Abatement by Village. If the inspecting officer determines that said
nuisance is a human health hazard, as defined in Sec. 254.01, Wis. Stats. and
Section
8-1-2 of this Code of Ordinances, and is not abated within the time provided in
Subsection (a), and there has been no appeal as set forth in Subsection (b),

or thing used for the purposes of collecting, conducting, transporting,
diverting, draining or discharging clear water from any part of any private
premises owned or occupied by said person to discharge into a sanitary sewer.
Sump pumps and their discharge shall comply with Section
8-1-12.
   (b)   Nuisance. The discharge into a sanitary sewer from any roof drain,
surface drain, subsoil drain, gutter, ditch, pipe, conduit, or any other object
or thing used for the purposes of collecting, conducting, transporting,
diverting, draining or discharging clear water from any part of any private

cause.
Cross-Reference:  Section
8-1-12.
Sec. 8-1-12 Sump Pump Discharge Regulated.
   (a)   Statement of Purpose. The Village Board finds that uncontrolled
discharges of water from sump pumps, footing tiles, roofs, down spouts, eave
troughs, yard drains, swimming pools, cistern overflows, and other means of
transmitting natural precipitation and surface waters can overload the public
sewerage system and contribute to flooding. Such overloading may result in
sewage flowing into basements and/or residences and businesses, creating
potentially hazardous public health and safety conditions and damage to
properties. Such discharges into the public sewerage system increase system
operating costs and maintenance. Furthermore, such uncontrolled discharges,
particularly from sump pumps, can create frozen runoff onto public sidewalks
and excess runoff from one lot to another.
   (b)   Prohibitions. It shall be unlawful for any owner, occupant or user of
any premises to direct into or allow any stormwater, surface water, ground
water, well water or other sources specified in Subsection (a) above to drain
into or connect into the public sewerage system. No rain spout or other form of
surface drainage, foundation drainage, or sump pump shall be connected to or
discharged into the public sewerage system.
   (c)   Sump Pump Discharge System Required.
      (1)   Requirement For. Dwellings and other buildings and structures which
require, because of infiltration of water into basements, crawl spaces, etc.,
the use of a sump pump system shall have a permanently installed discharge line
which shall not at any time discharge into a sanitary sewer system.
      (2)   Discharge Line Requirements.
         a.   A "permanently installed discharge line" shall be one which
provides for uninterupted year-around discharge capability to either an
appropriate drainage area outside of the dwelling, building or structure, or is
connected to the Village of Edgar storm sewer system.
         b.   The permanently installed discharge line shall consist of a rigid
discharge line, without valving or quick connections for altering the path of
discharge. This line shall not be capable of connection or reconnection to the
public sewerage system. The discharge pipe shall be installed to the outside
wall of the building with rigid pipe (plastic, copper, galvanized or black
pipe), one (1) inch inside diameter minimum. If the discharge line is directly
connected to a storm sewer line or catch basin, the discharge pipe shall have a
check valve within one (1) foot of the floor grade, an air gap, and a union or
other approved coupling for easy disconnection for repair or replacement. The
point of discharge shall be a minimum of two (2) feet from the basement
foundation wall and ten (10) feet from the property line.
         c.   Discharge water shall not create any icy condition on any
pedestrian walkways within or adjacent to the premise's lot lines.
         d.   As an alternate method of installation with the approval of the
Village, the discharge pipe may be connected directly to the Village's
underground storm sewer system provided the discharge is at a higher elevation
than the normal flow level and than an approved backflow prevention device is
installed.
         e.   When a storm sewer is not or will not be available in the future,
as determined by the Village, the sump pump shall discharge to grade and must
satisfy all of the following provisions, unless otherwise authorized by the
Public Works Department/Village Engineer:
            1.   The discharge pipe shall exit the building at one (I) foot
above finished grade.
            2.   The point of discharge shall be a minimum of two (2) feet from
a basement foundation wall and ten (I 0) feet from a property line.
            3.   The discharge shall flow parallel to or away from the nearest
property line, and comply with the restrictions of Subsection (c)(2)c above.
   (d)   Foundation Drain Tile Systems. For buildings and residences
constructed after the effective date of this Section, groundwater from
foundation drain tile shall not discharge into the sanitary sewerage system.
The building/residence shall have a drain tile placed around the inside or
outside perimeter of the foundation connected to a sump pit. All baseboard
seepage collection systems shall be discharged to the sump pit. The sump pit

discharged to the exterior of the structure with the use of a sump pump.
   (e)   Sump Pump Connection Required.
      (1)   Sump Pump Connections to Storm Sewer System.
         a.   Each owner of a platted lot where storm sewer laterals have been
installed, or will be installed in the future pursuant to Village standards,
shall be required to connect the building sump pump outlet directly to the
storm sewer lateral as installed at the time of plat or certified survey map
approval by the subdivider, or as subsequently installed by the Village
pursuant to this Section or any other ordinance of the Village of Edgar. If a
Village storm sewer system or Village drain tile system is available to the
property, connection of said discharges to this system shall be mandatory.
         b.   Where no storm sewer is available or is not adequate to receive
the anticipated flow (as determined by the Village) between the dates of
November 15 and April 15 of the following year, the sump pump discharge shall
drain onto the premises, not onto the roadway, curbing or sidewalk.
      (2)   Compliance Responsibility. It shall be the responsibility of the
party who is issued a building permit to ensure that the sump pump discharge
system from the building constructed on the property is installed underground
from the building and is properly connected to the storm sewer laterals.
      (3)   Downspouts. No downspouts shall be connected to the storm sewer
lateral, except with the approval of the Public Works Department, Village
Engineer or Building Inspector for unique hazard mitigation, and then shall be
limited to one (1) such connection only.
   (f)   Connection Orders; Inspections; Variances; Noncompliance.
      (1)   Connection Order. A connection order may be served, in person or by
first class mail, upon either the owner of the property or its occupant. The
order shall provide that connection to the storm sewer shall occur within
thirty (30) days after order issuance and prohibited connections be
discontinued, unless a written waiver or time extension request has been filed
with the Public Works Department, Village Engineer or Building Inspector.
      (2)   Inspections.
         a.   Within thirty (30) days after notice from the Village of Edgar,
the property owner shall contact the Village to schedule an inspection by a
Village inspector of each building and the utility service lines located on
such property. The purpose of this inspection is to confirm that there is no
sump pump or other prohibited discharges into the public sewerage system. In
lieu of having the Village inspect the property, the property owner may, at the
owner's expense, furnish a certificate from a Wisconsin-licensed plumber, in a
form acceptable to the Village, certifying that the property is in compliance
with this Section.
         b.   The Village may periodically re-inspect any building or premise
to determine compliance with this Section.
         c.   All new residences shall be required to have their sump pump
system inspected and be in compliance with this Section prior to issuance of a
certificate of occupancy.
      (3)   Waiver.
         a.   The Public Works Department, Village Engineer or Building
Inspector shall hear and decide requests for waivers or time extensions from
the applicability of the provisions of this Section where strict enforcement
would cause undue hardship because of circumstances unique to the individual
property under consideration or which would cause a significant public health
or safety problem. This may also include situations where it would not be
practical, as determined by the Village, to correct an otherwise prohibited
discharge to the public sewerage system.
         b.   Applications for a waiver or time extension shall be made within
fifteen (15) days of receipt of a compliance order. Such application shall be
addressed in writing to the Public Works Department, Village Engineer or
Building Inspector. Applications shall, at a minimum, identify the subject
property, the name of the property owner/applicant, and describe in detail what
characteristics of the subject property create an undue hardship. Within a
reasonable time, the Public Works Department, Village Engineer or Building
Inspector shall make a decision on the request, providing a copy of such
decision to the applicant in writing. Upon approval of an application for a
waiver or time extension, a property owner shall be allowed to discharge
directly into the sewerage system for a limited time specified in the written
determination and in accordance with other terms and conditions specified.
      (4)   Penalties.
         a.   A penalty surcharge of Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00) per month
shall be imposed on every sewer service bill to a property owner who:
            1.   Is not in compliance with this Section;
            2.   Has not obtained an inspection required by this Section or
refuses property inspections required under this Section;
            3.   Has not made necessary corrections within the time specified;
or
            4.   Is otherwise not in compliance with this Section.
         b.   The surcharge shall be added every month thereafter for
properties not in compliance with this Section until the property owner submits
appropriate proof to the Village that the property has been brought into full
compliance, with verification by Village inspection. Any property found during
any re-inspection to be in violation of this Section shall be subject to the
surcharge for all months between the two (2) most recent inspections. If the
surcharge is not paid, the Village reserves the right to assess the property
the unpaid balance as a special charge under the Wisconsin Statutes.
         c.   In addition to the penalty surcharge, a citation may also be
issued for violations, with all court costs payable by the property owner.
Sec. 8-1-13 Disturbance of Refuse Containers.
   (a)   Disturbing Containers Prohibited. No person shall open or disturb any
refuse bag or container in a manner that would cause or contribute to litter.

recyclables or other items placed for collection and/or disposal without the
prior express authorization of the party placing such items for collection/
disposal.
Sec. 8-1-14 Fencing of Anhydrous Ammonia Tanks.
   (a)   Purpose. The Village Board has determined that anhydrous ammonia
storage tanks located within the Village of Edgar pose a threat to public
health and safety if access to such tanks is not restricted through appropriate
fencing. Specifically, public health and safety may be at risk if tampering or
vandalism to the tanks results in unauthorized release of the tanks' dangerous
contents into the atmosphere; furthermore, anhydrous ammonia is known to be a
substance used in the illicit manufacture of prohibited controlled substances,
and that persons engaged in such illegal activity may tamper with unsecured
storage tanks. This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the Village's police
powers, which are to be liberally construed in favor of the municipality's
authority to enact measures to protect public health and safety.
   (b)   Requirements. Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this
Section, the owners of all parcels on which anhydrous ammonia storage tanks are
located, either presently or proposed, shall erect adequate fencing enclosing
such tanks. The fencing shall be of a design approved by the Village Board
prior to construction. Such fencing shall be kept locked and be properly
maintained.
   (c)   Penalty. Persons found to be in violation of this ordinance shall be
subject to the general penalty provisions of Section
1-1-6 of this Code of Ordinances. Each day shall constitute a separate
violation.
Sec. 8-1-15 Regulation of Smoking and Vaping.

   (c)   Smoking Prohibited Within or Upon All Buildings and Equipment Owned,
Leased or Rented by the Village. In recognition of the need to protect the
health and safety of the public and Village employees from the detrimental
effects of smoking, pursuant to the authority granted to the Village of Edgar
by Sec. 101.123(2)(c), Wis. Stats., smoking as defined by Sec. 101.123(1)(h),
Wis. Stats., is prohibited by any person within or upon all buildings and
enclosed equipment owned, leased or rented by the Village of Edgar, except in

health and safety of the public and Village employees from the detrimental
effects of vaping and to maintain consistency with no-smoking regulations, the
use of a vapor device is prohibited by any person within or upon all buildings
and enclosed equipment owned, leased or rented by the Village of Edgar, except

   (a)   No water service lateral shall be laid through any trench having
cinders, rubbish, rock or gravel fill, or any other material which may cause
injury to or disintegration of the service lateral, unless adequate means of
protection are provided by sand filling or such other insulation as may be
approved by the Water Utility. Service laterals passing through curb or
retaining walls shall be adequately safeguarded by provision of a channel space
or pipe casing, not less than twice the diameter of the service connection. The
space between the service lateral and channel or pipe casing shall be filled
and lightly caulked with an oakum, mastic cement, or other resilient material,
and made impervious to moisture.
   (b)   In backfilling the pipe trench, the service lateral must be protected
against injury by carefully hand tamping the ground filling around the pipe.
There should be at least six (6) inches of ground filling over the pipe, and it
should be free from hard lumps, rocks, stones, or other injurious material.
   (c)   All water service laterals shall be of undiminished size from the
street main in to the point of meter placement. Beyond the meter outlet valve,
the piping shall be sized and proportioned to provide, on all floors, at all
times, an equitable distribution of water supply for the greatest probable
number of fixtures or appliances operating simultaneously.
Sec. 9-1-29 Service Piping for Meter Settings.
Where the original service piping is installed for a new metered customer,
where existing service piping is changed for the customer's convenience, or
where a new meter is installed for an existing unmetered customer, the owner of
the premises at his/her expense shall provide a suitable location and the
proper connections for the meter. The Water Utility should be consulted as to
the type and size of meter setting. The meter setting and associated plumbing
shall comply with the Water Utility's standards.
Sec. 9-1-30 Turning on Water.
The water may only be turned on for a customer except by an authorized employee

upon completion must leave the water turned off.
Sec. 9-1-31 Failure to Read Meters.
   (a)   Where the Water Utility is unable to read a meter, the fact will be
plainly indicated on the bill, and either an estimated bill will be computed or
the minimum charge applied. The difference shall be adjusted when the meter is
again read, that is, the bill for the succeeding billing period will be
computed with the gallons or cubic feet in each block of the rate schedule
doubled, and credit will be given on that bill for the amount of the bill paid
the preceding period. Only in unusual cases shall more than three (3)
consecutive estimated or minimum bills be rendered.
   (b)   If the meter is damaged (see Surreptitious Use of Water) or fails to
operate, the bill will be based on the average use during the past year unless
there is some reason why the use is not normal. If the average use cannot be
properly determined, the bill will be estimated by some equitable method. (See
PSC 185.33, Wis. Adm. Code.)

obstructions and permit ready access for reading, inspection, and servicing,
such location to be designated or approved by the Water Utility. All piping
within the building must be supplied by the owner. Where additional meters are
desired by the owner, the owner shall pay for all piping. See Schedule Am-I for
applicable rates.
Sec. 9-1-36 Repairs to Meters.
   (a)   Meters will be repaired by the Water Utility and the cost of such
repairs caused by ordinary wear and tear will be borne by the Water Utility.
   (b)   Repair of any damage to a meter resulting from the carelessness of the
owner of the premises, the owner's agent, or tenant, or from the negligence of
any one of them to properly secure and protect same, including any damage that
may result from allowing a water meter to become frozen or to be damaged from
the presence of hot water or steam in the meter, shall be paid for by the
customer or the owner of the premises.
Sec. 9-1-37 Replacement and Repair of Service Laterals.
   (a)   The service lateral from the main to and through the curb stop will be
maintained and kept in repair and, when worn out, replaced at the expense of

the curb stop to the point of use.
   (b)   If an owner fails to repair a leaking or broken service lateral from
the curb to the point of metering or use within such time as may appear
reasonable to the Water Utility after notification has been served on the owner
by the Water Utility, the water will be shut off and will not be turned on
again until the repairs have been completed.
Sec. 9-1-38 Abandonment of Service.
If a property owner changes the use of a property currently receiving water
service such that water service will no longer be needed in the future, the
Water Utility may require the abandonment of the water service at the water
main. In such case, the property owner may be responsible for all removal and/
or repair costs, including the water main and the Utility portion of the water
service lateral.
Sec. 9-1-39 Charges for Water Wasted Due to Leaks.
See Wis. Adm. Code, Chapter PSC 185.35.

one (I) of which contains potable water from the Village of Edgar's public
water system, and the other of which contains water from a private source,
water of unknown or questionable safety, or steam, gases, or chemicals, whereby
there may be a flow from one (1) system to the other, with the direction of
flow depending on the pressure differential between the two (2) systems.
   (c)   Unprotected Cross Connections Prohibited. No person, firm, or
corporation may establish or maintain, or permit to be established or
maintained, any unprotected cross connection. Cross connections shall be
protected as required in SPS 382, Wis. Adm. Code.
   (d)   Inspection. The Water Utility may inspect, or arrange for an
inspection of, property served by the public water system for cross
connections. As an alternative, the Water Utility may require a person, firm,

inspected, at their own expense, by a State of Wisconsin Certified Cross
Connection Inspector/Surveyor. The frequency of inspections shall be
established by the Water Utility in accordance with NR 810.15, Wis. Adm. Code.
Any unprotected cross connections identified by the inspection shall be
promptly corrected at the user's expense. Failure to promptly correct an
unprotected cross connection shall be sufficient cause for the Water Utility to
discontinue water service to the property, as provided under Subsection (g)
below.
   (e)   Right of Entry. Upon presentation of credentials, a representative of
the Water Utility shall have the right to request entry, at any reasonable
time, to a property served by a connection to the public water system for the
purpose of inspecting the property for cross connections. Refusing entry to
such Water Utility representative shall be sufficient cause for the Water
Utility to discontinue water service to the property , as provided under
Subsection (g) below. If entry is refused, a special inspection warrant under
Section 66.0il9, Wis. Stats., may be obtained.
   (f)   Provision of Requested Information. The Water Utility may request an
owner, lessee, or occupant of property served by a connection to the public
water system to furnish the Water Utility with pertinent information regarding
the piping systems on the property. Refusing to provide requested information
shall be sufficient cause for the Water Utility to discontinue water service to
the property, as provided under Subsection (g) below.
   (g)   Discontinuation of Water for Violation. The Water Utility may
discontinue water service to any property wherein any unprotected connection in
violation of this Section exists, and take other precautionary measures deemed
necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water system.
Water service may be discontinued, however, only after reasonable notice and
opportunity for hearing under Chapter 68, Wis. Stats., (Title 4 of this Code of
Ordinances), except as provided in Subsection (h) below. Water service to such
property shall not be restored until the unprotected cross connection has been
eliminated.
   (h)   Emergency Discontinuance. If it is determined by the Water Utility
that an unprotected cross connection or emergency endangers public health,
safety, or welfare, and requires immediate action, and if a written finding to
that effect is filed with the Village Administrator and delivered to the
customer's premises, water service may be immediately discontinued. The
customer shall have an opportunity for hearing under Chapter 68, Wis. Stats.,
(Title 4 of this Code of Ordinances), within ten (10) days of such emergency
discontinuance. Water service to such property shall not be restored until the
unprotected cross connection has been eliminated.

(Ord. 2022-2, passed 12-12-2022)
Sec. 9-2-8   Sewer Service Charges.
   (a)   Sewer Service Charge System Established.
      (1)   The purpose of this Section is to establish the basis for
reasonable charges for the cost of collecting and treating domestic wastewaters
and industrial wastewaters. A sewer service charge shall be assessed to all
users of the wastewater facilities in accordance with the provisions of this
Chapter.
      (2)   The calculations establishing user charges for capital costs of
plant expansions and modifications constructed to upgrade the wastewater
treatment facilities (done in 1983) and costs of plant operation, maintenance
and replacement for the first year of operation are adopted by reference and
incorporated herein, a copy of which is on file with the Village Administrator.
      (3)   It is the intent of this Section to ensure that each user or user
class pays its proportionate share of operation, maintenance and replacement
costs based on its waste contribution and the facilities used to treat wastes
from a particular user. It is also the intent of this Section ensure that all
users and user classes share in the cost of transportation and treatment of
clear water.
      (4)   Bills for sewer service are due and payable on the first of the
month following the period for which service is rendered. A late payment charge
of three percent (3%) of the balance due [Ten Dollar ($10.00) minimum charge]
will be added to bills not paid within twenty (20) days of issuance. The late
payment charge is applicable to all customers.
      (5)   Sewer service charges shall be established so that revenues
collected cover capital expenditures, debt service costs, operation and
maintenance costs and replacement costs, except that ad valorem taxes may be
used to cover any portion of the capital expenditures or debt service costs. Ad
valorem taxes may not be used for operation, maintenance and replacement costs.
      (6)   Revenues in support of the collecting and treating of wastewater
shall be generated from two (2) classes of wastewater as follows:
      a.   Domestic wastewater; and
      b.   Industrial wastewater.
      (7)   Domestic wastewater shall include wastewater from commercial,
institutional, public and residential sources. Such revenues shall be collected
on a time period deemed appropriate by the Village, but not less frequently
than annually. Said revenues shall be reviewed to determine their adequacy to
offset operation, maintenance and capital costs annually. Accordingly, the
Village reserves the right to adjust the basis for such revenues annually to
assure their continued adequacy.
      (8)   The revenues for domestic wastewater shall be through user charges
to the "domestic user" class. The user charges shall be adjusted annually with
rates established to adequately meet the cost of collecting and treating
domestic wastewater.
      (9)   Industrial wastewaters shall be subject to an industrial service
charge. Such charges shall be assessed to cover capital and operation and
maintenance costs. The charges will be based on both the level of sewage
treatment plant and public sewer collection system capacity provided for in the
design and the actual discharge by each industry as measured by volume, BOD and
suspended solids. All Class D manufacturers (Standard Industrial Classification
Manual) discharging other than domestic wastewater are subject to such charges.
      (10)   Should the industrial wastewaters contain a fluid or solid not
reflected by volume, BOD or suspended solids, special charges shall be
determined on a case-by-case basis. These charges shall reflect the costs and
difficulties associated with collecting and treating that specified wastewater.
      (11)   Sampling of industrial wastewaters may be made on a regular basis
or as needed to verify the charges.
      (12)   Each new Class D industry shall file with the Village an initial
written statement for each separate connection to the system providing the
daily volume, range of pH, slug rate, peak flow rate, pounds per day of
suspended solids and pounds per day of BOD of the wastewater. Initial charges
shall be developed on the basis of this statement. If the industrial discharge,
as defined herein, all connections to the sanitary sewer system shall pass
through a special control manhole.
      (13)   Changes in operations or use shall be reported by the owner, and
it shall be his/her sole responsibility to have such charges made to the
original statement to remain in compliance with this Chapter.
      (14)   The Utility may sample and test at any industrial wastewater
discharge point to verify the accuracy of any statement made by an industry
owner. The costs of such tests shall be at the expense of the Utility.
   (b)   Factors in Determining Sewer User Charges.
      (1)   The purpose of this Subsection is to establish the method for
recovering capital and operation and maintenance costs invested by the Utility
on behalf of the industrial user, exclusive of pretreatment facilities. Each
industrial user shall enter into an industrial service contract pursuant to
this Chapter.
      (2)   The method for cost recovery for any industry shall apply to both
the public sewer collection system, including major appurtenances, and that
portion of the sewage treatment plant utilized by the industry.
      (3)   The parameters used in the method of cost recovery shall be:
         a.   Volume expressed in gallons per day (gpd), BOD expressed in
pounds per day (#/day), and suspended solids expressed in pounds per day (#/
day), or other parameters that represent an unusual contribution to operation,
maintenance or capital costs.
      (4)   The Utility shall maintain capital costs records on improvements to
the sewage treatment plant and/or public sewer collection system. The capital
costs shall be allocated based on design volume, BOD and suspended solids.
      (5)   The Utility shall maintain design capacity calculations which
allocate a specific volume, BOD and suspended solids concentration to each
industrial wastewater discharge to the sewage treatment plant.
      (6)   The Utility shall maintain design capacity calculations which
allocate a specific volume to industrial wastewater discharges to that portion
of the public sewer collection system and major appurtenances used by the
industry, if appropriate. Under normal circumstances, the industry will be
charged for use of the collection system as would any other class of user.
      (7)   Capital costs shall be reduced by any special assessment levied to
industry in the determination of sewer service charges.
      (8)   Capital costs shall be reduced by the amount of grant(s) received
for the facilities, if permissible, under then-current granting agency
regulations.
   (c)   Additional Charges. Additional charges shall be billed to the user to
which they apply and shall include the following:
      (1)   Actual costs incurred for monitoring or sampling performed by the
Village or agents of the Village for the purpose of determining compliance with
this Chapter.
      (2)   Actual costs incurred for monitoring and sampling or other services
performed by the Village or agents of the Village relative to any pretreatment
facility.
      (3)   Any increased costs due to a user's discharge of toxic or other
incompatible pollutants.
      (4)   Actual cost for handling a user's check returned for insufficient
funds.
      (5)   Actual costs incurred for special handling not provided for
elsewhere.
   (d)   Industry Wastewater Calculations.
      (1)   The capital costs shall be allocated to each industry based on the
following formula:
         Cc = vdxVc + bdxBc + sdxSc + ndxNc
         Where:
         Cc = charges $/year for capital cost
         Vc = capital costs allocated to volume for the sewage treatment plant
and public sewer collection system used by the industry
         Bc = capital costs allocated to BOD for the sewage treatment plant
         Sc = capital costs allocated to suspended solids for the sewage
treatment plant
         Nc = capital costs allocated to ammonia for the sewage treatment plant
         vd = percentage design capacity allocated to the industry for volume
at the sewage treatment plant and the public sewer collection system used by
the industry
         bd = percentage design capacity allocated to the industry for BOD at
the sewage plant
         sd = percentage design capacity allocated to the industry for
suspended solids at the sewage treatment plant
         nd = percentage design capacity allocated to the industry for ammonia
at the sewage treatment plant
      (2)   The Utility shall maintain annual operational and maintenance costs
allocated for volume, BOD, ammonia and suspended solids. The Utility shall
adjust the charge for operation and maintenance annually to reflect cost
increases and decreases. Operational and maintenance costs for the public sewer
collection system shall be allocated to such industry on volume only.
      (3)   The operational and maintenance costs shall be allocated to each
industry based on the following formula:
         Cm = va x Vm + ba x Bm + sa x Sm + Nm
         Cm = charge in $/year for operation and maintenance
         Vm = annual operation and maintenance cost allocated to volume for the
sewage treatment plant and public sewer collection system used by each industry
         Bm = annual operation and maintenance cost allocated to BOD for the
sewage treatment plant
         Nm = annual operation and maintenance cost allocated to ammonia for
the sewage treatment plant
         va = percent of actual volume contributed by the industry
         ba = percent of actual BOD contributed by the industry
         sa = percent of actual suspended solids contributed by the industry
         na = percent of actual ammonia contributed by the industry
      (4)   The sum of Cc and Cm shall be the total annual charge made to the
industry. The Utility shall invoice the industry a minimum of once a year.
Shorter invoicing periods may be established.
      (5)   The total annual operation and maintenance costs (Cm) shall include
a depreciation and inflation allowance, where applicable.
      (6)   If there is any change in the volume, BOD, ammonia or suspended
solids characteristics by the industry, the industry's share of operation and
maintenance will be adjusted accordingly.
   (e)   Annual Review of Service Fees; Replacement Fund; Compliance Records.
      (1)   The sewer service charge rates shall be reviewed at least annually.
Any excess revenues collection from a user class for operation, maintenance and
replacement shall be attributed to that class the next year.
      (2)   A replacement fund shall be established for the exclusive use of
replacement as defined in Section
9-2-2.
      (3)   The Village shall maintain adequate records to implement the sewer
service charges pursuant to this Chapter and to show compliance with the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources' user charge regulations.
   (f)   Billing; Unpaid Bills a Lien; Reconnection Charge.
      (1)   Bills for the sewer service charges as herein established shall be
mailed following the billing period and shall be paid at such place as
designated by the Village. If any bill for sewer service shall not be paid by
the twentieth (20th) day following the day of rendition of such bill, a delayed
payment charge of one and one-half (1½%) per month of the amount of the bill
shall be added thereto and collected therewith. If any bills for sewer use
shall remain unpaid after thirty (30) days following the rendition of such
bill, the sewer service charges for the lot, parcel of land or premises
affected shall be considered delinquent and the Village shall reserve the right
to seal off the service connection and service shall not be restored except
upon receipt of full payment of the bill including the delayed payment charge
and a reconnection fee as established by resolution of the Village Board.
      (2)   Sewer service charges shall be a lien on the property served
pursuant to Sec. 66.0821(4)(d), Wis. Stats., and shall be collected in the
manner therein provided.
      (3)   Each user shall be notified annually, in conjunction with a regular
billing, the sewer service charge rate.
   (g)   Reassignment of Sewer Users. The Utility will reassign sewer users to
appropriate sewer service charge categories if wastewater sampling programs and
other related information indicates a change of categories is necessary.
   (h)   Sewer Rates Established.
      (1)   The Village of Edgar shall utilize a sewer rate system based on
Equivalent Dwelling Units (EDU). The EDU shall be calculated annually based on
the prior year's Village of Edgar's report information to the Wisconsin Public
Service Commission (PSC). The equivalent unit is calculated by the total number
of residential consumption divided by the total number of residential users;
this rate is then applied to all users (residential, commercial and public
authorities). Water used for pools, watering lawns and leaks are not used in
the average calculations.
      (2)   Quarterly bills are mailed on the first day after the quarter end
and payment is due twenty (20) days after. A three percent (3%) late charge
will be added to any bill not paid by the due date. Disconnection notices will
be sent approximately seven (7) days after the due date. Unless a satisfactory
arrangement for payment is made within ten (10) days of receipt of notice,
service may be disconnected pursuant to PSC 185, Wis. Adm. Code.
      (3)   Current sewer charges are:
         1 Equivalent Dwelling Unit (EDU) = $63.46
         Plus $6.50/1,000 gallons used
         EDUs are calculated on the average 2021 residential water consumption
of 8,763 gallons per quarter
(Ord. 2022-2, passed 12-12-2022)
Sec. 9-2-9   Sewer Connection Charge.
   (a)   Requirement. All customers of the sewerage collection and treatment
system receiving such service for the first time shall pay a sewer connection
charge to the Village.
   (b)   Existing Customers. An existing customer may have to pay a sewer
connection charge if its wastewater changes substantially in quantity or
quality.
   (c)   Connection Charge Established. The sewer connection charge shall be as
established by the Village Board.
   (d)   Limits on Sewer Connections. The Village Board may limit sewer
connections if the downstream public sewers or sewage treatment plant does not
have sufficient capacity to accept the additional discharge.
(Ord. 2022-2, passed 12-12-2022)
Sec. 9-2-10   Service Contracts.
   (a)   Where individual industrial wastewaters constitute a substantial
portion of either the volumetric or organic capacity of the sewage treatment
facilities, a service agreement between the industry and the agency shall be
executed. Such industrial service contracts/agreements shall be required where
the individual wastewaters emanating from an industry contain either thirty
percent (30%) or more of the design suspended solids or if the wastewater
includes more than thirty percent (30%) of the design ammonia to the sewage
treatment plant. Such agreement shall ensure continued participation in capital
costs by the industry over the life of the agreement. Should the industry
eliminate its discharge, the Village, at its option, may elect to assign to
another industrial user that portion of design capacity and associated capital
costs, thereby relieving the industry of continued financial participation.
   (b)   Within each such industrial service contract, the Village of Edgar
shall require the industry associated capital cost (balance of capital cost
payments) owed by the industrial user be payable to the Village within thirty
(30) days of the industry's ceasing/terminating business operations within the
Village. The Village may, at its option, at the time of entering into the
service contract with an individual industry require of the individual industry
contractually a financial guarantee to ensure to the Village that the
industry's associated capital costs will be paid to the Village in the event
that the industry ceases/terminates business operations in the Village. Such
financial guarantee methods include, without limitation, personal guarantees of
the industry's majority shareholders/owners, a prepaid escrow account in a
dollar amount as agreed to between the Village and the industry (provided that
the escrow funds, interest thereon, and prorated reductions shall be paid to
the industry as the industry over time reduces its associated capital costs),
an unconditional letter of credit, and/or performance and payment bond. In the
event that the Village allows an industrial user under service contract to
cease/terminate business operations without repayment of that industry's unused
associated capital costs, then all other industrial users under service
contract with the Village shall be excused from the terms and conditions of
that industrial user's contract requiring prepayment in the event of that
industry ceasing/terminating business operations within the Village.
(Ord. 2022-2, passed 12-12-2022)
Sec. 9-2-11   Audit.
   (a)   Annual Audit. The Village may conduct an annual audit, the purpose of
which shall be to maintain the proportionality between users and user classes
of the user charge system and to ensure that adequate revenues are available
relative to increasing operation, maintenance and replacement costs.
   (b)   Notification. The Village shall, at least annually, notify current
users of any change in the portion of user charges and ad valorem taxes
attributable to wastewater treatment services.
(Ord. 2022-2, passed 12-12-2022)
Sec. 9-2-12   Disposition of Revenue.
   (a)   Generally. The rates and charges herein set forth shall be applicable
to all services furnished and made available by the wastewater treatment
facility to the Village and its inhabitants and all other persons, both public
and private, until modified by ordinance amendatory or supplemental to this
Chapter, providing such rates and charges as amended shall always be fixed,
maintained and collected in such amounts as shall produce gross revenues
adequate to pay as incurred all costs of the operation and maintenance of the
facility and to accumulate an adequate reserve for the depreciation thereof,
and to pay when due the principal of and interest on all bonds of the Village
which are payable from the revenues of the wastewater treatment facility.
   (b)   Separate Account. The funds received from the collection of the sewer
service charges authorized by this Chapter shall be credited to a sanitary
sewerage account and shall be set aside into the operation and maintenance of
the facility for a proper and adequate depreciation account and for the payment
of the interest and principal of bonds issued and outstanding or which may be
hereafter issued to provide funds to construct, improve or extend the public
utility. When appropriated by the Village, the credits to the account remaining
after the payment of operation and maintenance costs, deposits in a separate
account of the amount allocated to equipment replacement and interest and
principal of bonds issued shall be available for, but not limited to, the
payment of the following uses:
      (1)   Cost of the replacement of existing sewer mains.
      (2)   Cost of substitution of larger size for existing mains.
      (3)   Cost of new primary sewer mains and installation of same in excess
of such charge or cost payable by statutory assessment.
      (4)   Cost of road repair required by such construction.
      (5)   Cost of contracted engineering service to ensure a planned program.

to provide funds for the sewerage system or part thereof and all or a part of
the expenses for additions and improvements and other necessary disbursements
of indebtedness and the Village Board may by resolution pledge such surplus or
any part thereof for any such purpose.
(Ord. 2022-2, passed 12-12-2022)
Sec. 9-2-13   Protection From Damage.
   No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break,
damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or
equipment which is a part of the sewage collection system or sewage treatment
plant. Any person violating this provision may be subject to arrest.
(Ord. 2022-2, passed 12-12-2022)
Sec. 9-2-14   Powers and Authority of Inspectors.
   (a)   Duly authorized representatives, inspector and/or employees of the
Sewer Utility presenting proper credentials and identification shall be
permitted to enter all properties served by the Utility for the purpose of
inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and/or testing in accordance
with the provisions of this Chapter. Representatives of the Utility shall not
have authority to inquire into any processes, including metallurgical,
chemical, petroleum, refining, ceramic, paper or other processes beyond that
point having a direct bearing on the type and source of discharge(s) to the
sanitary sewers or sewage treatment facilities.
   (b)   While performing the necessary work on private premises referred to in
Subsection (a) above, representatives of the Utility shall observe all safety
rules applicable to the premises established by the company; the company shall
be held harmless for injury or death to the Utility's representative/inspector
and the Utility shall indemnify the company against loss or damage to its
property by Utility representatives/inspectors and against liability claims and
demands for personal injury or property damage asserted against the company and
growing out of the gauging and sampling operation, except as such may be caused
by negligence or failure to the company to maintain safe conditions as required
by this Chapter.
   (c)   Representatives of the Utility presenting proper credentials and
identification shall be permitted to enter all private properties for the
purpose of, but not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement, sampling,
repair and maintenance of any portion of the sewage collection system. All
entry and subsequent work, if any, shall be done in full accordance with the
terms of this Chapter.
(Ord. 2022-2, passed 12-12-2022)
Sec. 9-2-15   Industrial User Sanctions and Penalties.
   (a)   The Village of Edgar shall notify an industrial user in writing if the
industrial user exceeds its allowed loadings to the Village's wastewater
treatment facility for any three (3) consecutive days or for any five (5) days
within any sixty (60) day period (Note: The day limitations stated herein may
change hereinafter pursuant to federal and/or state mandated requirements). The
Village shall require the industrial user to take necessary and reasonable
actions to restrict the industry's loadings to the Village's wastewater
treatment plant to the agreed limits. Alternately, the Village may adjust the
agreed limits temporarily upward to allow the industrial user use of any
reserved capacity by an industrial user within the Village's treatment
facility. If the Village exercises its option to allow temporary use of reserve
capacity by an industrial user, the Village may at any time, within its sole
discretion, require the industrial user to return that industrial user's limits
to those limits agreed to by contract between the Village and the industrial
user. Any loadings by an industrial user in excess of the contractual limits
agreed to between the Village and the industrial user may, within the
discretion of the Village, result in an increase in any capital costs
reimbursement owed by the industrial user to the Village, pursuant to the terms
of the Village's user charge ordinance requirements.
   (b)   If the Village notifies an industrial user that an industrial user has
exceeded its allowed loadings, and that the industrial user is to take
reasonable and necessary actions to restrict its flows/loadings, and the
industrial user fails to take reasonable and necessary actions to do so,
resulting in a failure of the industrial user to restrict its loadings to the
appropriate agreed contractual limits and further exceedances occur, the
Village may within its discretion restrict service to the industrial user. The
industrial user shall be required to reimburse the Village for all costs
incurred as a result of the excessive discharges, including, but not limited
to, reimbursement of fines imposed upon the Village for the Village's violation
of its discharge permit (WPDES), costs related to facilities planning and
construction at the Village's treatment facility necessitated by the industrial
user's excessive discharges, and/or physical damage to the Village's treatment
facility arising from excessive discharges.
   (c)   In the event that an industrial user shall fail to take reasonable and
necessary actions to restrict the industrial user's flow/loadings so as to
restrict the industrial user's flow/loadings to the appropriate agreed
contractual limits and further exceedances occur, the same shall be considered
a contractual violation of the terms and conditions of the industrial service
contract as then in effect between the Village and the industrial user, and the
same shall be considered then a violation of the penalty provisions of Section
9-2-16, causing the industrial user to be liable to the Village for a
forfeiture of not less than One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) nor more than Five
Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) for each such contractual agreement violation.
Each day in which any such contractual agreement violation shall continue shall
be deemed a separate forfeiture offense. In order for an industrial user to be
liable for a contractual agreement violation, under this Subsection and the
subsequent imposition of a forfeiture thereon, a court judgment shall be
required to be entered upon the merit(s) of the legal issue as to whether or
not the industrial user has taken reasonable and necessary actions to restrict
the flow/loadings to appropriate limits, within the contractual terms,
conditions and covenants of the industrial service agreement.
   (d)   Any and all remedies stated herein, including without limitation
forfeitures, shall be cumulative to the Village of Edgar. In the event of
conflict(s) between this Section and other provisions of this Chapter, the most
restrictive provisions shall be applicable.
(Ord. 2022-2, passed 12-12-2022)
Sec. 9-2-16   Violations and Penalties.
   (a)   Violations; Penalties.
      (1)   Any person found to be in violation of any provisions of this
Chapter shall be served by the Village of Edgar with written notice stating the
nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time limit for the
satisfactory correction thereof. The offender shall, within the period of time
stated in such notice, permanently cease all violations or respond to the
Village within thirty (30) days of such notice indicating (i) why compliance
cannot be achieved within the period of time set forth in the notice; (ii) the
plan of action to be taken to bring the offending facility into compliance; and
(iii) the time schedule proposed to achieve compliance with this Chapter. The
Utility shall review such response and the reasonableness of the proposed plan
and timetable for compliance. Upon completion of such review, the Utility shall
provide the offender with written notice stating the acceptability of the
timeframe for completion of corrective action.
      (2)   No person who shall continue any violation beyond the time limit
provided above shall be subject to those penalties prescribed in Section
1-1-6. Each day in which such violation shall continue it shall be deemed a
separate offense.
      (3)   Continued violation may result in the refusal of the Village to
accept the discharges of the violating discharger.
      (4)   In addition to the forfeiture penalty provided for herein, any
person violating any of the provisions of this Chapter shall become liable to
the Village for any expense, loss, forfeitures/penalties or damage occasioned
the Village or its Sewer Utility by reason of such violation. The Village and
its Sewer Utility shall be held harmless from any expense, loss or damage
incurred by any downstream watercourse user or by any other person as a result
of a user violation of this Chapter.
      (5)   Any person who knowingly makes a false statement, representation or
certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed
or required to be maintained pursuant to this Chapter; or who falsifies,
tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method
required under this Chapter, shall forfeit to the Village an amount of not more
than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any discharger or agent of the discharger shall have the right to
appeal an interpretation or ruling by the Village on any matter covered by this
Chapter. The discharger or his/her agent shall be entitled to a hearing before
the Village Board for the purpose of appeal. Such a meeting shall be promptly
scheduled by the Village upon receipt of a written appeal from the discharger.
      (2)   In the event that such appeal deals with matters of performance or
compliance with this Chapter for which enforcement activity relating to an
alleged violation is subject, receipt of a discharger's written appeal shall
stay all enforcement proceedings pending the hearing before the Village Board.
Appeal on a final judgment by the Village entered pursuant to this Chapter may
be taken in accordance with the laws of the State of Wisconsin.

State Law Reference: Chapter 961, Wis. Stats.
Sec. 11-2-10 Synthetic Cannabinoid and Drugs Prohibited.
   (a)   Purpose; Background.
      (1)   Background - Synthetic Cannabinoid. Products that are commonly
known as synthetic cannabinoid, marijuana containing synthetic cannabinoids,
synthetic THC, or substantially similar chemicals or products often in the form
of incense, potpourri, plant food, spice, special dietary supplements or herbal
smoking blends, are commonly marketed or sold to the public under names such
as, but not limited to: "K2", "K3" or ' 1K4"; "K-2 Summit"; 11K-2 Sex";
11Spice'1; 11Genie"; "Yucatan Fire"; "Dascents"; "Zohal"; "Sage"; "Pep Spice";
"Solar Flare"; "K.0. Knock-Out 2"; "Spice Gold"; "Spice Diamond"; "Spice
Cannabinoid"; and "Fire and Ice".
      (2)   Background - Synthetic Drugs. Like the marketing of synthetic
cannabinoids as incense [such as, but not limited to, Spice or K2], synthetic
drugs are also commercially available, and in some instances are marketed as
bath salts under such names as Bliss, Vanilla Sky, White Lightning, Ivory Snow,
Ivory Wave, Purple Wave, Red Dove, Hurricane Charlie or other names, or are
packaged or marketed as potpourri, incense, plant food, spice, tobacco, or
dietary supplements.
      (3)   Scientific Background.  The Village Board finds that the United
States Drug Enforcement Agency in 2008 alerted law enforcement and public
officials that synthetic cannabinoid products are structurally and
pharmacologically similar to the active ingredient of marijuana (THC), a
Schedule I controlled substance. While there are hundreds of synthetic
compounds and their analogs, some are more common synthetic cannabinoids and
synthetic drugs include, but are not limited to:
         a.   Salviadivinorum or Salvinorum A. All parts of the plant presently
classified botanically as salvia divinorum.
         b.   JWH-018. (l-Pentyl-3-(1-naphthoyl) indole is an analgesic
chemical from the naphthoylindole family, which acts as a full agonist at both
the CBI and CB2 cannabinoid receptors, with some selectivity for CB2. It
produces effects in animals similar to those of THC, a cannabinoid naturally
present in cannabis, leading to its use in synthetic cannabis.
         c.   JWH-073. I-butyl-3-(Inaphthoyl) indole is an analgesic chemical
from the naphthoylindole family, which acts as a partial agonist at both the
CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors. It is somewhat selective for the CB2 subtype
with affinity at this subtype approximately Sx the affinity at CB1. The
abbreviation JWH stands for John W. Huffman, one of the inventors of the
compound.
         d.   JWH-200. 1-[2-4(4-morpholinyl)ethyl]-3-(1-naphthoyl) indole is an
analgesic chemical from the phenylacetylindole family, which acts as a
cannabinoid agonist at both the CBI and CB2 receptors, with a Ki of llnM at CBI
and 33nM at CB2. Unlike many of the older JWH series of compounds, this
compound does not have a naphthalene ring, instead occupying this position with
a 2'- methoxyphenyl group making JWH-250 ,a representative member of a new
class of cannabinoid ligands.
         e.   CP 47, 497. 2-(3-hydroxycyclohexyl)-5-(2-methylocatan-2-yl)
phenol [some trade and other names: CP-47, 497] and 2-(3-hydroxyclohexyl)-5-(2
methylnonan-2-yl) phenol [some trade names and other names: CP-47, 497, C8
homologue, cannabicyclohexanol] is a cannabinoid receptor agonist drug,
developed by Prizer in the I 980's. It has analgesic effects and is used in
scientific research. It is a potent CBI agonist with a Kd of 2.lnM.
         f.   JWH-081. 4-methoxynaphthalen-1-yl-(1-pentylindol-3-yl) methanone
is an analgesic chemical from the naphthoylindole family, which acts as a
cannabinoid agonist at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors. It is fairly selective
for the CB1 subtype, with affinity at this subtype approximately lOx the
affinity at CB2.
         g.   JWH-250. (1-pentyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-2-(2methoxyphenyl)-ethanone is
an analgesic chemical from the phenylacetylindole family, which acts as a
cannabinoid agonist at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors, with a Ki of 1lnM at
CB2. Unlike many of the older JWH series compounds, this compound does not have
a naphalene ring, instead occupying this position with a 2'-
methoxyphenyphenylacetyl group making JWH-25.0 a representative member of a new
class of cannabinoid ligands.
         h.   HU-210. (6aR, IOaR)-9-(hydroxymethyl)-6, 6-dimethyl-3-
(2methyloctan-2-yl)6a, 7, 10, lOa-tetrahydrobenzo[c] chromen-1-ol is
structurally and pharmacologically similar to tettrahydrocannabinol.
      (4)   Federal Health and Law Enforcement Warning. The Village Board notes
that the National Drug Intelligence Center of the United States Department of
Justice issued an immediate alert to law enforcement and public health
officials of potential substance abuse problems and harmful side effects
related to the use of these synthetic cannabinoid products in EWS 000006 dated
May 18, 2010.
      (5)   Statutory Status. The Village Board finds that while these
synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic drugs listed above may be prohibited
controlled substance analogs under Chapter 961, Wis. Stats., the State of
Wisconsin may not specifically list all varieties of synthetic cannabinoids and
synthetic drugs as controlled substances in Chapter 961, Wis. Stats.
      (6)   Municipal Determination. The Village Board finds that, in order to
promote the public health, safety and welfare, products containing synthetic
cannabinoids or synthetic drugs, and their derivatives, analogues, homologues,
salts, optical isomers and salts of optical isomers with substantially similar
chemical structure and pharmacological activity intended to mimic the effects
of marijauna or other controlled substance, such synthetic substance(s) should
be prohibited in the Village of Edgar. Ingestion of synthetic drugs has been
shown to produce dangerous side effects such as, but not limited, to:
         a.   Nausea;
         b.   Vomiting;
         c.   Hallucinations;
         d.   Blurred vision;
         e.   Delusions;
         f.   Headaches;
         g.   Agitation;
         h.   Anxiety;
         i.   Insomnia;
         j.   Convulsions;

Sec. 11-2-18 Sexual Offender Residency Restrictions.
   (a)   Findings, Recitals and Intent.
      (1)   Recitals.
         a.   The Village Board of the Village of Edgar promulgates this
ordinance enactment to protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of
the citizens of the Village and particularly its children.
         b.   Upon recent review of a published opinion and order in the case
of Hoffman, et al. v. Village of Pleasant Prairie, Case No. 16-CF-697-JES from
the United States District Court, Eastern District of Wisconsin, it is the
intent of the Village Board to adopt a Village of Edgar sexual offender
residency ordinance consistent with this recent court decision.
      (2)   Findings and Intent.
         a.   Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical
violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who
present an extreme threat to the public health, welfare and safety. Sexual
offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their
offenses; and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more
victims that are never reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of
their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society
at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant.
         b.   According to a 1997 report by the United States Department of
Justice, sex offenders have high rates of recidivism which are much higher than
recidivism rates for other types of violent crimes. Sex offenders are the least
likely to be cured and the most likely to re-offend and prey on the most
vulnerable members of the community.
         c.   While Federal and State Fair Housing Statutes prohibit unlawful
discrimination, they do not extend the same protections to a sex offender (as
herein defined) with respect to a place of residency (as herein defined) where
a Safety Zone (as herein defined) has been established.
         d.   It is the intent of this Section to serve the Village's
compelling interest to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and
welfare of the citizens of the Village of Edgar by creating safety zones around
locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein
certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from loitering or
establishing temporary or permanent residence.
         e.   This Section is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the
health and safety of children in the Village of Edgar from risk that convicted
sex offenders may reoffend in locations near their residences. Given the high
rate of recidivism for sex offenders and that reducing opportunity and
temptation is important to minimizing the risk of reoffense, there is a need to
protect children where they congregate or play in public places in addition to
the protections afforded by state law near schools, day care facilities and
other places children frequent.
         f.   The Village of Edgar finds and declares that repeat sexual
offenders who use physical violence and sexual offenders who prey on children
are sexual offenders who present an extreme threat to the public safety and
health of children. Sexual offenders are very likely to use physical violence
and to repeat their offenses. Most sexual offenders commit numerous offenses,
have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a
fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization
to society at large and the community where they reside, while incalculable,
clearly exorbitant. Such persons present a significantly high risk of re-
offending once released. As such, the Village hereby establishes regulations
which restrict certain offenders from residing or congregating in areas which
are at or near where there is a high concentration of children in order to
provide better protection for children in the Village by minimizing immediate
access and proximity to children and thereby reducing the opportunity and
temptation for recidivism.
         g.   The Village Board of the Village of Edgar has also been advised
of the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, in
Doe v. Miller, 405 F.3d 700 (8th Cir. 2005), which provides in part at page 716
of that decision the following:
            "The record does not support a conclusion that the Iowa General
Assembly and the Governor acted based merely on negative attitudes toward, fear
of, or a bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group. [Citations
omitted.] Sex offenders have a high rate of recidivism, and the parties
presented expert testimony that reducing opportunity and temptation is
important to minimizing the risk of reoffense. Even experts in the field could
not predict with confidence whether a particular sex offender will reoffend,
whether an offender convicted of an offense against a teenager will be among
those who "cross over" to offend against a younger child, or the degree to
which regular proximity to a place where children are located enhances the risk
of reoffense against children. One expert in the district court opined that it
just "common sense" that limiting the frequency of contact between sex
offenders and areas where children are located is likely to reduce the risk of
an offense. [Citation omitted.] The policy makers of Iowa are entitled to
employ such "common sense", and we are not persuaded that the means selected to
pursue the State's legitimate interest are without a rational basis ... "
      (3)   Intent. It is the intent of this Section not to impose a criminal
penalty or punish sex offenders, but rather to serve the Village of Edgar's
compelling interest to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and
welfare of the citizens of the Village by creating areas around locations where
children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers, wherein certain sexual
offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or
permanent residence. Due to the high rate of recidivism for sexual offenders,
and because reducing both opportunity and temptation would help minimize the
risk of re-offense, there is a compelling need to protect children where they
congregate or play in public places.

Section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them as follows, except where the

responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under twenty-one (21)
years of age possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person
hosting the event or gathering supplied the alcohol. The Edgar Village Board
finds:
      (1)   Public Health Considerations.
         a.   Events and gatherings held on private or public property where
alcohol is consumed by persons under the age of twenty-one (21) years of age
are harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health
requiring prevention or abatement.
         b.   Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could
have drastic effects on those individuals who use it, particularly underage
individuals, as well as those who are affected by the actions of an
irresponsible user.
      (2)   Prohibiting Underage Consumption. Prohibiting underage consumption
acts to protect underage persons, as well as the general public, from injuries
related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdoses or alcohol-related
traffic accidents.
      (3)   Parental/Guardian Role. Events or gatherings involving underage
possession and consumption often occur outside the presence of parents. There
are, however, instances when the parent(s) or legal guardian is/are present and
condone the activity, and, in some circumstances, provide the alcohol.
      (4)   Deterrent Effect. A deterrent effect will be created by holding an
adult person(s) responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage
possession or consumption occurs.
   (b)   Definitions. For purposes of this Section, the following terms shall
have the following meanings:
      (1)   Alcohol. Ethyl alcohol, hydrated oxide of ethyl, or spirits of

purposes either alone or when diluted, mixed or combined with other substances.
      (3)   Event or Gathering. Any group of three (3) or more persons who have
assembled or gathered together for a social occasion or other activity.
      (4)   Host or Allow. To aid, conduct, entertain, organize, supervise,
control, provide or permit a gathering or event.
      (5)   Parent. Any adult person having legal custody of a juvenile:
         a.   As natural, adoptive parent or step-parent;
         b.   As a legal guardian; or
         c.   As a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of a
court.
      (6)   Residence, Premises, or Public or Private Property. Any home, yard,
farm, field, land, apartment, condominium, hotel or motel room, or other
dwelling unit or accessory structure, or a hall or meeting room, park or any
other place of assembly, whether occupied on a temporary or permanent basis,
whether occupied as a dwelling unit, or specifically for a party or other
social function, and whether owned, leased, rented or used with or without
permission or compensation.
      (7)   Underage Person. Any individual under twenty-one (21) years of age.
      (8)   Present. Being at hand or in attendance.
      (9)   In Control. The power to direct, manage, oversee and/or restrict
the affairs, business or assets of a person or entity.
   (c)   Prohibited Acts.
      (1)   Prohibited Hosting Activity.
         a.   No adult may knowingly permit or fail to take action to prevent
the illegal consumption of alcohol beverages by an underage person on property,
including any premises, owned and occupied by the adult or occupied by the
adult and under the adult's control. This prohibition applies to a lodging
establishment, as defined in Sec. 106.52(l)(d), Wis. Stats., only if the adult
has furnished payment or security of lodging.
         b.   Under this prohibition, it is unlawful for any adult(s) to: host,
allow or permit any event or gathering at any residence, premises or on any
other private or public property under the adult's control where alcohol or
alcohol beverages are present when the adult knows that underage persons will,
likely will, or does consume any alcohol or alcohol beverage with the intent to
consume it; and the adult(s) fails to take reasonable steps to prevent
possession or consumption by the underage person(s).
      (2)   Intent to Aid Prohibited Hosting Activity. An adult(s) violates
this Section if the adult(s) intentionally aids, advises, hires, or conspires
with or otherwise procures another to commit or engage in an act prohibited by
this Section.
      (3)   Presence Not Required for Violation.  An adult(s) who knowingly
hosts an event or gathering does not have to be present at the event or
gathering to be responsible.
   (d)   Exceptions. The following are exceptions to this Section:
      (1)   Other Parties Not Present. This Section does not apply to conduct
solely between an underage person and his/her parent(s) or legal guardian while
that parent or legal guardian is present and in control of the underage person.
      (2)   Legally Protected Religious Observances. This Section does not
apply to legally protected religious observances.
      (3)   Employment Exception. This Section does not apply to situations
where underage persons are lawfully in possession of alcohol or alcohol
beverages during the course and scope of employment.

above. The fact that prior to the present offense a parent, legal guardian or
custodian was informed by any law enforcement officer of a separate violation
of this Section occurring within thirty (30) days of the present offense shall
be prima facie evidence that such parent, legal guardian or custodian allowed
or permitted the present violation. Any parent, legal guardian or custodian
herein who shall have made a missing person notification to the Police
Department shall not be considered to have allowed or permitted any juvenile
seventeen (17) years of age or under to violate this Section. No person shall
be liable under this Subsection for a violation committed by a minor during any

possible thereafter report to law enforcement authorities for the purpose of
taking the custody of the juvenile and shall sign a release for him or her, or

necessary arrangements as may be necessary under the circumstances for the
juvenile's welfare.
   (g)   Warning and Penalty.

enforcement officer shall, prior to issuing a citation or warning for an

not issue a citation or warning for an offense under this Section unless the

exceptions provided in this Section apply.

Sec. 11-5-9    Purchase or Possession of Tobacco, Nicotine Products or Vaping
Paraphernalia by Minors.
   (a)   Finding of Facts; Statement of Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of this Section is to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare of persons in the Village of Edgar by prohibiting persons
under eighteen (18) years of age from possessing and/or using tobacco products
or vapor products or devices, and prohibiting the sale of tobacco products and
vapor products and devices to persons under eighteen (18) years of age.
      (2)   Vaping devices and products provide an alternative smoking
experience to tobacco products. The decline in cigarette smoking and the use of
other tobacco products has resulted in an increase in the popularity of vaping
devices and alternative nicotine delivery systems, particularly among minors.
      (3)   Vaping devices and products often mimic conventional tobacco
products in shape, color and size, with the user exhaling a smoke-like vapor
similar in appearance to smoke exhaled when using tobacco products.
      (4)   Persons under age eighteen (18) years of age are prohibited by law
from purchasing or possessing cigarettes, cigars, and other tobacco products,
and retailers are prohibited from selling them to minors. Tobacco-less vaping
devices and products allow a user to simulate smoking; such products currently
may be purchased by minors and are marketed, unlike tobacco products, without
health warnings, disclosure of nicotine concentrations, content levels of toxic
substances, or age restrictions, and often come in flavors that appeal to
minors. Consumers have no way of knowing whether vapor devices and products are
safe, what potentially harmful chemicals the products contain, and what level
of nicotine the products deliver.
      (5)   The production of e-cigarettes, vapor products and vaping devices
is not currently regulated by federal or state authorities, and the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) has not completed full testing of these products.
Preliminary studies, however, have determined that e-cigarettes, vapor products
and vapor devices can contain chemicals and substances known to be harmful,
which may expose users and bystanders to potential health risks. The contents
of cartridges used in vaping devices and products varies but often contain
nicotine, traces of nicotine, formaldehyde, carcinogens, antifreeze, and other
toxic substances which may pose a health risk to users and bystanders.
      (6)   Vapor devices and products have been found to emit nicotine,
ultrafine particles, lead, acetaldehyde, nickel, chromium, volatile organic
compounds and other toxins, which when inhaled can be dangerous to the user and
public, especially pregnant women and children. Volatile organic compounds,
such as benzene and formaldehyde, found in vaping liquids, as well as in
tobacco products when smoked, are known carcinogens. Inhalation of vaporized
nicotine in propylene glycol is not FDA-approved. Exposure to ultrafine
particles may exacerbate respiratory illnesses, such as asthma. There have been
incidents of electronic vapor devices exploding, causing serious harm to the
user.
      (7)   The nicotine and/or chemicals contained in the e-liquid used in
vapor devices and products are undetectable unless the liquid is tested in a
laboratory facility, making it difficult and impractical for law enforcement
officers to ascertain the composition of the liquid used in a vaping device or
product. Some cartridges used with vapor devices can be refilled with a liquid
nicotine solution, creating the potential for exposure to dangerous nicotine
concentrations.
      (8)   Increased nicotine addiction among minors is a likely outcome from
use of vaping devices and products, and may lead to users transitioning to
tobacco products. After years of declining levels of tobacco use by minors,
recent data indicates that tobacco use by minors is again increasing.
      (9)   The use of vapor devices and products in smoke-free locations
threatens to undermine compliance with state and local smoking regulations and
conflicts with the progress which has been made in public understanding that
smoking is not permitted in public places, schools and places of employment.
      (10)   It is the intent of this Section to protect the public health,
safety and welfare by having consistent and uniform enforcement of smoke-free
laws and ordinances by:
         a.   Reducing the potential for minors to associate the use of vaping
products and devices with a normal or healthy lifestyle;
         b.   Reducing the potential for re-normalizing smoking of any type in
public places and places of employment; and
         c.   Prohibiting the sale or distribution of vapor devices and
products to minors.
      (11)   The Village Board of the Village of Edgar determines that
prohibiting the sale, furnishing, or giving away of vapor devices and products
to minors and prohibiting the possession, purchasing and use of such devices
and products is in the public interest and will promote the public health,
safety, and welfare.

Article A:   Introduction
Sec. 11-7-1 In General.
   (a)   It is a lawful purpose of the Village Board to enact rules and
regulations as are necessary for the preservation of health and to prevent the
spread of AIDS and other communicable or sexually transmitted diseases in the
Village of Edgar. It has been found by localities through the State of
Wisconsin, particularly Milwaukee, Racine, Waukesha, Delafield, Kenosha and
West Allis, as well as communities around the country, including Indianapolis,
Indiana; Boston, Texas; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Newport News, Virginia; Marion
County, Indiana; Detroit, Michigan; and Seattle, Washington; as well as other
communities around the country, that sexually oriented adult entertainment
establishments are predisposed to the creation of unsafe and unsanitary
conditions; that operators and employees of such businesses tend to participate
in sex-related offenses on the premises, creating substantial law enforcement
problems, and that the operational characteristics of such businesses have a
deleterious effect on surrounding areas, resulting in neighborhood blight and
reduced property values, especially when such businesses are concentrated in
one (I) area. Many of such establishments install movie viewing booths with
doors in which patrons view videotapes, movies, films and other forms of
entertainment characterized by their emphasis on depicting, describing or
relating to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas, and that
such booths have been and are being used by patrons to engage in sexual acts
resulting in unsanitary, unhealthy and unsafe conditions in said booths and
establishments. This Chapter is intended to establish standards in order to
prevent the spread of AIDS and other communicable or sexually transmitted
diseases, and to eliminate the deleterious effects described above in the
Village of Edgar.
   (b)   The Village Board finds that there is an increasing likelihood of
commercial exploitation of human sexuality by owners of premises holding "Class
B" alcohol beverage licenses in the State of Wisconsin. Such exploitation takes
place in the form of employing or permitting persons to perform or exhibit
their nude or semi-nude bodies to other persons as an inducement to other
persons to purchase alcohol beverages. The direct result of such exploitation
is criminal activity, moral degradation and disturbance of the peace and good
order of the community. In addition, this commercial exploitation of such nude
and semi- nude acts is adverse to the public's interest in the quality of life,
commercial activity and total community environment in the Village of Edgar.

greater impact on the Village's resources, and that the Village Board has
determined that the Village needs to balance the use of Village parks, park
facilities, and park shelters by large groups to help offset costs associated
with such uses and to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

Article B:   General Provisions
Sec. 13-1-20 Jurisdiction and General Provisions.
   (a)   Jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of this Chapter shall apply to all
structures, lands, water and air within the corporate limits of the Village of
Edgar. The provisions of this Chapter shall be held to be the minimum
requirements for carrying out the intent and purpose of this Chapter.
   (b)   Compliance. No new structure, new use of land, water or air or change
in the use of land, water or air shall hereafter be permitted and no structure
or part thereof shall hereafter be located, erected, moved, reconstructed,
extended, enlarged, converted or structurally altered without a zoning permit
and without full compliance with the provisions of this Chapter and all other
applicable local, county and state regulations.
   (c)   District Regulations to be Complied With. Except as otherwise
provided, the use and height of buildings hereafter erected, converted, moved,
enlarged or structurally altered and the use of any land shall be in compliance
with the regulations established herein for the district in which such building
or land is located.
   (d)   Relationship with Other Laws. Where the conditions imposed by any part
of this Chapter upon the use of land or buildings or upon the bulk of buildings
are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions
imposed by any other provisions of this Chapter or any other laws, ordinances,
resolutions, rules or regulations of any kind, the regulations which are more
restrictive (or impose higher standards or requirements) shall be enforced.
   (e)   Legal Remedies. No provision of this Chapter shall be construed to bar
an action to enjoin or abate the use or occupancy of any land, buildings or
other structures as a nuisance under the appropriate state laws.
Sec. 13-1-21 Use Regulations.
The following uses and their essential services may be allowed in any zoning
district:
   (a)   Permitted Uses. Permitted uses, being the principal uses, specified
for a district.
   (b)   Accessory Uses. Accessory uses and structures as specified under this
Chapter are permitted but not until their principal structure is present or
under construction.
   (c)   Conditional Uses.
      (1)   Approved Procedures. Conditional uses and their accessory
conditional uses are considered as special uses requiring, for their
authorization, review, public hearing and approval in accordance with Article E
of this Chapter excepting those existent at time of original adoption of the
Zoning Code.
      (2)   Permitted Use Terminates Conditional Use. Conditional use(s), when
replaced by permitted use(s), shall terminate. In such case(s), the
reestablishment of any previous conditional use(s), or establishment of new
conditional use(s) shall require review, public hearing and approval in
accordance with Article E of this Chapter.
      (3)   Limits on Conditional Use Duration. Conditional uses authorized by
the Village Board may be established for a period of time to a time certain or
until a future happening or event at which the same shall terminate, such as a
change of ownership or occupancy.
      (4)   Substitution. Conditional uses authorized by the Village Board
shall not be subject to substitution with other conditional uses, either
regular or limited, whether similar type or not, without Village Board approval
and the procedures required in Article E of this Chapter.
      (5)   Pre-Existing Conditional Uses. Those existing uses which are
classified as "conditional uses" for the district(s) in which they are located
at the time of original adoption of this Chapter require no action by the
Village Board for them to continue as valid conditional uses, and the same
shall be deemed to be "regular" conditional uses.
   (d)   Classification of Unlisted Uses. Any use not specifically listed as a
permitted use or a conditional use in the districts established in Article C
shall be considered to be prohibited except as may be otherwise specifically
provided hereinafter. In case of a question as to the classification of an
unlisted use, the question shall be submitted to the Village Board for
determination, following a recommendation from the Zoning Administrator and
Plan Commission, in accordance with the following procedure:
      (1)   Application. Application for determination for classification of an
unlisted use shall be made in writing to the Zoning Administrator and shall
include a detailed description of the proposed use and such other information
as may be required by the Village Board to facilitate the determination.
      (2)   Investigation. The Village Board shall make or have made such
investigations as it deems necessary in order to compare the nature and
characteristics of the proposed use with those of the uses specifically listed
in the Chapter and to recommend its classification.
      (3)   Determination. The determination of the Village Board shall be
rendered in writing within sixty (60) days from the application and shall
include findings supporting the conclusion. The Village Board shall determine
if the classification of the unlisted use is a permitted use, conditional use
or prohibited use in one (1) or more of the districts established in Article C.
      (4)   Effective Date of Determination. At the time of this determination
of the classification of the unlisted use by the Village Board, the
classification of the unlisted use shall become effective.
      (5)   Appeals. The classification determination by the Village Board
under this Subsection may be appealed to the Zoning Board of Appeals pursuant
to Sections 13-1-260 through 13-1-262.
Sec. 13-1-22 Site Regulations.
   (a)   Minimum Street Frontage. All lots shall abut upon a public street or
other officially approved means of access, and each lot shall have a minimum
frontage of twenty (25) feet at the front setback line; however, to be
buildable, the lot shall comply with the frontage requirements of the zoning
district in which it is located.
   (b)   Principal Structures.
      (1)   One Principal Structure Per Lot. All residential principal
structures shall be located on a legal lot. Except in the case of planned unit
developments, not more than one
      (1)   principal building or use and accessory structures permitted by
this Chapter, including a private garage, may be located on a lot in any
residential district.
      (2)   Special Exception. The Village Board may permit as a conditional
use pursuant to Article E or a planned unit development under Article D more
than one (1) principal structure per lot in any district where unique
characteristics exist and more than one
      (1)   such structure is needed for the orderly development of the parcel.
Such approval shall not be based upon personal convenience or financial gain
alone. Where additional structures are permitted, the Village Board may impose
additional yard requirements, landscaping requirements or parking requirements,
or require a minimum separation distance between principal structures.
   (c)   Dedicated Street. All lots shall abut a public street or Village-
approved private road or way which is constructed to applicable Village
standards. No zoning permit shall be issued for a lot which abuts a public
street dedicated to only a portion of its proposed width and located on that
side thereof from which the required dedication has not been secured.
   (d)   Site Suitability. No land shall be used or structure erected where the
land is held unsuitable for such use or structure by the Village Board, upon
the recommendation of the Plan Commission, by reason of flooding, concentrated
runoff, inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock formation, unfavorable
topography, low percolation rate or bearing strength, erosion susceptibility or
any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety, prosperity,
aesthetics and general welfare of this community. The Plan Commission, in
applying the provisions of the Section, shall, in writing, recite the
particular facts upon which it bases its recommendation that the land is not
suitable for certain uses. The applicant shall have an opportunity to present
evidence contesting such unsuitability if he/she so desires. Thereafter, the
Plan Commission may affirm, modify or withdraw its recommended determination of
unsuitability when making its recommendation to the Village Board.
   (e)   Preservation of Topography. In order to protect the property owner
from possible damage due to change in the existing grade of adjoining lands and
to aid in preserving and protecting the natural beauty and character of the
landscape, no change in the existing topography of any land shall be made which
would result in increasing any portion of the slope to a ratio greater than one
and one-half (1-1/2) horizontal to one (1) vertical, within a distance of
twenty (20) feet from the property line, except with the written consent of the
owner of the abutting property and with the approval of the Village Board, upon
the recommendation of the Plan Commission, or which would alter the existing
drainage or topography in any way as to adversely affect the adjoining
property. In no case shall any slope exceed the normal angle of slippage of the
material involved, and all slopes shall be protected against erosion.
   (f)   Setbacks - Decks, Porches, Handicapped Ramps, and Fireplace Chases.
For purposes of this Chapter, handicapped ramps, decks, porches and fireplace
chases shall be considered a part of a building or structure for determining
setback compliance.
   (g)   Vacated Streets. Whenever any street, alley, easement or public way is
vacated by official action, the zoning district abutting the centerline of the
said vacated area shall not be affected by such proceeding.
   (h)   Obstruction of Unplatted Lands. All buildings hereafter erected upon
unplatted land shall be so placed that they will not obstruct proper street
extensions or other features of proper subdivision and land platting.
   (i)   Prohibited Dwelling Units (Accessory Buildings, Recreational Vehicles,
Tents, etc.)
      (1)   Except as provided in Subsection (i)(2) below or in Section
13-1-29, no cellar, basement or unfinished home, garage, tent, recreational
vehicle, camper, recreational trailer or accessory building shall, at any time,
be used as a dwelling unit. Basements shall not be used as dwelling units,
except where specifically designed for such use through proper damp-proofing,
fire-protecting walls and other requirements as may be imposed by the building
and housing codes.
      (2)   A recreational vehicle, camper or tent on private property not
zoned for campground purposes may be occupied as living quarters only as
prescribed in Section
13-1-29. Such occupancy is permissible only with the written permission of the
property owner.
   (j)   Temporary Uses. Temporary uses such as real estate sales field offices
or shelters for materials and equipment being used in the construction of a
permanent structure, may be permitted by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning
Administrator may impose conditions on such temporary uses.
   (k)   Screening Regulations. Any use required by this Chapter to be screened
shall meet applicable buffer yard and screening requirements, specifically
Section
13-1-25.
   (I)   Yard Reduction or Joint Use.
      (1)   Required Area. No lot, yard, parking area, building area or other
space shall be reduced in area or dimension so as not to meet the provisions of
this Chapter. No part of any lot, yard, parking area or other space required
for a structure or use shall be used for any other structure or use.
      (2)   Joint Use. No part of any lot, parking area, yard or other space
required for a structure or use shall be used for any other structure or use.
No part of a yard or other open space provided about any building for the
purpose of complying with the provisions of this Chapter shall be included as
part of a yard or open space required for another building.
   (m)   Lots Abutting More Restrictive District. The street yard setbacks in
the less restrictive district shall be modified for a distance of not less than
thirty (30) feet from the more restrictive district boundary line so such
street yard setbacks shall be no less than the average of the street yards
required in both districts.
   (n)   Double-Frontage Lots. Buildings on through lots and extending from
street to street may have waived the requirements for a rear yard by furnishing
an equivalent open space on the same lot in lieu of the required rear yard,
provided that the setback requirements on both streets be complied with.
   (o)   Area Required for Rubbish Containers. On all premises on which there
will be constructed after the effective date of this Chapter a new structure
which will house four
      (4) or more dwelling units, any existing building converted to four (4)
or more dwelling units after such date, any rooming house or other residential
structure having four (4) or more occupants, or a new commercial or industrial
building, there shall be provided a sufficient area as determined by the Zoning
Administrator for screened refuse/recycling collection containers. Such areas
shall not be located in the front or street side yard and shall be accessible

   (p)   Lakeshore or Stream Setbacks. The term "Shoreline", as used herein,
shall be interpreted to mean the normal high water line. The term "Building",
as used herein, shall be interpreted to mean a principal building. No new
building shall be constructed adjacent to a navigable stream or on a lakeshore
lot in such a way that any portion thereof will be closer to the shoreline of
the lake than seventy-five (75) feet; an existing building can be reconstructed
provided the building footprint is not exceeded.
Sec. 13-1-23 Modifications; Height, Area and Setback Exceptions.
   (a)   Height. The district height limitations stipulated elsewhere in this
Chapter may be exceeded, but such modification shall be in accord with the
following:
      (1)   Architectural Structures. Agricultural structures, such as barns,
silos and windmills, shall not exceed in height twice their distance from the
nearest lot line.
      (2)   Special Structures, such as elevator penthouses, gas tanks, grain

three (3) times their distance from the nearest lot line.
      (5)   Public or Semipublic Facilities. Public or semipublic facilities,
such as schools, churches, hospitals, monuments, sanitariums, libraries,
government offices and stations, may be erected to a height of sixty (60) feet,
provided all required yards are increased not less than one (1) foot for each
foot the structure exceeds the district's maximum height requirement.
   (b)   Yards. The yard requirements stipulated elsewhere in this Chapter may
be modified as follows:
      (1)   Architectural Projections. Chimneys, flues, sills, eaves, belt
courses, ornaments, etc., may project into any required yard, but such

any residential or business district to the average of the existing street
yards of the abutting principal structures on each side. Where fifty percent
(50%) or more of the frontage on a block is occupied by principal structures
having setbacks less than that required by this Chapter, setback on each
remaining lot shall be determined in accordance with the following rule. The
front building line of a proposed structure shall be no nearer the front lot
line than a line joining adjacent front corners of the nearest principal struc-
tures which are in the same block frontage on either side of the proposed
structure. If, on a block frontage, no principal structure exists to one side
of a proposed structure, a structure may be assumed to exist on the comer lot
which conforms to the minimum setback and side yard width requirements of this
Chapter.
      (2)   Additions. Additions in the front yard of existing structures shall
not project beyond the average of the existing front yards on the abutting lots
or parcels.
   (d)   Corner Side Yards. The required side yard on the street side of comer

Sec. 13-1-24 Parcels Not Served by Public Sewer or Water.
In any location where the Village Board determines that public water service or
public sewage service is not in the public interest due to unique factors such
as, but not limited to, excessive cost, terrain, etc., the lot shall have
adequate soils for the construction and operation of private individual sewage
treatment and private individual water systems, and sufficient area for at
least one (1) replacement private sewage treatment system according to Ch. SPS
383, Wis. Adm. Code. Such determination shall be made by the Village Board
based on whether unique circumstances exist and the overall well-being of best
interests of serving the citizenry with public sewer/water facilities.
Sec. 13-1-25 Screens and Buffers.
   (a)   Required Screens and Buffers. Where screens or buffers are required by
this Chapter or the Village Board to reduce the impact of existing or proposed
uses on adjacent properties, the following standards in Subsections (b) and (c)
shall be followed. Buffer yards and screens may be required jointly or
separately.
   (b)   Buffer Yards. Buffer yards are horizontal separations along lot lines
that are intended to increase the physical separation between incompatible
uses. The width of the required buffer yard shall be determined by the Village
Board, upon the recommendation of the Zoning Administrator. The minimum width
shall be ten (10) feet.
   (c)   Screens. Screens are barriers located in a limited space [ten (10)
feet or less] intended to perform a buffering effect, particularly for noise
reduction or visual screening. Screens may consist of existing or planted
vegetation, fences, walls, earth berms or similar techniques. Plant screens
shall be sufficient to provide a year-round screen within three (3) years of
installation. Walls or earth berms shall be required where noise reduction is
necessary. Screen plantings shall be permanently maintained by the owner of the
property, and any plant materials which do not live shall be replaced within
six (6) months. The design of all screens shall be approved by the Zoning
Administrator.
Sec. 13-1-26 Establishment of Building Grades.
   (a)   Establishment of Building Grade Required. No person, corporation, or
entity shall establish a grade for a building being erected, structurally
altered, or relocated under this Section without prior approval of the Building
Inspector or Zoning Administrator. This provision applies to all applications
for zoning permits, including those for residential zoning districts.
   (b)   Building Grades.
      (1)   Elevations for buildings shall be established as based on an
average building-to-street height relationship, which shall be a minimum of two
(2) feet with a front yard/driveway slope of between one percent (1%) and ten
percent (10%). The Building Inspector or Zoning Administrator shall review the
information provided regarding the building-to-street height relationship in
the information submitted at the time of the zoning permit request.
      (2)   If the building-to-street height relationship is not provided at
the time of the zoning permit request or if verification is necessary, the
Building Inspector or Zoning Administrator may require the permit applicant to
provide necessary elevations on a plan drawing, prepared by a qualified
contractor, land surveyor, or Wisconsin-licensed engineer prior to permit
issuance.
   (c)   Building-to-Height Measurement.
      (1)   The building-to-height relationship shall be referenced from the
curb grade as defined in Article P of this Chapter or the street centerline
grade where no curb is present. For streets with significant slope, the average
elevation shall be used and is considered
to be the mean of two (2) street elevations taken at the straight projection on
the frontage street of the side building lines. Additional information may be
required in the cases of non-uniform lot dimensions, non-uniform building lines
or reversed comer lots, as determined by the Building Inspector or Zoning
Administrator.
      (2)   The building-to-street height relationship may be dictated as based
on existing utility services, such as Village sanitary sewer service. In the
case of a conflict between sanitary sewer and street grades, the most
restrictive condition shall apply.
      (3)   The building elevation shall be taken on the finished top of the
concrete foundation wall, or the finished garage slab, of the existing or
planned building. The Building Inspector or Zoning Administrator shall
determine the building-to-street height relationship based on this information
and identify the controlling building level where surface stormwater drainage
above that elevation would adversely affect exterior or interior building
appurtenances. Buildings with walkout designs and partial exposure amenities
are considered special conditions which may require more information for review
prior to a determination on the application.
   (d)   Permit Issuance.
      (1)   If the Building Inspector or Zoning Administrator, upon the review
of the application information, determines a potential problem in the site
grading or drainage in regard to a neighboring property, the Building Inspector
or Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant and the Director of Public
Works. No building permit shall be issued until zoning permit requirements
under this Section have been satisfactorily addressed in the plan.
      (2)   The Village may require the written consent of neighboring property
owners regarding the proposed grade-related activity prior to issuance of any
permits. The Village does not warranty or assume any liability regarding any
grading or drainage problems following the issuance of a permit.
   (e)   Accessory Building Grades. For any new accessory building,
establishment of grade shall be determined per the provisions of this Section,
and/or existing or new driveway permit conditions, and/or referenced off the
existing principal structure, whichever is more restrictive. While the Village
does not enforce restrictive covenants or deed restrictions, these may be
reviewed and considered under the permit review process.
   (f)   Variances. An applicant may request a variance from the requirements
of this Section due to unusual or unique circumstances with the property. Such
variance requests shall be made prior to the issuance of any applicable
permits, and shall be reviewed pursuant to the procedures in Section
13-1-263. The Building Inspector, Zoning Administrator and/or Director of
Public Works may make recommendations to the Zoning Board of Appeals regarding
the variance request.
   (g)   Nonconforming Structures. Buildings which are classified as
nonconforming structures shall also be subject to the provisions of Article F
of this Chapter.

not rejected, the clerk of the city or village with whom the annexation
petition is filed shall give written notice thereof by personal service or
registered mail with return receipt requested to the clerk of any town from

the referendum, bears to the total number of electors in such territory, voting
in the referendum.
      (7)   Effect. If the result of the referendum is against annexation, all
previous proceedings shall be nullified. If the result of the referendum is
annexation, failure of any town official to perform literally any duty required

      (1)   Enactment. An ordinance for the annexation of the territory
describing in the annexation petition may be enacted by a two-thirds vote of
the elected member of the governing body not less than twenty (20) days after
the publication of the notice of intention to circulate the petition and not
later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of filing with the city
or village clerk of the petition for annexation or of the referendum election
if favorable to the annexation. If the annexation is subject to Subsection (k),
the governing body shall first review the reasons given by the Wisconsin
Department of Administration that the proposed annexation is against the public
interest. Subject to Section 59.692(7), Wis. Stats., such an ordinance may
temporarily designate the classification of the annexed area for zoning
purposes until the zoning ordinance is amended as prescribed in Section 62.23
(7)(d), Wis. Stats. Before introduction of an ordinance containing such
temporary classification, the proposed classification shall be referred to and
recommended by the Plan Commission. The authority to make such temporary
classification shall not be effective when the county ordinance prevails during

territory shall file immediately with the secretary of state a certified copy
of the ordinance, certificate and plat, and shall send one copy to each company
that provides any utility service in the area that is annexed. The clerk shall
also record the ordinance with the register of deeds and file a signed copy of
the ordinance with the clerk of any affected school district. Failure to file,
record or send shall not invalidate the annexation and the duty to file, record
or send shall be a continuing one. The ordinance that is filed, recorded or
sent shall describe the annexed territory and the associated population. The
information filed with the Secretary of State shall be utilized in making
recommen- dations for adjustments to entitlements under the federal revenue
sharing program and distribution of funds under Ch. 79, Wis. Stats. The clerk
shall certify annually to the Secretary of State and record with the Register
of Deeds a legal description of the total boundaries of the municipality, as
those boundaries existed on December 1, unless there has been no change in the
twelve (12) months proceeding.
      (2)   State Agency Review. Within ten (10) days of receipt of the
annexation ordinance, certificate and plat, the Secretary of State shall
forward two (2) copies of the ordinance, certificate and plat to the Wisconsin
Department of Transportation, one (1) copy to the Wisconsin Department of
Administration, one (1) copy to the Wisconsin Department of Revenue, one (1)
copy to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, one (1) copy to the
Wisconsin Department of Administration, one (1) copy to the Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources, and one (1) copy to the Wisconsin Department
of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, and two (2) copies to the clerk
of the municipality from which the territory was annexed.
      (3)   Special Survey. Any city or village may direct a survey of its
present boundaries to be made, and when properly attested, the survey and plat
may be filed in the Office of the Register of Deeds in the county in which the
city or village is located, whereupon the survey and plat shall be prima facie
evidence of the facts therein set forth.
   (i)   Validity of Plats. Where any annexation is declared invalid but prior
to such declaration and subsequent to such annexation a plat has been submitted
and has been approved as required in Section 236.l'0(l)(a), Wis. Stats., such
plat shall be deemed validly approved despite the invalidity of the annexation.
   (j)   Action Contesting Validity of Annexation.
      (1)   Time of Commencement. An action on any grounds whatsoever, whether
denominated procedural or jurisdictional, to contest the validity of an
annexation shall be commenced within the time after adoption of the annexation
ordinance provided by Section 893.73(2), Wis. Stats.
      (2)   Preference in Circuit Court. An action contesting an annexation
shall be given preference in circuit court.
   (k)   Review of Annexations.
      (1)   Annexations Within Populous Counties. No annexation proceeding
within a county having a population of fifty thousand (50,000) or more shall be
valid unless the person causing a notice of annexation is published under
Subsection (c) shall within five (5) days of the publication mail a copy of the
notice, legal description and a scale map of the proposed annexation to the
clerk of each municipality affected and the Wisconsin Department of
Administration (Department). The Department may within twenty (20) days after
the receipt of the notice mail to the clerk of the town within which the
territory lies and to the clerk of the proposed annexing village or city a
notice that in its opinion the annexation is against the public interest. No
later than ten (10) days after mailing the notice, the Department shall advise
the clerk of the town in which the territory is located and the clerk of the
village or city to which the annexation is proposed of the reasons the
annexation is against the public interest as defined in Subsection (k)(2)
below. The annexing municipality shall review the advice before final action is
taken.
      (2)   Definition of Public Interest. For purposes of this Subsection,
"public interest" is determined by the Wisconsin Department of Administration
after consideration of the following:
         a.   Whether the government services, including zoning, to be supplied
to the territory could clearly be better supplied by the town or some other
village or city whose boundaries are contiguous to the territory proposed for
annexation which files with the circuit court a certified copy of a resolution
adopted by a two-thirds vote of the elected members of the governing body
indicating a willingness to annex the territory upon receiving an otherwise
valid petition for the annexation of the territory.
         b.   The shape of the proposed annexation and the homogeneity of the
territory with the annexing village or city and any other contiguous village or
city.
      (1)   Unanimous Approval Annexations. If a petition for direct annexation
signed by all of the electors residing in the territory and the owner of all of
the real property in the territory is filed with the city or village clerk, and
with the town clerk of the town or towns in which the territory is located,
together with a scale map and a legal description of the property to be
annexed, an annexation ordinance for the annexation of the territory may be
enacted by a two-thirds vote of the elected members of the governing body of
the city or village without compliance with the notice requirements of
Subsection (c) above. In such annexations, subject to Subsection (k), the
person filing the copy of the scale map and a legal description of the
territory to be annexed to the Wisconsin Department of Administration and the
governing body shall review the advice of the Department, if any, before
enacting the annexation ordinance.
   (m)   Review Requirements. The provisions of Subsection (I) do not eliminate
the necessity for review as required by Subsection (k).
   (n)   Annexation of Town Islands. Upon its own motion, a city or village by
a two-thirds vote of the entire membership of its governing body may enact an
ordinance annexing territory which comprises a portion of a town or towns and
which was completely surrounded by territory of the village or city on December
2, 1973. The ordinance shall include all surrounded town areas except those
exempt by mutual agreement of all of the governing bodies involved. The
annexation ordinance shall contain a legal description of the territory and the
name of the town or towns from which the territory is detached. Upon enactment
of the ordinance, the city or village clerk immediately shall file six (6)
certified copies of the ordinance in the office of the Wisconsin Secretary of
State, together with six (6) copies of the scale map. The Secretary of State
shall forward two (2) copies of the ordinance and scale map to the Wisconsin
Department of Transportation, one (1) copy to the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources, one (1) copy to the Wisconsin Department of Revenue, and one
(1) copy to the Wisconsin Department of Administration. This subsection does
not apply if the town island was created only by the annexation of a railroad
right-of-way or drainage ditch. This Subsection does not apply to land owned by
a town government which has existing town government buildings located thereon.
No town island may be annexed under this Subsection if the island consists of
over sixty-five (65) acres or contains over one hundred (100) residents. After
December 2, 1973, no city or village may, by annexation, create a town island,
which is completely surrounded by the city or village.
   (o)   Effective Date of Annexations. Because the creation of congressional,
legislative, supervisory and aldermanic districts of equal population is a
matter of statewide concern, any annexation action that affects a tract of land
that is the subject of an ordinance enacted or resolution adopted by any city
during the period from January I, 1990 to April I, 1991, or any later date,
expressing an intent to not exercise the city's authority to annex territory
before April 1, 1991, or the specified later date, taken by a municipality
during the period beginning on April 1 of the year commencing after each
federal decennial census of population and ending on June 30 of the year
commencing after that census, is effective on July 1 of the year commencing
after that census or at such later date as may be specified in the annexation
ordinance. This Subsection first applies to annexations effective after March
31, 1991.
   (p)   Annexation of Municipal-Owned Territory. In addition to other methods
provided by law and subject to Sections 59.692(7), 66.0223 and 66.0307, Wis.
Stats., territory owned by and lying near but not necessarily contiguous to a
village or city may be annexed to a village or city by ordinance enacted by the
board of trustees of the village or the common council of the city, provided
that in the case of noncontiguous territory the use of the territory by the
village or city is not contrary to any town or county zoning regulation. The
ordinance shall contain the exact description of the territory annexed and the
names of the towns from which detached and shall operate to attach the
territory to the village or city upon the filing of six (6) copies of a plat
showing the boundaries of the territory attached. Two (2) copies of the
ordinance and plat shall be forwarded by the Wisconsin Secretary of State to
the Wisconsin Department of Transportation, one (I) copy to the Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources, one (1) copy to Wisconsin Department of
Revenue, and one (1) copy to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction.
Sec. 13-1-28 Extension of Utilities Outside Corporate Limits.
Village public utilities will only be extended into and provided to those areas
which are within the corporate limits of the Village of Edgar at the time of
the utility extension unless provided otherwise by intergovernmental or other
agreement.
Sec. 13-1-29 Prohibited Dwelling Units.
   (a)   Purpose; Authority. Pursuant to the grant of police powers to

      (1)   Roofs. All dwellings shall have a roof with a pitch of at least
three (3) inches in height for each one (1) foot of width, and with an eve
which extends a minimum bo six (6) inches from the wall which supports the
roof. All dwellings, accessory garages and carports shall have a roof surfaced
with any of the following materials:

lines, town lines or corporate limits; such government survey lines or
political subdivision lines shall be construed to be said boundaries.
         d.   Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be
construed to be midway between the main tracks.
         e.   Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed
to follow such shorelines and, in the event of change in the shoreline, shall

         f.   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features
indicated in the preceding shall be so construed. Distances not specifically
indicated on the zoning map shall be determined by the scale of the map.
         g.   Where a district boundary line, as appearing on the zoning map,
divided a lot in single ownership at the time of original enactment of this
Zoning Code, the district requirements for the least restricted portion of such
lot shall be deemed to apply to the whole thereof, provided that such extension
shall not include any part of such lot more than thirty-five (35) feet beyond
the district boundary lines.

Sec. 13-1-59 AEO Adult Entertainment Overlay District.
   (a)   Authority.
      (1)   The Village Board has authority, to be liberally construed in favor
of the Village of Edgar, under its general police powers set forth in Ch. 61,
Wis. Stats., to act for the good order of the municipality and for the health,
morals, safety and welfare of the public; and may carry out its powers by
regulation and suppression; and
      (2)   The Village Board recognizes it lacks authority to regulate
obscenity under Sec. 66.0107(3), Wis. Stats., and does not intend by adopting
this Section to regulate obscenity, since nudity in and of itself is not
obscene, it declares its intent to enact an ordinance addressing the secondary
effects of live, totally nude, non-obscene, erotic dancing in bars and taverns;
and
      (3)   Adult establishments in other communities tended to further the
increase of criminal and other offensive activity, to disrupt the peace and
order of the communities, to depreciate the value of real property, to harm the
economic welfare of the communities and to negatively affect the quality of
life of the communities; and such secondary effects are detrimental to the
public health, safety and general welfare of citizens; and
      (4)   The Village Board recognizes the U.S. Supreme Court has held that
material with adult content is within the outer perimeters of the First
Amendment to the United States Constitution and therefore entitled to some
limited protection under the First Amendment, and the governing body further
recognizes that freedom of speech is among our most precious and highly
protected rights, and wishes to act consistently with full protection of those
rights; and
      (5)   However, the Village Board is aware, based on the experiences of
other communities, that adult establishments may and do generate secondary
effects which the governing body believes are detrimental to the public health,
safety and welfare of the citizens of the Village of Edgar; and
      (6)   Among these secondary effects are:
         a.   The potential increase in prostitution and other sex-related
offenses, as well as other crimes and offenses;
         b.   The potential depreciation of property values in neighborhoods
where adult establishments featuring nude dancing exist;
         c.   Health risks associated with the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases; and
         d.   The potential for infiltration by organized crime for the purpose
of unlawful conduct; and
      (7)   The Village Board desires to minimize, prevent and control these
adverse effects and thereby protect the health, safety and general welfare of
the citizens of the Village of Edgar; protect the citizens from increased
crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and character
of surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the spread of urban blight; and
      (8)   The Village Board has determined that the enactment of a zoning
ordinance provision allowing adult establishments viable areas in which to
exist within the Village while keeping those adult establishments separated
from each other, residential areas, schools, churches, day care centers, or
bars or taverns, promotes the goal of minimizing, preventing and controlling
the negative secondary effects associated with such adult establishments.
   (b)   Purpose. The purpose of the ABO Adult Entertainment Overlay District
is to create an overlay zoning district whereby adult establishments are
sufficiently separated from each other and conflicting uses so as to ameliorate
the negative secondary effects of adult uses while providing adult
establishments sufficient area and opportunity to operate within the Village so
as not to suppress their existence.

this Section shall be utilized by the Village in determining the adequacy of
all plans for proposed planned unit developments.
      (2)   Consideration of Comprehensive Plans. Consideration shall be given
to applicable provisions of the Village Comprehensive Plan, Official Map and
other adopted plans as they pertain to future school sites, recreation sites,
water supply, sewage treatment systems, highway and street alignments,
environmental integrity, and other public facilities where appropriate.
      (3)   Consideration of Existing Adjacent Development. The development of
the proposed PUD shall take into consideration relevant features of adjacent
existing development.
      (4)   Unsafe or Hazardous Conditions. Land with unsafe or hazardous
conditions, such as open quarries, unconsolidated fill, floodplains or steep
slopes, shall not be developed unless the PUD provides for adequate safeguards
which are approved by the Village Board.
   (b)   Location of Structures. Specific lot size, building location, height,
size, floor area, and other such requirements shall be based upon determination
by the Village Board, following advisory recommendations from the Plan
Commission, as to their appropriateness to the proposed uses and structures as
they relate to the total environmental concept of the planned development,
consistent with the criteria set forth in this Article, and, as near as
practicable, consistent with standards established in applicable existing basic
zoning districts and regulations, and with those generally accepted basic
standards necessary to insure the protection of the public health, safety and
general welfare of that area of the community.
   (c)   Minimum Area Requirements. Areas designated as planned unit
developments shall contain a minimum development area as follows:
      Principal Uses   Minimum Area of PUD
      Residential PUD   3   acres
      Commercial PUD   5   acres
      Industrial PUD   5   acres
      Mixed Compatible Use   5   acres
   (d)   Allowable Residential Densities
      (1)   General Lot Area, Density, Width and Setback/Yard Requirements.
         a.   In a PUD Planned Unit Development Overlay District, area and
width requirements of the basic use district may be modified; however, in no
case shall the average density in a residential district exceed the number of
dwelling units by more than five percent (5%) that would have been permitted if
the planned unit development regulations had not been utilized.
         b.   Setbacks required by the underlying base use district may be
modified in PUD Planned Unit Development Overlay Districts; however, no setback
shall be less than twenty-five (25) feet from any street right-of-way.
         c.   No principal structures in planned unit developments shall be
located closer than thirty (30) feet to another structure.
         d.   Structures in residential PUD Planned Unit Development Overlay
Districts shall have a rear yard of not less than twenty-five (25) feet.
      (2)   Minimum Lot Area Requirements. Provided the overall number of
dwelling units per acre (density) is not increased by more than five percent
(5%) beyond the number of dwelling units that would have been permitted if the
PUD District had not been utilized, and provided adequate open space is
maintained, the planned unit development may include lot areas per dwelling
unit smaller than those normally required in the underlying zoning district.
However, no lot shall be less than the minimum lot areas indicated below:
 
Use                       Minimum Lot Area per Dwelling Unit (square feet)
Single-family             6,000
Two-family                4,000
Multiple-family (1 story) 3,000

Multiple-family (3 story) 2,000
 
      (3)   Residential Permitted Densities Standards; Common Open Space
Requirements. In the case of residential uses, the allowable density shall be
based on the following considerations:
         a.   That there will result an appropriate relationship between the
number of dwelling units and the facilities required and available to service
them, such as sewer, water, schools, streets, and other appropriate municipal
services.
         b.   That there will be an appropriate provision of common open space
to compensate for clustering or other concentration of dwelling units,
consistent with the goal of creating a desirable living environment. Except as
provided below, no plan for a planned unit development shall be approved unless
such plan provides for permanent open space equivalent to twenty percent (20%)
of the total area in single-family residential planned unit developments,
twenty-five percent (25%) in multi-family residential planned unit
developments, and five percent (5%) in commercial/industrial planned unit
developments. Such open space may be in any of the following forms, provided
they contribute realistically and specifically to the enhancement of the
environmental character of the development for benefit of the residents thereof
and the general community:
            1.   Natural areas such as woods, unique meadows, marshes, lakes,
wetlands, streams and ponds, providing either an environmental amenity or
serving a useful ecological purpose.
            2.   Agricultural areas, including prime crop land, pasture,
orchards, and tree nurseries, contributing to the preservation of the
agricultural land resource or significantly contributing to the environmental
character of the area.
            3.   Recreational areas, such as parks, parkways, greenbelts,
playfields, and golf courses.
         c.   That there will result an appropriate relationship between the
character of existing developments or likely to result from the zoning of
property thereto.

      (1)   Buildings in a planned unit development shall not exceed the height
permitted in the basic use district.
      (2)   Buildings in a planned unit development shall have a minimum area
that is equal to or greater than that required in the basic use district.
   (f)   Single Parcel, Lot or Tract. At the time of filing, the land proposed
for a PUD Planned Unit Development Overlay District shall be considered as one
(1) tract, lot or parcel, and the legal description must define said PUD as a
single parcel, lot or tract.
Sec. 13-1-74 Planned Unit Development Site Design Standards.
   (a)   Natural Features. Physical layout and form of all structures shall be
designed with regard to the topography and natural features of the site.
   (b)   Visual Aspects. The overall design shall provide for the appearance of
external unity throughout the planned unit development project. Variations of
building elevations and materials used therein shall be encouraged insofar as
they reinforce rather than hamper the design harmony. Housing and other
facilities near the periphery of the planned unit development shall be designed
so as to be harmonious with neighboring areas.
   (c)   Landscaping.
      (1)   Topographic Features Preservation. Where natural or existing
topographic features contribute to the beauty and utility of a development,
consideration shall be given to this preservation. Modifications to topography
features should only occur where it contributes to good appearance.

Development Overlay District dedicated to the public shall be so indicated on
the General Development Plan and shall be constructed in accordance with
Village standards (see Title 14), or as modified under this Subsection.
Standards of design and construction of roadways within the PUD may be modified
as is deemed appropriate by the Village Board; however, in considering such
modifications, the Village Board shall consider the impact on traffic/
pedestrian safety, snowplowing, and law enforcement/firefighting/emergency
medical services responses. Right-of-way widths and street pavement widths may
be reduced where it is found that the General Development Plan provides for the
separation of motorized traffic from bicycle/pedestrian circulation patterns.
The use of private roadways and streets is discouraged.
   (e)   Accommodation of Pedestrian Traffic.
      (1)   Sidewalks; Walkways. Sidewalks and/or other walkways and bicycle
paths shall be provided where necessary for the safety and convenience of
pedestrian and cyclist traffic within project boundaries. Special attention
shall be given to connections accommodating pedestrian movement between the
dwelling units' common open space, recreation facilities, schools, commercial
establishments, and parking facilities.
      (2)   Design Considerations. Walkway widths and surface treatment of all
walkways shall be designed with regard to their function and the anticipated
manner of usage. The natural features of the area traversed in the walkway
system and suitable lighting in scale with the project shall also be
considered. Utilization of pedestrian ramps as required by law and necessary to
either resolve conflicts with vehicular traffic or facilitate the movement of
senior citizens and/or children.

      (1)   Required Number of Parking Spaces. Accessible off-street parking
and loading facilities shall be provided as required and specified in Article G
of this Chapter.
      (2)   Landscaping of Parking Areas. Parking areas shall be planned to
provide a desirable transition from the streetscape and to provide for adequate
landscaping, pedestrian movement, and parking areas. In keeping with this
purpose, the following design standards shall be followed for projects in a PUD
Planned Unit Development Overlay District; in the event of conflict between
these standards and those prescribed in Article G, the following standards
shall be applicable:
         a.   Parking areas shall be arranged so as to prevent or limit thru
traffic to other parking areas.
         b.   Parking areas shall be screened from residential structures and
streets with
hedges, dense plantings, earth berms, changes in grade and/or walls, or a
combination thereof, except where parking areas are designed as an integral
part of the street.
         c.   No more than fifteen (15) parking spaces shall be permitted in a
continuous row without being interrupted by landscaping unless otherwise
approved by the Plan Commission.
         d.   All off-street loading and unloading areas shall be paved and
according to the standards in Sec. 13-1-121, the design thereof approved by the

written so as to run with the land and the covenant shall become part of the
deed to each lot or parcel within the development.
      (3)   Enforcement of the Common Open Space Covenant.
         a.   Noncompliance with the above standards governing common open
space empowers the Village, as well as other owners in the development, to
enforce the common open space covenant.
         b.   If the Village determines that the responsible party is not in
compliance with any provisions of the covenant and is not satisfactorily
maintaining the common open space, or has not made the necessary improvements
to the common open space, the Village of Edgar may, at its own discretion,
intervene to maintain the common open space, or complete the necessary
improvements to the common open space, and may specifically assess by special
charge the property owners within the development which have a right of
enjoyment of the common open space, an amount of money sufficient to cover any
costs incurred by the Village.
         c.   Such charges shall be paid by the owners of said properties
within thirty (30) days after receipt of a statement therefor and, if not paid,

         q.   A written construction schedule mutually agreed upon by the
petitioner and the Village, which details the amount of completed construction
which will be equivalent to seventy-five percent (75%) of the projected cost of
the development. For purposes of this Article, such figure shall be referred to
as the amount of development construction which has been "substantially
completed."
         r.   A subdivision plat of all subdivided lands in the same form and
meeting all the requirements of a normal subdivision plat, if subdivided lands
are included in the planned unit development. (Note: The submission of one (1)
or more of the above documents and plans, or a portion(s) of any one of the
above documents and plans may be waived by the Village when such are not
applicable for the review of a particular type of development).
         s.   Any other information deemed appropriate and necessary by the
Plan Commission, Village Board or Village zoning officials.

Conditional Uses. Notice of such hearing shall include reference to the
development plans filed in conjunction with the requested zoning change.
   (f)   Village Board Approval. The Village Board, following a recommendation
from the Plan Commission and public hearing thereon and after due
consideration, shall either deny the petition, approve the petition as
submitted, or approve the petition subject to any additional conditions,
restrictions and/or modifications the Village Board may impose. Approval of the
proposed zoning to a PUD Planned Unit Development Overlay District shall
constitute approval of the related General Development Plan, which shall be
made part of the zoning record as an integral component of the right of use for
the area in conformity with such plan.
   (g)   Detailed Implementation Plan; Submittal and Approval.
      (1)   Submittal Requirement; Timeframe. Within eighteen (18) months
following the approval of the General Development Plan and PUD Planned Unit
Development Overlay District, unless the time is extended by the Village Board,
a Detailed Implementation Plan for the entire area, or a portion/phase thereof,
shall be submitted to the Village Administrator.
      (2)   Contents. The Detailed Implementation Plan shall include the
following:
         a.   A written statement describing the area of the proposed
development and its relationship to the General Development Plan, along with a
description of any proposed variations.
         b.   A plat of survey as required by Chapter 236, Wis. Stats., of the
areas of the Detailed Implementation Plan showing all existing utilities and
recorded easements.
         c.   The topography of the area of the Detailed Implementation Plan
showing contours at an interval of no more than five (5) feet.
         d.   A detailed site development plan showing at a scale no smaller
than 1" - 200' the specific designation of proposed land utilization, including
the pattern of public and private roads, driveways, walkways, and parking
facilities; detailed lot layout, and the arrangements of building groups other
than single family residences; the use intended for any non-residential
buildings; and the specific treatment of open spaces.
         e.   A proposed grading plan for the area of the Detailed

      (3)   Review and Approval. Upon submittal, the Village Administrator
shall refer the Detailed Implementation Plan and related documents to the Plan
Commission. The Plan Commission shall, within sixty (60) days of referral,
forward its recommendation to the Village Board that the Detailed
Implementation Plan be approved as submitted, approved with modifications, or
disapproved. The Village Board shall then take whatever action it deems
appropriate on such Detailed Implementation Plan. Before plans submitted for a
Detailed Implementation Plan will be approved, the developer shall give
satisfactory proof that he/she has contracted to install all necessary
improvements or file a performance bond, letter of credit or cash deposit,
approved as to form by the Village Attorney, that such improvements will be
installed within the time required by the Village Board. A Detailed
Implementation Plan which is in conformity with an approved General Development
Plan shall be entitled to approval, subject only to approval of the details of
the Detailed Implementation Plan.
      (4)   Variations. Consistent with the basic goal of limited flexibility,
minor variations may subsequently be permitted in details of the approved
plans, subject to approval of the Plan Commission. If, in the opinion of the
Plan Commission, any requested variation constitutes a substantial alteration
of the original General Development and Detailed Implementation Plans as
approved, the matter shall be referred to the Village Board for a hearing and
action thereof. The introduction of any new category of use or increase of more
than two percent (2%) from the approved density shall automatically constitute
a substantial variation.
   (h)   Development Implementation.
      (1)   Conformity With Approved Plans. No specific use or building permit
shall be issued for any part of such approved General Development Plan except
for an area covered by an approved Detailed Implementation Plan and in
conformity with such Plan.
      (2)   Official Record. Detailed building and landscape plans, as well as
all other commitments and contractual agreements with the Village related to a
Detailed Implementation Plan, shall be made a part of the official record and
shall be considered supplementary components of the PUD Planned Unit
Development Overlay District.
   (i)   Phasing Time Schedule; Extensions.
      (1)   Phasing Schedule. Each Detailed Implementation Plan shall be
accompanied by a phasing schedule showing the times within which each phase or
segment of the Detailed Implementation Plan will be completed. Approval of any
Detailed Implementation Plan by the Village Board shall carry with it approval
of the time schedule for completion of each phase or segment thereof, including
any changes or amendments required by the Village Board.
      (2)   Time Extensions. In the event that any portion of such time
schedule is not met, the Village Board, upon written request of the developer
for an extension of time, delivered to the Village Board at least twenty-five
(25) days prior to the expiration of the completion date for which such
extension is requested, may, for good cause shown, extend said completion date
for such length of time as the Village Board, at its sole discretion, deems
justified by the circumstances. There shall be no limit upon the number of time
extensions which may be requested.
      (3)   Failure to Meet Phasing Schedule. Upon failure of the developer to
satisfactorily meet any phase or segment of the completion or phasing schedule,
as determined by the Zoning Administrator or Building Inspector, within thirty
(30) days of the expiration date thereof or within thirty (30) days of denial
by the Village Board for extension thereof, all permits and approvals shall be
void or suspended on other segments of the Detailed Implementation Plan until
such time as the developer is able to be in conformance with the completion
schedule phasing.
   (j)   Rescinding An Approval. Failure to comply with the conditions,
commitments, guarantees, or the conditions established in the approval of such
planned unit development project shall be cause for rescinding the approval of
the same. Upon notice given by the Zoning Administrator or Building Inspector,
the developer shall then be required to appear before the Village Board at a
public meeting to explain any such failure to comply. The Village Board at such
hearing shall determine whether or not the developer shall have failed to
comply and if there has been such a failure, may either:
      (1)   Rescind Its Approval. The Village Board may rescind its earlier
approval, whereupon such recision and the cessation of all rights and
privileges of the developer and owner, including the right to complete
construction or to construct any building or other structure or improvements,
shall become effective on the 31st day following mailing, by certified mail, to
the developer at his/her last known address of a written notice of such
recision; or
      (2)   Compliance Extension. The Village Board, in the alternative to
recision, may adjourn such hearing for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days
to enable the developer to comply; whereupon, if the developer is then in
substantial compliance and has then established to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Village Board that there will be compliance in the future, the rights
and privileges of the developer and owner shall continue for such period of
time that there shall be such compliance. If the developer is not then in
substantial compliance or does not establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Village Board that there will be compliance in the future, the Village
Board will proceed in accordance with Subsection G)(l) above for recision.
   (k)   Revocation; Abandonment of Plan; Revocation to Basic Zoning
Regulations and Uses.
      (1)   Revocation Upon Failure to Submit Precise Implementation Plan. In
the event the developer shall fail to submit a Detailed Implementation Plan as
revoked herein, the General Development Plan shall also be deemed revoked.
      (2)   Developer Abandonment of Project. In the event the developer shall
elect to abandon the General Development Plan, after the same is approved and
the area zoned to PUD Planned Unit Development Overlay District, the developer
shall immediately notify the Village Board, in writing, and, upon receipt of
such notice of abandonment, the General Development Plan shall be deemed
revoked.
      (3)   Reclassification to Basic Underlying Zoning District. When
recessions occur pursuant to the above, the area involved shall automatically
revert to its underlying zoning and its applicable zoning regulations and uses.
   (l)   Major Changes.
      (1)   Major Changes Defined. Subsequent changes which alter the concept
or intent of the planned unit development shall be defined as a "major change"
and include, but are not limited to, the following:
         a.   Any change in the boundaries of the PUD District.
         b.   Any change in the permitted use to a less restrictive use.
         c.   Any construction of an accessory building or structure that is
greater in dimensions than permitted by Section
13-1-200.

time of approval.
         g.   Any change in the amount or maintenance responsibility of common
open space.
         h.   Any change in street locations or alignment.
         i.   Any change in the drainage plan.
         j.   Any subsequent land division.
         k.   Any change in the final governing agreements, provisions or
covenants, agreed upon at the time of approval.
         I.   Any other change which is determined by the Zoning Administrator
to constitute a major change.
      (2)   Action on Major Changes. The Zoning Administrator shall forward any
major change to the Village Board for approval. Notice of the proposed change
shall be given to all current property owners within the planned unit
development area, at the expense of the petitioner, and shall be forwarded to
any established association, pursuant to the procedures of the submitted
association bylaws. Such major change shall be submitted as a new amendment to
the PUD Planned Unit Development Overlay District and association general
development plan and detailed implementa- tion plan, and shall follow the
procedures in this Article for new applications.
   (m)   Subsequent Land Division. Any division of land or lands within a PUD
Planned Unit Development Overlay District shall be accomplished pursuant to the
land divisions regulations contained in Title 14 of the Village of Edgar Code
of Ordinances. If such division is contemplated at the time of application for
PUD District treatment, a preliminary plat of the lands proposed to be divided
should also be filed with the Village at that time.
Sec. 13-1-79 Criteria for Approval of the Petition for Planned Unit
Development.
   (a)   General Requirements. The approval of a project encompassed in a PUD
Planned Unit Development Overlay District shall be within the discretion of the
Village Board. The Village Board, at its discretion, may determine that
consideration of a project as a PUD Planned Unit Development Overlay District
is not appropriate, and that conventional consideration and review under the
standard requirements of this Zoning Code is appropriate and in the best
interests of the Village and its citizens. The Plan Commission, in making a
recommendation, and the Village Board, in making a determination approving a
petition for a PUD Planned Unit Development Overlay District, shall base
determinations on compliance with the following criteria:
      (1)   Compliance With Intent of Zoning Code. That the proposed
development is consistent with the specific requirements of this Article
governing planned unit developments and with the spirit and intent of this
Zoning Code.
      (2)   Professionally-Prepared Plans. That the proposed development plan
has been prepared with competent professional advice and guidance, and produces
significant benefits in terms of improved environmental design sufficient to
justify the application of the planned unit development concept instead of
conventional zoning regulations.
      (3)   Consideration of Physical Nature of the Site. That the site
development plan reflects sensitive consideration of the physical nature of the
site with particular concern for conservation of natural features, preservation
of open space, and careful shaping of terrain to ensure proper drainage and
preservation of natural features wherever appropriate.
      (4)   Compatability With Other Developments. That the general character
and density of use of the planned unit development produces an attractive
environment appropriate to the uses proposed and which is compatible with
existing developments in the surrounding area and with general community
development plans and policies.
      (5)   Municipal Services. That the development can be provided with
appropriate municipal services.
      (6)   Functional Design. That proposed design standards provide
adequately for practical operation and maintenance based on actual functional
need in terms of circulation, parking, emergency services, delivery services,
snow plowing, and garbage and refuse collection.
      (7)   Provisions for Common Open Space. That adequate provision has been
made to ensure proper maintenance and preservation of "common open space" which
has been provided within the development for the recreational and aesthetic
enhancement of the development, or to preserve or protect natural environmental
or ecological resources. Such provisions may be made be dedication to the
public or by retention in private ownership with appropriate covenants. Private
ownership may be in common or individual ownership subject to the following:
         a.   The "common open space" shall be protected against future
development by conveying to the Village and to each property owner within the
planned unit development intended to be benefitted, as part of the conditions
for development plan approval, a perpetual "open space easement" or "common
open space covenant" running with the land and over such areas restricting them
against future building development or use, except as is consistent with the
use as designated on the approved plan for recreational or aesthetic purposes,
or for the preservation of conservancy, natural environmental or ecologic
resources.
         b.   The care and maintenance of such "common open space" shall be
ensured by adequate covenants and deed restrictions, approved by the Village
Attorney, running to the Village as well as to each property, assuring such
maintenance. Where such maintenance is not carried out to the satisfaction of
the Village, the Village shall be empowered and authorized to treat such area
as a special service district and to provide the necessary maintenance service
and to levy the cost thereof as a special charge on all properties within such
service area.
         c.   In the case of roadways and other rights-of-way which are not
dedicated to the public as part of the conditions for project approval, there
shall be granted to the Village such easements over the same as may be
necessary to enable the Village to provide suitable and adequate fire
protection, sanitary and storm sewer, water, and other required municipal
services of the project area.
         d.   Ownership and tax responsibility of private open space areas and
rights-of-way shall be established in a manner acceptable to the Village and
made part of the condition of the plan.
         e.   Areas established for public use shall be dedicated to the
Village on preliminary and final subdivision plats consistent with the approved
development plan.
      (8)   Other Factors. Any other factors which in the discretion of the
Village Board are necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare
of the area of the community.
   (b)   Proposed Construction Schedule. The Plan Commission and Village Board,
in making their respective recommendations and determinations, shall consider
the reasonableness of the proposed construction schedule and any staging plan
for the physical development of the proposed PUD Planned Unit Development
Overlay District, commencement of the physical development within one (I) year
of approval being deemed reasonable. The petitioners for the proposed PUD
Planned Unit Development Overlay District shall indicate when they intend to
commence development and that the development will be carried out according to
the written construction schedule as outlined in Subsection (c)(2)p-q. The
construction schedule shall be a binding legal agreement between the developer
and the Village, requiring signatures of the authorized agent of the planned
unit development project and of the Village. Failure of the developer to
commence the physical development of the planned unit development within the
specified time period, or failure of the developer to complete the development
as agreed under the construction schedule, empowers the Village to take the
necessary actions specified in Section
13-1-79.
   (c)   Residential PUD Considerations. The Plan Commission and Village Board,
in making their respective recommendation and determination as to a proposed
residential planned unit development, shall further consider whether:

adverse effect upon the community's capacity to provide needed school or other
municipal service facilities.
      (7)   Adequate guarantee is provided for permanent preservation of open
space areas as shown on the general development plan as approved either by
private reservation and maintenance or by dedication to the public.
   (d)   Commercial PUD Considerations. The Plan Commission and Village Board,

shall not impose any undue burden on public services and facilities, such as
fire and police protection, street maintenance, water sanitary sewer and storm
water drainage and maintenance of public areas.
      (3)   The proposed development will include provision for off-street
parking and truck service areas in accordance with this Chapter and will be
adequately served by easy- access rail and/or arterial highway facilities.
      (4)   The proposed development is properly related to the total
transportation system of the community and will not result in an adverse effect
on the safety and efficiency of the public streets.
   (f)   Mixed Use PUD, Considerations. The Plan Commission and Village Board,
in making their respective recommendation and determination as to a proposed
mixed use planned unit development, shall further consider whether:

Article E:   Conditional Uses
Sec. 13-1-80 Statement of Purpose-Conditional Uses.
The purpose of a conditional use is to provide a reasonable degree of
discretion in determining the suitability of certain uses of a special nature,
so as to make impractical their predetermination as a principal use in a
district. The development and execution of this Article is based upon the
division of the Village of Edgar into zoning districts, within which districts
the use of land and buildings, and bulk and location of buildings and
structures in relation to the land, are mutually compatible and substantially
uniform. However, there are certain uses which, because of their unique
characteristics, cannot be properly classified as unrestricted permitted uses
in any particular district or districts, without consideration, in each case,
of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land or public facilities, and of
the public need for the particular use at a specific location. Such uses,
nevertheless, may be necessary or desirable to be allowed in a particular
district provided that due consideration is given to location, development and
operation of such uses. Such uses are classified as conditional uses, and are
those uses specifically designated as conditional uses by the zoning district
or which are classified as a conditional use under the review procedures in
this Article. The listing of a use as a conditional use is not a legislative
determination that the use is inherently in the public interest in that
district. [See Al/Energy Corp. v. Trempealeau County, 2017 WI 52 (2017)].
Sec. 13-1-81    Authority of the Plan Commission and Village Board;
Requirements.
   (a)   Authority; Intent. The Village Board may authorize the Zoning
Administrator to issue a conditional use permit after review, public hearing,
advisory recommendation from the Plan Commission and approval from the Village
Board, provided that such conditional use and involved structure(s) are found
to be in accordance with the purpose and intent of this Zoning Code and are
further found to be not hazardous, harmful, offensive or otherwise adverse to
the environment or the value of the neighborhood or the community. Such Village
Board action, and the resulting conditional use permit, when, shall specify the
period of time for which effective, if specified, the name of the permittee,
the location and legal description of the affected premises. Prior to the
granting of a conditional use, the Village Board shall make findings based upon
the evidence presented that the standards herein prescribed are being complied
with.
   (b)   Conditional Uses Adjacent to Freeways. Any development for which a
conditional use permit is requested within five hundred (500) feet of the
existing or proposed rights-of-way of freeways, expressways and within one-half
(1/2) mile of their existing or proposed interchange or turning lane rights-of-
way shall be specifically reviewed by the highway agency that has jurisdiction
over the traffic way. The Plan Commission and/or Village Board shall request
such review and await the highway agency's recommendation for a period not to
exceed twenty (20) days before taking final action.
   (c)   General Authority to Require Conditions. Per Section
13-1-88, conditions such as landscaping, architectural design, type of
construction, construction commencement and completion dates, sureties,
lighting, fencing, planting screens, operation control, hours of operation,
improved traffic circulation, deed restrictions, highway access restrictions,
increased yards or parking requirements may be recommended by the Plan
Commission and required by the Village Board upon their findings that these are
necessary to fulfill the purpose and intent of this Chapter.
   (d)   Compliance With Other Zoning Conditions. Compliance with all other
provisions of this Chapter, such as lot width and area, yards, height, parking,
loading, traffic, highway access and performance standards shall be required of
all conditional uses.
Sec. 13-1-82 Initiation of Conditional Use Request.
Any person, firm, corporation or organization having a freehold interest or a
possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, or a contractual interest
which may become a freehold interest, or an exclusive possessory interest, and
which is specifically enforceable in the land for which a conditional use
permit is sought may file an application to use such land for one (1) or more
of the conditional uses provided for in this Article in the zoning district in
which such land is located, or a conditional use substantially similar to a
listed conditional use.
Sec. 13-1-83 Application for Conditional Use.
   (a)   Application Filing Requirements. An application for a conditional use
permit, accompanied with the application fee prescribed by the Village, shall
be filed on a form prescribed by the Village of Edgar. Such applications shall
be forwarded to the Plan Commission upon receipt by the Zoning Administrator or
Village Administrator.

Sec. 13-1-86 Standards-Conditional Uses.
   (a)   Standards; Substantial Evidence Requirement for Conditional Use
Applications and Permits. No application for a conditional use shall be
recommended for approval by the Plan Commission, or approved by the Village
Board, unless the following conditions are present:
      (1)   That the applicant has demonstrated that the application and all
requirements and conditions established by the Village relating to the
conditional use are or shall be satisfied, both of which shall be supported by
substantial evidence. Per Sec. 62.23(7)(de)l.b., Wis. Stats., "substantial
evidence" means facts and information, other than merely personal preferences
or speculation, directly pertaining to the requirements and conditions an
applicant must meet to obtain a conditional use permit and that reasonable
persons would accept in support of a conclusion.
      (2)   That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional
use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals,
comfort or general welfare.
      (3)   That the uses, values and enjoyment of other property in the
neighborhood for purposes already permitted shall be in no foreseeable manner
substantially impaired or diminished by the establishment, maintenance or
operation of the conditional use and the proposed use is compatible with the
use of adjacent land.
      (4)   That the establishment of the conditional use will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for
uses permitted in the district.
      (5)   That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and other necessary
site improvements have been or are being provided.
      (6)   That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide
ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public
streets.
      (7)   That the conditional use shall conform to all applicable
regulations of the district in which it is located.
      (8)   That the proposed use does not violate floodplain regulations
governing the site.
      (9)   That adequate measures have been or will be taken to prevent and
control water pollution, including sedimentation, erosion and runoff.
   (b)   Application of Standards. When applying the above standards to any new
construction of a building or an addition to an existing building, the Village
Board and Plan Commission shall bear in mind the statement of purpose for the
zoning district such that the proposed building or addition at its location
does not defeat the purposes and objective of the zoning district and the
Village Comprehensive Plan.
   (c)   Additional Considerations. In addition, in passing upon a conditional
use permit application, the Plan Commission and Village Board shall also
evaluate the effect of the proposed use upon:
      (1)   The maintenance of safe and healthful conditions.
      (2)   The prevention and control of water pollution including
sedimentation.
      (3)   Existing topographic and drainage features and vegetative cover on
the site.
      (4)   The location of the site with respect to floodplains and floodways
of rivers and streams.
      (5)   The erosion potential of the site based upon degree and direction
of slope, soil type and vegetative cover.
      (6)   The location of the site with respect to existing or future access
roads.
      (7)   The need of the proposed use for a shoreland location.
      (8)   Its compatibility with uses on adjacent land.
      (9)   The amount of liquid wastes to be generated and the adequacy of the
proposed disposal systems.

request assistance from any source which can provide technical assistance. The
Plan Commission may review the site, existing and proposed structures,
architectural plans, neighboring uses, parking areas, driveway locations,
highway access, traffic generation and circulation, drainage, sewerage and
water systems and the proposed operation/use.
   (d)   Signage. Signage shall be in compliance with municipal sign

construction plans shall be provided that clearly indicate that the soil
conditions are adequate to accommodate the development contemplated and/or that
any inherent soil condition or slope problems will be overcome by special
construction techniques. Such special construction might include, among other
techniques, terracing, retaining walls, oversized foundations and footings,
drain tile, etc.
   (i)   Conditional Uses to Comply with Other Requirements. Conditional uses
shall comply with all other provisions of this Zoning Code such as lot width
and area, yards, height, parking and loading. No conditional use permit shall
be granted where the proposed use is deemed to be inconsistent or conflicting
with neighboring uses for reasons of smoke, dust, odors, noise, vibration,
lighting, health hazards or significant potential of accidents.
Sec. 13-1-89 Plan Commission Recommendation; Board Action.
   (a)   Plan Commission Advisory Recommendation.
(I)   Following referral of conditional use permit applications, the Plan
Commission may recommend that the Village Board authorize the Zoning

in this Chapter after review and a public hearing, provided such uses are in
accordance with the purpose and intent of this Chapter, and, more specifically,
the standards for conditional uses established in this Article.
      (2) The Plan Commission shall make findings of fact and recommend such
actions or conditions relating to the request as the Commission deems necessary
to carry out the intent and purpose of this Chapter.
   (b)   Village Board Action.
(I)   Upon receiving the recommendation of the Plan Commission, the Village
Board shall place such recommendation(s) on the agenda for the next subsequent
Board regular meeting. Such recommendations, including findings of standards
not met as required by Section
13-1-87, shall be entered in and made part of the permanent written record of
the Village Board. Such determinations shall be supported by substantial
evidence which is measurable.
      (2)   If, upon receiving the recommendations of the Plan Commission, the
Village Board finds that specific inconsistencies exist in the review process
or significant new facts have now been made available and thus the final
determination of the Village Board will differ from the advisory recommendation
of the Plan Commission, the Village Board shall, before taking final action,
refer the matter back to the Plan Commission with the written record or
separate statement/report explaining the specific reasons for referral. This
referral action shall only be permitted one (1) time with each conditional use
permit application.
      (3)   At the Village Board's discretion, the Board shall have the option
to set and hold an additional public hearing, following a Class 2 notice, at
the next subsequent Village Board meeting. Such hearing shall be noticed and
conducted as prescribed in this Chapter in compliance with the requirements of
this Chapter and the Wisconsin Statutes. The Village Board shall make, and
record in the minutes of the Board or in a separate statement/report, findings
of fact and may impose and require any conditions the Village Board considers
necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare when approving and
issuing a conditional use permit. The Village Board's decision to approve or
deny the permit must be supported by substantial evidence.
   (c)   Reapplication. No application for a conditional use permit which has
been denied in whole or in part by the Village Board shall be resubmitted for a
period of one (1) year from the date of such denial, except on the grounds that
substantial new evidence or proof of changes that would result in compliance
with applicable conditions is included in the resubmitted application.
Sec. 13-1-90 Validity of Conditional Use Permit.
   (a)   Where the Village Board has approved or conditionally approved an
application for a conditional use permit, such approval shall become null and
void within eighteen (18) months of the date of the approval unless the Village
Board has specified a different timeline in its approval or the use is
commenced, construction is underway or the current owner possesses a valid
building permit under which construction is commenced within six (6) months of
the date of issuance and which shall not be renewed unless construction has
commenced and is being diligently prosecuted. Approximately thirty (30) days
prior to the automatic revocation of such permit, the Zoning Administrator
shall notify the holder by certified mail of such revocation.
   (b)   A conditional use permit shall remain in effect as long as the
conditions upon which the permit was issued are followed, and the Village may
impose conditions such as, but not limited to, permit duration, transfer or
renewal, in addition to any other conditions specified in granting the
conditional use permit.
   (c)   The Village Board may extend such permit for a period of ninety (90)
days for justifiable cause if the conditional use permit included a permit
duration condition, if application is made to the Village Board at least thirty
(30) days before the expiration of said permit.
Sec. 13-1-91 Complaints Regarding Conditional Uses; Revocation of Permit.
   (d)   Continuing Jurisdiction. The Village Board shall retain continuing
jurisdiction over all conditional uses for the purpose of resolving complaints
against all previously approved conditional uses. Such authority shall be in

removal or discontinuance of any unauthorized alterations of an approved
conditional use, and the elimination, removal or discontinuance of any
violation of a condition imposed prior to or after approval or violation of any
other provision of this Zoning Code.
   (e)   Complaints. Upon written complaint by any citizen or Village official,
the Village Board shall initially determine whether said complaint indicates a

either one (1) or more of the standards set forth in Section
13-1-86 above or a condition of approval or other requirement imposed
hereunder.
   (f)   Hearing. Upon staff confirmation of possible non-compliance, a hearing
shall be held following notice as provided in Section
13-1-85 above. Any person may appear at such hearing and testify in person or
represented by an agent or attorney.
   (g)   Board Modification of Conditions. The Village Board may, in order to
bring the subject conditional use into compliance with the standards set forth
in Section
13-1-86 or conditions previously imposed by the Village Board, modify existing
conditions upon such use and impose additional reasonable conditions upon the
subject conditional use.
   (h)   Revocation. In the event that no reasonable modification of such
conditional use can be made in order to assure that standards (a) and (b) in
Section
13-1-86 will be met, the Village Board may revoke the subject conditional use
permit and direct the Zoning Administrator and the Village Attorney to seek
elimination of the subject use. Following any such hearing, the decision of the

   (a)   Intent.
      (1)   Intent. The intent of this Section is to provide a means to
accommodate a small home-based family or professional business home office

possibly be maintained pursuant to Subsection (e) below as a conditional use
under Article E.
      (2)   Cumulative Scope of Activity. The total number of home occupations
or professions conducted within a dwelling unit is not limited, except that the
cumulative impact of all home occupations or professions conducted within the
dwelling unit or on the premises thereof shall not be greater than the impact
of one (1) home occupation.
      (3)   Purpose. The regulations of this Section dealing with home
occupations and professional home offices are designed to protect and maintain
the residential character of established neighborhoods while recognizing that
certain professional and limited business activities may be carried on in the
home. This Section recognizes that, when properly limited and regulated, such
activities can take place in a residential structure without changing the
character of either the neighborhood or the structure.
   (b)   Definitions. The following definitions are applicable in this Section:
      (1)   Home Occupation. A business or trade conducted within a structure
primarily zoned or used for a residential purpose, conducted primarily by a
resident of the premises. Common features of a residential home occupation (or
professional home office) are whether business-related materials or stock-in-
trade are stored on the residential premises, vehicles with a business or
delivery purpose are regularly parked on or make deliveries at the residence,
the home is advertised as a place of business, and/or there is a business
deduction taken for tax purposes for the residential premises.

      (1)   Location; Size. The occupation or profession shall be carried on
wholly within the enclosed areas of the principal building or an attached
garage, but it shall utilize no more than thirty percent (30%) of the gross
floor area of the dwelling.
      (2)   Exterior Alterations. There shall be no exterior alterations which
change the character thereof as a dwelling and/or exterior evidence of the home
occupation other than those signs permitted in the district.
      (3)   Storage. No storage or display of materials, goods, supplies or
equipment related to the operation of the home occupation/profession shall be
visible outside any structure located on the premises. There shall not be
outside storage of any kind related to the home occupation/profession. The area
in which products, materials and goods are kept shall be considered to be part
of the thirty percent (30%) of the gross combined floor area permitted for a
home occupation.
      (4)   Nuisances. No home occupation use shall create smoke, odor, glare,
noise, dust, vibration, fire hazard, small electrical interference or any other
nuisance not normally associated with the average residential use in the
district. A home occupation shall not be detrimental to the health, safety,
welfare, peace and quiet or enjoyment of the surrounding property or

products or materials to and from the premises. This shall not be interpreted
to include delivery and/or pickup services such as United Parcel Service, DHL,
Federal Express, etc., in the conduct of their normal operations.
      (7)   Off-Site Delivery of Goods. To the extent that there is any sale of
any item related to a home occupation, delivery of that item to the buyer
should occur off the premises.
      (8)   Traffic. No traffic shall be generated by such home occupation/
profession in greater volumes than would normally be associated with a
residential neighborhood use.
      (9)   Parking. There shall be no demand for parking beyond that which is
normal to the neighborhood. In no case shall the home occupation cause more
than two (2) additional vehicles to be parked on or near the premises.
      (10)   Types of Businesses. Home occupations are restricted to service-
oriented, professional or clerical business or office uses; the manufacturing

      (14)   Retail Sales. Retail sales on premises shall be prohibited
including the retail sales of merchandise, products, supplies or goods not
produced or fabricated on the premises, provided that minor incidental retail
sales may be made in connection with the permitted home occupation. (Example: a
dressmaker would be permitted to sell only clothing produced or fabricated
onsite and would not be allowed to purchase stocks of dresses for sale to the
general public onsite.) The residence shall not be modified to accomodate
retail sales activities (example: addition of a display window) and any retail
activity shall be a minor use secondary to the primary occupation).

automobile, boat, recreational vehicle, small engine and body shop repair/
work), equipment rental businesses, and businesses that involve the storage of
heavy equipment on the premises (such as excavating or landscaping businesses)

services, claims processing, internet-related businesses, etc.

   (e)   Conditional Use Home Occupations/Professional Home Offices.
      (1)   Conditional Use Permit Requirement. A home occupation or
professional home office exceeding the standards prescribed in Subsections (c)
and (d) above for a limited permitted home occupation/professional home office
use may apply for a standard conditional use permit under Article E of this
Chapter. Village approval of an expansion of a home occupation or professional
home office as a conditional use is not automatic.
      (2)   Application Procedures.
         a.   The Village Board, upon the recommendation of the Plan
Commission, may approve home occupations or professional home offices in
residential districts which do not meet the standards in Subsection (c) above
as conditional uses.
         b.   The procedures for conditional use permits prescribed in this
Article shall be followed, and the standards in Sections 13-1-86 and 13-1-88
shall be applicable.
         c.   The Village Board may place conditions on the continuation or
expansion of such home occupations/professional home offices, or the Village
Board may require the relocation of the business to an area that is
appropriately zoned.
         d.   Conditional use permits issued for home occupations/professional
home offices under this Subsection are valid for a term of three (3) years.
Upon the expiration of such term, the conditional use permit must be reapplied
for.
      (3)   Sale of Property. Sale, transfer of the property, expansion of the
use beyond permitted levels, or other significant changes shall cause the

non-resident children and community-based residential facilities (adult
residential day care) exceeding more than eight (8) residents shall be required
to obtain a conditional use permit under the requirements of this Subsection.
   (f)   Home Occupations/Professions Permitted With Conditional Use Permit.
The following uses, by the nature of the investment or operation, have a
pronounced tendency once started to rapidly increase beyond the limits
permitted for home occupations/professions and thereby impair the use and value

Sec. 13-1-95 Large Livestock Facilities Conditional Uses.
   (a)   General Applicability. The procedures in this Section apply to large
livestock facilities that require a conditional use under this Chapter and are
supplementary to the general conditional use procedures of this Article. The
other provisions of this Article regarding the review and granting of
conditional use permits shall not be applicable to large livestock facilities
conditional uses unless specifically referred to by this Section.
   (b)   Conditional Use Permits for Existing Livestock Facilities.
      (1)   When Required. A conditional use permit is required for the
expansion of a pre- existing or previously approved livestock facility if the
number of animal units kept at the expanded livestock facility will exceed all
of the following:
         a.   The applicable size threshold for a conditional use permit
established for the A-2 Zoning District in Article C where the facility is
located.
         b.   The maximum number previously approved or, if no maximum number
was previously approved, a number that is twenty percent (20%) greater than the
number of animal units kept on the original effective date of this Chapter.
      (2)   When Permit Is Not Required.
         a.   A permit is not required for a livestock facility that existed
before the original effective date of this Chapter.
         b.   A permit is not required for a livestock facility that was
previously issued a conditional use permit or other local approval, except as
provided in Subsection (b)(l) above. [Note: A prior approval for the
construction of a livestock facility implies approval for the maximum number of
animal units that the approved livestock facility was reasonably designed to
house, except as otherwise clearly provided in the approval. Prior approval of
a single livestock structure, such as a waste storage structure, does not
constitute prior approval of an entire livestock facility].
   (c)   Application Procedure.
      (1)   Filing Requirements. A livestock operator filing for a livestock
facility conditional use permit shall complete the application and worksheets
of the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection

establish compliance with the standards of ATCP 51, Wis. Adm. Code, and this
Chapter. The livestock operator shall file four (4) duplicate copies of the
application form, including worksheets, maps and documents (other than
engineering design specifications) included in the application. If the
conditional use permit application is locally approved, one (1) duplicate copy
of the conditional use permit application must be filed with the Wisconsin
Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, and one (1) duplicate
copy marked "approved" shall be given back to the applicant. It is advisable
that the applicant also record a duplicate "approved" copy with County Register

1-3-1 shall accompany an application. Processing of the application shall not
proceed until such fee is paid.
   (d)   Application Review Procedure.
      (1)   Notice of Application Completeness. Within forty-five (45) days
after the Village Administrator, or the Zoning Administrator, receives an
application, it shall notify the applicant whether the application is complete.
If the application is not complete, the notice shall describe the additional
information needed. Within fourteen (14) days after the applicant provides all
of the required information, the Zoning Administrator or Village Administrator
shall notify the applicant that the application is complete. This notice does
not constitute an approval of the proposed livestock facility.
      (2)   Notification of Adjacent Landowners. Within fourteen (14) days
after the Zoning Administrator or Village Administrator notifies an applicant
that his/her application is complete, the Zoning Administrator or Village
Administrator shall notify adjacent landowners of the application pursuant to
the procedures in Section
13-1-85, and this Article, including the public hearing notice requirements
below. The Zoning Administrator shall use the approved notice form in ATCP 51,
Wis. Adm. Code, and mail a written notice to each property owner situated

   (e)   General Standards. The general standards to be satisfied for issuance
of a conditional use permit are as follows:
      (1)   State Livestock Facility Siting Standards. The State of Wisconsin
livestock facility siting standards prescribed under ATCP, Wis. Adm. Code These
state standards are incorporated herein by reference, without reproducing them
in full.
      (2)   Ordinance Setbacks. Setbacks authorized by this Chapter by
applicable zoning district.
   (f)   Criteria for Issuance of a Permit.
      (1)   Compliance With Standards. A permit shall be issued if the

information to show, in the absence of clear and convincing information to the
contrary, that the proposed livestock facility meets the standards specified in
this Section.
      (2)   Basis for Denial. A conditional use permit application under this
Section may be denied if any of the following apply:
         a.   The application, on it face, fails to meet the standard for
approval.

permit under this Section other that standards described and provided in this
Section.
   (g)   Determination.
      (1)   Plan Commission Advisory Recommendation.
         a.   Following referral of the conditional use permit application
under this Section, the Plan Commission may recommend that the Village Board

Village Board shall place the application and such recommendation(s) on the
agenda for a subsequent Village Board meeting. The hearing requirements of
Subsection (d)(3) shall be followed.
         b.   If, following the recommendations of the Plan Commission, the
Village Board finds that specific inconsistencies exist in the review process
or significant new facts have now been made available and thus the final
determination of the Village Board could differ from the advisory
recommendation of the Plan Commission, the Village Board may, before taking
final action, refer the matter back to the Plan Commission with the written
record or separate statement/report, explaining the specific reason(s) for
referral. This referral action shall only be permitted one (1) time with each
conditional use permit application under this Section.
         c.   At the Village Board's discretion, the Village Board shall have
the option to set and hold a public hearing at the next regular Village Board

      (2)   Filing Of Final Application/Worksheets. The Village Administrator
shall file with the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer
Protection ("Department") a copy of the final application granted or denied, if
the Village has granted or denied an application under this Section. Such copy

livestock facility conditional use permit approval under this Section, the
Village Administrator shall file with the Department a copy of the Village
final notice or order withdrawing the local approval.
   (i)   Permit Expiration. A conditional use permit under this Section remains
in effect regardless of the amount of time that elapses before the livestock
operator exercises the authority granted under such permit, and regardless of
whether the livestock operator exercises the full authority granted by the
approval. However, the Village Board may treat a conditional use permit under
this Section as lapsed and withdraw the permit if the permit holder fails to do
all of the following within two (2) years after issuance of the permit:
      (1)   Animal Populating Requirement. Begin populating the new or expanded
livestock facility; and
      (2)   Construction Requirement. Begin constructing all of the new or

Zoning Administrator or designee the right to view the permitted facility, the
Zoning Administrator or designee may request the assistance of law enforcement
authorities to obtain an inspection warrant from the circuit court to inspect
the permitted facility for the purpose of protection of the public health and
safety under Section 66.0119, Wis. Stats.
      (3)   Noncompliance; Time to Correct. If a permitted facility is found
not to be in compliance with the commitments made in the approved application,
the Zoning Administrator or designee shall issue a written notice to the
livestock facility owner stating the conditions of noncompliance and directing

may take further action as provided in this Section and Zoning Code, including,
but not limited to, issuance of a citation or seeking of injunctive relief.
      (5)   Compliance Disputes; Hearing. If the livestock facility owner
disputes that the conditions of the permit have not been complied with, the
livestock facility owner may request a hearing, such request to be in writing
to the Village Administrator within five (5) days of receipt of the notice of
noncompliance. Upon receipt of such written hearing request, the Village Board

Sec. 13-1-97 Comprehensive Plan Consistency Requirements and Conditional Use
Permits.
Pursuant to Sec. 66.1001(2m)(b), a conditional use permit that may be issued by
the Village of Edgar does not need to be consistent with the Village
Comprehensive Plan.
State Law Reference: Sec. 66.1001(2m)(b), Wis. Stats.
Sec. 13-1-98 through Sec. 13-1-99 Reserved for Future Use.
Article F:   Nonconforming Uses, Structures and Lots
Sec. 13-1-100 Intent - Nonconforming Uses, Lots and Structures.
   (a)   Intent; Interpretation.
      (1)   Within the zoning districts established by this Zoning Code or
amendment thereof, there may exist lots, structures and uses of land which were
lawful before this Zoning Code was enacted or amended, but which would be
prohibited in the future under the terms of this Zoning Code or amendment
thereto.
      (2)   It is the intent of the Village of Edgar to permit nonconforming
uses, lots and structures to remain and continue in accordance with the
provisions hereinafter set forth until they are removed due to economic forces,
public health or safety grounds, or otherwise. It is not the intent of this
Zoning Code to perpetuate and/or encourage the long-term continuance of
nonconformities because they are inconsistent with the requirements and
character of the districts involved, or to permit nonconformities to be
generally enlarged upon, expanded, or extended except as provided for herein.
Existing nonconformities shall not be used to justify adding structures or uses
prohibited in the zoning district.
   (b)   Classification of Nonconformities. Zoning nonconformities are
classified into three (3) categories as follows:
      (1)   Nonconforming uses.
      (2)   Nonconforming lots.
      (3)   Nonconforming structures.
   (c)   General Guidelines. It is the intention of the Village of Edgar that
standards be set forth for the purpose of determining:
      (1)   That the nonconforming use, lot or structure existed prior to the
effective date of this Chapter or amendment thereto;
      (2)   The ways in which the right of the nonconforming use, lot or
structure to remain can be preserved and the ways in which the right to
continue nonconforming use, lot or structure can be lost;
      (3)   The extent of permissible variation in the nonconforming use, lot
or structure; and
      (4)   The devices available for eliminating such nonconforming uses, lots
or structures, where appropriate.
   (d)   Burden of Proof Regarding Nonconforming Uses. Any property owner
asserting as a defense to a charge of violating this Chapter because his/her
property is a valid nonconforming use has the burden of demonstrating to
reasonable certainty by the greater weight of credible evidence that:
      (1)   The nonconforming use was legally in existence at the time the
zoning ordinance provision that now prohibits that use was adopted. The use
must be lawful under then existing zoning regulations and cannot contravene
such zoning requirements.
      (2)   That the use of the property prior to the nonconformity came into
being was so active and actual that the property owner can properly assert that
the property owner has acquired a vested interest in its continuance. Such use
cannot be occasional or sporadic. For purposes of this Chapter, a property
owner shall be deemed to have a vested right in the use of his/her property
where that use at the time the nonconfor- mity came into being is both actual
and active and a substantial degree of activity or expense had been undertaken
prior to the effective date the zoning provision that caused the nonconformity
to come into being. Such use must be more than incidental or accessory to the
principal use of the property.
      (3)   That the use is substantially the same use that existed prior to
the enactment of the ordinance or amendment thereto that caused the
nonconformity.
Sec. 13-1-101 Article Definitions.
In addition to the definitions contained in Section 13-l-300(a) of this
Chapter, the following definitions shall be applicable in Article; in the event
of conflict, the more specific definition shall be applicable:
   (a)   Assessed Value (Lot). The full market value placed upon the lot by the
Village Assessor as of the date that the nonconformity came into being. Such
valuation by the Assessor shall be prima facie evidence of an assessed value of
the lot.
   (b)   Nonconforming Lot. [See definition in Sec. 13-1-300(a)].
   (c)   Nonconforming Structure. [See definition in Sec. 13-1-300(a)].
   (d)   Nonconforming Use. [See definition in Sec. 13-1-300(a)J.
Sec. 13-1-102 Existing Nonconforming Structures.
   (a)   Continuation of Nonconforming Structures.
      (1)   The use of a structure existing on the date that the nonconformity
came into being may be continued although the structure's size or location does
not conform with the development regulations, parking, loading, or access
provisions of this Chapter.
      (2)   Any lawful nonconforming structure may be extended, enlarged,
reconstructed, or structurally altered, provided that said extension,
enlargement, reconstruction, movement or alteration complies with the setback
and building requirements of the specific zoning district. However, the
nonconforming feature of said structure shall not be allowed to become more
nonconforming by being extended, enlarged, reconstructed, moved, or
structurally altered except under one (1) or more of the following fact
situations:
         a.   As when required to do so by law, or order.
         b.   To comply with the provisions of this Chapter.
         c.   With the approval of a conditional use permit under the
procedures of Article E of this Chapter for the purpose of making required
alterations to maintain the structural integrity of the building.
         d.   With the approval of a variance by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
   (b)   Yard Encroachments by Nonconforming Structures. Nonconforming
structures which encroach upon the yard (setback) requirements of this Chapter,
but which met yard requirements at the time the nonconformity came into being
at the time of construction, may be structurally enlarged or expanded if the
existing structure is located at a minimum of at least fifty percent (50%) of
the minimum setback requirement(s) and further provided that the alteration
does not create a greater degree of encroachment on yard, height, parking,
loading, or access requirements. Placement of a new foundation or basement
under an existing nonconforming structure shall be allowed as long as no
further encroachment is permitted. The setbacks of the zoning district in which
the structure is located shall be met if the lot size and existing location of
the structure permits the setbacks to be met.
   (c)   Unsafe Nonconforming Structures. Nothing in this Chapter shall
preclude the Building Inspector or any other Village of Edgar official from
initiating remedial or enforcement actions when a lawful nonconforming
structure is declared unsafe or presents a danger to the public health, safety,
or welfare, constitutes a public nuisance, or is in violation of a licensing
regulation.
   (d)   Maintenance, Repair and Remodeling of Nonconforming Structures. This
Chapter does not prohibit, or limit based on cost, the repair, maintenance,
renovation, or remodeling of a nonconforming structure.
   (e)   Restoration of Certain Damaged Nonconforming Structures.
      (1)   In the case of damaged or destroyed nonconforming structures, the
restoration of a nonconforming structure is permitted if the structure will be
restored to the size, subject to Subsection (e)(2) below, location and use that
it had immediately before the damage or destruction occurred, or impose any
limits on the costs of the repair, reconstruction, or improvement if all of the
following apply:
         a.   The nonconforming structure was damaged or destroyed on or after
March 2, 2006.
         b.   The damage or destruction was caused by violent wind, vandalism,
fire, flood, ice, snow, mold, or infestation.
      (2)   Where the criteria under Subsection (e)(l) above exist for a
nonconforming structure to be restored, the size of the structure may be larger
than the size it was immediately before the damage or destruction if necessary
for the structure to comply with applicable federal or state requirements.
   (f)   Shoreland Nonconforming Structures. Nonconforming structures in
shoreland areas damaged or destroyed by violent wind, fire, flood, or vandalism
may be reconstructed or repaired, as provided by state law, to the size,
location, and use it had immediately before the damage occurred if the
landowner can establish that the damage was not due to deliberate act by the
landowner or his/her agent, or due to general deterioration or dilapidated
condition.
   (g)   Relocation of Nonconforming Structures. A nonconforming structure
shall not be moved or relocated to any other location on the lot unless such
structure is made to conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which
it is located.
Sec. 13-1-103 Existing Nonconforming Uses.
Pursuant to Section 62.23(7)(h), Wis. Stats., a nonconforming use may not be
extended. The total structural repairs and alterations in such a nonconforming
use's building, premises, structure, or fixtures shall not during its life
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the assessed value of the building, premises,
structure, or fixture unless permanently changed to a conforming use. The
nonconforming use of a structure, land, or water existing on the date that the
nonconformity came into being may be continued although the use does not
conform with the provisions of this Chapter, except that:
   (a)   Change to More Restrictive Use Category. The nonconforming use of a
structure may be changed to a use of the same or more restricted
classification, but where the nonconforming use of a structure is hereafter
changed to a use of a more restrictive classification, it shall not thereafter
be changed to a use of a less restricted classification.
   (b)   Discontinuation of Nonconforming Use. If a nonconforming use is
discontinued or terminated for a period of twelve (12) months, any future use
of the structure, land or water shall conform to the provisions of this
Chapter.
   (c)   Maintenance of Nonconforming Use Parcels. Parcels containing a
nonconforming use of land or water may be maintained or repaired including
grading, paving, and surfacing, or the repair and replacement of bumper or
wheel stops, fences, screening and drainage ways, provided that the amount of
land, water or storage (i.e. vehicles, equipment and/or materials) devoted to
such nonconforming use as it existed prior to the date that the nonconformity
came into being is not extended, enlarged or moved.
Sec. 13-1-104 Changes and Substitutions.
Once a nonconforming use or structure has been changed or altered so as to
comply with the pertinent district provisions of this Chapter, it shall not
revert back to a nonconforming use or structure. Once the Zoning Board of
Appeals has permitted the substitution of a more or equally restrictive
nonconforming use for an existing nonconforming use pursuant to the provisions
of Article N, the existing use shall lose its status as a legal nonconforming
use and become subject to all the conditions required by the Zoning Board of
Appeals and pertinent zoning district. Substitution of new equipment may be
permitted by the Zoning Board of Appeals if such equipment will reduce the
incompatibility of the nonconforming use with the neighboring uses.
Sec. 13-1-105 Floodplain and Shoreland-Wetland Nonconforming Uses and
Structures.
   (a)   Nonconformities in Floodplain Zoning Areas. Nonconformities in
Floodplain Zoning areas shall be governed by the provisions of the Village of
Edgar Code of Ordinances regulating floodplain zoning (if adopted by the
Edgar), and pertinent sections of the Wisconsin Statutes and Wisconsin
Administrative Code.
   (b)   Nonconformities in Shoreland-Wetland Zoning Areas. Nonconformities in
Shoreland- Wetland Zoning areas shall be governed by the provisions of the
Village of Edgar Code of Ordinances regulating shoreland-wetland zoning (if
adopted by the Village), and pertinent sections of the Wisconsin Statutes and
Wisconsin Administrative Code.

grant the issuance of a sign permit [see also Subsection (e) below):
([) Whether the sign is designed, installed, and maintained to promote the
surrounding environment desired by the general public, pursuant to the

in Subsection (d) above, the following Sign Review Guidelines shall be used by
the Village Board in acting on sign permit applications and by the Zoning Board
of Appeals in acting on appeals or variance requests:
      (1)   Any signage affixed to a building should be dimensioned and located
in such a manner that it fits the building's architectural features and
proportions.
      (2)   All signs should be designed to fit the zoning and status character
of the surrounding area. Special consideration should be made where proposed
signage is located on or adjacent to locally identified historic structures or
publicly owned recreation and conservancy areas. Signage in special planning
areas, such as the downtown, or historic preservation areas, will be required
to conform to the planned dominant architectural theme of the area. Signage in
or abutting residential properties should be designed and located so as not to
create a residential nuisance.
      (3)   As a general guidelines and where feasible, ground mounted, free
standing signs larger than six (6) square feet shall be located at least one
hundred (100) feet apart.
      (4)   Signs illuminated by floodlight or spotlights must be positioned in
such a manner that none of the light spills over onto an adjoining property or
glares or shines into the eyes of motorists or pedestrians, and may not exceed
three (3) footcandles at the lot line.
      (5)   As a general guideline, the number of colors and materials should
be kept to a minimum.
      (6)   Landscape features will be encouraged as part of all ground mounted
signs. Landscape plantings or other landscape materials will not be counted as
part of the allowable signage area.
   (f)   Permit Issuance/Denial.
      (1)   All sign permit applications shall be reviewed by the Zoning
Administrator who shall deny or grant such applications or refer the
application to the Village Board, within ten (10) business days of receipt of
the complete application and payment of fee. If the sign meets the requirements
of this Article and all other ordinances of the Village of Edgar, the Zoning
Administrator shall issue a permit therefor.
      (2)   If the sign permit is denied by the Zoning Administrator, within
five (5) days, a written notice of the denial shall be provided to the
applicant, together with a brief written statement of the reasons for the
denial.
      (3)   No permit for a sign issued hereunder shall be deemed to constitute
permission or authorization to maintain an unlawful sign, nor shall any permit
issued hereunder constitute a defense in an action to abate an unlawful sign.
   (g)   Appeal of Denial of Sign Permit.
      (1)   Any decision of the Zoning Administrator under this Article may be
appealed to the Zoning Board of Appeals. A request for an appeals hearing shall
be made in writing to the Zoning Administrator within thirty (30) days of the
date of permit denial.
      (2)   A majority vote of the Zoning Board of Appeals is required to
modify the earlier determination of the Zoning Administrator.

event that the applicant has failed to comply with the provisions of these
regulations or any conditions that may have accompanied the permit at the time
of granting.

action to the Zoning Board of Appeals. A request for an appeals hearing shall
be made in writing to the Zoning Administrator within thirty (30) days of the
date of the original permit revocation.
      (3)   Upon any permit revocation or failure to prevail before the Zoning
Board of Appeals, the sign(s) subject to such revoked permits shall be removed
by the licensee within thirty (30) days of such revocation.
      (4)   Revocation shall not give cause to a right of total or partial
reimbursement of license fees paid.
   (i)   Standards for Zoning Board of Appeals in Reviewing Appeals. The Zoning
Board of Appeals may authorize upon appeal, in specific cases, issuance of a

Article J:   Signal Receiving Antennas; Wind Energy Systems; Wireless
Telecommunications Systems
Sec. 13-1-180 Signal Receiving Antennas (Satellite Dishes).
   (a)   Purpose. In order to secure uniformity and compliance with Federal
Communications Commission rules (FCC 96-328) on over-the-air reception devices
implementing Section 207 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, this Section
regulating the placement of signal receiving antennas and over-the-air
reception devices is adopted to:
      (1)   Provide uniform regulation where necessary of all signal receiving
antenna devices;
      (2)   Secure placement of such antennas in an aesthetically sensitive
manner while allowing users reasonable reception of signals;
      (3)   Preserve the integrity of historic preservation districts;
      (4)   Protect the public from injury from roof-mounted antennas that are
inadequately mounted, unduly susceptible to wind pressure, improperly installed
and wired, or are placed on structures insufficiently designed or constructed
to safely support the roof- mounted antenna; and
      (5)   Provide for placement of such antennas in locations that preserve
access to rear property areas by firefighting apparatus and emergency
personnel.
   (b)   Definitions.
      (1)   For purposes of this Section, a "signal receiving antenna" is
defined as any apparatus capable of receiving communications from a transmitter
or a transmitter relay located in a planetary orbit. This definition includes
all types of signal receiving antennas, and over-the-air reception devices,
including, without limitation, parabolic antennas, home earth stations,
satellite television disks, UHF and VHF television antennas, and AM, FM, ham
and short-wave radio antennas, regardless of the method of mounting.
      (2) "Owner" means the holder of record of an estate in possession in fee
simple, or for life, in land or real property, or a vendee of record under a
land contract for the sale of an estate in possession in fee simple or for life
but does not include the vendor under a land contract. A tenant in common or
joint tenant shall be considered such owner to the extent of his/her interest.
The personal representative of at least one (I) owner shall be considered an
owner.
   (c)   Limited Permit Requirement.
      (1)   No owner shall, within the Village of Edgar, build, construct, use
or place any type of signal receiving antenna or over-the-air reception device
that is roof-mounted or proposed to be located in a designated historic
preservation district until a permit shall have first been obtained from the
Zoning Administrator.
      (2)   Application for a signal receiving antenna permit when required
under Subsection (c)(l) shall be made in writing to the Zoning Administrator.
With such application, there shall be submitted a sufficient set of mounting
plans and specifications to allow a determination to be made that the device
can be safely roof-mounted, or, in the case of a historic preservation
district, can be located in such a manner as to not seriously detract from the
historic character of the district. There is no fee for such permit. If such
application meets the requirements of this Section, the application shall be
approved.
   (d)   Exemption. Signal receiving devices less than twenty-four (24) inches
in diameter are exempt from the requirements of this Section, except for the
requirements in Subsection (e)(l), (6), (8) and (11).
   (e)   Installation Standards. Signal receiving antennas installed in any
zoning district within the Village of Edgar shall comply with the following
provisions:
      (1)   Setbacks.
         a.   Any signal receiving antenna and its mounting post shall be
located a minimum of ten (10) feet from any property line. The purpose of
setback regulations is to protect the aesthetics of the area and to preserve
adequate access for emergency equipment and personnel.
         b.   Subject to the provisions herein, signal receiving antennas shall
only be located in the rear yard of any lot. If reasonable reception of signals
is not possible with a rear yard placement due to the physical characteristics
of the lot and area, the signal receiving antenna shall be placed in the side
yard of the lot. In the event that reasonable reception of signals is not
possible by locating the signal receiving antenna on the rear or side yard of
the property, such antenna may be placed in the front yard or on the roof of
structures on the property following compliance with Subsection (c) above. For
comer lots, a side yard is only a yard that does not face a street.
         c.   If side yard, front yard or roof mounting is requested, the
Zoning Administrator shall determine where reasonable reception is possible,
based on evidence provided by the person seeking to erect or construct the
antenna.
      (2)   Mounting. Signal receiving antennas attached to the roof of any
principal or acces- sory structure shall be permitted only if the structure is
properly constructed to carry all imposed loading and complies with applicable
state and local building code requirements. The Zoning Administrator may
require engineering calculations.
      (3)   Diameter. The diameter of the signal receiving antenna shall not
exceed fifteen (15) feet for the ground-mounted antenna and ten (10) feet for
the roof-mounted antenna, except for stations used to provide community antenna
television services.
      (4)   Height.
         a.   A ground-mounted signal receiving antenna, including any platform
or structure upon which said antenna is mounted or affixed, may not exceed
eighteen (18) feet in height, as measured from the ground to the highest point
of the dish.
         b.   A roof-mounted antenna may not exceed fifteen (15) feet in height

      (1)   Architectural Consistency Requirements in All Residential Zoning
Districts.
         a.   Accessory buildings shall have a design composition which is
architecturally consistent with the principal building, and shall incorporate
similar complimentary design elements and colors where visible to the public;
the roof pitch and roof line of an accessory building shall be the same or
similar to that of the principal building. This Subsection is not applicable to
greenhouses.
         b.   Accessory building walls clad with a singular exterior surface
material shall provide some additional architectural design element(s) to break
up the visual plane of the wall. This may be done by the addition of windows,
gable end wall treatments, siding design and accent panels, protruding
pilasters, or other architectural design treatments consistent with the
principal building design.
         c.   In all residential districts in addition to the above
requirements, detached accessory structures shall utilize similar exterior wall
siding materials as then exist on the principal residential structure on the
property. In the case of principal residential structures in all residential
districts utilizing exterior brick, stone or masonry, similar brick, stone or
masonry materials shall be used on the front portion of the exterior walls of
the detached accessory structure or any publicly visible elevation. At a
minimum, a thirty (30) inch high masonry base should be included on elevations
visible from public view. Masonry, stone or brick accents or trim elements
matching similar components on the principal residential structure are
acceptable to complement a residence constructed with brick, stone or masonry
siding materials. For the remainder of the accessory structure located in a
residential district with a brick, stone or masonry residence, siding materials
shall resemble siding materials utilized on at least one (1) other non-brick/
masonry residential structure found on an adjacent or on the same block in the
residential neighborhood, if any, provided that such comparison structure must

similar materials approved by the Building Inspector. The color and texture of
exterior wall materials shall be similar to the color used on the exterior of
the principal residential structure where visible to the public. Accessory
structures in residential districts visible to the public shall utilize
exterior wall materials of similar type, color and texture as found on the
principal structure on the lot. Pole-type construction accessory structures in
a Residential District may only be permitted if the criteria herein can be met.
         b.   Roofs of all accessory structures on residential parcels shall be
covered with asphalt shingles; wood or shake shingles; standing painted metal
siding; tile roofing; or slate roofing. Accessory structures in residential
districts shall have roof lines and angles similar to the roof lines and angles
of the principal residential structure on the property. No flat roofs shall be
permitted on accessory structures (boathouses excepted) unless the principal
residential structure has a flat roof covering more than half of the residence,
excluding a garage or carport flat roof feature attached to the principal
residential structure.
         c.   Galvanized, reflective or unpainted corrugated exterior metal
siding or roof finishes are not permitted on detached accessory structures. Any
metal walls or roofing shall be not less than 26 gauge, roll-formed ribbed
sheeting with a factory-applied non-reflective finish with a manufacturer's
warranty of not less than twenty (20) years for the metal and finish. The use
of used metal siding/roofing is not permitted.

on accessory structures in residential districts per Subsection (g)(l)c above
and is encouraged with other non-agricultural accessory structures on parcels
with a primarily residential purpose.
         e.   For structures twenty (20) feet in length or greater, roof design
shall include architectural distinction to interupt the visual continuity of
the roof. The inclusion of a roof cupola, roof dormers or roof line changes
would act as acceptable architectural elements.
         f.   Detached accessory structures shall not have a rooftop deck
(boathouses excepted).
         g.   All accessory structures and garages shall be constructed of
durable materials and shall not utilize fabric/plastic/rubber materials or
membranes used in such a fashion or manner so as to be a substitute for
building walls and/or roof or roofs of said accessory structure or garage.
         h.   Detached accessory structures should have windows established on
at least two
      (2)   walls.
      (3)   Anchoring. Accessory buildings with foundations shall be secured
with anchor bolts. Accessory buildings not located on a foundation shall be

children's play structure, detached garage, dedicated sports court, detached
gazebo or pergola, and other detached accessory buildings/ structures shall be
included in the determination of available lot area coverage for accessory
structures. Patios and decks are not included in such determinations.
      (5)   Required Roof Overhangs. All detached structures over one hundred
fifty (150) square feet in size, in a residential district, must have a minimum

      (1)   Building Permit Requirements. A building permit is required for the
construction and/or erecting of a solar array, solar collector or solar farm
pursuant to the requirements of Title 15, Chapter 1. A separate zoning permit
is not required except where a conditional use permit is necessary under this
Section. The types of permits and inspections which may be required are site-
specific and equipment-specific. Prior to seeking local permits, the applicant
is encouraged to use the services of a qualified consultant or solar contractor
to determine if the property has a suitable solar energy site. The following
are generally required:
         a.   Building permits are required. When deemed necessary by the
Building Inspector, wind-load and structural-load calculations are also
required when structural and wind loads are concerns due to weight, size, or
extensive racking and/or footings of the proposed equipment and devices.
Building-integrated solar energy systems such as solar shingles, windows,
skylights, awnings, etc., are subject to building permit requirements.
         b.   Electrical permits are required for all solar electric equipment
and solar water heaters.
         c.   Plumbing permits are required for all solar water heaters and may
be required for solar air collector systems.
         d.   Ground-mounted solar arrays or solar farms may be determined by
the Building Inspector or Zoning Administrator as creating impervious surface
areas exceeding lot standards for improved surfaces. In such instances, any
applicable permits shall be conditional upon the owner constructing appropriate
mitigation measures for stormwater runoff.
         e.   Solar installations and protection of solar rights shall also be
in compliance with Sec. 66.0401, Wis. Stats.
      (2)   Inspections and Enforcement. The requirements and conditions herein
are enforced by the Village. Inspections of the site and equipment may be
conducted by the Building Inspector, Zoning Administrator, or designee as
appropriate. Violations and penalties are subject to the applicable code.
      (3)   Utility Interconnections. If the solar collectors being used are
designed to generate electricity and will be linked to the electrical grid
serving the property, an interconnect agreement, or proper permit application,
with the electrical service provider utility is required and shall be provided
to the Village at the time of application for any local permit.
   (d)   Solar Arrays - Accessory Use. Except as provided herein, solar arrays

building setback requirements for accessory structures in the zoning district
in which the system is proposed. Roof-mounted or wall-mounted solar arrays
shall comply with the height and building setback requirements for principal
structures in the zoning district in which the system is proposed.
         b.   In all districts accessory solar arrays exceeding height
standards may be allowed by conditional use permit under the procedures of
Article E of this Chapter.
      (2)   Size. Accessory solar arrays have no square footage size limits
except that in residential districts for buildings with four (4) dwelling units
or less, the maximum size for solar arrays shall be one thousand (1,000) square
feet. Larger arrays in residential districts may be allowed by conditional use
permit under the procedures of Article E of this Chapter.
   (e)   Solar Farms - Conditional Use. Solar farms are a principal use on the
property on which located and require a conditional use permit in all districts
pursuant to the procedures of Article E of this Chapter. Solar farms shall
comply with all setback and height requirements for principal structures in the
district unless height requirements are modified by conditional use permit.
   (f)   Signage. One (1) sign not exceeding twenty-four (24) sq. ft. is
allowed per solar array or solar farm for educational or acknowledgement
purposes.

   (c)   Public Hearing of Application.
      (1)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall conduct at least one (1) public
hearing on the proposed variation. Notice of such hearing shall be given not
more than thirty (30) days and not less than seven (7) days before the hearing
in one (1) or more of the newspapers in general circulation in the Village, and
shall give due notice to the parties in interest, the Zoning Administrator and
the Village Board. At the hearing the appellant or applicant may appear in
person, by agent or by attorney. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall thereafter
reach its decision within thirty (30) days after the final hearing and shall
transmit a written copy of its decision to the appellant or applicant, Zoning
Administrator and Village Board.
   (d)   Action of the Zoning Board of Appeals. For the Zoning Board of Appeals
to grant a variance, it must find that:
      (1)   Denial of variation may result in hardship to the property owner
due to physiographical consideration. There must be exceptional, extraordinary
or unusual circumstances or conditions applying to the lot or parcel,
structure, use or intended use that do not apply generally to other properties
or uses in the same district and the granting of the variance would not be of
so general or recurrent nature as to suggest that the Zoning Code should be
changed.
      (2)   The conditions upon which a petition for a variation is based are
unique to the property for which variation is being sought and that such
variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial
property rights possessed by other properties in the same district and same
vicinity.
      (3)   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire
to increase the value or income potential of the property.
      (4)   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to the other property or improvements in the neighborhood
in which the property is located.
      (5)   The proposed variation will not undermine the spirit and general
and specific purposes of the Zoning Code.
   (e)   Conditions. The Zoning Board of Appeals may impose such conditions and
restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variance as may be necessary to
comply with the standards established by this Chapter. Per Sec. 62.23(7)
(e)7.e., Wis. Stats., the Village Board authorizes the Zoning Board of Appeals
to impose an expiration date for a variance if such date relates to a specific
date by which action or work authorized must be commenced or completed. In the
absence of a different expiration date being established at the time of
granting a variance, no order of the Zoning Board of Appeals granting a
variance shall be valid for a period longer than eighteen (18) months from the
date of such order unless within such period the erection or alteration of a
building is started or the use is commenced per the variance approval.
   (f)   Standards for Qualifying For A Variance. To qualify for a variance,
the applicant must demonstrate that their property meets the following three
(3) requirements:
      (1)   Unique Property Limitations.
         a.   The applicant must show that the property has conditions that are
unique or special to that property, that such unique physical characteristics
prevent compliance with the regulations of this Zoning Code. Examples, but not
limited to, of such conditions are physical limitations unique to the property
such as wetlands or exceptionally unique steep slopes.
         b.   The following are non-exclusive examples of items Wisconsin
courts have decided cannot be a basis for granting a variance under the "unique
property limitation" test:
            1.   Financial considerations of the applicant.
            2.   The personal circumstances of the applicant (i.e. need for an
expanded garage, a growing family, an unemployed family member returning home,
etc.).
            3.   The existence of nearby Zoning Code violations.
            4.   Lack of objections from neighbors.
      (2)   No Harm To Public Interests. To qualify for a variance, the
applicant must demonstrate that the proposed variance is not contrary to the
public interest. In applying this test, the Zoning Board of Appeals must
consider the impacts of the variance proposal, and, if setting a precedent, the
cumulative impacts of similar projects on the interests of the neighbors, the
overall Village of Edgar and the general public. Such factors are generally
identified in Section
13-1-4.
      (3)   Unnecessary Hardship.
         a.   To qualify for a variance, the applicant must demonstrate that
the special condition(s) of the property creates an unnecessary hardship. When
determining whether an unnecessary hardship exists, the property as a whole
shall be considered rather than a portion of the property.
         b.   The following are non-exclusive examples of items Wisconsin
courts have decided cannot be a basis for granting a variance under the
"unnecessary hardship" test:
            1.   Conditions which are self-imposed or created by a prior owner
(i.e. owner expands home and then argues there is no suitable location for a
proposed new garage).
            2.   Economic or financial hardship to the applicant (i.e.
construction of a new garage in a complying location would cost more than
placing the garage in a location requiring a variance).
            3.   Lack of objections from neighbors.
         c.   Due to Wisconsin court decisions, the "unnecessary hardship"
determination requires that the Board of Appeals apply different tests for use
variances and area variances:
            1.   For a use variance, unnecessary hardship can be determined to
exist only if the property owner can show that he/she would have no reasonable
use of the property without a variance. A use variance would permit a property
owner to put property to an otherwise prohibited use.
            2.   For an area variance, unnecessary hardship can be determined
to exist only if the property owner can show that compliance with the
requirements of the Zoning Code would unreasonably prevent the property owner
from using the land for a permitted purpose (leaving the property owner without
any use that is permitted for the property under the Zoning Code) or would
render conformity with such zoning restrictions unnecessarily burdensome. Area
variances are intended to provide an increment of relief (usually small) from a
physical dimensional requirement of the Zoning Code such as building height or
setback requirements. In applying the test for an area variance, the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall consider the purpose of the Zoning Code, the Zoning
Code's restrictions on the applicant's property, and the cumulative effects
granting of a variance would have on the neighborhood, community and on the
public interests.
            3.   Unless the Zoning Board of Appeals finds that a property
cannot be used for any permitted purpose, area variances shall not be granted
for greater than a forty percent (40%) deviation in the area, setback, height
or density requirements specified in this Chapter.
(Note: The above standards reflect the Wisconsin Supreme Court's decisions in
State ex rel. Ziervogel v. Washington County Board of Adjustment, 2004 WI 23,
269 Wis. 2d 549, 676 N.W.2d 401 and State v. Waushara County Board of
Adjustment, 2004 WI 56, _ Wis. 2d _, 679 N.W.2d 514).
Sec. 13-1-264 Review by Court of Record.
Any person or persons aggrieved by any decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals
may present to a court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that
such decision is illegal and specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such
petition shall be presented to the court within thirty (30) days after the
filing of the decision in the offices of the Zoning Board of Appeals.

Article O:   Mobile Home Communities
Sec. 13-1-280 Intent-Where Mobile Home Communities Permitted.
   (a)   Location. Mobile home communities may be established in the R-
4 Residential District as a conditional use in accordance with the procedures,

designated as Mobile Homes within the definitions of this Article and to
prohibit units not meeting the requirements for Mobile Homes as defined herein.
Units constructed prior to 1974 are prohibited. Mobile Homes meeting the
requirements of the One- and Two-Family Building Dwelling Code shall not be
permitted in a mobile home community except as a conditional use. Permits may
be obtained only after approval by the Village Board. Manufactured or modular
homes are not mobile homes for purposes of this Article.

      (1)   Unoccupied mobile homes may be parked on the lawfully situated
premises of a licensed mobile home dealer for the purposes of sale display; the
lawfully situated premises of a vehicle service business for purposes of
servicing or making necessary repairs; the premises leased or owned by the
owner of such mobile home for purposes of sales display for a period not
exceeding one hundred twenty (120) days, provided no business is carried on
therein, or in an accessory private garage, building or rear yard of the owner
of such mobile home, provided no business is carried on therein.
      (2)   Individual mobile homes may be allowed by the Village Board in
Residential Districts as temporary uses not to exceed one hundred twenty (120)
days under exceptional circumstances, such as to provide temporary housing
during reconstruction following a fire.
Sec. 13-1-281 Definitions.
The following definitions are used in this Article:
   (a)   Mobile Home Communities (Parks). Mobile home communities/parks are
distinguished from subdivisions lacking common facilities and continuing
management services. The latter would be controlled by general subdivision
regulations, which would apply also to mobile home subdivisions without common
open space or continuing management.
   (b)   Mobile Home Subdivision. A parcel of land platted for subdivision
according to all requirements of the comprehensive plan, designed or intended
for lots to be conveyed by deed to individual owners for residential occupancy

plumbing systems. All said homes shall bear the proper approved Wisconsin
insignia as required by the pertinent codes of the Wisconsin Department of
Safety and Professional Services, Wis. Adm. Code.
   (d)   "Mobile home" means a dwelling constructed prior to October 1, 1974
which is, or was as originally constructed, designed to be transported by any
motor vehicle upon a public highway and designed, equipped and used primarily
for sleeping, eating and living quarters, or is intended to be so used; and
includes any additions, attachments, annexes, foundations and appurtenances,
except that a mobile home is not deemed a mobile home if the assessable value
of such additions, attachments, annexes, foundations and appurtenances equals
or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the assessable value of the mobile home. The
term "mobile home" shall not include a factory-built structure or manufactured
or modular home meeting the following requirements:
      (1)   Intended to be set on a foundation by virtue of its construction.
      (2)   Which is normally transported only once, from the factory to the
construction site.
      (3)   Which, from its construction, is designed to be permanently affixed
to land.
   (e)   Foundation Siding. A fire and weather resistant, pre-finished material
surrounding the entire perimeter of a home and completely enclosing a space
between the exterior wall of such home and the ground. Foundation siding shall
be properly vented, harmonious, and compatible with the house and installed
within sixty (60) days from the date of placement on site.
   (f)   Primary Exposure. Open areas adjacent to the front wall (or main
entrance) of a dwelling unit.
   (g)   Secondary Exposure. Open areas adjacent to side and rear walls of a

Sec. 13-1-282 Mobile Home Occupancy Permits.
   (a)   Mobile homes legally located and occupied on premises outside a
licensed mobile home community prior to the original enactment of this Chapter
may be continued in such location, provided that the owner of the premises on
which such unit is located shall apply to the Zoning Administrator within sixty
(60) days after the original effective date of this Chapter for a use permit
showing the date on which such use and occupancy commenced, the names of the
owner and occupants and that such use and occupancy is otherwise in conformity
with the applicable laws and regulations of the state and Village. Such
nonconforming use shall be automatically terminated upon a discontinuance for
any reason for twelve (12) consecutive months or if the total structural
repairs and alterations to the mobile home exceed fifty percent (50%) of the
net value.
   (b)   The owner or occupant of a mobile home shall, within five (5) days
after entering of a licensed mobile home community or removing to another
mobile home community within the Village, obtain a permit from the Zoning
Administrator. Such permits shall be issued only for mobile homes which bear a
seal, stamp or certificate of the manufacturer guaranteeing that the mobile
home is constructed in accordance with the standards of the American National
Standards Institute Book A 119.1, as originally existing, or, if amended, as
amended.
   (c)   Nothing herein shall prevent the owner of a mobile home under

construction in the industry existing as of the date of replacement, not at the
date of manufacture of the replacement unit, and meets the requirements of
Section
13-1-108.
Cross-Reference: Section

mobile home community is concerned and where such expansion will not increase
variation from requirements applying to mobile home communities, as set forth
herein.
Sec. 13-1-284 Permitted and Permissible Uses and Structures.
The following principal uses and structures are permitted within authorized
mobile home communities:
   (a)   One-Family Detached Mobile Homes (residential mobile home). In mobile

watertight sewer connection protected from damage by heaving and thawing or
parking of the unit and located within the rear one-third (1/3) of the stand,
with a continuous grade which is not subject to surface drainage, so
constructed that it can be closed when not in use and trapped in such a manner
that it can be kept odor free.
   (e)   Adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of solid and liquid
wastes in a manner approved by the Village Board. Open burning of waste or
refuse is prohibited.
   (f)   All television cable systems, electrical and telephone distribution

not create hazards to the property, health or safety of occupants of mobile
home spaces or living units. The site shall not be exposed to objectionable
smoke, noise, odors or other adverse influences, and no portion subject to
unpredictable and/or sudden flooding, subsidence or erosion shall be used for
any purpose which would expose persons or property within or without the park
to hazards.
   (j)   Exposed ground surfaces in all parts of every mobile home community
shall be paved or covered with stone screenings or other solid material or
protected with a vegetative growth that is capable of preventing soil erosion
and eliminating objectionable dust.
   (k)   The ground surface in all parts of every mobile home community shall
be graded and equipped to drain all surface water in a safe, sanitary and
efficient manner.
   (I)   All mobile home communities shall be furnished with individual outdoor
lot lighting of twenty-five to sixty (25-60) watts so spaced and equipped with
luminaires placed for the safe movement of pedestrians and vehicles at night.
   (m)   All mobile home spaces shall abut upon a street. All streets shall be
provided with a smooth, hard and dense surface which shall be well drained
under normal use and weather conditions for the area. Pavement edges shall be
curbed and protected to prevent raveling of the wearing surface and shifting of
the pavement base. Grades of streets shall be sufficient to insure adequate
surface drainage but not more than eight percent (8%), provided a maximum grade
of twelve percent (12%) may be used if approved by the street superintendent,
as safe and designed to avoid traffic hazards. Streets shall be at
approximately right angles within one hundred (100) feet of an intersection.
Intersections of more than two (2) streets at one (1) point shall not be
allowed. A distance of at least one hundred fifty (150) feet shall be
maintained between center lines of offset intersecting streets.
   (n)   All mobile home communities shall be provided with pedestrian walks
between individual mobile homes, park streets and community facilities of not
less than three (3) feet in width. Grade and surfacing of walks shall be
approved by the Village Engineer as safe and comparable to sidewalks in other
areas of the municipality subject to similar usage, except, that as an
alternative, inverted curbing may be used which provides approximately three
(3) feet of concrete walking area adjacent to the curbline.
   (o)   All mobile home communities shall have a greenbelt or buffer strip not
less than ten (10) feet wide along all boundaries. Unless adequately screened
by existing vegetative cover, all mobile home communities shall be provided
within such greenbelt or buffer strip with screening of natural growth or
screen fence, except where the adjoining property is also a mobile home
community. Compliance with this requirement shall be made within five (5) years
from the granting of the mobile home community developer's permit. Screening or
planting requirements may be waived or modified by the governing body if it
finds that the exterior architectural appeal and functional plan of the mobile
home community, when com- pleted, will be materially enhanced by modification
or elimination of such screen planting requirements.

state or municipal subdivision control laws and regulations regardless of the
size or number of lots or spaces so transferred or sold.
   (e)   Except as provided in Subsection (f) of this Section, no mobile home
community license shall be granted for any premises or to any person not
meeting the following standards and requirements:
      (1)   All standards and requirements set forth in Section
13-1-286 except as specifically waived or modified in writing by the Village

   (f)   Mobile home communities in existence and operating under a valid
mobile home community license upon the effective date of this Chapter,
including mobile home communities in areas hereafter annexed to the Village,
shall be exempt from the requirements hereof relating to land use and occupancy
provided such use and occupancy complies with the applicable laws and
ordinances in effect at the time of issuance of the original license but shall
file application for a mobile home community developer's nonconforming use
permit and comply with all other provisions of this Chapter within six
      (6) months after the effective date hereof, provided that an existing
mobile home community having a density in excess of that provided in Section
13-1-286 shall not increase its density and shall be operated in other respects
in accordance with this Chapter. The governing body may extend the time for
compliance as herein required upon such conditions as it shall determine
necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of mobile home community
occupants or inhabitants of the Village. All extensions, modifications or
additions to lawfully licensed existing mobile home communities or facilities

Sec. 13-1-292 Standards for General Site Planning for Mobile Home Communities.
The following guides, standards and requirements shall apply in site planning
for mobile home communities:
   (a)   Principal Vehicular Access Points. Principal vehicular access points
shall be designed to encourage smooth traffic flow with controlled turning
movements and minimum hazards to vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Merging and
turnout lanes and/or traffic dividers shall be required where existing or
anticipated heavy flows indicate need. In general, minor streets shall not be
connected with streets outside the community in such a way as to encourage the
use of such minor streets by substantial amounts of through traffic. No lot
within the community shall have direct vehicular access to a street bordering
the development.
   (b)   Access for Pedestrians and Cyclists. Access for pedestrians and
cyclists entering or leaving the community shall be by safe and convenient
routes. Such ways need not be adjacent to or limited to the vicinity of
vehicular access points. Where there are crossings of such ways and vehicular
routes at edges of planned developments, such crossings shall be safety
located, marked and controlled and where such ways are exposed to substantial
vehicular traffic at edges of communities, safeguards may be required to
prevent crossings except at designated points. Bicycle paths, if provided,
shall be so related to the pedestrian way system that street crossings are
combined.
   (c)   Protection of Visibility-Automotive Traffic, Cyclists and Pedestrians.
At intersections of any streets, public or private, the provisions of Section
13-1-120 shall apply and is hereby adopted by reference.
   (d)   Ways for Pedestrians and/or Cyclists in Exterior Yards. In any
exterior yard, required or other, ways for pedestrian and/or cyclists may be
permitted, if appropriately located, fenced or landscaped to prevent potential
hazards arising from vehicular traffic on adjacent streets or other hazards and
annoyances to users or to occupants of adjoining property. When otherwise in
accord with the requirements concerning such ways set forth above, approved
ways in such locations shall be counted as common recreation facilities and may
also be used for utilities easements.
   (e)   Internal Relationships. The site plan shall provide for safe,
efficient, convenient and harmonious groupings of structures, uses and
facilities, and for appropriate relation of space inside and outside buildings
to intended uses and structural features. In particular:
      (1)   Streets, Drives and Parking and Service Areas. Streets, drives and
parking and service areas shall provide safe and convenient access to dwellings
and community facilities and for service and emergency vehicles, but streets
shall not be so laid out as to encourage outside traffic to traverse the
community, nor occupy more land than is required to provide access as
indicated, nor create unnecessary fragmentation of the community into small
blocks. In general, block size shall be the maximum consistent with use, the
shape of the site and the convenience and safety of the occupants.
      (2)   Vehicular Access to Streets. Vehicular access to streets from off-
street parking areas may be direct from dwellings if the street or portion of
the street serves fifty (50) units or less. Determination of units served shall
be based on normal routes anticipated for traffic. Along streets or portions of
streets serving more than fifty (50) dwelling units, or constituting major
routes to or around central facilities, access from parking and service areas
shall be so combined, limited, located, designed and controlled as to channel
traffic conveniently, safely and in a manner that minimizes marginal traffic
friction, and direct vehicular access from individual dwellings shall generally
be prohibited.
      (3)   Ways for Pedestrians and Cyclists; Use by Emergency, Maintenance or
Service Vehicles.
         a.   Walkways shall form a logical, safe and convenient system for
pedestrian access to all dwellings, project facilities and principal off-street
pedestrian destinations. Maximum walking distance in the open between dwelling
units and related parking spaces, delivery areas and trash and garbage storage
areas intended for use of occupants shall not exceed one hundred (100) feet.
         b.   Walkways to be used by substantial numbers of children as play
areas or routes to school, bus stops or other destinations shall be so located
and safeguarded as to minimize contracts with normal automotive traffic. If an
internal walkway system is provided, away from streets, bicycle paths shall be
incorporated in the walkway system. Street crossings shall be held to a minimum
on such walkways and shall be located and designated to provide safety and
shall be appropriately marked and otherwise safeguarded. Ways for pedestrians
and cyclists, appropriately located, designed and constructed may be combined
with other easements and used by emergency, maintenance or service vehicle but
shall not be used by other automotive traffic.

Note: Mobile Homes vs. Modular Homes
"Mobile homes" have been required to follow construction standards, including
heating, electrical and plumbing, since 1976 through a Federal Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) program. in Wisconsin this is administered under
contract by the Division of Safety and Buildings, Wisconsin Department of
Commerce. The current proper and legal term for mobile homes is "manufactured
homes". While the manufactured home itself is not covered by the Wisconsin
Uniform Dwelling Code (UDC), any site-built addition to that home, such as a
basement, crawl space or room addition attached to the home, does have to be
constructed to meet the requirements of the UDC if the manufactured home was
built after June 1, 1980.
While manufactured homes are constructed to the HUD construction standards,
"manufactured dwellings" must meet the UDC standards. Such non-HUD factory-
built homes are referred to as "manufactured dwellings". However, double-wide
manufactured mobile homes often are similar in appearance to modular homes. For
purposes of identification, a manufactured (mobile) home is identified with a
red metal rectangular label affixed to the rear of each full or half unit. This
indicates the home has been constructed in accordance with the HUD manufactured
home standards. In contrast, a modular home or manufactured dwelling will be
identified with a red plastic sticker, called a "Wisconsin Insignia", imprinted
with the outline of the State of Wisconsin. It will usually be affixed to the
electrical panel, vanity base cabinet or kitchen cabinet. Inspectors must first
identify what they are looking at before applying the applicable code
regulations.

mobile home and the exclusive use of its occupants.
      (170)   Mobile Home Community. A parcel of land which has been developed

Sec. 13-2-1 Statutory Authorization.
This Chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Secs. 61.35 and 62.23,
Wis. Stats. for villages and cities; Secs. 59.69, 59.692 and 59.694, Wis.
Stats.; and the requirements in Sec. 87.30, Wis. Stats.
Sec. 13-2-2 Finding of Fact.
Uncontrolled development and the use of the floodplains and rivers of the
Village of Edgar would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general
welfare and tax base.
Sec. 13-2-3 Statement of Purpose.
This Chapter is intended to regulate floodplain development to:
   (a)   Protect life, health and property;
   (b)   Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects;
   (c)   Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the
taxpayers;
   (d)   Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain;
   (f)   Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the
floodplain;
   (g)   Discourage the victimization of unwary land and home buyers;
   (h)   Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage
and result in conflicts between property owners; and
   (i)   Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable
alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain.
Sec. 13-2-4 Title.
This Chapter shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the Village
of Edgar, Marathon County, Wisconsin.
Sec. 13-2-5 General Provisions.
   (a)   Areas To Be Regulated. This ordinance regulates all areas that would
be covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) or other
maps approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles
in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and are shown as AB, Al-30, and AH Zones on
the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO zones. Regional
Flood Elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one map
or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.
   (b)   Official Maps and Revisions.
      (1)   The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AB,
AH, AO or Al-30 on the maps based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed
below. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to the
boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the
Letter of Map Change process (see Sections 13-2-80 and 13-2-81) before it is
effective. No changes to RFEs on non- FEMA maps shall be effective until
approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the
Villag of Edgar Administrator. If more than one (I) map or revision is
referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.
      (2)   The pertinent floodplain zoning maps and flood insurance studies
shall be (approved by FEMA and the DNR):
         a.   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel numbers 55073C02340F and
55073C02350F (Marathon), dated 7/22/2010; with corresponding profiles that are
based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated 7/22/2010, volume #55073CV000A.
      (3)   These maps have been approved by the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and is on
file wi the Village of Edgar Administrator.
   (c)   Establishment of Floodplain Zoning Districts. The regional floodplain
areas are divided into three (3) districts as follows:
      (1)   The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and
those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the
regional floodwaters and are contained within AE Zones on the FIRM.
      (2)   The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion of the floodplain
between the regional flood limits and the floodway and displayed as AB Zones on
the FIRM.
      (3)   The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that have been
or may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have a
BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO zones on the FIRM.
   (d)   Locating Floodplain Boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on
the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be
resolved using the criteria in Subsections (d)(I) and (2) below. If a
significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to Secs. 13-
2-80 and 13-2-81. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a boundary derived from
a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map
amendment is required. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for
documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which
the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments
required under this Section. Disputes between the Zoning Administrator and an
applicant over the district's boundary line shall be settled according to Sec.
13-2-53 and the criteria in Subsection (d)(l) and (2) below. Where the flood
profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must
approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to Sections 13-2-80 and 13-2-81.
      (1)   If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations
shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations
shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
      (2)   Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary
shall be determined by the map scale.
[Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations
from a FIRM, FEMA must also approve any map amendment pursuant to Sec. 13-2-80
(f)].
   (e)   Removal of Lands From Floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of
this Chapter shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless
it is filled at least two (2) feet above the regional or base flood elevation,
the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended
pursuant to Secs. 13-2-80 and 13-2-81.
[Note: This procedure does not remove the requirements for the mandatory
purchase of flood insurance. The property owner must contact FEMA to request a
Letter of Map Change (LOMC).
   (f)   Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this
Chapter shall be in compliance with the terms of this Chapter, and other
applicable local, state and federal regulations.
   (g)   Municipalities and State Agencies Regulated. Unless specifically
exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns and counties are required to
comply with this Chapter and obtain necessary permits. State agencies are
required to comply if Sec. 13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The construction,
reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the
Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when Sec. 30.2022, Wis.
Stats., applies.
   (h)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
      (1)   This Chapter supercedes all the provisions of any zoning ordinance
enacted under Section 61.35, Wis. Stats., for villages, Sec. 62.23, Wis.
Stats., for cities, or Sec. 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to floodplains. A
more restrictive ordinance than this Chapter shall continue in full force and
effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
      (2)   This Chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this Chapter imposes
greater restrictions, the provisions of this Chapter shall prevail.
   (i)   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this Chapter are the minimum requirements liberally construed in
favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other
powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this Chapter,
required by NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provisions shall be
interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of
this Chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this
Chapter.
   (j)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The flood protection standards in
this Chapter are based on engineering experience and scientific research.
Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This Chapter does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain
areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood
damages. This Chapter does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of
action against, the Village of Edgar or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damage that may result from reliance on this Chapter.
   (k)   Severability. Should any portion of this Chapter be declared
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder
of this Chapter shall not be affected.
   (I)   Annexed Areas for Cities and Villages. The Marathon County floodplain
zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect
and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the
Village of Edgar adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements
of NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
These annexed lands are described on the Village of Edgar's official zoning
map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the
purpose of administering this Section and are on file in the office of the
Village of Administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the
regional flood elevation and the location of the floodway.

Sec. 13-2-25 Flooded Agriculture-Cranberry Farms (FA-CJ.
   (a)   Statement of Purpose.
      (1)   General Purpose. The federal government created the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP) to establish flood risk zones and to provide flood
insurance to property owners in communities that adopt and enforce floodplain
regulations in accordance with regulatory floodplain maps approved by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In recognition of the NFIP's
requirements, the following provisions of this Section shall apply to flooded
agriculture-cranberry farms (FA-C).
      (2)   Special Flood Hazard Area Location. Cranberry farming uses
extensive water management systems that are often located in areas designated
as a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).
      (3)   Cranberry Culture Areas Floodplain Regulations Generally. Within
the SFHA, this Section establishes the minimum floodplain regulations, which
apply to maintenance and FA-C development activities and it preserves the
orderly and efficient use of land for agricultural purposes. The provisions of
this Section are limited to floodplain management requirements. This Section is
designed to clarify permit procedures for routine activities related to
cranberry culture.
   (b)   Applicability.
      (1)   Areas Affected. The provisions for this District shall apply to all
flooded agriculture- cranberry farms (FA-C) in the SFHA as identified on the
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)
for the community. The intent of this District is to provide a consistent
regulatory framework for both maintenance and development activities, which are
required for the efficient management of a cranberry farming operation.
      (2)   Buildings Not Governed by This District. These provisions describe
the activities associated with FA-C, the potential for each activity to impact
the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) or floodway and the requirements for each
activity. This Section does not apply to the construction, maintenance, repair
or modification of any building in this District. Buildings and all other
development activities not associated with cranberry farming are regulated by
other sections of this Floodplain Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)   Permitted Use. Any use or FA development activity, which occurs in an
FA-C must meet the requirements in this Section.
   (d)   Definitions. In this Section:
      (1)   Department. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.
      (2)   Existing Cranberry Farm. The area of established cranberry farming
as established pursuant to Subsection (e).
      (3)   FA-C. The portions of the existing cranberry farm as defined in
Subsection (e) and that are subject to the SFHA regulations.
      (4)   FA-C Development Activities. Development activities listed in
Subsection (f)(4). FA-C development activities do not include maintenance
activities and do not include the construction, maintenance, repair or
modification of any building.
      (5)   Permit Required. That an FA-C Permit is required.
      (6)   Perimeter Dike. The dike or system of dikes that are closest to the
boundary line of the existing cranberry farm, usually the outermost dike.
      (7)   Maintenance Activities. Activities identified in Subsection (h)
that take place within the boundary of an existing cranberry farm.
      (8)   Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). An area having special flood
hazards and is shown on a Flood Hazard Boundary Map or a Flood Insurance Rate
Map as an A, AE, AH or AO Zone.
   (e)   Establishment of Existing Cranberry Farm. The construction or
maintenance of a building is not covered by this Section. (For construction or
maintenance, please refer to Articles C and D and Section
13-2-50.)
      (1)   Establishment of Existing Cranberry Farm Boundaries. To establish
the boundary of an "existing cranberry farm", a person must file with the
community a certified legal description of the farm boundary as it existed on
the effective date of the adopted FIRM or FHBM. The area of existing use
includes all farm production areas, all farm support land and all farm support
areas including dikes, impoundments, water storage reservoirs, ditches, sand
stockpiles and roads. The area of established use does not include buildings.
      (2)   Post-FA-C Permit Development. Upon issuance of the FA-C permit, the
FA-C development that is completed in accordance with the FA-C permit shall be
established as an existing cranberry farm upon completion.
   (f)   Requirements for New FA-C Development Activities in Flooded
Agriculture Districts-Cranberry Farms. (For construction or maintenance, please
refer to Articles C and D and Section
13-2-50.)
      (1)   A Zones. FA-C development activities in an A Zone may not cause a
cumulative impact on the base flood elevation (BFE) of more than 1.0 (one) foot
at any point on the waterway. If any project causes an increase in flooding
elevations that would impact other properties, then the provisions of the
municipality's floodplain zoning standards apply. Increases equal to or greater
than one (1) foot would require submittal of the engineering study to FEMA for
a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). It is the municipality's
responsibility to determine if the project meets the District criteria,
determine if a permit is appropriate, and submit the CLOMR application to FEMA
when necessary.
      (2)   AE Zones. FA-C development activities in the designated floodway of
an AE Zone must be analyzed using the current, effective hydraulic model to
ensure that the project does not cause an increase to the BFE. If any project
causes an increase in flooding elevations that would impact other properties,
the provisions of NR 116.11(3), Wis. Adm. Code, apply. Any increase requires
submittal of the engineering study to FEMA for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision (CLOMR). It is the project sponsor's responsibility to contract for
and submit the engineering study to the community. All studies shall be
reviewed and approved by the Department at the municipality's request. It is
the municipality's responsibility to determine if the project meets the
district critieria, determine if a permit is appropriate, and submit the CLOMR
application to FEMA when necessary.
      (3)   Permit Required. All FA-C development activities require a FA-
C permit in accordance with Subsection (i) below.

showing all cross section locations, floodway/floodplain limits based on best
available topographic data, geographic limits of the proposed development and
whether the proposed development is located in the floodway:
               i.   If the proposed development is located outside of the
floodway, then it is determined to have no impact on the regional flood
elevation.
               ii.   If any part of the proposed development is in the
floodway, it must be added to the base model to show the difference between
existing and proposed conditions. The study must ensure that all coefficients
remain the same as in the existing model, unless adequate justification based
on standard accepted engineering practices is provided.
         b.   Zone AE Floodplains.
            1.   Hydrology. If the proposed hydrology will change the existing
study, the appropriate method to be used shall be based on NR 116.07(3), Wis.
Adm. Code, "Hydrologic Analysis: Determination of Regional Flood Discharge".
            2.   Hydraulic Model. The regional flood elevation shall be based
on the standards in NR 116.07(4), Wis. Adm. Code, "Hydraulic Analysis:
Determination of Regional Flood Elevation" and the following:
               i.   Duplicate Effective Model. The effective model shall be
reproduced to ensure correct transference of the model data and to allow
integration of the revised data to provide a continuous FIS model upstream and
downstream of the revised reach. If data from the effective model is available,
models shall be generated that duplicate the FIS profiles and the elevations
shown in the Floodway Data Table in the FIS report to within 0.1 foot.
               ii.   Corrected Effective Model. The Corrected Effective Model
shall not include any man-made physical changes since the effective model date,
but shall import the model into the most current version of HEC-RAS for
Department review.
               iii.   Existing (Pre-Project Conditions) Model. The Existing
Model shall be required to support conclusions about the actual impacts of the
project associated with the Revised (Post-Project) Model or to establish more
up-to-date models on which to base the Revised (Post-Project) Model.
               iv.   Revised (Post-Project Conditions) Model. The Revised
(Post-Project Conditions) Model shall incorporate the Existing Model and any
proposed changes to the topography caused by the proposed development. This
model shall reflect proposed conditions.
               v.   Changes to Duplicate Effective Model. All changes to the
Duplicate Effective Model and subsequent models must be supported by certified
topographic information, bridge plans, construction plans and survey notes.
               vi.   Changes to Hydraulic Models. Changes to the hydraulic
models shall be limited to the stream reach for which the revision is being
requested. Cross sections upstream and downstream of the revised reach shall be
identical to those in the effective model and result in water surface
elevations and topwidths computed by the revised models matching those in the
effective models upstream and downstream of the revised reach as required. The
Effective Model shall not be truncated.
            3.   Mapping. Maps and associated engineering data shall be
submitted to the Department for review which meet the following conditions:
               i.   Consistency between the revised hydraulic models, the
revised floodplain and floodway delineations, the revised flood profiles,
topographic work map, annotated FIRMS and/or Flood Boundary Floodway Maps
(FBFMs), construction plans, and bridge plans.
               ii.   Certified topographic map of suitable scale, contour
interval, and planmetric map showing the applicable items. If a digital version
of the map is available, it may be submitted in order that the FIRM may be more
easily revised.

provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the
first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the pouring of
slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or
any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers
or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an
alteration, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
      (73)   Structure. Any manmade object with form, shape and utility, either
permanently or temporarily attached to, placed upon or set into the ground,
stream bed or lake bed, including, but not limited to, roofed and walled
buildings, gas or liquid storage tanks, bridges, dams and culverts.
      (74)   Subdivision. Has the meaning given in Sec. 236.02(12), Wis. Stats.
      (75)   Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure,
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its pre-damaged condition would
equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the equalized assessed value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
      (76)   Substantial Improvement. Any repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the equalized assessed value of
the structure before the improvement or repair is started. If the structure has
sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial
improvement regardless of the work performed. The term does not, however,
include either any project for the improvement of a building required to
correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the
building official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions; or any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
      (77)   Unnecessary Hardship. Where special conditions affecting a
particular property, which were not self-created, have made strict conformity
with restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or density
unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of the
Chapter.
      (78)   Variance. An authorization by the Zoning Board of Appeals for the
construction or maintenance of a building or structure in a manner which is
inconsistent with dimensional standards (not uses) contained in the floodplain
zoning ordinance.
      (79)   Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with the floodplain zoning ordinance. A structure or other
development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation,
floodproofing certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
      (80)   Watershed. The entire region contributing runoff or surface water
to a watercourse or body of water.
      (81)   Water Surface Profile. A graphical representation showing the
elevation of the water surface of a watercourse for each position along a reach
of river or stream at a certain flood flow. A water surface profile of the
regional flood is used in regulating floodplain areas.
      (82)   Well. An excavation opening in the ground made by digging, boring,
drilling, driving or other methods, to obtain groundwater regardless of its
intended use.

and Title
Sec. 13-3-1 Statutory Authorization.
This Chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Sections 62.23,
62.231, 87.30 and 144.26, Wis. Stats.
Sec. 13-3-2 Findings of Fact.
   (a)   Findings of Fact. Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and the
pollution of the navigable waters of the Village of Edgar would adversely
affect the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare and impair
the tax base. The Legislature of Wisconsin has delegated responsibility to all
municipalities to further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions;
prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic
life; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; and
preserve shore cover and natural beauty.
   (b)   Purpose. To promote the public health, safety, convenience and general
welfare, this Chapter has been established to:
      (1)   Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions;
      (2)   Prevent and control water pollution by filtering or storage of
sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise
drain into navigable waters and to maintain storm and flood water capacity;
      (3)   Protect fish spawning grounds, fish, aquatic life and wildlife by
preserving wetlands and other fish and aquatic habitat;
      (4)   Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area;
and
      (5)   Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal
of natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland-wetland excavation,
filling and other earth moving activities.
      (6)   Maintain the storm and flood water storage capacity of wetlands.
Sec. 13-3-3 Title of Chapter.
Shoreland-Wetland Zoning Ordinance/Chapter for the Village of Edgar, Marathon
County, Wisconsin.
Sec. 13-3-4 through Sec. 13-3-9   Reserved for Future Use.
Article B:   General Provisions
Sec. 13-3-10 Compliance.
The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within the shoreland area of
the Village of Edgar shall be in full compliance with the terms of this Chapter
and other applicable local, state or federal regulations. (However, see Section
13-3-25 of this Chapter for the standards applicable to nonconforming uses.)
All permitted development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless
otherwise expressly excluded by a provision of this Chapter.
Sec. 13-3-11 Municipalities and State Agencies Regulated.
Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, town and counties
are required to comply with this Chapter and obtain all necessary permits.
State agencies are required to comply if Section 13.48(13), Wis. Stats.,
applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state
highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt
when Section 30.12(4)(a), Wis. Stats., applies.
Sec. 13-3-12 Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
   (a)   This Chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under Section 62.23 or 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to
shoreland-wetlands, except that where another municipal zoning ordinance is
more restrictive than the provisions contained in this Chapter, that ordinance
shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater
restrictions, but not otherwise.
   (b)   This Chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this Chapter
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Chapter shall prevail.
Sec. 13-3-13 Interpretation.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Chapter shall
be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of
the municipality and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other
powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. Where a provision of this Chapter is
required by a standard in Chapter NR 117, Wis. Adm. Code, and where the Chapter
provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the
Chapter NR 117 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this Chapter
or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this Chapter.
Sec. 13-3-14 Severability.
Should any portion of this Chapter be declared invalid or unconstitutional for
any reason by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Chapter
shall not be affected.
Sec. 13-3-15 Annexed Areas.
The Marathon County shoreland zoning provisions in effect on the date of
annexation remain in effect administered by the municipality for all areas
annexed by the municipality after May 7, 1982. These annexed lands are
described on the municipality's official zoning map. The Marathon County
shoreland zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of
administering this Section and are on file in the office of the Village Zoning
Administrator.
Sec. 13-3-16 through Sec. 13-3-19   Reserved for Future Use.
Article C:   Shoreland-Wetland Zoning District
Sec. 13-3-20 Purp'ose of Shoreland-Wetland Zoning.
This Chapter is adopted to maintain safe and healthful conditions, to prevent
and control water pollution, to protect fish spawning grounds, fish and aquatic
life and wildlife habitation, to preserve shore cover and natural beauty and to
control building and development in wetlands whenever possible. When
development is permitted in a wetland, the development should occur in a manner
which minimizes adverse impacts upon the wetland.
Sec. 13-3-21 Official Shoreland-Wetland Zoning Maps.
The following maps are hereby adopted and made a part of this Chapter and are
on file in the office of the Village Administrator:

Chapter in Section
13-3-21 and which are:
      (1)   Within one thousand (1,000) feet of the ordinary high-water mark of
navigable lakes, ponds or flowages. Lakes, ponds or flowages in the Village of
Edgar shall be presumed to be navigable if they are shown on the United States
Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been
incorporated by reference and made a part of this Chapter in Section
13-3-21 of this Chapter.
      (2) Within three hundred (300) feet of the ordinary high-water mark of
navigable rivers or streams, or to the landward side of the floodplain,

navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways
on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base
maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this Chapter
in Section
13-3-21. Flood Hazard Boundary Maps, Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary-
Floodway Maps, County Soil Survey Maps or other existing community floodplain
zoning maps used to delineate floodplain area which have been adopted by the
Village shall be used to determine the extent of floodplain areas in the
Village of Edgar.
   (b)   Determinations of navigability and ordinary high-water mark shall
initially be made by the Zoning Administrator. When questions arise, the Zoning
Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department
(DNR) for the final determination of navigability or ordinary high-water mark.
   (c)   When an apparent discrepancy exists between the shoreland-wetland
district boundary shown on the official shoreland-wetland zoning maps and the
actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the Zoning
Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department
to determine if the shoreland-wetland district boundary as mapped is in error.
If the Department staff concurs with the Zoning Administrator that a particular
area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the Zoning Administrator shall have
the authority to immediately grant or deny a land use or building permit in
accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In
order to correct wetland mapping errors shown on the official shoreland-wetland
zoning maps, the Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for initiating a
shoreland-wetland map amendment within a reasonable period.

be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the Board, by
filing with the official from whom the appeal is taken and with the Zoning
Board of Appeals, a notice of appeal specifying the reasons therefor. The

conditional use permit, to the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be in the form of
a written decision, made within a reasonable time after the public hearing,
signed by the Board chairperson. Such decision shall state the specific facts
which are the basis of the Board's determination and shall either affirm,
reverse or modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed,
in whole or in part, dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction or
persecution, or grant the application for a conditional use.
      (2)   A copy of such decision shall be mailed to the parties in interest
and the appropriate district office of the Department within ten (10) days
after the decision is issued.

of the Village of Edgar, the Subdivider/Developer may dedicate said land to the
Village, but in any case shall reserve said land for not less than two (2)
years for acquisition by the Village of Edgar.
         b.   If said land is not designated as a park, parkway, or other
public use on an official plan or map, then the Subdivider/Developer shall
cause said land to be carried in a private easement in the individual deeds
affected thereby, and no permit shall be issued for a building therein.
         c.   In lieu of the requirements set forth in Subsection (d)(l)a
above, the Subdi- vider/Developer may, at his/her expense, prepare a
development proposal for the problem area. It shall be submitted for the Plan
Commission's recommendation and the Village Board's approval and shall be
accompanied by a site plan and adequate engineering data to insure that the
public health, safety and welfare will not be violated if approved, and to
provide a surety bond to the Village to ensure that such work will be done at a
specified time, if approved.
      (2)   Adverse Soil and Rock Formations.
         a.   Soil suitability rating for a proposed land division shall be
determined by the Plan Commission from sources available to it. The Plan
Commission shall determine the minimum lot size required if public sewer is not
available even though the minimum lot size allowed under the applicable zoning
code is less than the soil rating might require. In order to determine the
precise location of soil boundaries, on-site investigation by soil scientists
may be necessary but in areas where no public sewer is available, this
investigation is mandatory and may be made by a professional surveyor, engineer
or soil scientist at the expense of the applicant, and according to the
procedures established by the State Division of Health of the Wisconsin
Department of Family Services and the Wisconsin Department of Safety and
Professional Services.
         b.   Where soil interpretations determine that a tract of land is
unsuitable for development under existing conditions, the Subdivider/Developer
may submit a proposal for development indicating how, through site and
engineering design, the soil problems can be overcome. The proposal shall
include a site plan and adequate engineering data before approval of the
proposed development or land division can be recommended for approval by the
Plan Commission. If this plan is approved, the applicant shall provide an
irrevocable letter of credit or cash deposit to the Village of Edgar to ensure
that such work will be done at a specified time.
   (e)   Miscellaneous Provisions - Floodlands; Slopes. Village officials shall
also consider, but not be limited to, the following items in determining land
suitability:
      (1)   Flood/ands. No lot served by public sanitary sewer facilities shall
have more than fifty percent (50%) of its required lot area below an elevation
at least two (2) feet above the elevation of the one hundred (100) year
recurrence interval flood, or where such data is not available, five (5) feet
above the maximum flood of record.
      (2)   Lands Having a Slope of twenty percent (20%) or more shall be
maintained in permanent open space use. No lot shall have more than fifty
percent (50%) of its minimum required area in slopes of ten percent (10%) or
greater.
   (f)   Application of Standards By Plan Commission. The Plan Commission, in
applying the provisions of this Section, shall in writing recite the particular
facts upon which it bases its conclusion that the land is unsuitable for
residential use and afford the Subdivider/Developer an opportunity to present
evidence in rebuttal to such finding of unsuitability if he/she so desires.
Thereafter the Plan Commission may affirm, modify, or withdraw its
determination of unsuitability.
Sec. 14-1-22 Condominium Developments.
   (a)   Purpose.
      (1)   The Village Board of the Village of Edgar hereby finds that certain
issues arise in condominium developments that require limited applicability of
this Chapter to condominium developments. The State Legislature has recognized
that subdivision ordinances may apply to condominiums but that subdivision
ordinances shall not impose burdens upon condominiums that are different from
those imposed on other property of a similar character not subject to a
declaration of condominium.
      (2)   The factor that makes this Chapter applicable to a condominium
development is the creation of multiple, distinct property entities at or near
the ground surface, subject to property taxation as separate "parcels," with
each property entity having different ownership and management. The Village
determines that this factor makes a condominium development dissimilar, both
physically and in ownership, from developments in which the land and
improvements are under unitary ownership, management, and control.
      (3)   Thus, the Village Board hereby finds that new condominium
developments can place impacts on community resources in the same manner as
other new developments which are characterized by division of land into lots.
These impacts include:
         a.   Additional population density.
         b.   Possibility of use of particular land in a manner unsuitable to
the land's characteristics.
         c.   Additional demands upon Village area parks, recreation areas,
utility facilities and schools.
         d.   Additional traffic and street use.
   (b)   Portions of Chapter Applicable to Condominium Developments. The
following Sections of this Chapter shall apply to condominium developments:
      (1)   Section
14-1-21 relating to land suitability and construction practices.
      (2)   Sections 14-1-30 through 14-1-33 relating to preliminary and final
plat approval. The technical requirements for preliminary plats set forth in
Section
14-1-40 shall not apply, since condominiums have separate technical standards
set forth in Chapter 703, Wis. Stats.
      (3)   Article I relating to fees for review.
      (4)   Article F relating to required improvements.
      (5)   Article G relating to design standards for improvements.
      (6)   Article H relating to dedication requirements.
   (c)   Exceptions. This Section shall not apply to the following
condominiums:
      (1)   Any condominium plat recorded prior to the effective date of this
Chapter.
      (2)   Any conversion of a structure or structures in existence on the
effective date of this Chapter to a condominium after the effective date of
this Chapter.
Sec. 14-1-23 Homeowner, Property Owner or Condominium Associations; Common
Areas.
Common areas or facilities within a land division or condominium shall be held
in common ownership as undivided proportionate interests by the members of a
homeowners, property owners or condominium association, subject to the
provisions set forth herein. The homeowners, property owners or condominium
association shall be governed by the following:
   (a)   Documents To Be Submitted. The Subdivider/Developer shall provide the
Village of Edgar with a description of the homeowners, property owners or
condominium association, including its bylaws, and all documents and
restrictive covenants governing maintenance requirements and use restrictions
for common areas and facilities. These documents shall be subject to review as
to form by the Village Attorney at the expense of the developer. The documents
required by this Section shall be filed with the Village Administrator at the
time of preliminary plat submittal.
   (b)   Timetable For Creation. The association shall be established by the
owner or applicant of the land division/condominium, and such association shall
be operating prior to the sale of any lots or units in the subdivision, land
division or condominium.
   (c)   Mandatory Membership. Membership in the association shall be mandatory
and on-going for all purchasers of lots or units within the subdivision, land
division or condominium and their successors and assigns.
   (d)   Maintenance Responsibilities.
      (1)   The association shall be responsible for maintenance of and
insurance for common areas and facilities. Included in such responsibilities is
on-going maintenance of any stormwater detention/retention system facilities or
shared community private septic system for that subdivision or condominium,
pursuant to a maintenance plan approved by the Village and incorporated in the
development agreement; such requirement is only inapplicable where the Village
has expressly determined to have, in the alternative, the Village maintain such
facilities and areas.
      (2)   The members of the association shall share equitably the costs of
maintaining, insuring, and operating common areas and facilities. The
Subdivider/Developer shall arrange with the Village a method of assessment of
any common areas and facilities which will allocate to each lot, parcel or unit
within the land division or condominium a share of the total assessment of
costs for such common areas and facilities; the services of the Village
Assessor or Village Engineer may be utilized in developing such methodology, at
the expense of the Subdivider/Developer.
   (c)   Plan For Natural Areas.  A land stewardship plan for any common open
space or prairies to be maintained in a natural state shall be included in the
submittal of association documents.
   (f)   Notice Of Transfer Of Common Areas. The Village shall receive written
notice of any proposed transfer of common areas or facilities by the
association or the assumption of maintenance of common areas or facilities.
Such notice shall be given by the association to all members of the association
and the Village at least thirty (30) days prior to such transfer.
   (g)   Failure To Maintain. In the event that the association established to
own and maintain common areas and facilities, or any successor organization
thereto, fails to properly maintain all or any portion of the aforesaid common
areas or facilities, the Village may serve written notice upon such association
setting forth the manner in which the association has failed to maintain the
aforesaid common areas and facilities. Such notice shall set forth the nature
of corrections required and the time within which the corrections shall be
made. Upon failure to comply within the time specified, the association, or any
successor association, shall be considered in violation of this Chapter, in
which case the Village shall have the right to enter the premise and take the
needed corrective actions. The costs of corrective actions by the Village shall
be assessed against the properties that have the right of enjoyment of and/or
are served by the common areas and facilities.
Cross-Reference: Section
14-1-74.
Sec. 14-1-24    Sale or Exchange of Parcels of Land Between Owners of Adjoining
Properties.
The sale or exchange of parcels for lot line adjustment purposes between owners
of adjoining property if additional lots are not thereby created and the lots
resulting are not reduced below the minimum sizes required by applicable zoning
laws or other applicable laws, ordinances or comprehensive plan. Lot line
adjustments between two (2) different, but adjacent, land use categories or
districts are considered to be minor adjustments which do not require an
amendment to the Village of Edgar Comprehensive Plan or review/approval under
this Chapter, provided that such an adjustment does not create a substandard or
nonconforming lot under applicable regulations.
Sec. 14-1-25 through Sec. 14-1-29 Reserved for Future Use.

the Village Administrator ten (I 0) complete sets of preliminary engineering
reports, plans and specifications for the construction of any public
improvements required by this Chapter, specifically addressing sewer and water
service feasibility, drainage facilities, traffic patterns, typical street
cross sections, erosion control plans, pavement design and other improvements
necessary in the subdivision.
   (c)   Property Owners Association; Draft Restrictive Covenants or
Conservation Easements. A draft of the legal instruments and rules for proposed
property owners associations, when the Subdivider/Developer proposes that
common property within a subdivision would be either owned or maintained by
such an organization of property owners or a subunit of the Village pursuant to
Sec. 236.293, Wis. Stats., and proposed deed restrictions, conservation
easements or restrictive covenants, shall be submitted at the time of filing
the Preliminary Plat with the Village Administrator. (Note: Deed restrictions
and restrictive covenants in subdivisions are private contractual agreements
and are not enforceable by the Village.)
   (d)   Environmental Assessment Checklist.
      (1)   Filing Requirement. An Environmental Assessment Checklist (Appendix
A) shall be completed by the Subdivider/Developer for review by the Plan
Commission with the Preliminary Plat, or preferably as part of the pre-
application conference, for any subdivision or land division by certified
survey map which the Village has authority to approve.
      (2)   Purpose. The purpose of this Environmental Assessment Checklist is
to provide the basis for an orderly, systematic review of the effects of all
new subdivisions upon the community environment in accordance with the
principles and procedures of Wisconsin Statutes set for local subdivision
regulation. The Plan Commission will use these procedures in determining land
suitability. The goals of the community in requiring this checklist are to
eliminate or reduce pollution and siltation to an acceptable standard, assume
ample living space per capita, preserve open space and parks for recreation,
provide adequately for stormwater control, maintain scenic beauty and aesthetic
surroundings, administer to the economic and cultural needs of the citizens and
provide for the effective and efficient flow of goods and services.
      (3)   Coverage. The Environmental Assessment Checklist shall apply to all
reviewable subdivisions, and land divisions by certified survey map. The Plan
Commission may waive the requirement for the filing of an Environmental
Assessment Checklist for land divisions by certified survey map of less than
five (5) acres total area.
      (4)   Preliminary Checklist for Environmental Assessment of Plats, Land
Divisions and Community Development Plans. An Environmental Assessment
Checklist form as required under this Subsection is available from the Village
Administrator.
   (e)   Supplementary Data to be Filed with Preliminary Plat. The following
information shall also be filed with the Preliminary Plat:
      (1)   Use Statement. A statement of the proposed use of lots stating type
of residential buildings with number of proposed dwelling units; types of
business or industry so as to reveal the effect of the development on traffic,
fire hazards and congestion of population; and
      (2)   Zoning Changes. If any zoning changes are contemplated, the
proposed zoning plan for the areas, including dimensions; and
      (3)   Area Plan. Where the Subdivider/Developer owns property adjacent to
that which is being proposed for the subdivision, the Subdivider/Developer
shall comply with the requirements of Section
14-1-40(a)(5) for the remainder of the property so as to show the possible
relationships between the proposed subdivision and future land division. In any
event, all subdivisions must be shown to relate well with existing or potential
adjacent subdivisions.
   (f)   Street Plans and Profiles. The Subdivider or Condominium Developer (as
applicable) shall submit with the Preliminary Plat street plans and profiles
existing and proposed ground surface, proposed and, when requested by the Plan
Commission or Village Engineer, established street grades including extensions
for a reasonable distance beyond the limits of the proposed subdivision. All
elevations shall be based upon mean sea level (1929) datum, and plans and
profiles shall meet the approval of the Village Engineer.
   (g)   Soil Testing.
      (1)   Testing Purpose. Certain soils in the county have severe
limitations that are difficult to overcome or that preclude their use for
residential development either because of the inability of on-site sewerage
systems to function properly and/or because of fluctuating or seasonable high
water table or other reasons. The purpose of this requirement is to save the
Subdivider/Developer engineering costs should the subject areas be determined
to be unsuitable for residential development. The data obtained is to assist
the Village Board and Plan Commission in making determinations of land
suitability. When requested by the Village, the Subdivider/Developer shall
provide a preliminary soils report, listing the types of soil in the proposed
subdivision, their effect on the subdivision and a proposed soil testing and
investigation program. Pursuant to the public policy concerns prescribed in
Section
14-1-21, the Village Board, upon the recommendation of the Village Engineer,
may require that borings and soundings be made in specified areas to ascertain
subsurface soil, rock and water conditions, including depth to bedrock and
depth to ground water table.
      (2)   Compliance with State/County Requirements. The applicant shall
provide verification that all applicable State of Wisconsin and County sanitary
permit requirements can be satisfied.
   (h)   Drafting Standards. The Subdivider/Developer shall submit to the
Village Administrator and to those agencies having the authority to object to
plats under provisions in Ch. 236, Wis. Stats., copies of a Preliminary Plat
(or Certified Survey Map) based upon an accurate exterior boundary survey by a
registered land surveyor which shall show clearly the proposed subdivision at a
scale of not more than one (1) inch per one hundred (100) feet having two (2)
foot contour intervals, shall identify the improvements (grading, tree
planting, paving, installation of facilities and dedications of land),
easements which the Subdivider proposes to make and shall indicate by
accompanying letter when the improve- ments will be provided. Any proposed
restrictive covenants for the land involved shall be submitted.
   (i)   Affidavit. The surveyor preparing the Preliminary Plat shall certify
on the face of the plat that it is a correct representation of all existing
land divisions and features and that he/she has fully complied with the
provisions of this Chapter.

deemed an expression of approval or conditional approval of the layout
submitted as a guide to the preparation of the Final Plat, which will be
subject to further consideration by the Plan Commission and Village Board at
the time of its submission. If a Final Plat is not submitted within thirty-six
(36) months of Preliminary Plat Approval, the Preliminary Plat approval shall
be void; previous Preliminary Plat approvals shall constitute grounds for
automatic approval upon resubmission.
   (g)   Preliminary Plat Amendment. Should the Subdivider or Condominium
Developer desire to amend the Preliminary Plat as approved, he/she may resubmit
the amended plat which shall follow the same procedure, except for the fee,
unless the amendment is, in the opinion of the Village Board, of such scope as
to constitute a new plat, in which such case it shall be refiled in its
entirety.

discretion, of plans and specifications by the Village Engineer, Planner, and
Attorney, as well as other costs of a similar nature. The Village may draw on
the escrow account for this purpose.
      (11)   Legal Signatories to Contract. If the Subdivision, Certified
Survey Map or Condominium Developer (as applicable) and the individual or
entity holding title to the property on which the development is to occur are

      (1)   Infrastructure Phasing Option. Pursuant to Sec. 236.13(2)(a), Wis.
Stats., if the project is approved to be constructed in phases, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withhheld, the security required to be deposited
shall be limited to the phase of the project currently being constructed. The
agreement shall provide a reasonable time not exceeding fourteen (14) months by
which such security shall be provided, which shall be no sooner than is
reasonably necessary before the commencement of the installation of the
improvements. In addition, the Village may require by agreement that the
Developer provide non-secured improvements warranties. The Subdivision,
Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer (as applicable) may elect, with
the approval of the Village, to install the improvements in construction phases
provided that:
         a.   The phases are specified in the contract for land division
improvements;
         b.   The Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer
(as appli- cable) submits security in an amount equal to one hundred twenty
percent (120%) of the estimated costs of improvements required for the
installation and construction schedules for that phase. Improvements
constructed during that phase shall not be accepted nor shall any building
permit be issued for construction within the completed area of that phase of
the land division unless required infrastructure for that phase has been
properly installed pursuant to this Chapter;
         c.   The Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer
(as appli- cable) is responsible for recording deed restrictions, approved by
the Village Attorney, which specify that the lots which are included in future
construction phases of the land division will not be transferred or sold unless
the Village's approval is obtained;
         d.   The Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer
(as appli- cable) minimizes grading and other disturbances to lands included in
future construction phases in order to prevent erosion; and
         e.   Erosion control plans and measures submitted and approved herein
shall address the individual phases of construction.
      (2)   Phasing Timeline Considerations. The time period for completion of
a phased improvement program shall take into account the needs of the Village
and adjacent property owners for street and other improvements to serve lands
adjacent to and/or within the land division.
      (3)   Reduction of Security Upon Phase Completion. As work progresses on
installation of improvements constructed as part of the contract, the Village
Engineer, upon written request from the Subdivision, Condominium or Certified
Survey Map Developer (as applicable) from time to time, is authorized to
recommend a reduction in the amount of surety as hereinafter provided. When
portions of construction (any required utilities infrastructure, street,
sidewalk, greenway, stormwater management or other improvements) are completed
by the Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer (as
applicable) and determined acceptable by the Village Engineer, the Village
Administrator is authorized, upon submission of lien waivers by the
Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer's (as applicable)
contractors, to reduce the amount of surety. The amount of surety may be
reduced at the time any required underground utilities are installed and
tested. The amount of surety remaining shall be equal to one hundred twenty
percent (120%) of the estimate of the Village Engineer of costs of work
remaining to be completed and accepted and to ensure performance of the
fourteen (14) month guarantee as specified in Subsection (d) below against
defects in workmanship and materials on work accepted.
      (4)   Village Acceptance of Surety Reduction. When the work on the major
components of construction has been substantially completed, except for work
which cannot be completed because of weather conditions or other reasons which,
in the judgment of the Village Engineer are valid for noncompletion, the
Village Board is authorized to accept a reduction in the amount of surety to an
amount in the estimate of the Village Engineer, sufficient to cover the work
remaining to be completed, including perfor- mance of the fourteen (14) month
guarantee period against defects in workmanship and materials. As a further
guarantee that all obligations under contract for work on the development are
satisfied, the contractor and subcontractors who are to be engaged in the
construction of utilities or street improvements on the street right-of-way to
be dedicated shall be approved for such work by the Village Engineer prior to
commencing construction.

will serve as open or buffer space and be jointly maintained and controlled by
the owners of the platted Jots or where erosion control or stormwater
management devices will be installed in the area being subdivided that will
require ongoing maintenance, the Developer's Agreement shall require that a
homeowners' association be created with membership on an equal basis of all
platted Jots not commonly owned and on an equal basis, that association bylaws
be developed and that a restrictive covenant or other perpetual, binding legal
device be employed that will create, administer and enforce the collective
responsibilities of the individual members of said homeowners' association
concerning commonly held areas and/or erosion control or stormwater management
devices.
      (7)   A Developer's Agreement shall contain measures to protect the
investments and expectations of existing and future lot owners against
unilateral changes in the organizational or governing documents of a
homeowners' association by a developer so Jong as the subject area is under the
developer's control by requiring advance Village approval of material changes
to the homeowners' association bylaws or restrictive covenants from the time
the Developer's Agreement is executed until a majority of the lots are conveyed
to individual homeowners.

Sec. 14-1-68 Acceptance of Improvements and Dedications.
   (a)   Acceptance of Improvements. The dedication of any improvements,
utilities, streets, parks, easements, rights-of-way or other lands or rights to
the Village or the public shall not be considered accepted by the Village for
public ownership until such time as the required public improvements within the
intended dedication or necessary because of the intended dedication have been
completed and accepted by the Village Board by adoption of a resolution
accepting such dedication. The Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map
Developer (as applicable) shall be responsible for and liable for the main-
tenance, safety and operation of all required public improvements until such
time as the improvements are accepted by the Village Board by resolution. In
the event the Village must take measures to maintain, operate or make safe a
public improvement existing or required as a result of the land division but
which has not yet been accepted by the Village, the costs of such measures
shall hereby be determined to be Village-incurred costs to be reimbursed to the
Village by the Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer (as
appliable) in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.
   (b)   Inspection and Certification of Improvements.
      (1)   After any of the following increments of the required improvements
have been installed and completed, the Subdivision, Condominium or Certified
Survey Map Developer (as applicable) shall notify the Village Engineer, in
writing, that the work is complete and ready for final inspection, shall file
reproducible record drawings of the completed improvements and shall file lien
waivers or affidavits, in a form acceptable to the Village Administrator and
approved by the Village Attorney, evidencing that there are no claims, actions
or demands for damages, based upon contract or tort arising out of or in any
way related to the project and that no moneys are owned to any surveyor,
mechanic, contractor, subcontractor, materialman or laborer after all required
improvements have been installed. Acceptance of the improvements may be
requested in the following increments:
         a.   Sewer mains and services (either storm or sanitary).

Article G:   Design Standards
Sec. 14-1-70 General Street Design Standards.
   (a)   Compliance with Statutes. In laying out a certified survey or
subdivision, the Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer (as
applicable) shall conform to the provisions of Chapter 236, Wis. Stats., and
all applicable Village of Edgar regulations. In all cases where the
requirements of this Chapter are different from the requirements of Chapter
236, Wis. Stats., the more restrictive provision shall apply. (See also Section
14-1-73).
   (b)   Dedication. The Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map
Developer (as applicable) shall dedicate land and improve streets as provided
in this Chapter and Section
14-1-53. Streets shall be located with due regard for topographical conditions,
natural features, existing and proposed streets, utilities and land uses and
public convenience and safety. Streets shall conform to official maps adopted
by the Village Board. The Subdivision, Certified Survey Map or Condominium Plat
shall be so designed as to provide each lot with satisfactory access to a
public street or road. (See also Section
14-1-73.)
   (c)   Compliance with Comprehensive Plan and Ordinances.
      (1)   Land Development Compliance With Plans.
         a.   The arrangement, character, features, and layout of land
developments in the Village of Edgar shall be designed to comply with the
standards of this Chapter, the Comprehensive Plan (Smart Growth Plan), Official
Map, and/or any compre- hensive utility plans or other planning documents which
may pertain to the standards of design for land divisions or land developments
and which have been adopted by the Village Board.
         b.   Where no such planning documents have been adopted, Subdivision,
Certified Survey Map and Condominium land developments shall be designed
according to engineering and planning standards approved by the Village
Engineer and applied so as to properly relate the proposed land development
with adjacent development, the topography, natural features, public safety and
convenience, and the most advantageous development of undeveloped adjacent
lands. In the absence of a street being shown on the Official Map, streets
shall be provided in locations determined necessary by the Village Engineer and
to the right-of-way widths required in this Article for the classification of
street required.
      (2)   Street Locations to Comply With Plans. The arrangement, character,
extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to the Village
Comprehensive Plan, the Official Map, and to this Chapter, and other Village
planning documents and shall be considered in their relation to: existing and
planned streets, reasonable circulation of traffic, topographical conditions,
run-off of storm water, public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate
relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.
      (3)   Continuation. The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall
make provision for the appropriate continuation at the same or greater width of
the existing streets in adjoining areas.
   (d)   Areas Not Covered by Official Map or Plan. In areas not covered by an
Official Map or the Village Comprehensive Plan, the layout of streets shall
conform to the plan for the most advantageous development of adjoining areas of
the neighborhood. Streets shall be designed and located in relation to existing
and officially planned streets, topography and natural terrain, streams and
lakes and existing tree growth, public convenience and safety and in their
appropriate relation to the proposed use of the land to be served by such
streets.
   (e)   Proposed Streets. Proposed streets shall extend to the boundary lines
of the tract being subdivided unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions or unless, in the opinion of the Village Board, such extension is
not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the
subdivision or land division or for the advantageous development of the
adjacent tracts.
   (f)   Streets Classifications. Streets shall be required and classified by
the Village Engineer in accordance with the Village Comprehensive Plan and
where not identified in said plan, in accordance with sound engineering
standards, into the classifications indicated below with the designated minimum
widths:
      (1)   Arterial Streets. Arterial streets, shall be arranged so as to
provide ready access to centers of employment, centers of governmental
activity, community shopping areas, community recreation, and points beyond the
boundaries of the community. They shall also be properly integrated with and
related to the existing and proposed system of major streets and highways and
shall be, insofar as practicable, continuous and in alignment with existing or
planned streets with which they are to connect.
      (2)   Collector Streets.  Collector streets, shall be arranged so as to
provide ready collection of traffic from residential areas and conveyance of
this traffic to the major street and highway system and shall be properly
related to the mass transportation system, to special traffic generators such
as schools, churches and shopping centers and other concentrations of
population and to the major streets to which they connect.
      (3)   Minor Streets. Minor streets, shall be arranged to conform to the
topography, to discourage use by through traffic to permit the design of
efficient storm and sanitary sewerage systems, and to require the minimum
street area necessary to provide safe and convenient access to abutting
property.
      (4)   Proposed Streets. Proposed streets shall extend to the boundary
lines of the tract being subdivided unless prevented by topography or other
physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the Village, such extension is
not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the
subdivision or for the advantageous development of the adjacent tracts.
   (g)   Arterial Street and Highway Protection. Whenever the proposed
subdivision contains or is adjacent to a major street or highway, adequate
protection of residential properties, limitation of access and separation of
through and local traffic shall be provided by reversed frontage, with screen
planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line, or
by the use of frontage streets.
   (h)   Reserve Strips. Reserve strips, strips which prevent access to public
street, shall not be provided on any Subdivision, Certified Survey Map or
Condominium Plan to control access to streets or alleys, except where control
of such strips is placed with the Village under conditions approved by the
Village Board.
   (i)   Alleys; Cul-de-Sac Streets.
      (1)   Commercial and Industrial. Alleys may be provided in commercial and
industrial districts. The width of the right-of-way for residential alleys
shall be not less than twenty-four (24) feet and the width of the right-of-way
for commercial and industrial alleys shall be not less than thirty-two (32)
feet. Alleys shall be constructed according to base and surfacing requirements
for streets.
      (2)   Residential. Alleys shall not be approved in residential areas
unless necessary because of topography or other exceptional circumstances.
      (3)   Temporary Street Termination. Dead-end alleys are prohibited except
under very unusual circumstances, and crooked and "T" alleys shall be
discouraged. Temporary dead-end streets shall not be over one thousand (1,000)
feet in total length, shall provide for an eventual intersection spacing
meeting the requirements of this Chapter and shall provide for temporary cul-
de-sacs or turnarounds as approved by the Village Engineer. Temporary
termination of streets intended to be extended at a later date shall be
accomplished with a temporary cul-de-sac in accordance with the standards set
forth below, or by construction of a temporary "T" intersection thirty-three
(33) feet in width and thirty-three (33) feet in length abutting the right-of-
way lines of the access street on each side.
      (4)   Design of Cul-de-Sac Streets.  Cul-de-sac streets designed to have
one (1) end permanently closed shall not exceed seven hundred fifty (750) feet
in length. All urban cul-de-sac streets designed to have one (I) end
permanently closed shall terminate in a circular or tear-drop tum-around having
a minimum right-of-way radius of sixty-six (66) feet and a minimum outside curb
radius of fifty-one (51) feet to the face of the curb. The use of cul-de-sacs
shall be held to a minimum and permanently dead ended streets shall be
prohibited.
   (j)   Continuation. Streets shall be laid out to provide for possible
continuation wherever topographic and other physical conditions permit.
Provision shall be made so that all proposed streets shall have a direct
connection with, or be continuous and in line with, existing, planned or
platted streets with which they are to connect. Proposed streets shall be
extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented
by topography or other physical conditions, or unless in the Village Board
determines such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of
the layout of the Subdivision, Certified Survey Map or Condominium with
existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts.
   (k)   Access to Public Streets Required. The Certified Survey Map or
Subdivision shall be designed so as to provide each lot with satisfactory
access to a public street.
   (l)   Frontage Roads. Where a Subdivision, Certified Survey Map or
Condominium development abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial
highway, or railroad right-of- way, the developer shall provide a frontage
road, platted access restriction along the prope1ty contiguous to such highway,
or such other treatment as may be determined necessary by the Village Engineer
to ensure safe, efficient traffic flow and adequate protection of residential
properties.
   (m)   Private Streets. Private streets shall not be approved nor shall
public improvements be approved for any private street; all streets shall be
dedicated for public use.
   (n)   Tangents. A tangent at least one hundred (100) feet long shall be
required between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
   (o)   Visibility. Streets shall afford maximum visibility and safety for
motorist bicycle, and pedestrian use and shall intersect at right angles, where
practicable. A minimum sight distance with clear visibility, measured along the
centerline, shall be provided of at least five hundred (500) feet on major
thoroughfares, two hundred (200) feet on collector- distributor streets, and
one hundred fifty (150) feet on all other streets.
   (p)   Intersections.
      (1)   Angle of Intersect. Streets shall intersect each other at as nearly
right angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit.
The curved street shall intersect another street with not less than fifteen
(15) feet of tangent right-of-way between the end of curvature and the right-
of-way of the street being intersected.
      (2)   Number of Streets Converging. The number of streets converging at
one (1) intersection shall be reduced to a minimum, preferably not more than
two (2). Cross- type intersections on local streets shall be avoided whenever
possible in favor of T- type intersections. Intersections of local streets
shall be at least one hundred fifty (150) feet from each other.
      (3)   Number of Intersections - Arterial Streets. The number of
intersections along arterial streets shall be held to a minimum. Wherever
practicable, the distance between such intersections shall be not less than one
thousand two hundred (1,200) feet, unless otherwise determined by the Village
Engineer to provide better safety.
      (4)   Local Street Spacing. Local streets and frontage roads intersecting
with other local streets or collector streets shall, wherever practicable, be
spaced no closer than three hundred (300) feet between right-of-way lines, nor
closer than eight hundred (800) feet to the right-of-way of an arterial street.
      (5)   Rounding of Property Lines at Street Intersections Required.
Property lines at street intersections may be rounded with a minimum radius of
fifteen (15) feet, or of a greater radius when required by the Village Board,
upon the recommendation of the Village Engineer, or shall be cut off by a
straight line through the points of tengency of an arc having a radius of
fifteen (15) feet.
      (6)   Continuation of Local Streets. Local streets shall not necessarily
continue across arterial or collector streets, but if the centerlines of such
local streets approach the major streets from opposite sides within two hundred
fifty (250) feet of each other, measured along the centerline of the arterial
or collector streets, then the location shall be so adjusted that the
adjoinment across the major or collector street is continuous and a jog is
avoided.
      (7)   Additional Sight Easements. At any intersection determined by the
Village Engineer, restricted development easements or additional street right-
of-way shall be platted to provide for adequate sight distances in every
direction of travel. At a minimum, the subdivider shall grade, clear or
otherwise provide for an unobstructed sight triangle at all intersections
incorporating the area within a triangle formed by the intersection of the
street right-of-way lines and a point on each right-of-way line being not less
than thirty (30) feet from the intersection point.
   (q)   Street Names.
      (1)   Village Approval. Street names shall be approved by the Village
Board following the guidelines of this Subsection.
      (2)   Continuation; Conformance with Street Numbering. Where a street
maintains the same general direction except for curvilinear changes for short
distances, the same name shall continue for the entire length of the street.
House numbering difficulties shall be considered the determining factor in
considering whether a change of name is necessary due to curvilinear changes. A
street name shall be changed when required to conform to the proposed or
existing house numbering base.
      (3)   Future Through Streets. A name which is assigned to a street which
is not presently a through street, due to intervening land over which the
street extension is planned, shall be continued for the separate portions of
the planned through street.
      (4)   Name Guidelines. The following designations are guidelines for the
naming of streets:
         a.   "Boulevard." A street with a divided pavement, either existing or
planned. If the divided pavement ends but the street continues, the same street
name and suffix shall continue.
         b.   "Lane." To be limited to a street, one (1) block long, not ending
in a cul-de-sac.
         c.   "Circle." To be limited to a cul-de-sac of nine (9) lots or more.
         d.   "Court." To be limited to a cul de-sac of eight (8) lots or less.
         e.   "Parkway." To be limited to a street abutting a park or greenway
or creek.
      (5)   Cul-de-Sacs. The name of any projection of a street shall remain
unchanged even if the projection terminates in a cul-de-sac.
      (6)   Preliminary Name Approvals. Approval of street names on a
Preliminary Plat will not reserve the names nor shall the Village be required
to accept such names at the time of final platting.
      (7)   Annexed Lands. When a project area includes lands annexed to the
Village and has a roadway with an existing name, the Village Board may rename
the roadway to comply with Village street naming standards. The Village shall
assign addresses to all existing parcels within the annexation area including
properties with pre-existing addresses.
      (8)   Street Name Length. Street names shall have no fewer than three (3)
and no more than twelve (12) characters. A space between two (2) words is
considered a character.
      (9)   Duplication. To eliminate potential confusion and delay of
emergency responses, duplication of street names shall not be permitted.
Roadways with the same name but different suffix designations shall be
considered duplicate roadway names (e.g. "Oak Drive" and "Oak Lane" are
duplicates).
      (10)   Similar or Confusing Spelling. To eliminate confusion, street
names that are difficult to spell, have similar spelling, can be spelled
several different ways or have phonetically confusing spelling shall not be
approved (e.g. "Broome" vs. "Broom" - spelled two different ways).
      (11)   Unconventional Spelling. To avoid confusion and allow for accurate
communication in emergency situations, unconventional spelling of words in
roadway names shall be prohibited (e.g. "Wynd Chime Lane").
      (12)   Offensive or Frivolous Names . Roadway names that may be offensive
(slang, double meanings, discriminatory, slanderous, etc.) will not be
approved. Street names that could be considered frivolous or overly complicated
will not be approved ("I Did It My Way").
      (13)   Vanity Names.  Roadway names that identify with a specific
company, individual, family or private entity will not be approved unless it is
demonstrated that such parties have made exceptional civic contributions to the
community.
      (14)   Use of Roadway Type Suffix or Directional Prefix Words. Street
names that include a directional prefix or the roadway type suffix as the
roadway name or in the roadway name will not be approved (e.g. "Madison Court
Drive" or "West Avenue").
      (15)   Punctuation. Punctuation is not permitted in roadway names (e.g.
"New-World Court"). Names shall not include hyphens, apostrophes, or other non-
letter characters.
   (r)   Limited Access Highway and Railroad Right-of-way Treatment. Whenever
the proposed Subdivision, Certified Survey Map, or Condominium contains or is
adjacent to a limited access highway, arterial street or railroad right-of-way,
the design shall provide the following treatment:
      (1)   Landscape Bufferyard Easement Requirement. When lots within the
proposed Subdivision, Certified Survey Map, or Condominium back upon the right-
of-way of an existing or proposed limited access highway or a railroad, a
combined earthen berm (if topographically possible) and planting strip
(landscape bufferyard easement) a minimum of thirty-five (35) feet in depth
shall be provided adjacent to the highway or railroad in addition to the normal
lot depth. This strip shall be part of the platted lots but shall have the
following restriction lettered on the face of the plat: "Landscape Bufferyard
Easement: This strip reserved for the planting of trees and shrubs, the
building of structures hereon prohibited."
      (2)   Streets Serving Commercial and Industrial Properties. Commercial
and industrial properties shall have provided, on each side of the limited
access highway, arterial street or railroad, streets approximately parallel to
and at a suitable distance from such highway or railroad for the appropriate
use of the land between such streets and highway or railroad, but not less than
one hundred fifty (150) feet.
      (3)   Streets Parallel to a Limited Access Highway Right-of-Way. Streets
parallel to a limited access highway or railroad right-of-way, when
intersecting a major street and highway or collector street which crosses said
railroad or highway, shall be located at a minimum distance of two hundred
fifty (250) feet from said highway or railroad right-of-way. Such distance,
where desirable and practicable, shall be determined with due consideration of
the minimum distance required for the future separation of grades by means of
appropriate approach gradients.
      (4)   Minor Streets Adjacent and Parallel to Railroads, Arterial Streets
and Highways. Minor streets immediately adjacent and parallel to railroad
rights-of-way shall be avoided, and the location of minor streets immediately
adjacent to arterial streets and highways and to railroad rights-of-way shall
be avoided in residential areas.
   (s)   Street and Pedestrian Way Design Standards. The minimum right-of-way
and roadway width of all proposed streets shall be as specified by the
Comprehensive Plan, comprehensive plan component, Official Map, neighborhood
development study, or jurisdictional highway system plan, or if no width is
specified therein, the minimum widths shall be as shown as follows. Street
sections are for standard arterial, collector and minor streets only. Cross-
sections for freeways, expressways and parkways should be based upon detailed
engineering studies. The type of street cross section to be used shall be
determined by the Village Board, upon the recommendation of the Village
Engineer, pursuant to the following general standards:
      (1)   Street Cross Sections - Urban Streets (Curb and Gutter).

Sec. 14-1-71    Specifications for Construction and Dedication of Streets and
Roads.
   (a)   General Requirements.
      (1)   Construction Standards.
         a.   All roadway construction and materials used shall be performed in
accordance with the construction methods as listed in the appropriate sections
of the "State of Wisconsin Department of Transportation Standard Specifications
for Road and Bridge Construction" and its supplements, the Village of Edgar
Engineering Guidelines (if such Guidelines are adopted by the Village Board),
and this Chapter, whichever is more restrictive.
         b.   The design requirements of this Article and Section
14-1-70 shall be applicable to all streets and roads that are to be dedicated
to the Village of Edgar, regardless of whether such streets or roads are part
of a new subdivision or land division.
         c.   Design requirements for the pavement shall be adequate for the
zoning classification of the area served by the subject street. A street which
divides areas with different zoning classifications shall be constructed in
accordance with the requirements of the area requiring the higher quality
pavement. Any variation of this must have prior approval of the Village
Engineer.
         d.   Combination concrete curb and gutter is required on all streets,
unless the Village Board has made an express exception to permit a rural-type
street cross-section with ditch drainage. [Refer to the Subsection (g)(l6)
below describing requirements for curbs and gutters.] A copy of all design
assumptions and computations on which the proposed design is based shall be
submitted to the Village Board.
      (2)   Project Costs. All roadway surveys, dedications, plans and
specifications and construction will be at the expense of the Subdivision,
Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer (as applicable). This includes
any expense incurred by the Village in the preparation of plans and review and
inspection of plans and construction.
      (3)   Preliminary Consultation. Prior to the design, preparation and
construction of any roadway to be dedicated to the Village of Edgar, the
Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer (as applicable)
shall notify the Village Engineer. An on-site meeting will then be arranged to
be attended by the Village Engineer and the Subdivision, Condominium or
Certified Survey Map Developer (as applicable). Plans must be provided in order
for the Village Engineer to check the design and the drainage.
      (4)   Material Slips. Copies of material slips for all materials
furnished for the road construction projects shall be delivered to the Village
before the Village approves the final construction.
      (5)   Required Inspections. Prior to the commencement of any street
construction, the subdivider shall notify the Village Engineer, at least one
(1) workday in advance, as to the nature of the work being done. The Village
Engineer shall be contacted for required inspections before and after the
following phases of construction:
         a.   Subbase grading;
         b.   Crushed aggregate base course;
         c.   Concrete gutters, curbs and sidewalks;
         d.   Bituminous surface course; and
         e.   Shouldering.
   Any deficiencies found by the Village Engineer shall be corrected before
proceeding to the next phase of construction.
      (6)   Tests of Materials. The Village of Edgar reserves the right to
obtain a sample of the roadway base material prior to placement on the roadway
for purposes of determining whether the material meets gradation and soundness
requirements.
      (7)   Pavement Samples. Samples of bituminous concrete may be taken by
the Village during pavement construction operations for purposes of determining
that the material meets specifications.
   (b)   Roadway Elevations; Interval Floods. Elevations of roadways passing
through floodplain areas shall be designed in the following manner:
      (1)   Arterial Streets. Freeways and arterial streets and highways shall
be designed so they will not be overtopped by the 100-year recurrence interval
flood.
      (2)   Collector Streets. Collector streets shall be designed so they will
not be overtopped by the SO-year recurrence interval flood.
      (3)   Local Streets. Local streets shall be designed so they will not be
overtopped by the 25-year recurrence interval flood.
   (c)   New and Replacement Bridges and Culverts.
      (1)   Applicable Standards. All new and replacement bridges shall be
constructed in accordance with all applicable Wisconsin Statutes and state
regulations, and shall be submitted to the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources to ensure compliance therewith.
      (2)   Waterway Bridges.  All new and replacement bridges and culverts
over perennial waterways, including pedestrian and other minor bridges, in
addition to meeting other applicable requirements, shall be designed so as to
accommodate the 100-year recurrence interval flood event without raising the
peak stage, either upstream or downstream, more than 0.01 foot above the peak
stage for the 100-year recurrence interval flood:
         a.   Larger permissible flood stage increases may be acceptable for
reaches having topographic land use conditions which could accommodate the
increased stage without creating additional flood damage potential upstream or
downstream of the proposed structure.
         b.   Such bridges and culverts shall be so designed and constructed as
to facilitate the passage of ice flows and other debris.
   (d)   Street Grades.
      (1)   Generally.  Street grades shall be established wherever practicable
so as to avoid excessive grading, the promiscuous removal of ground cover and
tree growth, and general leveling of the topography.
      (2)   Changes in Street Grade. All changes in street grades shall be
connected by vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent in feet to fifteen
(15) times the algebraic difference in the rates of grade for arterial streets,
and one-half this minimum for all other streets.
      (3)   Maximum Centerline Grades. Unless necessitated by exceptional
topography subject to the approval of the Village Board, upon the
recommendation of the Village Engineer, the maximum centerline grade of any
street or public way shall not exceed the following:
         a.   Arterial and collector streets: Six percent (6%).

Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) "Accessibility Guidelines."
         e.   Equestrian trails: Eight percent (8%).
      (4)   Maximum Grade. The grade of any street shall in no case exceed
twelve percent (12%) or be less than one-half of one percent (0.5%).
      (5)   Grade Variations. Street grades may be varied as provided for in
Subsection (e)(3) above.
   (e)   Radii of Curvature.
      (1)   Standards. When a continuous street centerline deflects at any one
(I) point by more than ten (10) degrees, a circular curve shall be introduced
having a radius of curvature on said centerline of not less than the following:
         a.   Arterial streets and highways: Five hundred (500) feet.
         b.   Collector streets: Three hundred (300) feet.
         c.   Minor streets: One hundred (100) feet.
         d.   Rural and suburban streets: May be less than one hundred (100)
feet in environmentally-sensitive areas as determined by the Village Board,
upon the recommendation of the Plan Commission.
      (2)   Reverse Curve Tangents. A tangent at least one hundred (100) feet
in length shall be provided between reverse curves on arterial and collector
streets.
   (f)   Half-Streets. Where an existing dedicated or platted half-street is
adjacent to the tract being subdivided by either a Subdivision Plat or
Certified Survey Map, the other half of the street shall be dedicated by the
Subdivider or Condominium Developer (as applicable). The platting of new half-
streets shall not be permitted.
   (g)   Construction Standards. All streets and highways constructed in the
Village or to be dedicated to the Village shall fully comply with the following
construction standards, and shall be adequate for the zoning classification or
projected use of the area served by the street:
      (1)   General Requirements; Building Permit Issuance. After completion of
the underground utilities and approval thereof, the streets shall be
constructed. Unless phasing of construction of improvements is approved by the
Village Board or its designee, building permits shall not be issued prior to
the installation of the street improvements and the approval of an individual
lot grading plan that conforms to the guidelines of the master site grading
plan, as determined by the Village Engineer, or his/her designee.
      (2)   Street Right-of-Ways. Streets shall have a right-of-way width as
established on the Official Map or as designated in Section
14-1-71(t), provided, however, that a greater or lesser roadway width may be
required by the Village Engineer where necessary to assure uniformity along the
entire length of any street.
      (3)   Temporary Streets. Construction of temporary streets shall require
authorization of the Village Board, upon the recommendation of the Village
Engineer.
      (4)   Standard Street Improvements.
         a.   Standard street improvements shall include street lights,
concrete curb and gutter, base course, bituminous base course, bituminous
surface course and, when required, walkways.
         b.   The construction of standard street improvements can begin only
when either:
            1.   The underground utilities were installed in the previous
construction season; or
            2.   The construction of underground utilities included mechanical
compaction and compaction tests have been approved by the Village Engineer.
         c.   Upon obtaining the written approval of the Village Engineer the
Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer (as applicable) can
proceed with the construction of the standard street improvements. Standard
street improvements shall be installed to the boundary line of the subdivision
unless the street culminates in a cul-de-sac, the topography or other physical
conditions make it impossible to do so, or unless this requirement is waived,
in writing, by the Village Engineer.
      (5)   Phasing of Paving. Where he/she deems appropriate, the Village
Engineer may require that pavement construction take place over a two (2) year
period, with the lower coat being placed in the same year as the underground
utilities are constructed and with the upper coat being placed in the following
year, after thorough cleaning and application of a tack coat to the first coat.
      (6)   Roadway Base Standards.
         a.   After the installation of temporary block corners monuments by
the Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer (as applicable)
and approval of street grades by the Village Engineer, the Subdivision,
Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer (as applicable) shall grade the
full width of the right-of-way of all streets proposed to be dedicated in
accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the Village
Board, upon the recommendation of the Village Engineer.
         b.   Cut and filled lands shall be graded to a maximum slope of one
(1) on four (4) or the soils angle of repose, whichever is the lesser and
covered with permanent vegetation.
         c.   Residential streets shall have a minimum eight (8) inch thick,
compacted in-place, crushed limestone aggregate base, gradation No. 2,

by the Village Engineer, a ten (10) inch minimum depth crushed limestone
aggregate base course, gradation No. 2, shall be constructed upon an inspected
and approved subgrade conforming to the specifications in Subsection (b)(5)c
above.
         e.   In the case of commercial, arterial or other heavy-use roads, the
Village Board may, in the alternative to the above standards, have the Village
Engineer provide specifications for such roads after researching the site(s)
and conducting a soil analysis for separate pavement design analysis.
         f.   In any case. the Village Board shall have the sole discretion in
determining the use and construction classification to be adhered to.
         g.   In all cases, the base course shall be compacted to the extent
necessary to produce a condition so that there will be no appreciable
displacement of material laterally and longitudinally under traffic and shall
conform to line, grades and shape shown on the approved plans, profiles and
cross sections.
         h.   The Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer
(as applicable) shall furnish drawings which indicate the proposed grades of
streets shown on the plat and, after approval of those grades by the Village
Engineer and adoption by the Village Board, the streets shall be graded to full
width of the right-of-way of the proposed street to the subgrade elevations
shown on the typical cross-section.
         i.   All stumps and trees which cannot be saved, boulders and other
similar items shall be removed by the Subdivision, Condominium or Certified
Survey Map Developer (as applicable).
      (7)   Roadway Subgrade Quality. If deemed necessary by the Village
Engineer, tests may be required according to the following standards:
         a.   All subgrade material shall meet standards required by the
Village Engineer. Inferior subgrade material shall be removed and replaced with
a suitable fill material, or the pavement must be designed to compensate for
the soil conditions.
         b.   Stable and nonorganic sub-base material is required. All topsoil
shall be first removed. In addition, all subsoils which have a high shrink-
swell potential, low- bearing capacity when wet, or are highly elastic shall be
removed to a minimum depth of fifteen (15) inches below the top of the subgrade
and used outside of the right-of-way. Where both subsoil and substratum have a
high shrink-swell potential and low-bearing capacity when wet, an underdrain
system shall be installed to remove water from the sub-base. Unstable and
organic material must be subcut, removed and replaced with a suitable granular
material placed over a geotextile fabric laid on top of the subgrade. Granular
material shall be approved by Village Engineer. Geotextile material shall be
Type SAS material.
      (8)   Roadway Grading; Ditches. Roads shall be graded to their full width
in accordance with approved plans, plus an additional distance necessary to
establish a four-to-one (4:1) backslope where ditches are allowed by the
Village Board. The roadway shall be compacted and graded to a subgrade using,
where necessary, approved fill material in accordance with Wisconsin Department
of Transportation standards. Roadside ditches, where allowed by the Village,
shall be a minimum of twenty-six (26) inches below the finished roadway
centerline elevation, or as approved by the Village Engineer. Debris may not be
buried in the designated road right-of-way. Roadway ditches shall have a normal
slope ratio of three-to-one (3:1) ditch from the edge of the shoulder to the
bottom of the ditch and two-to-one (2:1) on the back slope.
      (9)   Pavement Thickness.

utilities, and the surface course being placed within one (1) year after the
date the binder course was placed. Said surfacing shall be done in accordance
with plans and standard specifications approved by the Village Coard, upon the
recommendation of the Village Engineer.
         d.   In the case of commercial, arterial or other heavy-use roads, the
Village Board may, in the alternative to the above standards, have the Village
Engineer provide specifications for paving such roads with a greater thickness
after researching the site(s) and conducting a soil analysis. In any case, the
Village Board shall have the sole discretion in determining the use and
construction classification to be adhered to. In no event shall paving occur
later than eighteen (18) months from the Village's approval of the Final Plat
or Certified Survey Map.

(ditches, backslopes) within the road right-of-way not provided with pavement
and shouldering material shall be restored utilizing four (4) inches of topsoil
and good quality grass seed, fertilizer and mulch. Ditches along the roadway
shall be protected by erosion control materials such as hay bales, sod, erosion
control mats, etc.
      (14)   Drainage Improvements. In the case of all new roads and streets,
the Village Engineer may require that storm water retention areas and storm
sewers be constructed in order to provide for proper drainage.
      (15)   Continuity and Transitions.
         a.   All street pavement widths on streets continued from previously
developed or platted streets shall, wherever practical, provide for the greater
of either the existing or required pavement type, width, grade and cross slope.
         b.   Where it is necessary to provide for a transition of pavement
width and/or type between new and existing streets, the transition shall occur
in a safe manner at an intersection. In the event a transition in pavement
width cannot safety occur at an intersection, it shall not occur closer than
two hundred fifty (250) feet to the intersection of right-of-way lines. In
width transitions, the ratio of the transition length to width shall not be
less than fifteen to one (15:1) unless the Village Engineer determines that
special circumstances prevent use of such ratio, in which case the minimum
transition ratio shall be ten to one (10:1).
      (16)   Curb and Gutter. Combination concrete curb and gutter is required
on all streets, except where the Village Board has made an express exception to
permit a rural-type street cross-section with ditch drainage. Curb and gutter
in residential areas shall be either barrier type or mountable type. Barrier
type curb and gutter shall have a six (6) inch barrier curb with a twenty-four
(24) inch flag; except at driveway aprons where a depressed curb shall be
constructed. Mountable type curb and gutter shall have been thirty (30) inches
wide with an eighteen (18) inch flag. The top of the back of the mountable curb
shall be three (3) inches above the gutter flowline. Depress curb shall be
constructed at all handicap ramps for sidewalks and bikeways. Said curb and
gutter shall be constructed of concrete, 3500 PSI strength at twenty- eight
(28) days. Expansion joints one-half (1/2) inch thick shall be placed in the
curb at each starting and ending of a radius and at intervals not exceeding
three hundred (300) feet and where otherwise directed by the Village Engineer.
Tie bars shall be provided where curb and gutter is adjacent to rigid
pavements. The standards of Section
14-1-54 shall also be complied with, whichever is more restrictive.
      (17)   Post-Construction Traffic Limited. No vehicular traffic shall be
permitted on the pavement for a minimum period of between twenty-four (24) and
seventy-two (72) hours following paving, as determined necessary by the Village
Engineer to protect the new pavement.
   (h)   Final Inspection. Upon completion of proposed streets, the Village
Engineer will proceed to make a final inspection, accepting or rejecting the
street as the case may be. After all of the provisions of this Chapter have
been complied with, the street will be inspected by Village officials and, at
that time, proof will be made by the presenting of waivers of liens or
receipted bills that all work that has been done has been paid for, or
arrangements have been made for the payment through written instrument by the
Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer (as applicable). If
the street is rejected, corrections shall be made as required by the Village
Board, upon the Village Engineer's recommenda- tion, before final inspection
can then be made again. If final acceptance is then made, the owner or owners
shall dedicate to the Village all land necessary for streets. The Village may
require an unsecured warranty regarding the fitness of street improvements
after the expiration of the fourteen (14) month security.

dividing of a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots, or a plan shown as
to future use rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels.
   (m)   Redivision of Large Lots. In case a tract is divided and results in
parcels of more than twice the minimum lot size provided for by the Village
Zoning Code for the zoning district in which the land is located, such parcels
shall be so arranged to permit redividing into parcels in accordance with this
Chapter and with the Village of Edgar Zoning Code.
   (n)   Trunk Highway Proximity. All lots adjacent to state trunk and federal
highways shall be platted with additional depth necessary to provide for a
building setback line not less than fifty (50) feet from the nearer right-of-
way line or one hundred ten (110) feet from the centerline, whichever is more
restrictive (Ref. Wis. Adm. Code HY 33). The Subdivider/Developer may appeal
this requirement to the Village Engineer. Upon written request of the Village
Engineer; the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is hereby authorized to
then determine building setback requirements equal to or less than those
required above in all land divisions (including certified surveys) adjacent to
state and federal highways in accordance with the authority granted in the
Wisconsin Administrative Code. The required building setback line and
additional lot depth shall be platted so as to accommodate such required

flumes or other energy dissipating structures and seeding and/or sodding of
open channels and unpaved road ditches proposed to be constructed shall be in
accordance with the plans and standard specifications approved by the Village
Engineer.
      (3)   The Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer (as
applicable) shall assume the cost of installing all storm sewers of thirty-six
(36) inches or smaller within the proposed subdivision, except for the added
cost of installing storm sewers greater than thirty-six (36) inches which are
necessary to serve tributary drainage areas lying outside of the proposed
subdivision. In addition, the Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map
Developer (as applicable) shall pay to the Village, a storm sewer trunk line
connection fee based on the added cost of installing larger sewers in the total
tributary drainage area which shall be prorated in proportion to the ratio
which the total area of the proposed plat is to the total drainage area to be
served by such larger sewers.
      (4)   The following provisions in this Section are established to
preserve and provide properly located public sites and facilities for drainage
and stormwater management as the community develops, and to insure that the
costs of providing and developing such public sites are equitably apportioned

clear grate on the aforementioned storm drainage inlets. The Subdivision,
Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer (as applicable) shall also
incorporate restrictive covenants in the deeds of any parcel abutting any
drainage way/easement specific in the plat requiring the maintenance of grades
and notice that the owner shall be subject to assessments necessary to remedy
encroachments and obstructions by said lot owner.
      (2)   The restrictive covenants in the deeds and as noted on the face of
the plat shall notify the owner of any parcel within the land development that
the lot or parcel shall also be subject to special assessments for any and all
work necessary to maintain the final drainage plan in accordance with the
specifications of the plat.
   (g)   Grading. The Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map
Developer (as applicable) shall grade each subdivision in order to establish
street, block and lot grades in proper relation to each other and to topography
as follows:
      (1)   The Subdivider/Developer shall grade the full width of the right-
of-way of all proposed streets in accordance with the approved plans.
      (2)   Block grading shall be completed by one (1) or more of the
following methods:

and specifications provided by Village ordinance and/or the Village Engineer.
   (n)   Maintenance Agreement.
      (1)   A maintenance agreement shall be required between the Village and
the Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer (as applicable).
The agreement shall be recorded as a property deed restriction by the
subdivider with the County Register of Deeds in a form which shall be binding
upon all subsequent owners of land covered by the agreement. Such agreement
shall assign on-going responsibility for maintenance and repair of the
stormwater management system, including detention/retention facilities and
drainageways, to a homeowners, property owners or condominium association per
Sec. 14-1-23. Prior to Final Plat approval, the Subdivision, Condominium or
Certified Survey Map Developer (as applicable) subdivider shall submit to the
Village for its approval an on-going maintenance and mowing plan for such
facilities, which shall be incorporated by reference into all approvals and
development agreements. In the alternative, if unique circumstances or a
special benefit to the public can be demonstrated, such ownership and
maintenance responsibility may be assumed by the Village of Edgar.
      (2)   If the Village at any time finds that the stormwater management
measures constructed in accordance with the system plan are not being properly
maintained, or if altered in any way from the location, configuration and
capacity of the measures specified in the approved plan, the Village shall have
the right to undertake the needed maintenance or repair. This right shall
include the right to enter onto private property as necessary to carry out the
needed maintenance or repair. The cost of such maintenance or repair shall be
levied as a special assessment or special charge against the properties
concerned. The special charge or assessment shall be collectible in the same
manner as all other special assessments/charges levied by the Village of Edgar.
   (o)   Minor Drainage System. The Subdivision, Condominium or Certified
Survey Map Developer (as applicable) shall install all minor drainage system
components necessary to reduce inconvenience and damages from frequent storms.
Minor drainage components shall include all inlets, piping, gutters, channels,
ditching, pumping and other facilities designed to accommodate the post-
development runoff resulting from a ten (10) year, twenty-four (24) hour
rainfall event as determined in the most current edition of the Soils
Conservation Service Technical Release 55 (TR 55) or the "Rational Method".
Temporary accumulations of storm runoff from ponding or flowing water, in or
near minor system components, shall be petmitted providing such accumulations
do not allow the water to flow across the crown of the street from one side to
the other. For arterial streets and streets located in commercial districts,
ponding within normal traffic lanes [ten (10) feet on each side of the
centerline of the street] is prohibited. In drainageways and drainageway
easements, accumulations of water shall not inundate beyond the limits of the
drainageway or drainageway easement. Cross-street drainage channels (valley
gutters) shall not be permitted except on cul-de-sac or permanent dead-end
streets serving less than ten (10) dwelling units and where the minimum grade
in the valley gutter and street gutter between the valley gutter and the next
downstream drainage inlet is not less than one percent (1.00%).
   (p)   Major Drainage System. The Subdivision, Condominium or Certified
Survey Map Developer (as applicable) shall install all major drainage system
components necessary to reduce inconvenience and damages from infrequent

      (1)   Unless recommended otherwise by the Village Engineer, unpaved road
ditches and street gutters shall be permitted only within the Village's
extraterritorial plat approved jurisdictional area and shall be shaped and
seeded and/or sodded as grassed waterways. Where the velocity of flow is in
excess of four (4) feet per second on soils having a severe or very severe
erosion hazard and in excess of six (6) feet per second on soils having
moderate, slight, or very slight erosion hazard, the Subdivider/Developer shall
install check dams, flumes, or other energy dissipating devices.
      (2)   Where open channels are utilized in either the minor or major
drainage system, they shall be designed so as to minimize maintenance
requirements and maximize safety. Drainage easements (in lieu of dedications)
shall be utilized to accommodate open channels provided adequate access by the
Village for maintenance of drainage capacity. Side slopes shall not exceed a
four-to-one (4:1) slope. Drainageways where subject to high ground water,
continuous flows, or other conditions as determined by the Village Engineer
that would hamper maintenance operations due to consistently wet conditions,
shall have a paved concrete invert of not less than eight (8) feet wide and
side slopes to a point one (I) foot above the channel invert.
      (3)   In areas where invert paving is not required, the drainageway
bottom shall be grass. If the drainageway has a bare soil bottom or the natural
grasses in the drainageway are disturbed due to development operations, the
drainageway bottom shall be sodded and securely staked to one (1) foot above
the elevation of inundation resulting from a predevelopment five (5) year,
twenty-four (24) hour storm event. Other disturbed areas shall be seeded and
prepared in accordance with the Village's Erosion Control requirements.
Velocities for grass-lined channels shall not exceed those presented in the
Village's Surface Water Management Study, if one is adopted.
   (s)   Standards for On-Site Detention Storage. When the Subdivision,
Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer (as applicable) employs on-site
detention to control erosion and sedimentation, reduce the post-development
peak runoff rate or temporarily store storm water runoff due to inadequate
downstream drainage facilities. The detention (storage) facilities shall be
subject to regulation in accordance with the following standards:
      (1)   Temporary on-site detention for erosion and sedimentation control
shall be designed in conformance with the "Wisconsin Construction Site Best
Management Practices Handbook".
      (2)   Where on-site detention is permanently employed to reduce the post-
development peak runoff, the detention facility shall safety contain the post-
development runoff from a twenty-five (25) year storm event of twenty-four (24)
hour duration within the limits of the facility.
      (3)   Post-development peak runoff rates shall be limited to pre-
development levels, up to and including twenty-five (25) year return period
storms. Curve numbers of 30, 58, 71 and 78 for Hydrologic Soil Groups A, B, C
and D respectively shall be used when computing pre-development runoff rates.
      (4)   All detention facilities shall safety contain or pass the runoff
from any storm of any duration which exceeds the maximum storm required to be
contained up to the one hundred (100) year storm event of twenty-four (24) hour
duration.
      (5)   All permanent detention facilities shall safety contain the runoff
from the one hundred (100) year storm event of twenty-four (24) hour duration
on both public and, if necessary, private properties without inundating any
building at the ground elevation, the travel lanes of any arterial street, the
center ten (10) feet of any collector street or the top of the curb on any
local street.
      (6)   Determination of on-site detention volumes shall be computed by
procedures established by the United States Soil Conservation Service in the
most current edition of its technical publication entitled "Urban Hydrology for
Small Watersheds, TR-55 or TR-20," and as accepted and approved by the Village
Engineer.
      (7)   The storage of storm water runoff shall not encroach on any public
park (except parks designed with detention facilities) or any private lands
outside the land division unless an easement providing for such storage has
been approved and recorded for said lands.
      (8)   All detention facilities shall be designed with the safety of the
general public and any considerations for ease of maintenance as top
proprieties.
      (9)   Any wet detention facilities shall include riprap to not less than
two (2) feet above the normal pool elevation for protection from wave action,
or other slope stabilization methods approved by the Village Engineer, for
protection from wave action.
      (10)   The sides of all detention facilities shall have a maximum slope
ratio of four to one (4:1) (horizontal to vertical), with flatter slopes being
required where determined practical by the Village Engineer.
      (11)   The Village Board, upon recommendation by the Village Engineer,
may require the installation of fencing or other such security measures in
detention facilities with excessively long down times or permanent water
features, or other features requiring additional security for safety reasons.

shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or
potential residential areas.
Sec. 14-1-76 Grading.
The Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer (as applicable)
shall grade each land division in order to establish street, block and lot
grades in proper relation to each other and to topography as follows:
   (a)   Master Site-Grading Plan.
      (1)   A master site-grading plan shall be prepared by the Subdivision,
Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer (as applicable) for all new
Subdivision, Certified Survey Map and Condominium projects. This plan shall be
prepared in accordance with the requirements and standards of the Village of
Edgar.
      (2)   The master site-grading plan shall show existing and proposed
elevations of all lot comers, control points and building locations. The plan
shall also indicate all overland storm drainage in and adjacent to the land
development. The cost of the preparation of such a plan shall be paid for by
the Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer (as applicable).
Grading plans shall include topographic contours at one (1) foot intervals.
Grading plans shall show top of foundation elevations for proposed lots and at
existing structures on surrounding properties.
      (3)   After approval or modification of these plans by the Village
Engineer, the full width of the right-of-way of the proposed streets within the
subdivision and the entire land development lot area shall be graded in
accordance with the master site-grade plan. The owners of the lots shall adhere
to those plans.
      (4)   The Village Engineer shall be contacted to inspect and approve the
grading and related work at each of the following stages:
         a.   Completion of the grading of all street right-of-way areas.
         b.   Completion of the grading of all lots.
         c.   Completion of the filling with topsoil and leveling of the public
right-of-way behind the curbs.

Map Developer (as applicable) shall grade the full width of the right-of-way of
all proposed streets in accordance with the approved plans, including the
grading of site triangles at each intersection.
   (c)   Block Grading. Block grading shall be completed by one (1) or more of
the following methods:
      (1)   Regrading along the side or rear lot lines which provides for
drainage to the public drainage facilities, provided any ditches or swales are
in public drainage easements, provided that a deed restriction is adopted which
prohibits alteration of the grades within five (5) feet of any property line
from the grades shown on the master site grading plan.
      (2)   Parts of all lots may be graded to provide for drainage to a ditch
or to a swale.
   (d)   Miscellaneous Grading Requirements.
      (1)   Lot grading shall be completed so that water drains away from each
building site toward public drainage facilities at a grade approved by the
Village Engineer and provisions shall be made to prevent drainage onto
properties adjacent to the land division unless to a public drainage facility.
Buildable lots shall be graded so that the elevation of each building site is
at least one (1) to two (2) feet above the centerline elevation of the adjacent
public street.
      (2)   Grading activities shall not result in slopes greater than three to
one (3:1) on public lands or lands subject to public access. Cut on filled land
shall be graded to a maximum slope of three to one (3:1).
      (3)   The topsoil stripped for grading shall not be removed from the site
unless identified in the Erosion Control Plan approved by the Village Engineer
as not being necessary for erosion control or site landscaping purposes.
Topsoil shall be uniformly returned to the lots when rough grading is finished.
Topsoil piles shall be leveled and seeded for erosion control prior to the
Village releasing the one (1) year guarantee provision on public improvements
in the streets adjacent to the lots on which the topsoil is stockpiled.
      (4)   Such grading shall not result in detriment to any existing
developed lands, either within or outside of the corporate limits.
      (5)   The Village shall require the Subdivision, Condominium or Certified
Survey Map Developer (as applicable) to provide or install certain protection
and rehabilitation measures, such as fencing, sloping, seeding, riprap,
revetments, jetties, clearing, dredging, snagging, drop structures, brush mats,
willow poles and grade stabilization structures. Seeding of the site shall
occur within thirty (30) days of rough grading.
      (6)   Tree cutting and shrubbery clearing shall not exceed fifty percent
(50%) of the lot or tract and shall be so conducted as to prevent erosion and
sedimentation; preserve and improve scenic qualities; and, during foliation,
substantially screen any development from stream or lake users.
      (7)   Paths and trails in wooded and wetland areas shall not exceed ten
(10) feet in width unless otherwise approved by the Village Board, and shall be
so designed and constructed as to result in the least removal and disruption of
trees and shrubs, and the minimum impairment of natural beauty.
      (8)   Earth moving, such as grading, topsoil removal, mineral extraction,
stream course changing, road cutting, waterway construction or enlargement,
removal of stream or lake bed materials, excavation, channel, clearing,
ditching, drain tile laying, dredging, and lagooning, shall be so conducted as
to prevent erosion and sedimentation and to least disturb the natural fauna,
flora, watercourse, water regimen, and topography.
      (9)   Review of the conduct of such cutting, clearing, and moving may be
requested of the County Soil and Water Conservation District Supervisors, the
State District Fish and Game Managers, and the State District Forester by the
Village Engineer or Plan Commission as they deem appropriate.
   (e)   Drainage Flows. The Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map
Developer (as applicable) shall cause to be set upon the master grading plan
arrows indicating the directions of drainage flows for each property line not
fronting on a street on all parcels and along each street as will result from
the grading of the site, the construction of the required public improvements,
or which are existing drainage flows and will remain. The arrows indicating the
directions of flows shall be appropriately weighted so as to differentiate
between the minor and major [one hundred (100) year event] drainage components.
The arrows shall be accompanied on the master grading plan with the following
note:
      Arrows indicate the direction of drainage flows in various components
resulting from site grading and the construction of required public
improvements. The drainage flow components located in easements shall be
maintained and preserved by the property owner unless approved by the Village
Engineer.
Sec. 14-1-77 Erosion Control.
The Village of Edgar finds that urbanizing land uses have accelerated the
process of soil erosion, runoff and sediment deposition in the waters of the
Village. Therefore, it is declared to be the purpose of this Section to control
and prevent soil erosion and minimize storm water runoff increases and thereby
to preserve the natural resources, control floods and prevent impairment of
dams and reservoirs, protect the quality of public waters, protect wildlife,
protect the tax base, and protect and promote the health, safety and general
welfare of the people of the Village. All land disturbing activities shall be
subject to the provisions of the Village's Construction Site Erosion Control
Ordinance (Title 15, Chapter 2).
Cross-Reference: Title 15, Chapter 2, "Construction Site Erosion Control".
Sec. 14-1-78 through Sec. 14-1-79   Reserved for Future Use.
Article H:   Park and Public Land Dedications; Impact Fees
Sec. 14-1-80 General Park and Public Land Dedication Requirements.
   (a)   Dedication Requirement. In order that adequate open spaces and sites
for public uses may be properly located and reserved and in order that the cost
of providing public areas, such as but not limited to, parks, recreation areas
may be equitably apportioned on the basis of additional need created by the
subdivision development, each Subdivider/Developer shall be required to
dedicate land or fees in lieu of land for park or other public uses.
   (b)   General Design. In the design of a subdivision, land division, planned
unit development or development project, provision shall be made for suitable
sites of adequate area for parks, playgrounds, open spaces, drainage-ways and
other public purposes. Such sites are to be shown on the Preliminary Plat and
Final Plat, and shall comply with the Village of Edgar Comprehensive Plan or
component of said Plan. Consideration shall be given to the preservation of
scenic and historic sites, stands of trees, marshes, lakes, ponds, streams,
watercourses, watersheds, ravines and woodlands, prairie and wetlands, and
plant and animal communities.
Sec. 14-1-81 Land Dedication.
   (a)   Recreational Dedication Standards. The Village of Edgar shall require
that land be dedicated for parks and playgrounds, recreational areas, or open
space locations where such would be appropriate. The Village Administrator
shall determine the number of acres to be reserved based upon the following
calculations. These requirements are only applicable to single-family
residential subdivisions of more than ten (10) units or multifamily single lot
subdivisions. Parkland required in residential subdivisions are:
 
Dwelling Units Per Gross Acre Percent Acreage for Parkland/Open Space
1 - 7                      7%
8 - 14                        12%
15 and up                     17%
 
   (b)   Suitability and Condition of Land to be Dedicated.
      (1)   Land for recreation or open space purposes shall be of a character
and location suitable for use as a playground, playfield, or for other active
or passive recreation purposes, and shall be level and dry, and shall be
improved by the Subdivider/ Developer to the standards required by the Village
Administrator, which improvements shall be included in the performance
security. All active recreation site shall be accessible from at least one (1)
street.
      (2)   Lands to be dedicated shall be suitable for the public use for
which they are proposed, with at least sixty percent (60%) of the site no more
than an average grade of 5.25% to provide areas suitable for playground and
playfield improvements. Drainageways, detention basins, floodplains, or
wetlands shall not be considered as satisfying parkland dedication
requirements. The Village Board, upon the recommendations of the Village
Administrator and Plan Commission, shall have the sole authority to determine
the suitability and adequacy of lands proposed for dedication.
      (3)   Land to be dedicated shall be adequately drained. Subsurface
investigation may be required by the Village Administrator to determine whether
or not the drainage capability of the soil is adequate. The Village Board may
reject the land offered if it is determined to be unsuitable for recreational
development. In this case, the Subdivider/Developer shall offer another parcel
or a cash payment in lieu of dedication. The Village Administrator may
recommend to the Village Board that the Subdivider/Developer submit a cash
payment in lieu of dedication where it is deemed by the Village that the
drainage capability or other conditions at a site are not adequate for
recreation purposes. All land to be reserved for dedication to the Village for
park purposes shall have prior approval of the Village and shall be shown
marked on the approved subdivision plan as lands "to be dedicated for park,
recreation or open space purposes."
   (c)   Active Recreation Facility Plan. The Village Administrator shall
recommend active recreation facilities to be required, related parking areas,
and proposed landscaping when deemed necessary. A report shall accompany this
active recreation facilities plan outlining the proper procedure to be followed
in bearing debris and waste, parking of construction vehicles, and otherwise
maintaining the condition of the site before dedication to the Village.
   (d)   Timing of Dedication. The Village is empowered to require the land
reserved for dedication to be deeded to the Village of Edgar under the terms of
an approved subdivision plan based in part upon the recommendation of the
Village Administrator as to when sufficient recreation needs exist in the
subdivision. The Village Administrator shall notify the Subdivider/Developer in
writing that a transfer of land is requested at least ninety (90) days prior to
the desired date of transfer. At the time of transfer, the land must be
adequately drained, graded, and sown in accordance with Village standards and
specifications.
   (e)   Future Development of Adjacent Lands. In designing the location of
future park and recreation sites, due consideration shall be given to locating
parkland on the boundary of the development parcel in areas adjacent to
unplatted lands proposed for future development in Village planning documents.
This will allow for the potential for larger community parks with the future
dedication of parkland adjoining the Subdivision or Condominium Development
when the adjacent lands are platted and/or developed.
   (f)   Alternative Procedure; Money in Lieu of Land. Where, with respect to a
particular subdivision, the reservation of land required pursuant to this
Section does not equal the percentage of total land required to be reserved in
accordance with this Article or the land is determined to not be suitable for
dedication by the Village Board, upon the recommenda- tion of the Plan
Commission and Village Administrator, the Village Board may require, prior to
final approval of the construction improvements plan for the subdivision, that
the applicant deposit with the Village a cash payment in lieu of land
dedication. Such deposit shall be used by the Village for improvement of a
neighborhood park, playground, or recreation area, including the acquisition of
property. Such deposit shall be used for facilities which will actually be
available to and benefit the persons in said subdivision and be located in a
park near the subdivision. The Village Board shall determine the amount to be
deposited, based upon the recommendation of the Village Administrator. This
recommendation will reflect the fair market value of the amount of land that
would have been dedicated. The fees collected shall be held in a nonlapsing
fund to be used for the purchase or improvement of land or recreational
facilities for parks, trails, open spaces, and other public recreation
purposes.
   (g)   Other Recreation Dedications. The provisions of this Section are
minimum standards. None of the Subsections herein shall be construed to
prohibit a developer from dedicating other lands for recreation or open space
purposes in addition to the requirements of this Section.
   (h)   Utility Extensions. The Subdivider/Developer shall install or provide
for installation of water and sanitary sewer lines to the property line of all
dedicated land, where such services are to be provided to the adjacent
properties.
   (i)   Changes in Allowable Use of a Property. Any changes in the allowable
use of a property, which would have the effect of increasing the number of
residential dwelling units on a parcel of land, shall be required to provide
land dedication or fees in lieu of land to meet the increased recreational
demands created by the change in use according to the requirements of this
Article.
   (j)   Exceptions.
      (1)   The land dedication and fee in lieu of land requirements of this
Article do not apply to land divisions where the proposed land division
involves only one (I) existing lot of record in the Village of Edgar as of the
date of adoption of this Code of Ordinances, and the act of division creates
only one (1) new lot intended for two (2) or fewer dwelling units.
      (2)   The land dedication and fee in lieu of land requirement of this
Article shall not apply to conversions of existing residential dwelling
structures from a single-family residence to a two-family residence.
Sec. 14-1-82 Reservation of Additional Land.
Whenever a public park or recreation site proposed in the Village Comprehensive
Plan, Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan or Parks Plan, or Official Map is
embraced, in whole or in part, in a tract of land to be divided, the proposed
public park or recreation site shall be dedicated and credited toward the land
dedication requirements of this Article. Where a public park or recreation site
as shown on the Village Comprehensive Plan, Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation
Plan or Parks Master Plan, or Official Map within the tract are greater in area
than required under the dedication requirements of this Article, the Village
Board may require that the Subdivider or Condominium Developer reserve for
acquistion by the Village, through a development agreement, purchase, or
condemnation, the remaining greater park area for a period of two (2) years of
the Final Plan, Certified Survey Map, or Condominium plat approval unless
extended by mutual agreement such reserved lands shall be kept in one (1) or
more outlots to be held by the Subdivider or Condominium Developer. Over that
period, the Village shall have the ability to negotiate the purchase of said
land at undeveloped land prices. If the Village does not acquire the outlots
set aside during the two (2) year period, this requirement shall lapse and the
Village shall remove this requirement from any recorded documents.
Sec. 14-1-83 Development of Park Area.
   (a)   When parklands are dedicated to the Village of Edgar, the Subdivider/
Developer is required to:
      (1)   Properly grade and contour for proper drainage;
      (2)   Provide surface contour suitable for anticipated use of area as
approved by the Village Engineer; and
      (3)   Cover areas to be seeded with a minimum of six (6) inches of
quality topsoil, seed as specified by the Public Works Department, fertilized
with 16-6-6 at a rate of seven (7) pounds per one thousand (1,000) square feet,
and mulched, as specified in the standard "Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction Section 627 and 629". The topsoil furnished for the park site
shall consist of the natural loam, sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or
clay loam humus-bearing soils adapted to the sustenance of plant life, and such
topsoil shall be neither excessively acid nor excessively alkaline. Fine
grading and seeding must occur within one (1) year following issuance of the
first building permit within that land division unless otherwise authorized by
the Village Board. The improved area shall not be deemed officially accepted
until a uniform grass cover to a two (2) inch height has been established. It
shall be the responsibility of the Subdivider/Developer to maintain the area
until the Village accepts the dedication.
   (b)   It shall be the responsibility of the Village to maintain the
dedicated areas upon their dedication and acceptance by the Village. The owner
of said land shall be responsible for its maintenance and liability thereon
except that said owner shall not develop the surrounding area in a manner which
would unduly depreciate the purpose, use or value of the dedicated property.
   (c)   A neighborhood park area shall be provided by the Subdivider/Developer
with a standard residential water service unless located directly adjacent to a
fire hydrant. A community park area shall be provided by the developer with a
minimum six (6) inch water service or at least one (1) fire hydrant, and at
least one (1) four (4) inch sanitary sewer lateral, all located at the street
property line.
   (d)   The Village Board may require certification of compliance by Village
officials. The cost of such report shall be paid by the Subdivider/Developer.
   (e)   If the Subdivider/Developer fails to satisfy the requirements of this
Section, the Village Board may contract said completion and bill such costs to
the Subdivider/Developer, following a public hearing and written notice to the
Subdivider/Developer of noncompli- ance. Failure to pay such costs may result
in the immediate withholding of all building permits until such costs are paid.
   (f)   The Subdivider/Developer shall pay all costs of public improvements in
the public streets adjacent to or within all public and/or park lands.
   (g)   Development of park lands is to be completed as soon as twenty percent
(20%) of the planned lots in the subdivision are sold or developed, as
determined by the Village Board.

any time to provide notice to the applicant that the escrow funds under this
provision are insufficient. Statements outstanding for more than thirty (30)
days shall accrue interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1-1/2%) per
month. In the event the applicant withdraws his/her plat or certified survey
map, or the same is approved, and money remains in escrow over and above the
Village's fees, the excess shall be refunded to the Subdivision, Condominium or
Certified Survey Map Developer (as applicable). The escrow account shall not
draw interest for the benefit of the Subdivision, Condominium or Certified
Survey Map Developer (as applicable). The Village Administrator, with the
approval of the Village Board, shall have the right to draw upon the escrow to
reimburse the Village for the fees it has incurred in reviewing the
Subdivision, Certified Survey Map or other land development project on a
periodic basis.
         c.   An accounting of all fees incurred by the Village and the status
of the escrow shall also be provided to the Subdivision, Condominium or

provide the Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer (as
applicable) with amounts paid from any such escrow account and copies of
invoices it receives for any professional review services for the Subdivision,
Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer's (as applicable) proposed
subdivision. In the event the Subdivision, Condominium or Certified Survey Map
Developer (as applicable) defaults in establishing or replenishing the escrow,
the Village shall not be required to act further upon the Subdivision,
Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer's (as applicable) request.

all required impact fees shall be paid one hundred percent (100%) at the time
of issuance of the building permit by the Village of Edgar. The impact fee

Dated this ___________ day of ______________, _____________
(Signature of Applicant/Petitioner)
Article J:   Variances; Penalties and Violations
Sec. 14-1-100 Variations and Exceptions.
   (a)   Requests for Variances. Where the Subdivision, Condominium or
Certified Survey Map Developer (as applicable) alleges that extraordinary
hardships or particular difficulties may result from strict compliance with
these regulations, he/she may request variations or exceptions to the
regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest
secured, provided that such variation or exception shall not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of this Chapter. Application for any such
variance shall be made in writing by the Subdivision, Condominium or Certified
Survey Map Developer (as applicable) to the Village Administrator at the time
when the Preliminary Plat or Certified Survey Map is filed for consideration,
stating fully all facts relied upon by the petitioner, and shall be
supplemented with maps, plans, or other additional data which may aid Village
officials in the analysis of the proposed project. The plans for such
development shall include such covenants, restrictions or other legal
provisions necessary to guarantee the full achievement of the plan. The Village
Administrator may request that the Village Engineer, Village Attorney or other
officials review each situation to ensure that the request is consistent with
the requirements and standards of this Chapter. The Village Administrator shall
refer the matter to the Plan Commission with any written recommendations from
Village staff. The Plan Commission shall make a recommendation to the Village
Board. The previous granting of variances or exceptions in the same or similar
circumstances shall not of itself constitute grounds for the granting of a
variance or exception, nor shall strictly financial rationale.
   (b)   Variance Criteria. The Plan Commission shall not recommend, nor shall
the Village Board grant, variations or exceptions to the regulations of this
Chapter unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it
in each specific case that:
      (1)   Failure to grant the variation may be detrimental to the public
safety, health or welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located;
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are
unique to the property for which the variation is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property;
      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
financial hardship or self-imposed hardship, if the strict letter of the
regulations were carried out.
      (4)   There would be no costs (present or future) to the Village
resulting from the granting of the variance or exception.
   (c)   Plan Commission Recommendation; Village Board Action. Any
recommendations for variances or exceptions by the Plan Commission must be
approved by a majority vote of the Plan Commission and shall be so endorsed by
the Secretary and transmitted to the Village Board. The Village Board, if it
approves, shall do so by resolution adopted by majority vote and shall instruct
the Village Administrator to notify the Plan Commission and the subdivider.
   (d)   Planned Unit Development Platting Variances. Variances from the strict
application of the platting requirements of this Chapter may also be granted in
accordance with this Chapter in the case of Planned Unit Developments provided
the Village Board, upon review and recommendations from the Plan Commission,
shall find that the proposed development is fully consistent with the purpose
and intent of this Chapter, Zoning Ordinances, and the Village Comprehensive
Plan.

   (e)   Revocation of Permits and/or Approvals.
      (1)   The Village Engineer, Village Administrator or Building Inspector
may revoke or suspend any permit or approval issued under the regulations of
this Chapter and may stop construction or use of approved materials, equipment,
methods of construction, devices or appliances for any of the following
reasons:
         a.   Whenever the Village Engineer or Village Administrator shall find
at any time that applicable ordinances, laws, orders, plans and specifications
are not being complied with and that the Subdivision, Condominium or Certified
Survey Map Developer (as applicable) or his/her contractor has refused to
conform after written warning or instruction has been issued to him/her.
         b.   Whenever the continuance of any construction becomes dangerous to
life or property.
         c.   Whenever there is any violation of any condition or provisions of
the application for permit, or of the permit or of any approval.
         d.   Whenever, in the opinion of the Village Engineer, Village
Administrator, Zoning Administrator, or Building Inspector, the Subdivision,
Condominium or Certified Survey Map Developer (as applicable) has provided
inadequate management of the project.
         e.   Whenever any false statement or misrepresentation has been made
in the application for permit, plans, drawings, data specifications or

based.
         f.   Whenever there is a violation of any of the conditions of an
approval or occupancy given by the Village Engineer, Village Administrator or
Building Inspector for the use of all materials, equipment, methods of
construction, devices or appliances.
      (2)   The notice revoking a permit or approval shall be in writing and
may be served upon the applicant of the permit, owner of the premises and his/
her agent, if any, and/or on the person having charge of construction.
      (3)   A revocation placard shall also be posted upon the premises in
question by the Village Engineer, Village Administrator, Zoning Administrator
or Building Inspector.
      (4)   After the notice is served upon the persons as aforesaid and
posted, it shall be unlawful for any person to proceed thereafter with any
construction operation whatsoever on the premises, and the permit which has
been so revoked shall be null and void, and before any construction or
operation is again resumed, a new permit, as required by this Chapter, shall be
procured and fees paid therefor, and thereafter the resumption of any
construction or operation shall be in compliance with the regulation of this
Chapter. However, such work as the Village Engineer, Village Administrator,
Zoning Administrator or Building Inspector may order as a condition precedent
to the reissuance of the building permit may be performed, or such work as he/
she may require for the preservation of life and safety.
      (5)   Any appeals of such revocations or suspensions must be made in
writing and within seven (7) calendar days to the Village Administrator for
consideration by the Village Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting,
provided the appeal is filed not less than seven (7) days prior to the meeting
date.
      (6)   The Building Inspector is hereby directed to withhold the issuance
of building permits within the land division until compliance with the
provisions of this Chapter is obtained.
      (7)   The Building Inspector is hereby directed to withhold the issuance

therefrom, as provided in Sections 236.13(5) and 62.23(7)(e)IO, 14 and 15, Wis.
Stats., within thirty (30) days of notification of the rejection of the Plat or
Certified Survey Map. Where failure to approve is based on an unsatisfied
objection, the agency making the objection shall be made a party to the action.
The court may direct that the Plat or Certified Survey Map be approved if it
finds that the action of the approving or objecting agency is arbitrary,
unreasonable or discriminatory.
Sec. 14-1-102 Disclaimers on Approvals.
   (a)   The purpose of requiring approvals under this Chapter is to insure the
health, safety, morale, comfort, prosperity and general welfare of the Village
of Edgar. This Chapter shall not be interpreted as placing any responsibility
or liability on any Village official, Village employee, or the Village of Edgar
as a municipal corporation for the granting of approval, or the denial of any
approval. All approvals rendered as part of this Chapter shall be considered as
being approved conditionally based on the information and circumstances
apparent at that time.
   (b)   Approvals issued by the Village shall not be construed as an
assumption or expression of any responsibility, warranty, or guarantee, for the
design or construction of any improvements within the land division.
   (c)   The Village of Edgar does not guarantee, warrant, or represent that
only those areas delineated as floodlands on Plats and Certified Survey Maps
will be subject to periodic inundation, nor does the Village guarantee,
warrant, or represent that the soils shown to be unsuited for a given land use
from tests required by this Chapter are the only unsuited soils within the
jurisdiction of this Chapter; and thereby asserts that there is no liability on
the part of the Village Board, its agencies, or employees for flooding
problems, sanitation problems, or structural damages that may occur as a result
of reliance upon, and conformance with, this Chapter.
Sec. 14-1-103 Restrictions for Public Benefit.

names a public body or public utility as grantee, promisee or beneficiary,
vests in the public body or utility the right to enforce the restriction by law
or in equity against anyone who has interest in the land subject to the
restriction. The restriction may be released or waived by resolution of the
Village Board.

Sec. 15-1-1   Building Code Established.
   (a)   Title. This Chapter shall be known as the "Building Code of the
Village of Edgar" and will be referred to in this Chapter as "this Code," "this
Chapter" or "this Ordinance."
   (b)   Purpose. This Chapter provides certain minimum standards, provisions
and requirements for safe and stable design, methods of construction and uses
of materials in buildings and/or structures hereafter erected, constructed,
enlarged, altered, repaired, moved, converted to other uses or demolished and
regulates the equipment, maintenance, use and occupancy of all such buildings
and/or structures. Its purpose is to protect and foster the health, safety and
well-being of persons occupying or using such buildings and the general public.
   (c)   Scope; Applicability; Statutory Authority.
      (1)   Scope.  New buildings hereafter erected in, or any building
hereafter moved within or into the Village of Edgar shall conform to all the
requirements of this Chapter except as they are herein specifically exempted
from part or all of its provisions. Any alteration, enlargement or demolition
of an existing building and any installation therein of electrical, gas,
heating, plumbing or ventilating equipment which affects the health or safety
of the users thereof or any other persons is a "new building" to the extent of
such change. The provisions of this Chapter supplement the laws of the State of
Wisconsin pertaining to construction and use and the Zoning Code of the Village
of Edgar and amendments thereto to the date this Chapter was adopted and in no
way supersede or nullify such laws and the said Zoning Code.
      (2)   Applicability. This Building Code applies to all dwellings,
commercial buildings/structures, swimming pools, garages, structures, buildings
and accessory buildings. Not included are children's play structures,
reroofing, and agricultural buildings on agricultural zoned parcels.
      (3)   Statutory Authority. These regulations are adopted under the
authority granted by Sec. 101.65, Wis. Stats.
   (d)   Village Building Code Positions. The Village Board may elect that this
Chapter be administered by two (2) different designated authorities
representing the Village of Edgar:
      (1)   UDC Administration. Construction requiring inspection by a
Wisconsin Uniform Dwelling Code (UDC) certified building inspector shall be
inspected by by a UDC-Certified Building Inspector or inspection firm employed
by the Village of Edgar.
      (2)   Non-UDC Administration. With construction not required by state law
or this Chapter to be inspected by a UDC-certified building inspector, the
Village elects that all permits shall be issued by the UDC Building Inspector;
the Village may elect in the future to have non-UDC permits issued by a
designated non-certified Village official or employee.
Sec. 15-1-2 Building Permits and Inspection.
   (a)   Permit Required.
      (1)   General Permit Requirements. No building of any kind shall be moved
within or into the Village of Edgar and no new building or structure, or any
part thereof, shall hereafter be erected, or ground broken for the same, or
enlarged, altered, moved, demolished, razed or used within the Village, except
as herein provided, until a permit therefor shall first have been obtained by
the owner, or his/her authorized agent, from the Village, with necessary plan
review and inspections provided by the UDC Building Inspector, in the case of
UDC projects requiring plan review and inspections. Lesser projects requiring
issuance of just a non-UDC administrative building permit to assist in
documenting changes to properties and their valuations may be issued by a
designated Village official or employee if the Village Board authorizes such
practice.
      (2)   Residential Administrative Building Permit. If the Village Board
elects, per Section 15-1-l(d), to have a Village official or employee other
than a UDC-Certified Building Inspector issue administrative building permits
for non-UDC projects, an administr- ative building permit may be issued and is
required for any non-structural work with a value of One Thousand Dollars
($1,000.00 - market value of material and labor) or more unless a Uniform
Dwelling Code (UDC) building permit is issued.
      (3)   Residential UDC Building Permit. A UDC building permit with
inspections is required if a person structurally alters a residential building.
If a person moves a building within or into the Village of Edgar, or builds,
installs, or assembles a building within the scope of this Chapter, he/she
shall first obtain a building permit for such work from the UDC Certified
Building Inspector. Any structural changes or major changes to mechanical
systems that involve extensions of such systems shall require permits. An
electric service upgrade or installation of a new electrical panel requires a
permit, regardless of cost.
      (4)   Commercial Building Permit. A building permit is required for all
new construction, alterations or additions of commercial buildings or building
mechanical systems.
   (b)   Exceptions to Building Permit Requirements.
      (1)   Minor Repairs. The UDC Certified Building Inspector may authorize
minor repairs or alterations without a permit that do not change the occupancy,
use, area, structural strength, room arrangement, fire protection, access to or
efficiency of any existing stairways or exits, light or ventilation of the
building.
      (2)   Cabinetry. Repair, refinishing or replacement of interior surfaces
and installation of cabinetry shall be exempt from permit requirments.
      (3)   Restoration. Restoration or repair of an installation to its
previous Code-compliant condition as determined by the UDC Certified Building
Inspector is exempt from permit requirements.
      (4)   Alterations and Repairs. The following provisions shall apply to
buildings altered or repaired:
         a.   Alterations. When not in conflict with any regulations,
alterations to any existing building or structure accommodating a legal
occupancy and use but of substandard type of construction, which involves
either beams, girders, columns, bearing or other walls, room, heating and air
condition systems, arrangement, light and ventilation, changes in location of
exit stairways or exits, or any or all of the above, then such existing
construction shall be made to conform to the minimum requirements of this
Chapter applicable to such occupancy and use and given type of construction.
         b.   Repairs. Repairs for purposes of maintenance, or replacements in
any existing building or structure which do not involve the structural portions
of the building or structure or which do not affect room arrangement, light and
ventilation, access to or efficiency of any exist stairways, or exits, fire
protection, or exterior aesthetic appearance and which do not increase a given
occupancy or use, shall be deemed minor repairs.
   (c)   Application; Appropriate Application/Inspection Official. Application
for a building permit shall be made in writing upon a form furnished by the
Village or designee and shall state the name and address of the owner of the
land and also the owner of the building if different, contact information
(email address and fax, mailing address, telephone and cellphone numbers), the
legal description of the land upon which the building is to be located, the
name and address of the designer, the use to which said building is to be put
and such other information as the Building Inspector or designee may require.
Applications for new one- and two-family residences and additions to existing
structures shall be submitted to the UDC-certified Building Inspector or
designee. All other applications for building permits shall be to the Village's
Non-UDC designated official or employee.
   (d)   Submission of Plans - UDC Projects.
      (1)   Basic Application Information. Two (2) sets of building plans shall
be submitted to the UDC Certified Building Inspector or designee for any work
which expands or structurally alters a building, involves a new building, or as
required by the Building Inspector. If a new building or building addition is
proposed, then a plot plan showing such proposed work and existing buildings
and property lines shall be submitted. A third set of plans may be requested at
the discretion of the UDC Certified Building Inspector for the Village
Assessor. The UDC Certified Building Inspector may require the owner or
contractor to submit plans for any construction, building moving, or demolition
project when the UDC Certified Building Inspector determines that it is
necessary to review such plans to assure that the proposed project will comply
with all applicable codes.
      (2)   Erosion Control Plan. A construction erosion control plan setting
forth proposed information and procedures needed for control of soil erosion,
surface water runoff and sediment disposition at the building site shall also
be filed if deemed necessary for the project per state and local regulations.
      (3)   Scale. Plans, specifications and plot plans shall be drawn to a
minimum scale of one-quarter (1/4) inch to one (1) foot [fireplace details to
three-quarters (3/4) inch to one (1) foot].

approval as provided in this Chapter. The second set shall be filed in the
office of the UDC Certified Building Inspector. Plans for buildings involving
the State (Commercial) Building Code shall bear the stamp of approval of the
Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services (SPS). One (I) plan
shall be submitted which shall remain on file in the office of the UDC
Certified Building Inspector. All plans and specifications shall be signed by
the designer.
      (5)   Additional UDC Requirements.  Plans for all new one (1) and two (2)
family dwellings shall comply with the provisions of Chapter SPS 320.09, Wis.
Adm. Code.
      (6)   Foundation Elevation and Location Confirmation. The UDC Certified
Building Inspector may issue its preliminary building permit as a result of the
above submittals, subject, however, to the owner confirming the actual
elevations and location of the foundation once it is installed. No further
construction work can be completed on the new building until submission of a
recertification of the foundation elevations and location, confirming that the
foundation elevations and location conform with the original permit and
application regulations.
   (e)   Permit Issuance - New Non-UDC Projects. If the UDC Certified Building
Inspector, or Village designee in the case of non-UDC projects, determines that
the building will comply with all applicable ordinances of the Village and all
applicable laws and orders of the State of Wisconsin, the UDC Certified
Building Inspector, or non-UDC administrative official in his/her authority
area, may issue a building permit which shall state the use to which said
building is to be put, which shall be kept and displayed at the site of the
proposed building. After being approved, the plans and specifications shall not
be altered in any respect which involves any of the above-mentioned ordinances,
laws or orders, or which involves the safety of the building or the occupants,
except with the written consent of the UDC Certified Building Inspector or or
non-UDC designee, as appropriate.
[Note: This Subsection only becomes applicable if the Village Board elects to
have a non- UDC certified official issue administrative building permits per
Sections
15-1-1 and
15-1-2.]
   (f)   Approval of Plans; Permit Issuance for UDC Projects.
      (1)   Preliminary Foundation Permit. The UDC Certified Building Inspector
shall issue the requested building permit for UDC projects as a preliminary
permit to construct the foundation if the owner or contractor demonstrates that
all state, county and local submission requirements are satisfied. If a permit
card is issued, it shall be posted at the job site in a visible location from
the street. A preliminary permit is valid for six (6) months. A preliminary
permit may be extended for a specific time frame upon the UDC Certified
Building Inspector's approval and payment of appropriate fees.
      (2)   Recertification; Final Building Permit Issuance. Upon completion of
the foundation, the owner or contractor shall submit data identifying setbacks
and elevations. Said information shall be submitted to the UDC Certified
Building Inspector who shall review it to determine that local setback and
elevation requirements are satisfied. If the existing foundation conforms to
the local requirements, a final building permit shall be issued and it shall be
posted at the job site in a visible location from the street. A final building
permit may be extended for a specific time frame upon the UDC Certified
Building Inspector's approval and payment of appropriate fees.
      (3)   Right of Inspection Access. By accepting a permit, the applicant,
owner or contractor grants the UDC Certified Building Inspector the right of
access to the real estate on which the permitted construction or demolition
will occur.
      (4)   Building Permits Conditioned Upon Compliance with Codes. All
permits are issued conditionally on the condition that the owner and/or
contractor(s) shall conform to the requirements of all applicable building
codes, zoning ordinances and setback requirements on constructing the building.
After being approved, the plans and specifications shall not be altered in any
respect which involves any of the above- mentioned ordinances, laws or orders,
or which involves the safety of the building or the occupants.
      (5)   Partial Building Permit. In case adequate plans are presented for
only a part of a UDC-classified building, the UDC Certified Building Inspector,
at his/her discretion, may issue a permit for only that part of the building
before receiving the plans and specifications for the entire building.
   (g)   Dedicated Street and Approved Land Division Required.  No building
permit shall be issued unless the property on which the building is proposed to
be built abuts a street that has been dedicated for street purposes. No
building permits shall be issued until the land division and required
improvements are accepted by the Village Board, unless the Village Board has
authorized the use of a private road.
   (h)   Utilities Required.
      (1)   Residential Buildings. No building permit shall be issued for the
construction of any residential building until sewer, water, grading and
graveling are installed in the streets necessary to service the property for
which the permit is required and a receipt for payment of electrical connection
is presented to the UDC Certified Building Inspector.
      (2)   Non-Residential Buildings. No building permit shall be issued for
the construction of any non-agricultural building other than residential until
contracts have been let for the installation of sewer, water, grading and

replacement of public trees, as determined by the Village of Edgar, shall be
paid to the UDC Building Inspector or Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer
prior to issuance of the moving permit.
      (3)   Issuance of moving permit shall further be conditioned on approval
of the moving route by the Village Board.
   (b)   Moving Damaged Buildings. No building shall be repaired, altered or
moved within or into the Village of Edgar that has deteriorated or has been
damaged by any cause (including such moving and separation from its foundation
and service connections in case of moved buildings) or which is unsafe for
human habitation or poses a threat to neighboring properties, and no permit
shall be granted to repair, alter or move such building within or into the
Village of Edgar. Furthermore, if the equalized assessed value of the building
is not within twenty percent (20%) of the surrounding buildings where the
building is proposed to be moved to, no permit shall be granted unless the
building is improved to be within the twenty percent (20%). Such determination
shall be made by the Building Inspector, who may seek a recommendation from the
Village Assessor.
   (c)   Continuous Movement. The movement of buildings shall be a continuous
operation during all the hours of the day and at night, until such movement is
fully completed. All such operations shall be performed with the least possible
obstruction to thoroughfares. No building shall be allowed to remain overnight
upon any street crossing or intersection or so near thereto as to prevent easy
access to any fire hydrant or any other public facility. Lights shall be kept
in conspicuous places at each end of the building during the night.
   (d)   Street Repair. Every person receiving a permit to move a building
shall, within one (1) day after said building reaches its destination, report
that fact to the Village Administrator- Clerk-Treasurer, who shall direct
Public Works Department personnel to inspect the streets, highways and curbs
and gutters over which said building has been moved and ascertain their
condition. If the removal of said building has caused any damage to any street
or highway, the person to whom the permit was issued shall forthwith place them
in as good repair as they were before the permit was granted. On the failure of
the said permittee to do so within ten (10) days thereafter to the satisfaction
of the Village Board, the Village shall repair the damage done to such streets
and hold the person obtaining such permit and the sureties on his/her bond
responsible for the payment of same.
   (e)   Conformance with Code. No permit shall be issued to move a building
within or into the Village of Edgar and to establish it upon a location within
the Village until the Building Inspector has made an investigation of such
building at the location from which it is to be moved and is satisfied from
such investigation that said building is in a sound and stable condition and of
such construction that it will meet the requirements of this Building Code in
all respects. A complete plan of all further repairs, improvements and
remodeling with reference to such building shall be submitted to the Building
Inspector, and he/she shall make a finding of fact to the effect that all such
repairs, improvements and remodeling are in conformity with the requirements of
this Building Code and that, when the same are completed, the building as such
will so comply with said Building Code. In the event a building is to be moved
from the Village of Edgar to some point outside the boundaries thereof, the
provisions with respect to the furnishing of plans and specifications for
proposed alterations to such building may be disregarded.
   (f)   Bond or Security Deposit.
      (1)   Before a permit is issued to move any building over any public way
in the Village, the party applying therefor shall provide a bond or security
deposit to the Village of Edgar in a sum to be fixed by the Building Inspector
and which shall not be less than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), said bond
to be executed by a corporate surety or two (2) personal sureties to be
approved by the Village of Edgar or designated agent conditioned upon, among
other things, the indemnification to the Village for any costs or expenses
incurred by it in connection with any claims for damages to any persons or
property, and the payment of any judgment together with the costs and expenses
incurred by the Village in connection therewith arising out of the removal of
the building for which the permit is issued.
      (2)   Unless the Building Inspector, upon investigation, shall find it to
be a fact that the excavation exposed by the removal of such building from its
foundation shall not be so close to a public thoroughfare as to permit the
accidental falling therein of travelers or the location, nature and physical
characteristics of the premises and the exposed excavation, such as to make
intrusion upon the premises and the falling into such excavation of children
under twelve (12) years of age unlikely, the bond required by Subsection (f)(l)
shall be further conditioned upon the permittee erecting adequate barriers and
within forty-eight (48) hours, filling in such excavation or adopting and
employing such other means, devices or methods approved by the UDC Building
Inspector or designated Village official or employee and reasonably adopted or
calculated to prevent the occurrences set forth herein.
   (g)   Insurance. The Village shall require, in addition to said bond above
indicated, public liability insurance covering injury to one (1) person in the
sum of not less than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) and for one
(1) accident, aggregate not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000),
together with property damage insurance in a sum not less than Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00), or such other coverage as deemed necessary. The
Village of Edgar shall be an additional named insured.
   (h)   Village Board Approval.
      (1)   No such permit shall be issued unless it has been found as a fact
by the Village Board by at least a majority vote, after an examination of the
application for the permit which shall include exterior elevations of the
building and accurate photographs of all sides and views of the same and in
case it is proposed to alter the exterior of said building, plans and
specifications of such proposed alterations and after a view of the building
proposed to be moved and of the site at which it is to be located, that the
exterior architectural appeal and functional plans of the building to be moved
or moved and altered, will not be so at variance with either the exterior
architectural appeal and functional plan of the buildings already constructed
or in the course of construction in the immediate neighborhood or in the
character of the applicable district established by the zoning ordinances of
the Village or any ordinance amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto, as to
cause a substantial depreciation of the property values of said neighborhood
within said applicable district. In case the applicant proposed to alter the
exterior of said building after moving the same, he/she shall submit, with his/
her application papers, complete plans and specifications for the proposed
alterations. Before a permit shall be issued for a building to be moved and
altered, the applicant shall give a cash bond to the Village Board, which shall
not be less than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) to be executed in the
manner provided in subsection hereof to the effect that he/she will, within a
time to be set by the Village Board, complete the proposed exterior alterations
to said building in the manner set forth in his/her plans and specifications.
This bond shall be in addition to any other bond or surety which may be
required by other applicable ordinances of the Village of Edgar. No occupancy
permit shall be issued for said building until the exterior alterations
proposed to be made have been completed.
      (2)   Upon application being made to the Building Inspector, he/she shall
request a meeting of the Village Board to consider application for moving
permits which he/she has found comply, in all respects, with all other
ordinances of the Village. The Village of Edgar may, if it desires, hear the
applicant for the moving permit in question and/or the owner of the lot on
which it is proposed to locate the building in question, together with any
other persons, either residents or property owners, desiring to be heard, give
such notice of hearing as they may deem sufficient. Such hearing may be
adjourned for a reasonable length of time and within forty-eight (48) hours
after the close of the hearing, the Village Board shall, in writing, make or
refuse to make the finding required by Subsection (h)(l) hereof and file it in
the office of Village Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer who shall send a copy of it
to the Building Inspector.

Handbook, published by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, may be
selected, installed, maintained and remain in place until the site is
stabilized to meet the performance standards specified Section
15-2-6.
   (d)   Maintenance of Control Procedures.
      (1)   General. During the period of construction at a site, all erosion
control procedures necessary to meet the performance standards of this Section
shall be properly implemented, installed and maintained by the building permit
applicant or subsequent landowner. If erosion occurs after building
construction activities have ceased, some or all of the erosion control
procedures shall be maintained until the site has been stabilized.
      (2)   Exceptions and Clarification. The maintenance procedures and
inspection sequences with Chapter 3, Wisconsin Construction Site Best
Management Practices Handbook, are not adopted as a part of this Chaper.
   (e)   Dismantling of Erosion Control Procedures. Except for permanent
erosion control systems, the owner shall be responsible for dismantling and
removing erosion control procedures once the soil on the site is stabilized.
Sec. 15-2-8    Performance Standards for Land Disturbing Construction Sites
(Not for Buildings).
   (a)   Plan Requirement. The responsible party shall implement a written
erosion and sediment control plan for each construction site, developed in
accordance with Section
15-2-10, that incorporates the requirements of this Section.
   (b)   Erosion and Other Pollutant Control Requirements. The plan required
under Subsection (a) shall include the following:
      (1)   BMPs that, by design, achieve to the maximum extent practicable, a
reduction of eighty percent (80%) of the sediment load carried in runoff, on an
average annual basis, as compared with no sediment or BMPs until the
construction site has undergone final stabilization. No person shall be
required to exceed an eighty percent (80%) sediment reduction to meet the
requirements of this Subsection. Erosion and sediment controls may be used
alone or in combination to meet the requirements of this Subsection. Credit
toward meeting the sediment reduction shall be given for limiting the duration
or area, or both, of land disturbing construction activity, or other
appropriate mechanism.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Subsection (b)(1) above, if BMPs cannot be designed
and implemented to reduce the sediment load by eighty percent (80%), on an
average annual basis, the plan shall include a written and site-specific
explanation as to why the eighty percent (80%) reduction goal is not attainable
and the sediment load shall be reduced to the maximum extent practicable.
      (3)   Where appropriate, the plan shall include sediment controls to do
all of the following to the maximum extent practicable:
         a.   Prevent tracking of sediment from the construction site onto
roads and other paved surfaces.
         b.   Prevent the discharge of sediment as part of site de-watering.
         c.   Protect the separate storm drain inlet structure from receiving
sediment.
      (4)   The use, storage and disposal of chemicals, cement and other
compounds and materials used on the construction site shall be managed during
the construction period, to prevent their entrance beyond the construction site
or into waters of the state. However, projects that require the placement of
these materials in waters of the state, such as constructing bridge footings or
BMP installations, are not prohibited by this Subsection.
   (c)   Location. The BMPs used to comply with this Section shall be located
to prevent runoff entering properties owned by others, Village stormwater
conveyance systems or waters of the state.
   (d)   Alternate Requirements. The Village Engineer may establish stormwater
management requirements more stringent than those set forth in this Section if
the Village Engineer determines that an added level of protection is needed for
sensitive resources.
Sec. 15-2-9 Permitting Requirements, Procedures and Fees.

property for which the relief is sought and are not applicable generally to
other property;
      (3)   Because of the location or conditions affecting the specific
property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as
distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these
regulations is carried out;
      (4)   The relief sought will not materially alter the provisions of any
existing regional stormwater management plan except that this document may be
amended in the manner prescribed by law; and
      (5)   The granting of the exception or waiver will not result in a
violation of State or Federal laws or permits.
   (b)   Conditions. In approving exceptions or waivers, the Village Engineer
may require such conditions as will in his/her judgment secure substantially
the purposes described in this Chapter and accompanying written stormwater
management and erosion control requirements.
   (c)   Procedures. A petition for an exception or waiver shall be submitted
in writing by the responsible party at the time when the development is filed

Sec. 15-3-1   Authority.
   (a)   Statutory Authority. This Chapter was originally adopted under the
authority granted by Sec. 61.354, Wis. Stats. This Chapter supersedes all
provisions of ordinance(s) previously enacted under Sec. 61.35, Wis. Stats.,
that relate to stormwater management regulations. Except as otherwise specified
in Sec. 61.354, Wis. Stats., Sec. 61.35, Wis. Stats., applies to this Chapter
and to any amendments to this Chapter.
   (b)   Limitation on Other Regulations. The provisions of this Chapter are
deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the same governing
body.
   (c)   Administration. The Village of Edgar hereby designates the Village
Engineer to administer and enforce the provisions of this Chapter. Any powers
granted or duties imposed upon the Village Engineer may be delegated by the
Village Engineer to persons or entities acting in the beneficial interest of or
in the employ of the Village of Edgar.
   (d)   Applicability of Requirements. The requirements of this Chapter do not
pre-empt more stringent stormwater management requirements that may be imposed
by any of the following:
      (1)   Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules,
permits or approvals including those authorized under Secs. 281.16 and 283.33,
Wis. Stats.
      (2)   Targeted non-agricultural performance standards promulgated in
rules by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under NR 151.004, Wis.
Adm. Code.
Sec. 15-3-2 Findings of Fact.
The Village Board of the Village of Edgar finds that uncontrolled, post-
construction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the
health, safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public
enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled post-
construction runoff can:
   (a)   Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion,
increasing streambed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing
stream base flows and increasing stream temperatures.
   (b)   Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic
life, recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of
sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, bacteria, pathogens and
other urban pollutants.
   (c)   Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by
increasing pollutant loads.
   (d)   Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading.
   (e)   Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by
overtaxing storm sewers, drainage ways, and other minor drainage facilities.
   (f)   Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by
increasing major flood peaks and volumes.
   (g)   Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence
and levels of flooding.
Sec. 15-3-3 Purpose and Intent.
   (a)   Purpose. The general purpose of this Chapter is to establish long-
term, post-construction runoff management requirements that will diminish the
threats to public health, safety, welfare and the aquatic environment. Specific
purposes are to:
      (1)   Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions.
      (2)   Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater; prevent and
control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning
grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures
and land uses; preserve ground cover and scenic beauty; and promote sound
economic growth.
      (3)   Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage
facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; control
increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter; and prevent
conditions that endanger downstream property.
   (b)   Intent. It is the intent of the Village of Edgar that this Chapter
regulates post-construction stormwater discharges to waters of the state. This
Chapter may be applied on a site-by-site basis. The Village of Edgar
recognizes, however, that the preferred method of achieving the stormwater
performance standards set forth in this Chapter is through the preparation and
implementation of comprehensive, systems-level stormwater management plans that
cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and regional scale.
Such plans may prescribe regional stormwater devices, practices or systems, any
of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one (1) site prior to
discharge to waters of the state. Where such plans are in conformance with the
performance standards developed under Sec. 281.16, Wis. Stats., for regional
stormwater management measures and have been approved by the Village of Edgar,
it is the intent of this Chapter that the approved plan be used to identify
post-construction management measures acceptable for the community.
Sec. 15-3-4 Applicability and Jurisdiction.
   (a)   Applicability.
      (1)   Where not otherwise limited by law, this Chapter applies to land
development activity that results in one (1) or more acres of land disturbing
construction activity, unless the site is otherwise exempt under Subsection (a)
(2) below.
      (2)   A post-construction site that meets any of the criteria in this
Subsection is exempt from the requirements of this Chapter:
         a.   A redevelopment post-construction site with no net increase in
exposed parking lots, roads, rooftops, or other impervious areas.
         b.   A post-construction site with less than ten percent (10%)
connected impervious- ness based on complete development of the post-
construction site, provided the cumulative area of all parking lots and
rooftops is less than one (1) acre.
         c.   Nonpoint discharges from agricultural facilities and practices.
         d.   Nonpoint discharges from silviculture activities.
         e.   Routine maintenance for project sites under five (5) acres of
land disturbance if performed to maintain the original line and grade,
hydraulic capacity or original purpose of the facility.
         f.   Underground utility construction such as but not limited to
water, sewer and fiber optic lines. This exemption does not apply to the
construction of any above ground structures or lift stations associated with
utility construction.
      (3)   Notwithstanding the applicability requirements in Subsection (a)
(l), this Chapter applies to land development activity of any size that, in the
opinion of the Village Engineer or Building Inspector, is likely to result in
runoff that exceeds the safe capacity of the existing drainage facilities or
receiving body of water, that causes undue channel erosion, that increases
water pollution by scouring or the transportation of particulate matter or that
endangers property or public safety.
   (b)   Jurisdiction. This Chapter applies to post-construction sites within
the boundaries and jurisdiction of the Village of Edgar, as well as all lands
located within the extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction of the Village
of Edgar, even if plat approval is not involved.
   (c)   Exclusions. This Chapter is not applicable to activities conducted by
a state agency, as defined under Sec. 227.01(1), Wis. Stats., but also
including the Office of District Attorney, which is subject to the state plan
promulgated or a memorandum of understanding entered into under Sec. 281.33(2),
Wis. Stats.
Sec. 15-3-5 Definitions.
The following definitions shall be applicable in this Chapter:
   (a)   Definitions Established. The following definitions shall be applicable
in this Chapter:
      (1)   Administrative Authority. A governmental employee, or a regional

maintenance areas shall, to the maximum extent practicable, have BMPs designed,
installed and maintained to reduce petroleum within runoff, such that the
runoff that enters waters of the state contains no visible petroleum sheen.
      (3)   Peak Discharge.
         a.   By design, BMPs shall be employed to maintain or reduce the peak
runoff discharge rates, to the maximum extent practicable, as compared to pre-

methodology. The meanings of "hydrologic soil group" and "runoff curve number"
are as determined in TR-55. However, when pre-development land cover is
cropland, rather than using TR-55 values for cropland, the runoff curve numbers
in Table 1 shall be used:
 
Maximum Pre-Development Runoff Curve Numbers - Cropland
Hydrologic Soil Group A  B  C  D
Runoff Curve Number   56 70 79 83
 
         d.   Stormwater discharge from a newly developed site must have a
stable outlet capable of carrying the design flow at velocities that are non-

floodplain elevation of the area adjacent to the pond unless the entire 100-
year floodplain lies within the owner's property. This condition may be waived
if the owner obtains the legal right to increase flood elevations on all
properties where the flood plain is increased due to development activities.

24-hour design storm with a Type II distribution. Separate curve numbers for
pervious and impervious surfaces shall be used to calculate runoff volumes, and
not composite curve numbers as defined in TR-55. However, when designing
appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than two
percent (2%) of the project site is required as an effective infiltration area.
         c.   Pre-development condition shall be the same.
         d.   Before infiltrating runoff, pretreatment shall be required for
parking lot runoff and for runoff from new road construction in commercial,
industrial and institutional areas that will enter an infiltration system. The

         h.   Infiltration systems designed in accordance with this Subsection
shall, to the extent technically and economically feasible, minimize the level
of pollutants infiltrating to groundwater and shall maintain compliance with
the preventive action limit at a point of standards application in accordance
with NR 140, Wis. Adm. Code. However, if site specific information indicates

protective area, and where no impervious surface is present, adequate sod or
self-sustaining vegetative cover of seventy percent (70%) or greater shall be
established and maintained. The adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative
cover shall be sufficient to provide for bank stability, maintenance of fish
habitat and filtering of pollutants from upslope overland flow areas under
sheet flow conditions. Non-vegetative materials, such as rock riprap, may be
employed on the bank as necessary to prevent erosion, such as on steep slopes
or where high velocity flows occur.
            3.   Non-aggressive vegetative cover that is flood and drought
tolerant shall be used in seeding the protective areas whenever possible.
            4.   Best management practices such as filter strips, swales, or

not applicable to transportation facilities that are part of a larger common
plan of development or sale:
         a.   Applicability. Except as provided in Subsection (c)(7)b,
transportation facilities that use swales for runoff conveyance and pollutant
removal meet all of the requirements of this Section, if the swales are
designed to the maximum extent practicable to do all of the following:
            1.   Be vegetated. However, where appropriate, non-vegetative
measures may be employed to prevent erosion or provide for runoff treatment,
such as rock riprap stabilization or check dams.
            2.   Carry runoff through a swale for two hundred (200) feet or
more in length that is designed with a flow velocity no greater than 1.5 feet
per second for the peak flow generated using either a 2-year, 24-hour design
storm or a 2- year storm with a duration equal to the time of concentration as
appropriate. If a swale of two hundred (200) feet in length cannot be designed
with a flow velocity of 1.5 feet per second or less, then the flow velocity
shall be reduced to the maximum extent practicable.
         b.   Exemptions. The Village Engineer may, consistent with water
quality standards, require other provisions of this Section be met on a
transportation facility with an average daily travel of vehicles greater than
two thousand five hundred (2,500) and where the initial surface water of the
state that the runoff directly enters is any of the following:
            1.   An outstanding resource water.

combinations thereof, which are so dilapidated, neglected, unsafe, dangerous,
unhygienic, inadequately maintained or lacking in basic equipment or
facilities, light, ventilation, and heating so as to be detrimental to the
health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the Village of Edgar, or
to the economic values of area properties.
      (3)   The establishment and subsequent enforcement of this Chapter is
deemed necessary and essential to protecting, preserving and promoting the
public interest. This Chapter is adopted pursuant to the general police powers
conferred on municipalities by the Wisconsin Statutes, and the provisions of
this Chapter shall be reasonably and liberally construed to be an exercise of
those powers intended to maintain a pleasant, safe and healthful environment
within the Village of Edgar.
   (b)   Scope; Conflict of Regulations.

Edgar, with certain provisions specifically applicable to residential dwellings
and dwelling units, including, but not limited to, rental dwelling units.
      (2)   The provisions of this Chapter and the standards herein are minimum
standards. In situations where a provision of this Chapter is in conflict with
another provision of this Code of Ordinances or a state regulation, the
provision which establishes the higher or more restrictive standard for the
protection of the public health, safety and welfare shall take precedence and
be complied with.
      (3)   The provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to the construction
of new buildings, which are subject to other local and state regulations.
   (c)   Validity of Prior Regulations. Equipment, systems, and safeguards
required by a previous state regulation, local ordinance or code effective when
a structure was constructed or lawfully altered shall be maintained in good
repair and working order. The requirements of this Chapter are not intended to
provide the basis for removal or abrogation of fire protection or safety
systems in good repair and working order.
   (d)   Historic Buildings. The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to
structures designated and as allowed as federal, state or municipal government-
designated historic structures. Howe-ver, any construction work performed on

rental dwelling units to assist in responding to complaints regarding unsafe or
unsanitary conditions for tenants. The Village Board finds that a significant
percentage of code complaints, violations and compliance actions occur involve
residential rental dwelling units and that the conditions which are found to
exist at such dwelling units adversely affect the neighborhoods in which they
are located and the health and safety of tenants. This Section is adopted to
help facilitate communications with the owners of residential rental dwelling
units and secure cooperation with making appropriate repairs. Village officials
and emergency responders can utilize contact information gathered through
registration to contact property owners or landlords in case of an emergency
with the rental property.

the Village of Edgar shall record the residential contact information with the
Village Administrator by January 1, 2018 for rental units existing on the
effective date of this Chapter, or within thirty (30) days of full or partial
