one copy of which shall be maintained in the office of the city clerk,
certified as to correctness and available for inspection at any and all times
that said office is regularly open.
Section 3:   All ordinances of a general nature included in this official city
code shall be considered as a continuation of said ordinance provision and the
fact that some provisions have been deliberately eliminated by the governing
body shall not serve to cause any interruption in the continuous effectiveness
of ordinances included in said official city code. All ordinances of a special
nature, such as tax levy ordinances, bond ordinances, franchises, vacating
ordinances and annexation ordinances shall continue in full force and effect
unless specifically repealed or amended by a provision of the city code. Such
ordinances are not intended to be included in the official city code.

misrepresented thereby.

   A.   For purposes of this chapter, a historic structure, historic site or
historic district designation may be placed on any site, natural or improved,
including any building, improvement or structure located thereon, or any area
of particular historic, architectural, archeological or cultural significance
to the city such as historic structures, sites or districts which:

   B.   The commission may adopt specific operating guidelines for historic
structure, historic site and historic district designation providing such are
in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. (1975 Code Ch. 21 § XXXII)
2-8-5: POWERS AND DUTIES:
   A.   Designation: The commission shall have the power, subject to section
2-8-6 of this chapter, to designate historic structures, historic sites and
historic districts within the city limits. Such designations shall be made
based on section
2-8-4 of this chapter. Once designated, such historic structures, sites and
districts shall be subject to all the provisions of this chapter.
   B.   Regulation Of Construction, Reconstruction, Alteration And Demolition:
      1.   No owner or person in charge of a historic structure, historic site
or structure within a historic district shall reconstruct, alter or demolish
all or any part of the exterior of such property or construct any improvement
upon such designated property or properties or cause or permit any such work to
be performed upon such property or demolish such property unless a certificate
of appropriateness has been granted by the commission. Unless such certificate
has been granted by the commission, the building inspector shall not issue a
permit for any such work.
      2.   Upon filing of any application for a certificate of appropriateness
with the commission, the commission shall approve the application unless:
         a.   In the case of a designated historic structure or historic site,
the proposed work would detrimentally change, destroy or adversely affect any
exterior architectural feature of the improvement or site upon which said work
is to be done;
         b.   In the case of the construction of a new improvement upon a
historic site, or within a historic district, the exterior of such improvement
would adversely affect or not harmonize with the external appearance of other
neighboring improvements on such site or within the district;
         c.   In the case of any property located in a historic district, the
proposed construction, reconstruction, exterior alteration or demolition does
not conform to the purpose and intent of this chapter and to the objectives and
design criteria of the historic preservation plan for said district;
         d.   The building or structure is of such architectural or historical
significance that its demolition would be detrimental to the public interest
and contrary to the general welfare of the people of the city and state;
         e.   The building or structure is of such old and unusual or uncommon
design, texture and/or material that it could not be reproduced without great
difficulty and/or expense;
         f.   In the case of a request for a demolition permit, the denial of
the permit would result in the loss of all reasonable and beneficial use of or
return from the property; or
         g.   In the case of a request for the demolition of a deteriorated
building or structure, any hardship or difficulty claimed by the owner is self-
created or is the result of any failure to maintain the property in good
repair.
      3.   In addition, in determining whether to issue a certificate of
appropriateness, the commission shall consider and may give decisive weight to
any or all of the following standards:
         a.   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in
a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment.
         b.   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
         c.   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its
time, place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical
development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from
other buildings, shall not be undertaken.
         d.   Most properties change over time; those changes that have
acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and
preserved.
         e.   Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.
         f.   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or
pictorial evidence.
         g.   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
         h.   Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall
be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
         i.   New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment.
         j.   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
         k.   Historic district design review guidelines established by the
commission that are not inconsistent with the standards in this subsection or
subsection 2-8-6B3 of this chapter.
      4.   If the commission determines that the application for a certificate
of appropriateness and the proposed changes are consistent with the character
and features of the property or district, and with the above guidelines, it
shall issue the certificate of appropriateness. Upon the issuance of such
certificate, the building permit shall then be issued by the building
inspector. The commission shall make this decision within forty five (45) days
of the filing of the application.
      5.   Agencies of the city and all public utility and transportation
companies undertaking projects affecting historic structures, historic sites or
historic districts, shall be required to obtain a certificate of
appropriateness prior to initiating any changes in the character of street
paving, sidewalks, utility installations, lighting, walls, fences, structures
and buildings on property, easements or streets owned or franchised by the
city.
      6.   The issuance of a certificate of appropriateness shall not relieve
the applicant from obtaining other permits and approvals required by the city.
A building permit or other municipal permit shall be invalid if it is obtained
without the presentation of the certificate of appropriateness required for the
proposed work. Insofar as they are applicable to a historic structure, historic
site or improvement in a historic district designated under this chapter, any
provision of the plumbing code, electrical code, or building or housing code of
the city shall apply, unless waived by the appropriate state or city officials.
The commission may support or propose such waivers before the appropriate state
or city appeals body.
      7.   Compliance with certificates of appropriateness shall be started
within twelve (12) months after the issuance of the certificate and the work
shall conform to the provisions of the certificate. The city may inspect the
work during and after construction in order to assure compliance. Failure to
comply with a certificate of appropriateness or failure to obtain a certificate
of appropriateness shall be a violation of this chapter. In addition to other
penalties and remedies, the city shall issue a stop work order, and all work
shall cease on the designated property. No additional work shall be undertaken
as long as such stop work order shall continue in effect.
      8.   Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be undertaken without a
certificate of appropriateness; provided, that the work involves repairs to
existing features of a historic structure or site or the replacement of
elements of a structure with pieces identical in appearance; and provided, that
the work does not change the exterior appearance of the structure or site and
does not require the issuance of a building permit.
   C.   Appeals: Should the commission fail to issue a certificate of
appropriateness due to the failure of the proposal to conform to the
guidelines, the applicant may appeal such decision to the common council within
thirty (30) days. In addition, if the commission fails to issue a certificate
of appropriateness, the commission shall, with the cooperation of the
applicant, work with the applicant in an attempt to obtain a certificate of
appropriateness within the guidelines of this chapter.
   D.   Recognition Of Historic Structures, Sites And Districts: At such time
as a historic structure, site or district has been properly designated, the
commission may cause to be prepared and erected on such property, at city
expense, a suitable plaque declaring that such property is a historic
structure, site or district. Such plaque shall be so placed as to be easily
visible to passing pedestrians. The plaque shall state the accepted name of the
historic property, the date of its construction, and other information deemed
proper by the commission.
   E.   Sale Of Historic Structures And Historic Sites: Any party who is listed
as the owner of record of a historic structure or historic site at the time of
its designation, who can demonstrate to the commission that by virtue of such
designation he is unable to find a buyer willing to preserve such historic
structure or historic site, even though he has made reasonable attempts in good
faith to find and attract such a buyer, may petition the commission for a
rescission of its designation. Following the filing of such petition with the
secretary of the commission:
      1.   The owner and the commission shall work together in good faith to
locate a buyer for the subject property who is willing to abide by its
designation.
      2.   If, at the end of a period not exceeding six (6) months from the
date of such petition, no such buyer can be found, and, if the owner still
desires to obtain such rescission, the commission shall rescind its designation
of the subject property.
      3.   In the event of such rescission, the commission shall notify the
city clerk, the building inspector and the city assessor of same, and shall
cause the same to be recorded, at its own expense, in the office of the Dunn
County register of deeds.
      4.   Following any such rescission, the commission may not redesignate
the subject property a historic structure or historic site for a period of not
less than five (5) years following the date of the rescission.
   F.   Other Duties: In addition to those duties already specified in this
section, the commission shall:
      1.   Work for the continuing education of the citizens about the
historical heritage of this city and the historic properties designated under
the provisions of this chapter.
      2.   Cooperate with the state of Wisconsin historic preservation officer
and the state historic preservation review board in attempting to include such
properties hereunder designated as historic structures, historic sites or
historic districts in the National Register of Historic Places and the State
Register of Historic Places.
      3.   As it deems advisable, receive and solicit funds for the purpose of
historic preservation in the city. Such funds shall be placed in a special city
account for such purposes. (1975 Code Ch. 21 § XXXII)

expert witnesses and shall have the power to subpoena such witnesses and
records as it deems necessary.
      4.   Within thirty (30) days of the close of the public hearing, the
commission shall approve or reject the proposed designation. In making its
designation, the commission shall find that the subject property meets at least
one of the criteria described at section
2-8-4 of this chapter.
      5.   Following the action of the commission, the city clerk shall cause
the designation to be recorded, at city expense, in the Dunn County register of

   B.   Creation Of Historic Districts:
      1.   For preservation purposes, the commission may, after notice and
public hearing, designate geographically defined areas within the city which
have particular historic, architectural or cultural significance as historic

of a historic district, the commission shall find that the subject area meets
at least one of the criteria referred to at section

         a.   All new structures shall be constructed to a height visually
compatible with the buildings and environment with which they are visually
related.
         b.   The gross volume of any new structure shall be visually
compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually
related.
         c.   In the street elevation(s) of a building, the proportion between
the width and height in the facade(s) should be visually compatible with the
buildings and environment with which it is visually related.
         d.   The proportions and relationships between doors and windows in
the street facade should be visually compatible with the buildings and
environment with which it is visually related.
         e.   The rhythm of solids to voids, created by openings in the facade,
should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it
is visually related.
         f.   The existing rhythm created by existing building masses and
spaces between them should be preserved.
         g.   The materials used in the final facade should be visually
compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually
related.
         h.   The texture inherent in the facade should be visually compatible
with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related.
         i.   Colors and patterns used on the facade (especially trim) should

is visually related.
         l.   All street facade(s) should blend with other buildings via
directional expression. When adjacent buildings have a dominant horizontal or
vertical expression, this expression should be carried over and reflected.
         m.   Architectural elements should be incorporated as necessary to
relate the new with the old and to preserve and enhance the inherent
characteristics of the area.

council and mayor as representative of all city departments. Each such person,
department or board shall respond to the commission within thirty (30) days of
notification with its comments, if any, on the proposed action.

historic structure, historic site or historic district, the regulation of
construction, reconstruction or exterior alteration or the regulation of
demolition may be initiated by filing a petition to appeal, specifying the
grounds for such an appeal with the city clerk within thirty (30) days of the
date on which the final decision of the commission is made. The city clerk

an opportunity for individuals to readily transfer stolen property to those
businesses. The common council also finds that consumer protection regulation
is warranted in transactions involving these businesses. The common council
further finds that pawnshops have outgrown the city's current ability to
effectively or efficiently identify criminal activity related to them. The
purpose of this chapter is to prevent pawnshops from being used to facilitate
the commission of crimes and to assure that they comply with basic consumer
protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety, and general
welfare of the citizens, and pursuant to the authority granted by section
134.71, Wisconsin statutes.
   B.   This chapter implements and establishes the required use of the
Automated Pawn System (APS) to help the police department better regulate
current and future pawnshops to decrease and stabilize costs associated with
the regulation of pawnshops, and to increase identification of criminal
activities in pawnshops through the timely collection and sharing of
transaction information. (Ord. 2007-02, 1-15-2007)

3-15-1: INTENT:
   A.   The city, pursuant to applicable federal and state law, is authorized
to grant one or more nonexclusive franchises to construct, operate, maintain,
and reconstruct cable television systems within the city limits. Unless
otherwise permitted by applicable law, this franchise will not extend to
services beyond "cable service", as defined herein, such as telephone service
or other telecommunications services. A franchisee does not waive its right to
offer telephone service or other telecommunications services subject to
applicable local, state, or federal law.
   B.   The common council of Menomonie finds that the development of cable
television systems has the potential of having great benefit and impact upon
the residents of Menomonie. Because of the complex and rapidly changing
technology associated with cable television, the common council further finds
that the public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by
establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the city or such
persons the city will designate. It is the intent of this chapter and
subsequent amendments to provide for and specify the means to obtain the best
possible cable service for the public, and any franchises issued pursuant to
this chapter will be deemed to include this finding as an integral part
thereof.
   C.   The city will not discriminate in awarding franchises pursuant to this
chapter. Entities which request a franchise to provide substantially similar
services to substantially similar groups of city residents on substantially
similar terms will receive substantially similar franchises. The terms and
conditions of any additional franchise will be no less burdensome nor more
favorable than those contained in any other franchise, based upon a review of
the provisions of each franchise as a whole, provided that nothing herein shall
be construed as requiring the use of identical terms or conditions.
   D.   This chapter will be known as the CABLE TELEVISION ORDINANCE. (1975

made on or before the dates specified above, franchisee will pay as additional

equal to the prime lending rate, plus one and one-half percent (11/2%), during
the period for which payment was due and unpaid.
   F.   Each franchisee will file with the city quarterly reports of gross
revenues certified as correct by the franchisee and prepared in a form

cable system to prevent the city from purchasing same, as provided for herein;

existed, the city will notify the franchisee, in writing, setting forth the
nature and facts of such noncompliance. If, within the thirty (30) days
following such written notification, the franchisee has not furnished
reasonably satisfactory evidence that corrective action has been taken or is
being actively and expeditiously pursued, or that alleged violations did not
occur, or that the alleged violations were beyond the franchisee's direct
control, the city may, following notice of the grounds for termination,
pursuant to this subsection and the holding of a public hearing with the common
council, revoke a franchise. Franchisee will be afforded a fair opportunity for
participation at the public hearing, including the right to introduce evidence
and question witnesses. Franchisee will have the right to appeal any such
decision to a state or federal court, and the termination will not become
effective until any such appeal has become final or the time for taking such
appeal has expired. (1975 Code Ch. 13 § XV)

   B.   Federal, State And City Jurisdiction:
      1.   This chapter and any franchise agreement will be construed in a
manner consistent with all applicable federal and state laws.
      2.   In the event that the state or federal government will discontinue
preemption in any area of cable television over which it currently exercises

regulatory authority, the city may, if it so elects, adopt rules and
regulations in these areas to the extent permitted by law.
      3.   This chapter will apply to all franchises granted or renewed from
and after the effective date hereof.
      4.   Franchisee will not be relieved of its obligation to comply with any

included in the franchise agreement, it must contain the following express
representations by the franchisee that:
      1.   It accepts and agrees to all of the provisions of this chapter, and

the city in which the franchisee is authorized to operate.
   E.   The franchise agreement will contain such further conditions or
provisions as may be included in the request for proposal and negotiated
between the city and the franchisee, except that no such conditions or
provisions will be such as to conflict with any provisions of this chapter or
other law. In case of such conflict or ambiguity between any terms or
provisions of the franchise agreement and this chapter, the franchise agreement
will control. (1975 Code Ch. 13 § XV)
3-15-10: ACCESS CHANNELS:
A franchisee must provide access channels and funding or equipment and
facilities to support the access channels and capacity on an institutional
network for government and education use. If there is one or more franchisees
under this chapter, any new franchisee must provide at a minimum the same
number of channels and financial support as the franchisee with the lowest
number of access channels. (1975 Code Ch. 13 § XV)
3-15-11: OPEN ACCESS:
Subject to a final court decision and there are no pending appeals, and, after
review and a hearing, and consideration of franchisee representations, the city
may require open access to competing internet service providers to franchisee's
cable internet modem service. Otherwise, any such requirement should be
included as an amendment to this chapter by mutual agreement with a franchisee
of a franchise agreement. (1975 Code Ch. 13 § XV)
3-15-12: PUBLIC SERVICE INSTALLATION:
The franchisee will, without charge for installation, maintenance, or monthly
service, provide one outlet of its basic cable service at each fire and police
station, public school, and secondary private school with students receiving
funding under title I of the education and secondary school act of 1965, as
well as all public libraries and community centers, provided such locations are
within one hundred fifty feet (150') of the franchisee's cable system and
serviceable through a standard aerial drop and specifically agreed to in the
franchise agreement.
Such installations will be made at such reasonable locations as will be
requested by the respective units of government or educational institutions.
Any charge for relocation of such installations will, however, be charged at
actual cost. Additional installations at the same location may be made at cost.
No monthly service charges will be made for distribution of the franchisee's
signals within such publicly owned buildings. Franchisee will provide a
converter box, if necessary for receipt of basic cable service, at no cost to
each of the above entities. (1975 Code Ch. 13 § XV)
3-15-13: CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Franchisee will not construct any cable system facilities until

appurtenances will be installed, located, erected, constructed, reconstructed,
replaced, removed, repaired, maintained, and operated in accordance with good
engineering practices, performed by experienced pole line construction crews
and so as not to endanger or interfere with the safety of any person or
property, or to interfere with improvements the city may deem proper to make,
or to interfere in any manner with the right of any property owner, or to
unnecessarily hinder or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic on city
properties.
   C.   Any opening or obstruction in or disturbance of the streets or other
municipal properties made by the franchisee in the exercise of its rights under
a franchise agreement will be done in compliance with city ordinances which
regulate work in the public ways of the city, except that any bond requirements
therein may be waived in cognizance of the bond requirements of this chapter.
   D.   The franchisee will comply with the minimum standards provided for by
the applicable ordinances of the city adopted from time to time containing
construction or building standards of general applicability.
   E.   The franchisee will, at its expense, protect, support, temporarily
disconnect, relocate in the same street, or other street, or remove from the
street, any property of franchisee when required by the common council or its
designee by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street excavation,
freeway, and street construction, change or establishment of street grade,
installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, and
tracks, or any other type of structures or improvements by public agencies. If
the city compensates any utility for such work, the city must similarly
compensate the franchisee for such work.
   F.   The franchisee will, on the request of any private party holding an
appropriate permit issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its lines to
permit the moving of any building or other structure, and the actual expense of
the same will be paid in advance by the party requesting the same.
   G.   The franchisee will have the right, with the prior approval of the
city, except in emergency circumstances, to remove, trim, cut, and keep clear
of its poles, wires, or cables, the trees in and along the streets of the city,
but in the exercise of such right, the franchisee will not cut or otherwise
injure said trees to any greater extent than is reasonably necessary for the
continued integrity of its poles, wires, or cables.
   H.   The franchisee, in exercise of any right granted to it by the
franchise, will reconstruct, replace, restore, or repair any street, and any
sewer, gas, or water main, pipe, electrical, fire alarm, or police
communications, off or on city property, or right of way or traffic control
facility of the city which may be damaged or destroyed by the exercise of any
such right, to a condition as good as that prevailing before said work to the
reasonable satisfaction of the city. The city reserves the right to determine
whether the franchisee has properly complied with the provisions of this
subsection, and in the event it is determined that the franchisee has failed to
do so, the city will have the right to, following notice to the franchisee and
reasonable opportunity for the franchisee to cure, carry out such provisions,
and the franchisee will reimburse the city in full for all expenses incurred by
the city in carrying out all or part of such provisions.
   I.   Upon failure of the franchisee to commence, pursue, or complete any
work required by law or by the provisions of this chapter to be done in any
street, within the time prescribed, and to the satisfaction of the common
council or its designee, the common council or its designee may, following
notice to the franchisee and reasonable opportunity for the franchisee to cure,
at its option, cause such work to be done, and the franchisee will pay to the
city the cost thereof in the itemized amounts reported by the common council or
its designee to franchisee within thirty (30) days after receipt of such
itemized report.
   J.   The city will have the right to install and maintain, upon the poles
and within the underground pipes and conduit of franchisee, any wires and
fixtures desired by the city; provided, that: 1) such use by city does not
interfere with existing or future use by the franchisee; 2) the city will take
reasonable precautions to prevent any use of the franchisee's facilities in any
manner which results in the inappropriate use of such facilities or any loss or
damage to the system; 3) to the extent provided by state law, the city holds
franchisee harmless against and from all claims, demands, costs, or liabilities
of every kind and nature whatsoever arising out of such use of said poles or
conduit; and 4) at the franchisee's sole discretion, the city may be required
either to pay a reasonable rental fee or otherwise reasonably compensate the
franchisee for the use of such conduit or other equipment; provided, however,
the franchisee agrees that such compensation or charge will not exceed those
paid by it to public utilities. (1975 Code Ch. 13 § XV)
3-15-14: TECHNICAL STANDARDS:

accordance with the provisions of the national electrical and safety code and
national electrical code, as amended.

regulations of the federal aviation administration and all other local, state,
and federal laws and regulations.
   D.   The results of tests required by the FCC must be filed with the city
within thirty (30) days of a request by the city.
   E.   At any time after commencement of service to subscribers, the city may
require the franchisee to perform additional tests, full or partial repeat
tests, or tests involving a specific subscriber's drop. Such additional tests
may be made on the basis of complaints received or other evidence indicating an
unresolved controversy or significant noncompliance, and such tests will be
limited to the particular matter in controversy. The city will be able to
designate a representative to be present during the testing. If a test
indicates that the franchisee is in compliance with FCC standards and
requirements, the city will bear the expense of such test. If a test indicates
that the franchisee is not in compliance with FCC standards and requirements,
the franchisee will bear the expense of such test. The city will endeavor to so
arrange its requests for such special tests so as to minimize hardship or
inconvenience to franchisee or to the subscriber.
   F.   Upon request, franchisee will provide annual reports to the city of the
following statistical information:
      1.   Statistics compiled on a quarterly basis recording service calls in
which a technician or repairman is dispatched to a residence to correct a
reception problem.
      2.   Service interruption logs, in which service interruptions to
multiple addresses are recorded.

3-15-15: PERIODIC REVIEW AND EVALUATION:
The city has determined that cable television technology, programs, and
services are subject to continuing change. This includes change in law and
regulations, as well as technological and service advancements. For this
reason, it is essential that any franchise which is granted pursuant to this
chapter must include provisions for periodic review, evaluation, and
modification and procedures and requirements relating to evaluation of the
state of the art technology and services permitting the city and franchisee to
agree to changes based upon review and in accordance with the procedures
outlined in the franchise agreement. (1975 Code Ch. 13 § XV)
3-15-16: REPAIR:
Any damage caused to the property of building owners or users or any other
person by the franchisee's negligence will be repaired fully to a condition as
good as that prevailing before said work by the franchisee. (1975 Code Ch. 13
§ XV)
3-15-17: REMOVAL OF FACILITIES UPON REQUEST:
Upon termination of service to any subscriber, the franchisee will promptly
remove all its facilities and equipment from the premises of such subscriber
upon his or her request. (1975 Code Ch. 13 § XV)
3-15-18: TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP:
   A.   Franchisee will not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet, or dispose
of any franchise awarded under this chapter or any of the rights or privileges
granted by the franchise to any person other than an affiliate of franchisee,
without the prior consent of the common council, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld.
Further, any sale or transfer and the consent thereto, will comply with
applicable law requirements. Any attempt to sell, transfer, lease, assign, or
otherwise dispose of the franchise and/or the cable system without the consent
of the city, except as otherwise provided herein, will be null and void. The
granting of a security interest in any of franchisee's assets, or any mortgages
or other hypothecation, will not be considered a transfer for the purposes of
this chapter.
   B.   Any change of control of franchisee will be deemed to be a "sale" or
"transfer" of the franchise. A "change of control" will include any stock sale
by franchisee to, or any merger or consolidation with, any person (or group of
persons acting in concert) who is not an affiliate of franchisee before such
transaction.
   C.   The franchisee must comply with provisions of the cable act regarding
transfers of ownership and any other state, federal, or local laws which are
applicable.
   D.   The franchisee will notify the city in writing of any foreclosure or
any other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the property of the
franchisee or upon the termination of any lease or interest covering all or a
substantial part of said franchised property. Such notification will be
considered by the city as notice that a change in control or ownership of the
franchise has taken place and the provisions under this chapter governing the
consent of the city to such change in control or ownership will apply.
   E.   For the purpose of determining whether it will consent to such a
change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the city may inquire into the
qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and the
franchisee will assist the city in any such inquiry. The transferee will be
required to establish that it possesses the legal, technical, and financial
qualifications to operate and maintain the system and comply with all franchise
requirements for the remainder of the term of the franchise. After considering
the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the transferee and
determining that they are satisfactory, the city may approve the transfer of
rights and obligations of said franchise.
   F.   As a condition of transfer of ownership or control any proposed
transferee shall execute an agreement, in such form as acceptable to the city
attorney, that it will assume and be bound by all of the provisions, terms and
conditions of this chapter and any franchise granted pursuant to it.
   G.   Any financial institution having a pledge of the franchisee or its
assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of
the franchise will have the right to notify the city that it or its designee
satisfactory to the city will take control of and operate the cable television
system, in the event of a franchisee default in its financial obligations. Said
financial institution will also submit a plan for such operation within thirty
(30) days of assuming such control that will assure continued service and
compliance with all franchise requirements during the term the financial
institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution will
not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one year unless
extended by the city in its discretion, and during said period of time it will
have the right to petition the city to transfer the franchise to another
franchisee.
   H.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no such
prior consent will be required for any transfer or assignment to any person
controlling, controlled by, or under the same common control as the franchisee.
(1975 Code Ch. 13 § XV)
3-15-19: PURCHASE BY CITY:
Subject to the cable act, if a franchise is revoked for cause, the city may, to
the extent permitted by local law, acquire that portion of the cable system
serving the city upon payment of an equitable price. (1975 Code Ch. 13 § XV)
3-15-20: REQUESTS FOR CABLE SERVICE:
A franchisee will provide cable service to any requesting subscriber within the
city within thirty (30) days from the date of request, weather permitting.
(1975 Code Ch. 13 § XV)
3-15-21: MULTIPLE FRANCHISES:
   A.   The city may grant one or more franchises for the city. The city may,
in its sole discretion, limit the number of franchises granted based upon, but
not necessarily limited to, the requirements of applicable laws and specific
local considerations, such as:
      1.   The capacity of the public rights of way to accommodate multiple
coaxial cables in addition to the cables, conduit, and pipes of the utility
systems, such as electrical, power, telephone, gas, and sewerage.
      2.   The impact on the community of having multiple franchises.
      3.   The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition,
such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents' property, and a
disruption arising from numerous excavations of the streets.
      4.   The legal, technical, and financial capabilities of the applicant
and its guaranteed commitment to make the necessary investment to erect,
maintain, and operate the proposed system for the duration of the franchise
term.
   B.   Each franchisee awarded a franchise to serve the entire city will offer
service to all residences in the city consistent with applicable law. All
franchises granted in the city shall contain terms and conditions which on the
whole are no less burdensome or more beneficial than those imposed upon on any
other franchisee, provided that nothing herein shall be construed as requiring
the use of identical terms or conditions. (1975 Code Ch. 13 § XV)
3-15-22: DISCRIMINATORY OR PREFERENTIAL PRACTICE:
   A.   The franchisee will not, in its rates or charges, or in making
available the services or facilities of its system, or in its rules or
regulations, or in any other respect, make or grant preferences or advantages
to any subscriber or potential subscriber to the system, or to any user or
potential user of the system; and will not subject any such persons to any
prejudice or disadvantage. The foregoing will not be deemed to prohibit or
preclude promotional rates or charges.
   B.   The franchisee will not deny service, deny access, or otherwise
discriminate against subscribers on the basis of race, color, religion,
national origin, or sex. The franchisee will comply at all times with
applicable equal employment opportunity requirements and all other applicable
federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and all executive and
administrative orders relating to nondiscrimination which are hereby
incorporated and made part of this section by reference. (1975 Code Ch. 13
§ XV)
3-15-23: SUBSCRIBER PRIVACY:
The franchise will comply with the subscriber privacy standards located in 47
USC section 551. If the standards in 47 USC section 551 cease to exist, the
city will have the right to implement the following:
No signal will be transmitted from a subscriber terminal for purposes of
monitoring individual viewing patterns or practices without the express written
permission of the subscriber. The request for such permission will be contained
in a separate document with a prominent statement that the subscriber is
authorizing the monitoring and acknowledging the provisions. The authorization
will be revocable at any time by the subscriber without penalty of any kind
whatsoever; provided, however, that the franchisee will be entitled, without
permission, to conduct systemwide or individually addressed "sweeps" for the
purpose of verifying system integrity, controlling return transmission, or
billing for services. (1975 Code Ch. 13 § XV)
3-15-24: PERMITS AND AUTHORIZATIONS:
The franchisee or applicant for franchise will diligently apply for all
necessary permits and authorizations required in the conduct of its business,
and will diligently pursue the acquisition thereof, including necessary pole
attachment contracts, and necessary authorizations from the federal aviation
administration to construct such receiving antenna towers as may be required,
and any necessary authorizations or waivers from the FCC. After the franchisee
has diligently pursued the acquisition of necessary pole attachment contracts,
or other necessary easements, and where such necessary contracts have not been
entered or easements obtained after a reasonable period of time, the franchisee
may submit the matter to the common council and the common council may
thereupon provide assistance that may be necessary to arrive at a solution so
that scheduled construction of the system will not be impaired. (1975 Code
Ch. 13 § XV)
3-15-25: ANNUAL REPORTS:
Upon request, each franchisee will file an annual report. Such report will
include:
   A.   An ownership report, identifying all persons who at any time during the
preceding year controlled or benefited from an interest in the franchisee of
five percent (5%) or more.
   B.   Copies of all rules, regulations, terms, and conditions the franchisee
has adopted for the conduct of its business.
   C.   A summary of any customer surveys conducted that year including surveys
conducted pursuant to section
3-15-32 of this chapter.
   D.   A summary of the previous year's (or in the case of the initial
reporting year, the initial year's) activities in development of the cable
system, including, but not limited to, services begun or discontinued during
the reporting year.
   E.   A list of franchisee's officers, board members, and other principals.
Upon request, franchisee will allow the city administrator or his or her
designee to review a detailed plan (map) of the system at its offices. (1975
Code Ch. 13 § XV)
3-15-26: EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM:
A franchisee will at all times comply with the emergency alert system
requirements of the FCC. (1975 Code Ch. 13 § XV)
3-15-27: NEW DEVELOPMENTS:
The common council may amend this chapter whenever necessary to enable the
franchisee to take advantage of any developments in the field of transmission
of communication signals and upgrade the system which will afford it an
opportunity to more effectively, efficiently, or economically serve its
customers; provided; that, this chapter will not be construed to require the
city to make any such amendment; and further provided, that the city council
may not impose any capital or operating expenditures on any franchisee pursuant
to this chapter without the franchisee's consent. (1975 Code Ch. 13 § XV)
3-15-28: INDEMNIFICATION; SECURITY FUNDS; INSURANCE:
   A.   Liability And Indemnification: The franchisee will indemnify, hold
harmless, release, and defend the city, its officers, agents, and employees
from and against any and all lawsuits, claims, causes of action, actions,
liability, demands, damages, disability losses, expenses including reasonable
attorney fees, and costs or liabilities of any nature that may be asserted by
any person or entity from any cause whatsoever including another's concurring
negligence arising from injury to persons or damages to property to the extent
caused by any conduct undertaken by the franchisee, its officers, agents, or
employees, by reason of its construction, operation, or maintenance of its
system. Such damages and penalties will include, but not be limited to, damages
arising out of copyright infringements, and all other damages arising out of
the installation, operation, or maintenance of the cable system authorized
herein, whether or not any act or omission complained of is authorized,
allowed, or prohibited by the franchise, except that a franchisee will not be
liable for payment of damages and penalties arising solely from any acts or
omissions by the city, its agents, or employees. If a lawsuit is filed against
the city, either independently or jointly with the franchisee to recover for
any claim or damages, the franchisee, upon notice to it by the city, will, at
its sole cost and expense, defend and fully control the defense of the city
against the action and, in the event of a final judgment being obtained against
the city, either independently or jointly with the franchisee, solely by reason
of the acts of the franchisee, the franchisee will pay said judgment and all
costs and hold the city harmless therefrom. However, the franchisee may not
enter into any compromise, settlement, resolution, or disposition of a claim or
proceeding that may create or impose liability for the city without obtaining
the city's written consent thereto which shall not be unreasonably withheld. In
order for the city to assert its right to be indemnified and held harmless, the
city must:
      1.   Notify franchisee of any claim or legal proceeding which gives rise
to such right;
      2.   Afford franchisee the opportunity to participate in and fully
control any compromise, settlement, resolution, or disposition of such claim or
proceeding; and
      3.   Fully cooperate in the defense of such claim and make available to
franchisee all such information which it may lawfully furnish to franchisee and
relating to the claim.
   B.   Security Funds: The city may require the franchisee to file with the
city clerk, concurrently with its acceptance of the franchise and at
franchisee's sole expense, a corporate surety bond, construction bond,
performance bond, and/or security fund. Such bond and/or security fund will be
in an amount specified in the franchise agreement, issued by a responsible
company licensed to do business in Wisconsin and conditioned upon the faithful
performance of the franchisee to meet its obligations under this chapter and
the franchise. The franchisee shall be required to replenish any such bond
within thirty (30) days after the city draws down upon it.
   C.   Insurance:
      1.   During the course of the franchise, the franchisee will be required
to maintain liability insurance, to protect the city and the franchisee from
and against any and all claims, injury, or damage to persons or property, both
real and personal, caused by the construction, erection, operation, or
maintenance of any aspect of the system. The amount of insurance will be
specified in the franchise agreement.
      2.   The franchisee will provide workers' compensation insurance as
required by state law.
      3.   All such insurance coverage will provide a thirty (30) day notice to
the city administrator in the event of material alteration or cancellation of
any coverage afforded in said policies prior to the date said material
alteration or cancellation will become effective.
      4.   Copies of all certificates evidencing insurance will be furnished to
and filed with the city administrator prior to the commencement of operations
or the expiration of prior policies, as the case may be.
      5.   It will be the obligation of franchisee to promptly notify the city
of any pending or threatened litigation that would be likely to affect the
franchisee's insurance coverage.
   D.   Nonwaiver: Neither the provisions of this chapter, nor any bonds
accepted by the city pursuant thereto, nor any damages recovered by the city
thereunder, will be construed to excuse unfaithful performance by the
franchisee or limit the liability of the franchisee under this chapter or the
franchise for damages, either to the full amount of the bond or otherwise.
(1975 Code Ch. 13 § XV)
3-15-29: OPERATIONAL STANDARDS:
The franchisee will:
   A.   Limit failures to a minimum by locating and correcting malfunctions
properly, but in no event later than twenty four (24) business hours after
notification.
   B.   Notify subscribers affected twenty four (24) hours prior to any planned
service interruption. Such notice may be made through the cable system itself.
   C.   Demonstrate to subscribers upon request, by instruments and otherwise,
that a signal of adequate strength and quality is being delivered. (1975 Code
Ch. 13 § XV)
3-15-30: CONTINUITY OF SERVICE:
   A.   It will be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving cable
services insofar as their financial and other obligations to the franchisee are
honored. In the event that the franchisee elects to rebuild, modify, or sell
the system, or the city gives notice of intent to terminate or fails to renew
the franchise, the franchisee will act so as to ensure that all subscribers
receive continuous, uninterrupted service, subject to compliance with federal
and state laws.
   B.   In the event of a change of the franchisee, or in the event a new
operator acquires the system, the franchisee will cooperate with the city's new
franchisee or operator in maintaining continuity of cable service to all
subscribers. During such period, franchisee will be entitled to the revenues
for any period during which it operates the system and will be entitled to
reasonable cost for its services when it no longer operates the system. (1975
Code Ch. 13 § XV)
3-15-31: SAFETY REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   The franchisee will at all times employ ordinary care and will install,
maintain, and use commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures
and accidents which are likely to cause damage, injuries, or nuisances to the
public.

and other equipment in accordance with the requirements of the national
electrical safety code of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers;
the national electrical code of the National Fire Protection Association; the
bell system code of pole line construction; and applicable federal, state, and
local regulations.

to conduct a statistically valid random survey of city subscribers. Such survey
will be provided to the city at least thirty (30) days before its use for the

   C.   The franchisee will make available to the city for review the results
of the survey and will report in writing what steps, if any, franchisee is
taking to implement the findings of the poll survey, such as correcting
problems and expanding services, to the extent the city can maintain the
confidentiality of the results. The city will be able to review the survey
results at the franchisee's office during normal business hours.

such an inspection will be treated as confidential, making it available only to
those persons who must have access to perform their duties on behalf of the
city, including, but not limited to, the division of finance, the law
department, and common council members. To the extent any state or federal

3-15-36: ABANDONMENT OR REMOVAL OF FRANCHISE PROPERTY:
   A.   In the event that the use of any property of franchisee within the
franchise area or a portion thereof is discontinued for a continuous period of
twelve (12) months, franchisee will be deemed to have abandoned that franchise
property.
   B.   The city, upon such terms as city may impose, may give franchisee
permission to abandon, without removing, any system facility or equipment laid,
directly constructed, operated, or maintained under the franchise. Unless such
permission is granted or unless otherwise provided in this chapter, the
franchisee will remove all abandoned aboveground facilities and equipment upon
receipt of written notice from city and will restore any affected street,
alley, or public property to its former state at the time such facilities and
equipment were installed, so as not to impair its usefulness. In removing its
plant, structures, and equipment, franchisee will refill, at its own expense,
any excavation that will be made by it and will leave all streets in as good
condition as that prevailing prior to such removal without materially
interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires,
poles, or attachments. The city will have the right to inspect and approve the
condition of the streets, cables, wires, attachments, and poles prior to and

denial of any renewal, or upon its revocation or earlier expiration, as
provided for herein, in any such case without renewal, extension, or transfer,
the city will have the right to require franchisee to remove, at its own
expense, all aboveground portions of the cable television system from all
streets within the city within a reasonable period of time, but will not be
less than one hundred eighty (180) days.
   E.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section, the
franchisee may abandon any underground franchise property in place so long as
it does not materially interfere with the use of the street in which such
property is located or with the use thereof by any public utility or other
cable franchisee. (1975 Code Ch. 13 § XV)
3-15-37: RIGHTS RESERVED TO CITY:
   A.   In addition to any rights specifically reserved to the city by this

be reserved by a provision of any ordinance or under the franchise.
   B.   The city will have the right to waive any provision of the franchise,
except those required by federal or state regulation, if the city determines:
      1.   That it is in the public interest to do so; and
      2.   That the enforcement of such provision will impose an undue hardship
on the franchisee or subscribers.
To be effective, such waiver will be evidenced by a statement in writing signed
by a duly authorized representative of the city. Waiver of any provision in one
instance will not be deemed a waiver of such provision subsequent to such
instance nor be deemed a waiver of any other provision of the franchise unless
the statement so recites. (1975 Code Ch. 13 § XV)

or obligations required by this chapter or a franchise granted hereunder is
prevented by a cause or event not within normal operating conditions or
otherwise not within the franchisee's control, such inability to perform will
be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions will be imposed as a result
thereof.

control of franchisee include, but are not limited to: acts of God, strikes,
sabotage, riots or civil disturbances, restraints imposed by order of a

has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner or has not diligently
commenced correction of such violation, the common council may establish a

the obligation or the city may thereafter impose liquidated damages, payable

3-15-42: SEPARABILITY:
If any provision of this chapter is held by any court or by any federal or
state agency of competent jurisdiction to be invalid as conflicting with any
federal or state law, rule, or regulation now or hereafter in effect, or is
held by such court or agency to be modified in any way in order to conform to
the requirements of any such law, rule, or regulation, such provision will be
considered a separate, distinct, and independent part of this chapter, and such
holding will not affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions
hereof. In the event that such law, rule, or regulation is subsequently
repealed, rescinded, amended, or otherwise changed, so that the provision
hereof which had been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with
such law, rule, or regulation, said provision will thereupon return to full
force and effect and will thereafter be binding on city and franchisee,
provided that city will give franchisee thirty (30) days' written notice of

term manufactured home as that term is defined at sections 66.0435(1)(cm) and
101.91(2), Wisconsin statutes. A recreational mobile home shall not, for
purposes of this title, be included in this definition.
MOBILE HOME PARK: Shall have the meaning of the term manufactured and mobile
home community, as that term is defined at section 66.0435(1)(cg), Wisconsin
statutes, and shall also have the meaning of the term manufactured home
community as that term is defined at section 101.91(5m), Wisconsin statutes.
MOBILE HOME SITE: A parcel of land in a mobile home park which has been
reserved for the placement of one mobile home stand.
MOBILE HOME STAND: That part of a parcel of land (mobile home site) in a mobile
home park which has been reserved for the placement of one mobile home unit and
shall include all attachments and additions to such mobile home.

3-17-3: COMMUNITY DESIGN:
   A.   The general pattern of development shall fit topography, requirements
for circulation, and requirements for provision of community facilities and
utilities. Areas for churches, schools, major parks and community facilities
should be located appropriately with respect to the population to be served and
the street and walkway nets. As appropriate, residential areas should merge
into or be insulated from areas devoted to other purposes. They should be
insulated from heavy traffic, concentrations of parking, noise, lights,
commercial and industrial activities. They should merge with parks and other
suitable open areas.
   B.   The street pattern should serve, not shape, the lots in their small
neighborhood groupings. Land devoted to streets should be held to a minimum
compatible with performance of street related functions. Minor streets should
discourage use by through traffic, and no single minor street should serve so
many homes that local traffic is likely to become a problem. Minor streets
should feed at well spaced intervals and well designed intersections into
collector streets and arteries for fast moving traffic. Neither collector nor
arterial streets should have direct entrances from residential lots.
   C.   Blocks should be oriented generally with the long axis in the direction
of principal automotive and pedestrian movement. Blocks should be large enough
and wide enough to provide desirable lot depths, plus interior walkways,
commons, and easements for such utilities as are to be located within the
block.
   D.   The mobile home park should be set in its own environment, rather than
merely running into surrounding uses. It is desirable that it be bordered in a
manner which insulates it from surrounding uses and sets it apart as a
community.
   E.   These standards shall apply to all mobile home parks. Likewise, it will
be necessary to obtain the approval of the board of zoning appeals and common
council for the location and design of any mobile home park on the basis of its
compliance with these standards. (1975 Code Ch. 13 § XVIII)
3-17-4: PARK LICENSE; APPLICATION PROCEDURE:

results in a mobile home park of less than fifteen (15) acres in size, provided
that the expanded portion complies with this chapter and all other applicable
provisions of this code, and further provided that no such park shall exceed
fifty (50) acres in size. (1975 Code Ch. 13 § XVIII)

by the city clerk in accordance with section 66.0435, Wisconsin statutes. All
information required on the form, including the full purchase price including
sales tax and furnishings, shall be provided to the fullest extent possible and
no person shall omit any of such information. No person shall knowingly falsify
any such information.
   G.   Each mobile home located in the city shall pay a monthly parking fee as

twelve (12) months, if the occupants are tourists or vacationists. The licensee
of such park shall keep a record of persons claiming exemption pursuant to this
section, containing the signature of such claimant and in a form approved by
the city treasurer- comptroller.
   I.   Licenses shall expire each year on June 30 and may be renewed annually
thereafter by any licensee after approval of the common council and upon
payment of the annual license fee. Upon such renewal, the city clerk shall
issue a certificate renewing the license for another year unless sooner
revoked. The application for renewal shall be in writing signed by the
applicant on forms furnished by the city clerk.
   J.   No license shall be issued or transferred unless all monthly parking
fees attributable to the park from all preceding months have been fully paid as
required by this chapter. (1975 Code Ch. 13 § XVIII)
3-17-5: PARK INSPECTIONS:
   A.   No mobile home park license shall be issued until the city clerk has
notified the police department, health officer, fire department and building
inspector or their authorized agents, of the application, and these officials
shall inspect or cause to be inspected each application and the premises to
determine whether the applicant and the premises on which the mobile homes are

      2.   Numerous scientific studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major
contributor to indoor air pollution.
      3.   Reliable scientific studies, including studies conducted by the
surgeon general of the United States, have shown that breathing sidestream or
secondhand smoke is a significant health hazard to nonsmokers, particularly to
children, elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and
individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those
with obstructive airway disease.

include lung cancer, respiratory infection, decreased respiratory function,
decreased exercise tolerance, bronchoconstriction and bronchospasm.

protection agency have found that sidestream and secondhand tobacco smoke is a
leading cause of premature death and disability among nonsmokers.

irritant. Smoking results in serious and significant physical discomfort to
nonsmokers.

CHAPTER 4
ALARM DEVICES
SECTION:
5-4-1: Purpose
5-4-2: False Alarms
5-4-3: Additional Regulations
5-4-1: PURPOSE:
This chapter is adopted pursuant to section 62.11(5), Wisconsin statutes, to
deal with the public safety hazard caused by the necessity of the fire and/or
police departments having to respond to all private fire and security alarms,
including false alarms, triggered by malfunctioning or poorly maintained
private alarm devices or systems, both to protect the personal safety of
individuals who are found at the location of activated alarms as well as to
prevent damage, as well as to promote the interests of the public in general
and to protect the public from injuries and deaths resulting from possible
fires or criminal acts. The fire and police departments respond to alarms as a
form of current service provision to the owners of real property and personal
property, including motor vehicles, at which alarms are maintained. To this
extent, the purpose of this chapter is: a) to designate alarm responses as a
service for which a fee is established when the fire and police departments are
confronted with false alarms and b) to establish additional regulations
regarding the use and operation of alarm devices or systems. (Ord. 2010-04, 4-
5-2010)
5-4-2: FALSE ALARMS:
   A.   Definition: A "false alarm" is any signal, communication or message
transmitted by an alarm device or system which causes a police department or
fire department response when a situation requiring a response by the police
department or fire department does not in fact exist. An alarm is presumed to
be false if the responding department does not locate evidence of an intrusion,
commission of an unlawful act or an emergency on the premises or property that
might have caused the signal, communication or message to be transmitted. An
alarm shall not be considered a false alarm if the alarm is activated by
tornados, earthquakes, natural disasters or violent climatic conditions.
   B.   Schedule Of Fees: The user of any private alarm device or system shall
be charged a fee according to the following schedule of fees for any false
alarm occurring within a twelve (12) month period:
      1.   First false alarm: No charge.
      2.   Second false alarm: One hundred dollars ($100.00).
      3.   Third through tenth false alarm: Two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per false alarm.
      4.   Eleventh and subsequent false alarm: Five hundred dollars ($500.00)
per false alarm.
      5.   There shall be no false alarm fees charged during the thirty (30)
day period immediately following the installation of any new alarm device or
system. Any false alarms during said thirty (30) day period shall not be
counted against the total number of false alarms.
      6.   The person or entity to whom the false alarm fee has been assessed
has the right to appeal the fee assessment. All appeals must be submitted in
written form, with documentation, to the city administrator within ten (10)
days of the date of the fee assessment notice. A written response from the city
administrator or his designee shall be made within thirty (30) days of the
receipt of the appeal. If the city administrator or his designee determines
that the alarm(s) was (were) not a false alarm, the fee assessment will be
withdrawn and the response to the alarm by the police or fire department shall
not count as a false alarm in computing the fee established in this section.
      7.   Any fees payable to the city which are delinquent may be assessed
against the property involved as a special charge for current service, without
notice, pursuant to section 66.0627, Wisconsin statutes.
   C.   Discontinuation Of Response: In cases where the alarm user has twelve
(12) or more false alarms within a six (6) month period the police department
and/or fire department may suspend response after the chief of police, fire
chief, or designee sends written notification to the alarm user. In order to
lift the suspension, the alarm user shall submit written confirmation to the
chief of police, fire chief, or designee that the alarm system has been
inspected and repaired, if necessary, and/or additional measures have been
taken to reduce the number of false alarms at that location. If the chief of
police, fire chief, or designee determines that the actions taken are likely to
prevent the occurrence of additional false alarms, the police department and/or
fire department shall lift the suspension. (Ord. 2010-04, 4-5-2010)
5-4-3: ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS:
   A.   Each alarm user shall provide to the fire department in the case of a
fire alarm, and shall provide to the police department in the case of a
security alarm, the names, addresses and telephone numbers of at least two (2)
persons who can be reached at any time who are authorized to respond to an
emergency signal, communication or message transmitted by the alarm device or
system and who are trained in the operation and functioning of the alarm device
or system and who can unlock and open the premises wherein the alarm device or
system is located.
This required notification shall be made for alarms existing as of the
effective date hereof within ten (10) days of the effective date hereof and
shall be made for alarms installed after the effective date hereof immediately
prior to such installation.
It shall be a violation of this section if the alarm user fails to provide the
required notification, or if the persons identified in the notification cannot
be immediately contacted, or if those persons identified in the notification
refuse to immediately cooperate with or immediately respond at the request of
the fire department or police department. The alarm user or the persons
identified in the notification, or both, may be subject to a forfeiture for
such violation.
   B.   No alarm device or system shall be tested, demonstrated or have
maintenance performed upon it, without first notifying the applicable fire or
police department prior to the start of such test, demonstration or maintenance
work.
   C.   Any alarm device or system that when activated causes an audible or
visual signal to be heard or seen externally on the premises or property shall
signal for a maximum of thirty (30) minutes, after which time the alarm device
or system must cease such signal.
   D.   A firearm dealer shall install and maintain a burglar and holdup alarm
system in any structure within the city in which guns are displayed, stored, or
kept. The alarm system must, either by answering service or automatic dialing
device, immediately notify or signal the police department of an emergency
situation that the alarm system is designed to detect.
The term "firearms dealer" is defined as any person engaged in the business of
selling firearms at wholesale or retail and having a license as a dealer issued
by the U.S. department of treasury; provided, however, such person shall not
include a pawnbroker or a gunsmith who is engaged in the business of repairing
firearms or of making or fitting special barrels, stocks, or trigger mechanisms
to the firearms.
The term "engaged in the business" is defined as a person who devotes time,
attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or
business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the
repetitive purchase and resale of firearms; but such phrase shall not include a
person who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases firearms for the
enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby.
The primary purpose of this subsection is to require businesses which deal in
the sale of firearms to install reliable emergency alarm devices or systems in
order to provide additional protection from burglary or robbery of large
quantities of guns in stock, which in turn adds to the safety and protection of
the citizens of the city. (Ord. 2010-04, 4-5-2010)

      4.   Notwithstanding the requirements of subsections C2 and C3 of this
section, the public works director, in his discretion, may elect to have the
permit holder, and not the city, repair the opening in the street. In such a
circumstance, the permit holder shall not be charged for the street opening but
will still be required to pay the permit fee established in subsection A of
this section.
   D.   Protection Of Public: Every person, firm or corporation who opens any
street or public way must enclose each street opening which he may make in the
streets or public ways with sufficient barriers. Warning lights must be kept
burning from sunset to sunrise; one warning light to be placed at intervals of
ten feet (10'). All necessary precautions shall be taken to guard the public
effectually from accidents or damages to persons or property from the beginning

liable for all damages, including the costs incurred by the city in defending
any action brought against it for damages and costs of an appeal that may
result from the neglect of his employees or himself of any necessary
precautions against injury or damage to person, vehicle or property of any
kind.
   E.   Exception to Permit Requirement. Contractors performing excavation or
installation work while under city contract or performing work otherwise
requested by the city are not required to obtain a permit under this chapter

7-2-6: SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR, SPECIFICATIONS:
All sidewalks within the city hereafter shall be repaired, rebuilt and
constructed in accordance with the following specifications:
   A.   Subgrade: The subgrade shall be prepared by excavating to the line,
grade and cross section as established by the director of public works. Soft
and unsuitable material shall be removed and replaced with sand or other
satisfactory material, and the subgrade shall be thoroughly and uniformly
compacted and moistened immediately before the concrete is placed. When so
specified by the director of public works, a subbase of sand and gravel or
other approved material shall be placed under the sidewalks. On embankments the
subgrade shall extend at least one foot (1') beyond each edge of the sidewalk.
   B.   Materials:
      1.   All sidewalks shall be of air entrained concrete composed of six (6)
100-pound bags of cement per cubic yard of one course construction. Gravel
shall be of good quality and washed. Concrete shall be mixed thoroughly for a
minimum of one and one-half (11/2) minutes after all materials have been placed
in the mixer.
      2.   Ready mix concrete shall meet the requirements of the Wisconsin
department of transportation, and all concrete delivered by truck shall be at
least the above consistency of six (6) 100-pound bags of cement per cubic yard,
and certified by the ready mix company, unless specified otherwise by the
director of public works.
   C.   Forms: Concrete shall be placed in straight forms of wood, metal or
composite material of sufficient strength to resist springing, tipping or other
displacement during the process of depositing and consolidating the concrete.
Wood forms shall be of such design as to permit secure fastening. Forms shall
be thoroughly cleaned and oiled before the concrete is placed against them.
Concrete shall be placed in the forms on a moist subgrade deposited just above
the finished grade and consolidated and spaded sufficiently to bring the mortar
to the surface and to prevent honeycombing. It shall then be struck off level
with the top of the forms and finished with wooden floats. To provide adequate
drainage, the sidewalk shall slope toward the curb at a minimum rate of one-
fourth inch (1/4") per foot of width of sidewalk. All joints and edges shall be
finished with a one-fourth inch (1/4") radius edging tool.
   D.   Width And Thickness: Residential walks shall be five feet (5') minimum
in width and not less than four inches (4") thick except within driveway
approaches where the minimum thickness shall be six inches (6"); provided, that
walks in residential areas may be repaired or constructed to a width to conform
with the existing width of sidewalks in the block where the new sidewalk is
being constructed. Sidewalks in front of commercial or industrial
establishments shall not be less than eight feet (8') in width or the width of
the existing boulevard, whichever is the lesser, and five inches (5") in
thickness except within driveway approaches where the minimum thickness shall
be seven inches (7"). Sidewalks over five feet (5') in width and all driveways
shall use six by six (6 x 6) no. 10 mesh for reinforcement. (1975 Code Ch. 6
§ IV; amd. 2009 Code)
   E.   Finishing: Before the last finish has set, the sidewalk shall be
brushed or broomed in transverse direction. Before final finishing the surface
shall be checked with a ten foot (10') straightedge and any areas departing
more than one-eighth inch (1/8") from the testing edge shall be corrected by
adding or removing concrete while the concrete in the walk is still plastic.
   F.   Jointing: Transverse, full depth, one-half inch (1/2") thick expansion
joints or premolded expansion material shall be located every fifty feet (50')
and at the property line, and where the walk intersects another walk, curb
line, building or driveway approach, and at buildings, walls, poles and stop
boxes. The expansion joint material shall be placed in a neat and workmanlike
manner with its upper edge slightly below the finished sidewalk surface. Dummy
groove joints for controlled cracking, at least one-half inch (1/2") in depth
and one-fourth inch (1/4") wide shall be placed at intervals approximately the
same as the width of sidewalk. All joints shall be at right angles to the
direction and grade of the walk. Diagonal joints may be used only when approved
by the city engineer.
   G.   Curing And Drying: As soon as any of the concrete work hereinbefore
mentioned has been finished and hardened sufficiently to prevent excessive
marring of the surface, it shall be cured and protected against rapid drying.
Failure to comply with this requirement shall be deemed sufficient cause for
suspension of work. Curing shall be accomplished by the "impervious coating",
"wet fabric" or "paper" methods. For impervious coating or membrane curing,
only those materials meeting requirements of ASTM specs. C156-44T, "Method Of
Test For Efficiency Of Materials For Curing Concrete" shall be used. Said
specifications are hereby adopted by reference as if fully set forth herein.
Walks shall be kept free from all traffic at normal temperatures for forty
eight (48) hours, and in cold weather (below 50 degrees Fahrenheit) for ninety
six (96) hours. No concrete shall be poured when the temperatures may be
expected to fall below thirty five degrees Fahrenheit (35°F) in any seventy two
(72) hour period or upon frozen subgrade.
   H.   Brick Sidewalks: The use of bricks for sidewalks shall be allowed only
with the approval of the common council. If approved, the bricks shall be
placed and maintained to the same requirements for line and grade of concrete
walks, including requirements for subgrade and use of expansion materials. The
finished surface of the brick walk shall vary no more than three- eighths inch
(3/8") when tested with a ten foot (10') straightedge. The surface shall be
maintained to said tolerance and free from vegetative materials. Lack of said
maintenance shall void the common council approval and require replacement with
concrete after due notice. (1975 Code Ch. 6 § IV)

egress from the street area and shall not occupy areas of the roadway deemed
necessary by the director of public works for effective traffic control or for
highway signs or signals.
      3.   Interference With Street: No driveway apron shall extend out into
the street farther than the face of the curb, and under no circumstances shall
such driveway apron extend into the gutter area. All driveway entrances and
approaches shall be so constructed that they shall not interfere with the
drainage of the streets, side ditches or roadside areas or with any existing
structures on the right of way. When required by the street superintendent to
provide for adequate surface water drainage along the street, the property
owner shall provide any necessary culvert pipe at his own expense.
      4.   Number Of Approaches Limited: No more than one driveway entrance and
approach shall be constructed for any lot or premises except where deemed
necessary and feasible without undue impairment of safety, convenience and
utility of the street by the director of public works. Any two (2) approaches
shall be at least ten feet (10') apart.
      5.   Workmanship And Materials: All driveway entrances and approaches
which are constructed across sidewalks shall be paved in accordance with the
requirements for sidewalk construction in section
7-2-6 of this chapter insofar as such requirements are applicable, including

maintenance, and development of the airport, to protect city taxpayer interests
in existing investments in the airport, and to protect the health, safety, and
general welfare of all members of the public using or desiring to use airport
facilities, the commission shall establish regulations to determine, establish,
regulate, and restrict:

commission, the commission shall, if possible, provide a comparable location
and assume responsibility for the relocation of all buildings.
      2.   To maintain and keep in repair the landing area of the airport and
all publicly owned facilities of the airport, together with the right to direct

person for rights in the use of the airport shall be subordinate to such
agreements with the United States or state of Wisconsin.
      4.   To take any action it considers necessary to protect the aerial

such lease is executed, the provisions of any instrument or agreement with any
person, insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of the lease to
the government, shall be suspended.

of any injury, harm, damage or violation of law arising from the event,
activity, operation, or exercise of privilege or right under the lease or
agreement, except when caused by the negligence of the commission or owner.
         b.   Any lessee or permittee shall carry appropriate contractual
liability insurance to provide the necessary financial backing for this hold
harmless agreement. In the absence of the availability of appropriate
contractual liability insurance, other appropriate insuring techniques deemed

exposures to potential loss resulting from the operations and activities which
pertain to any lease or agreement for use of the airport.
         d.   The specified minimum limits of insurance shall be subject to

best possible manner those public purposes dependent upon it without exceeding
the limited city and other public taxpayer dollars available. Consistent with
this policy, all fees, charges, and rents shall be subject to periodic review
and adjustment, so that the airport may recover from each user, where possible,
a reasonable percentage of its proportionate share of the cost of providing,
maintaining, operating, and administering the facilities benefiting each such
user. Each lease or other written agreement requiring the payment of fees,
charges or rents to the commission shall specify a procedure by which the same
may be reviewed and adjusted upon such terms as shall be set forth therein.

approve or reject all applications by October of each year. If the treatment
facility cannot accept all the proposed septage disposal, consideration shall
be given first to those generators of septage that lie within the service
district.
All approvals for septage disposal shall be granted subject to the condition
that, any time the wastewater facilities has operational problems, maintenance
problems, or threat of WPDES permit violation that are indirectly or directly
related to septage disposal, the utility may immediately restrict septage
disposal until such time as corrective action or mitigative measures have been
taken.
Septage shall only be discharged to the sewer system by city approved and state
licensed disposers and at locations, times, and conditions as specified by the
superintendent. Septage discharges to city specified manholes may, under
special circumstances, be allowed, provided discharge rates are restricted as
necessary to facilitate mixing, prevent a backup in the receiving sewer and
prevent a slug load to the wastewater facility. Discharges may be limited to
the normal working hours of the treatment plant personnel and require a written
documentation of the discharge to be submitted to the superintendent within one
working day of the discharge to the sewers or wastewater facility.
   L.   The utility reserves the right to require any user of the system with
flows in excess of five thousand (5,000) gallons per day (GPD) to install and
maintain, at the user's expense, a control or monitoring manhole on the user's
discharge pipeline. The user shall provide the city free and unobstructed
access to the installed manhole.
   M.   The utility reserves the right to require any industrial user with
flows in excess of twenty five thousand (25,000) GPD and/or of strengths in
excess of that of domestic wastewater, to install and maintain at the user's
expense a monitoring facility. This monitoring facility will be capable of
continuous flow measurement and composite sampling for all discharges and
accessible to utility personnel at all times. The utility may inspect the
monitoring facilities of any discharger to determine compliance with the
requirements of this chapter. The discharger shall allow the utility to enter
upon the premises of the discharger at all reasonable hours, for the purpose of
inspection, sampling, or records examination. The utility shall have the right
to set up on the discharger's property such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
   N.   No claim may be made against the city, the utility or their
representatives by reason of the breaking, clogging, stoppage, or freezing of
any service pipes, nor from any damage arising from repairing mains, making
connections or extensions or any other work that may be deemed necessary. The
right is hereby reserved to cut off the service at any time for the purpose of
repairs or any other necessary purpose, any permit granted or regulations to
the contrary notwithstanding. Whenever it shall become necessary to shut off
the sewer within any district of the city, the utility shall, if practicable,
give notice to each and every consumer within the affected area of the time
when such service will be shut off. (1975 Code Ch. 5 § II)
8-2-4-5: GENERAL DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS:

   D.   Pretreatment Required: When in the opinion of the superintendent, and
in accordance with title 40 part 128 of the code of federal regulations, and
other applicable state and federal regulations, pretreatment is required to
modify or eliminate wastes that are harmful to the structures, processes or
operation of the wastewater treatment facility, the person creating the waste
shall provide, at his expense, such preliminary treatment or processing
facilities as may be determined required to render his wastes acceptable for
admission to the sewerage system.
   E.   Interceptor Requirements: Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be
provided when, in the opinion of the superintendent, they are necessary for the
proper handling of such wastes, except that such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall
be of a type and capacity approved by state plumbing code, and shall be located
so as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the
maintaining of these interceptors, the owner shall be responsible for the
proper removal and disposal, by appropriate means, of the captured material,
and shall maintain records of the dates and means of disposal, which are
subject to review by the superintendent. Any removal and handling of the
collected materials not performed by the owner's personnel must be performed by
currently licensed waste disposal firms.
   F.   Special Agreements: No provision contained in this chapter shall be
construed as prohibiting any special agreement between the utility and any
person, whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be
admitted to the sewerage system, either before or after pretreatment, provided
that there is no impairment of the functioning of the wastewater treatment
facilities by reason of the admission of such wastes or impair the quality of

discharging the waste or septage and shall be subject to the approval of the
utility. Access to sampling locations shall be granted to the utility at all
times. Every care shall be exercised in the collection of samples to ensure
their preservation in a state comparable to that at the time the sample was
taken. The utility may use a consulting engineer or attorney to evaluate the
data furnished by the user and may require additional information. After
evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished, the approving authority may
issue a wastewater discharge permit subject to appropriate terms and
conditions. (1975 Code Ch. 5 § II)
8-2-4-7: AMALGAM MANAGEMENT OF DENTAL OFFICES:
   A.   This section applies to any dental office that places or removes
amalgam. If work in a dental office is limited to work that does not involve
placing or removing amalgam, such as orthodontics, periodontics, oral and
maxillofacial surgery, endodontics, or prosthodontics, then this section does
not apply.
   B.   All dental offices shall implement best management practices for
amalgam as established by the Wisconsin Dental Association.
   C.   Within the shortest reasonable time, but not later than July 1, 2010,
every vacuum system where amalgam is placed or removed shall include an amalgam

8-2-5: SEWER USER CHARGE SYSTEM:
   A.   Authority: The common council shall have the authority to establish and
collect a sewer service charge for the use of the utility's sewerage system.
   B.   Classes Of Users:
      1.   The following user classes are established:
         a.   Residential.
         b.   Commercial and institutional.
         c.   Industrial.
      2.   All users will pay at the residential rate, plus the appropriate
surcharges.
   C.   Method Of Computing: The sewer utility shall determine the yearly cost
of operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment facility, the total
flow-BOD-suspended solids- phosphorus treated by the facility and resulting
flow-BOD- suspended solids-phosphorus unit rates. To these expenses, the
utility shall add their expenses to debt, operation, maintenance, and equipment
replacement of the sewerage system and the cost of billing and collecting, and
then determine total sewer service charge for each user of the system. The
service charge shall be based on water or wastewater meter readings, when
available. When such meter readings are unavailable, the service charges will
be a flat charge based on the estimate of usage for the unmetered users. This
estimate shall be fifteen thousand (15,000) gallons per quarter. Where the flat
charge must be used, it will be paid for the full quarter and shall not be
prorated. If service should be interrupted for any full quarter, only the
minimum charge will be charged. The flat charge will be adopted by resolution
of the common council.
   D.   Debt Service Charge: All charges for debts on the existing sewerage
system and the debts incurred by the utility for construction of the sewerage
system shall be paid for by a debt service charge which is a part of the total
sewer service charge. The amount of this surcharge will be reviewed annually
and adopted by resolution of the common council.
   E.   Minimum Charge: The minimum charge per user shall be comprised of the
cost of billing, collecting and accounting, meter reading expense, collection
system maintenance, administrative and general salaries, transportation, office
supplies and expenses, miscellaneous general expense, and office rent, to be
paid for each connection for the availability of service. This charge will be
made regardless of use of user and shall be adopted by resolution of the common
council.
   F.   User Charge: The user charge for the residential user class for
discharging domestic wastewater shall be based on a minimum annual charge per
user and on the volume used by each user. The amount of this charge will be
reviewed annually and adopted by resolution or action of the common council.
   G.   Replacement Fund: A distinct replacement fund shall be established by
the utility. The replacement fund is for replacing existing equipment and
accessories necessary to maintain the capacity and performance during the
service life of the treatment facility, future wastewater treatment facility
modifications required by changes in the WPDES permit, and replacing structures
and equipment beyond their useful service life.
   H.   Surcharges:
      1.   The commercial and institutional class of users shall be charged at
the residential user rate and such additional surcharges as established by
resolution of the common council.
      2.   The industrial user class of users shall be charged at the
residential user rate, plus a surcharge, as established by resolution of the
common council.
      3.   Users discharging toxic pollutants shall pay for any increased
operation, maintenance and replacement costs.
      4.   Septage dischargers will be charged at the residential user rate,
plus any applicable surcharges for BOD concentrations in excess of two hundred
thirty seven milligrams per liter (237 mg/l), suspended solids concentrations
in excess of two hundred fifteen milligrams per liter (215 mg/l), and
phosphorus concentrations in excess of seven milligrams per liter (7 mg/l).
State average concentrations may be used in lieu of testing for fee
determination.
   I.   Total Sewer Service Charge: The total sewer service charge shall be the
sum of the minimum charge, user charge, debt service charge and any applicable
surcharges.
   J.   Methods Of Metering Sewerage:
      1.   Water meter readings shall be used to determine the actual volume of
water used. Sewage volume for computing the service charge for residential
accounts shall be considered to be one hundred percent (100%) of the metered
water consumption during the fourth and first billing quarters, and the average
of one hundred percent (100%) of the metered water consumption of the preceding
two (2) quarters for the second and third billing quarters. In no case shall
the volume for computing the charge exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the
actual metered water consumption. If, because of interruption of occupancy or
other reason, there is substantial inaccuracy in the imputed volume for second
and third billing quarters, the utility may use one hundred percent (100%) of
actual metered water consumption as the basis for service charge.
      2.   Sewage volume for computing the service charge for commercial,
industrial and public authority customers shall be considered to be one hundred
percent (100%) of the metered water consumption during the billing quarter.
Upon presentation of evidence that a substantial amount of the metered water
consumption is not discharged into the sanitary sewer, the utility may adjust
the imputed volume for computing service charge.
      3.   Customers operating their own water supply system but discharging to
the sewerage system shall, at their own expense, provide and install a meter
which is accessible during working hours by city personnel. All costs of
providing, installing and maintaining said metering system shall be borne by
the customer, and the system shall be maintained to the utility's standards.
      4.   Where it is not possible to compute an accurate sewer bill due to
one of the following reasons, the charge will be computed as follows:
         a.   Meter failure: Charge same as previous quarter.
         b.   No meter: Charge fifteen thousand (15,000) gallons per quarter.
         c.   New customer at old service: Charge one hundred thirty five (135)
gallons per day times the number of days of occupancy, or the actual reading if
read within five (5) days of initial occupancy.
   K.   Billing Periods: The bill will be payable in accordance with the
schedule established by the utility. These bills are payable in four (4)
quarterly payments each year.
   L.   Due Date: All portions of the service charges shall be payable at the
time the bill for the same is issued.
   M.   Late Penalties: Charges levied in accordance with this chapter shall be
a debt due to the utility and shall be a lien upon the property. If this debt
is not paid within twenty (20) days after it is due and payable, it shall be
deemed delinquent, and a penalty equal to the rate established by the Wisconsin
public service commission shall be added to the bill. This debt may then be
recovered by civil action in the name of the city against the property owner,
the person, or both. If payment is not received prior to November 15, the
delinquent bill will be forwarded to the county for placement on the succeeding
tax roll.
   N.   Failure To Pay:
      1.   In the event of failure to pay sewer service charges after they
become delinquent, the utility shall have the right to remove or close sewer
connections and enter upon the property for accomplishing such purposes.
      2.   The expense of such removal or closing, as well as the expense of
restoring service, shall likewise be a debt to the city and a lien upon the
property, and may be recovered by civil action in the name of the city against
the property owner, the person, or both.
      3.   Sewer service shall not be restored until all charges, including the
expense of removal, closing and restoration, shall have been paid.
      4.   Change of ownership or occupancy of premises found delinquent shall
not be cause for reducing or eliminating these penalties.
   O.   Audit Of General Account:
      1.   The utility shall conduct an annual audit, the purpose of which
shall be to maintain the proportionality and adequacy of the sewer service
charge relative to changing system operation, maintenance and debt service
costs. Any excess revenues collected from a user class shall be attributed to
that class when determining the next year's charge system.
      2.   Users will be notified annually of the charges attributable to
wastewater treatment services. (1975 Code Ch. 5 § III)
8-2-6: ENFORCEMENT; PERMIT SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION; HEARING:
   A.   Emergency Suspension Of Service And Discharge Permits: The
superintendent may, for good cause shown, suspend the wastewater treatment
service of a discharger when it appears to the superintendent that an actual or
threatened discharge presents or threatens an imminent or substantial danger to
the environment, interference with the operation of the wastewater facilities,
or violation of any pretreatment limits imposed by this chapter, contract or
agreement. Any discharger notified of the suspension of the utility's
wastewater treatment service shall within a reasonable period of time, as
determined by the superintendent, cease all discharges. In the event of failure
of the discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension order within the
specified time, the utility may commence judicial proceedings immediately
thereafter to compel the discharger's compliance with such order. The utility
shall reinstate the wastewater treatment service and terminate judicial
proceedings pending proof by the discharger of the elimination of the
noncomplying discharge or conditions creating the threat of imminent or
substantial danger as set forth above.
   B.   Revocation Of Permit: The utility may revoke the permit of any
discharger which fails to: 1) factually report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge; 2) report significant changes in wastewater
constituents or characteristics; 3) allow reasonable access to the discharger's
premises by representatives of the utility for the purpose of inspection or
monitoring; or 4) uphold the condition of its permit, or this chapter, or any
final judicial order entered with respect thereto.
   C.   Notification Of Violation; Administrative Adjustment: Whenever the
utility finds that any discharger has engaged in conduct which justifies
revocation of a permit, the utility shall serve or cause to serve or cause to
be served upon such discharger a written notice either personally or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature of
the alleged violation. Within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt of the
notice, the discharger shall respond personally or in writing to the utility
advising of its position with respect to the allegations. Thereafter, the
parties shall meet to ascertain the veracity of the allegations and, where
necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof.
   D.   Show Cause Hearing: Where violation of sections
8-2-3 and
8-2-4 through
8-2-4-6 of this chapter is not corrected by timely compliance by means of
administrative adjustment, the utility may order any discharger which causes or

discharger. Appeal of such orders may be taken by the discharger in accordance
with applicable local or state law.
   E.   Judicial Proceedings: Following the entry of any order by the utility
with respect to the conduct of a discharger contrary to the provisions of this
chapter, the attorney for the utility may, following the authorization of such
action by the utility, commence an action for appropriate legal and/or
equitable relief in the appropriate court.

the subject of enforcement proceedings pursuant to this chapter during the
twelve (12) previous months, shall be annually published by the utility in the
official city newspaper, summarizing the enforcement actions taken against the
dischargers during the same twelve (12) months whose violations remained
uncorrected forty five (45) or more days after notification of noncompliance,
or which have exhibited a pattern of noncompliance over the twelve (12) month
period, or which involve failure to accurately report noncompliance.
   G.   Right Of Appeal: Any discharger or any interested party shall have the
right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the utility on any
matter covered by this chapter and shall be entitled to a prompt written reply.
In the event that such inquiry is by a discharger and deals with matters of
performance or compliance with this chapter or permit for which enforcement
activity relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt of a
discharger's request shall stay all enforcement proceedings pending receipt of
the aforesaid written reply. Appeal of any final judicial order entered
pursuant to this chapter may be taken in accordance with local and state law.
   H.   Operation Upsets: Any discharger which experiences an upset in
operations which places the discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance
with this chapter shall inform the superintendent thereof within twenty four
(24) hours of first awareness of the commencement of the upset. Where such
information is given orally, a written follow-up report thereof shall be filed
by the discharger with the superintendent within five (5) days. The report
shall specify:

8-3-1: PURPOSE, NECESSITY AND AUTHORIZATION:
The common council of the city of Menomonie finds that the management of
stormwater and other surface water discharges within and beyond Lake Menomin,
Red Cedar River and other bodies of water within the city is a matter that
affects the health, safety and welfare of the city, its citizens and businesses
and others in the surrounding area. Failure to effectively manage stormwater
affects the sanitary sewer utility operations of the city by, among other
things, increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary
sewer system. Surface water runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten
residences and businesses with water damage, and create environmental damage to
the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within and adjacent to the city.
A system for the collection and disposal of stormwater provides services to all
properties within the city of Menomonie and surrounding areas, including those
properties not currently served by the system. The cost of operating and
maintaining the city stormwater management system and financing necessary
repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the
extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from
the system. In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public,
the common council hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater
utility and establish the rates for stormwater management services. In
promulgating the regulations contained in this chapter, the city is acting
pursuant to authority granted by chapters 62 and 66 of the Wisconsin statutes,
including, but not limited to, sections 62.04, 62.11, 62.18, 66.0621, 66.0627,
66.0809, 66.0811 and 66.0821, Wisconsin statutes. (Ord. 2007-14, 11-5-2007)
8-3-2: CREATION OF STORMWATER UTILITY:
There is hereby established a stormwater utility in the city. The operation of
the stormwater utility shall be under the supervision of the city

8-3-3: AUTHORITY:
The city, acting through the stormwater utility, may acquire, construct, lease,
own, operate, maintain, extend, expand, replace, clean, dredge, repair,
conduct, manage, and finance such facilities, operations and activities, as are
deemed by the city to be proper and reasonably necessary for a system of storm
and surface water management. These facilities may include, without limitation
due to enumeration, surface and underground drainage facilities, sewers,
watercourses, retaining walls, ponds, streets, roads, ditches, and such other
facilities as will support a stormwater management system. Additionally, the
city, through the utility, shall educate and inform the public on proper
stormwater management techniques. (Ord. 2007-14, 11-5-2007)

water utility shall be surveyed on a ten (10) year interval or when the meter
is changed, whichever is later. The water utility may, but is not required to,
perform the cross connection survey of the customer's property. All
nonresidential properties serviced by the water utility shall be surveyed on an
interval not exceeding two (2) years. The frequency of required surveys and
resurveys, based upon the potential health hazards, may be shortened by the
water utility. If, in the opinion of the water utility, the water utility is
not able to perform the survey, the property owner must, at the property
owner's own expense, have the water system piping surveyed for cross
connections by a person who has been properly trained in accordance with the
American Society Of Sanitary Engineers (ASSE) standard number 5120 as a cross
connection control surveyor. The utility shall charge fees as approved by the
state of Wisconsin public service commission for on premises follow up visits
by water utility personnel for reinspection due to customer noncompliance and
for after hours inspections or reinspections. (Ord. 2013-11, 6-3-2013)
8-5-7: RIGHT OF ENTRY:
Upon presentation of credentials, representatives of the water utility shall
have the right to request entry at any reasonable time to examine property
served by a connection to the public potable water system of the water utility
for cross connections. If entry is refused, such representatives shall obtain a
special inspection warrant under section 66.0119, Wisconsin statutes. The water
utility shall charge the property owner a fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00)
per day for refusal to allow entry to examine any property. Upon request, the
owner, lessee or occupant of any property served shall furnish to the
inspection agency any pertinent information regarding the piping system on such
property. (Ord. 2013-11, 6-3-2013)
8-5-8: AUTHORITY TO DISCONTINUE SERVICE:
The water utility is hereby authorized and directed to discontinue water
service to any property wherein any connection in violation of this section
exists and to take such other precautionary measures deemed necessary to
eliminate any damage of contamination of the potable water system. Water
service shall be discontinued if the means of backflow prevention required by
the water utility is not installed, tested, maintained and/or repaired in
compliance with this chapter, chapters SPS 382-384, Wisconsin administrative
code, and the water utility's "Cross Connection Control Manual", or if it is
found that the means of backflow prevention required by this chapter has been
removed or bypassed. Water service shall be discontinued only after reasonable
notice and opportunity for hearing under chapter 68, Wisconsin statutes, except
as provided in section
8-5-10 of this chapter. (Ord. 2013-11, 6-3-2013)
8-5-9: RECONNECTION OF SERVICE:
Water service to any property disconnected under provisions of this chapter
shall not be restored until the cross connection(s) has been eliminated or a
backflow prevention means approved by the water utility has been installed in
compliance with the provisions of this section. The water utility shall charge
fees as approved by the state of Wisconsin public service commission for the
reconnection of the water service. (Ord. 2013-11, 6-3-2013)
8-5-10: EMERGENCY DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE:

emergency endangers public health, safety or welfare and requires immediate
action, service may be immediately discontinued. The owner, lessee or occupant
shall have an opportunity for hearing under chapter 68, Wisconsin statutes,
within ten (10) days of such emergency discontinuance. Such hearing shall be
before the city of Menomonie common council and shall conform to all existing
due process requirements. (Ord. 2013-11, 6-3-2013)
8-5-11: ADDITIONAL PROTECTION:
In the case of premises having: a) cross connections that cannot be permanently
corrected or controlled, or b) intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or
where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for
surveying purposes, making it impractical or impossible to ascertain whether or
not dangerous cross connections exist, the public water supply system shall be
protected in the service line. In the case of any premises where there is any
material dangerous to health that is handled in such a manner that, in the
opinion of the water utility, could create an actual or potential hazard to the
public water supply system, an approved air gap separation or an approved
reduced pressure principle backflow assembly shall protect the public water
supply system. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include
premises with auxiliary water supplies either interconnected or not
interconnected with the public water supply system, premises where inspection
is restricted, hospitals, mortuaries, clinics, laboratories, piers, docks, and
other waterfront facilities, sewage treatment plants, sewage lift stations,
food and beverage, processing plants, chemical plants using a water process,
metal processing plants or nuclear reactors, car washing facilities and
premises with reclaimed water systems. In the case of any presence of toxic
substances, the water utility may require an approved air gap or reduced
pressure principle backflow assembly at the service connection to protect the
public water supply system. This requirement will be at the discretion of the
water utility. (Ord. 2013-11, 6-3-2013)

constructed, and maintained in accordance with the following standards:
      1.   All signs shall comply with applicable provisions of the Wisconsin
building code and the national electrical code (article 600).
      2.   Except for temporary signs, all signs shall be constructed of
permanent materials and shall be permanently attached to the ground, a
building, or another structure by direct attachment to a rigid wall, frame, or
structure, and shall be maintained in good finish (not faded) and good

   F.   Nonconforming Existing Signs, Permits And Terms:
      1.   A sign other than temporary sign(s) that would be permitted under

effective date of the original enactment of this chapter (September 25, 1991),
or on the effective date of any applicable amendment thereto, or on a later
date when the property is annexed to the city, and which was constructed in
accordance with this chapter and other applicable laws in effect on the date of
its construction, but which by reason of its size, height, location, design, or
construction is not in conformance with the requirements of this chapter, shall
be allowed to remain in place.
      2.   Such sign(s), which were made nonconforming by the adoption of this
chapter, or as amended, shall be allowed to remain in place, provided that no
action is taken which increases the degree or extent of the nonconformity. A
change in the information on the face of an existing nonconforming sign is
allowed. However, any nonconforming sign shall either be eliminated or made to
conform with the requirements of this chapter when any proposed change, repair,
or maintenance would constitute replacement of more than fifty percent (50%) of

plan or permit governing such sign or the zone lot on which the sign is
located;

permit;
      3.   To fail to remove any sign that is installed, created, erected, or
maintained in violation of this chapter, or in the case of temporary signs, for

violation shall be considered a separate violation when applying the penalties
of the city zoning regulations.
   H.   Appeals: Appeals may be made to the zoning board of appeals (or
equivalent) by the same rights and procedures governing other zoning appeals.
Appeals shall be reviewed by the building inspector's office which shall advise
the board of its findings prior to the board's decision.
   I.   Additional Regulations: Additional sign regulations exist in title 10,

10 conflict with the regulations of this title, the provisions of title 10
shall control. (1975 Code Ch. 16 § XIX)

more, shall be completely enclosed by a fence prior to use of the swimming
pool. The wall of a building may be accepted as a part of the required fence
when found by the inspector to provide a sufficient degree of protection. Such
fence shall be not less than four feet (4') in height above the ground level
immediately below. Such fence shall be of not less than 111/2-gauge chainlink
fencing or such other construction which will make access to the swimming pool
area equally difficult. All fence material and fence posts shall be resistant
to decay and corrosion, and fence posts shall be set in concrete bases or
similarly secured. Any open space between the bottom of the fence and the fence
and the ground shall not exceed four inches (4"). Each fence opening or point
of entry into the pool area enclosure shall be equipped with a gate. Each gate
shall have at least the minimum height required for the fence and shall be
equipped with self-closing and self-latching devices placed at the top of the
gate or at a place which is otherwise inaccessible to small children.

encompassed by an exterior wall having a height of four feet (4') or more shall
be exempt from the provisions of subsection A of this section; provided, that
all such aboveground pools shall be equipped with an effective fence and gate
system at all points of entry to the pool, constructed to the specifications
contained in subsection A of this section.
   C.   Prior to filling with water, each such outdoor swimming pool shall be
enclosed by either fencing as required above, or a temporary construction
fence. Such temporary fence shall be a snow fence or similar design at least
four feet (4') in height and securely anchored in place. The fence shall be
constructed with its base flush to the ground and shall have supportive posts
placed no more than eight feet (8') apart. The fence shall remain in place
until such time as a permanent fence is installed as provided in this section.
The installation of a permanent fence shall take place no later than sixty (60)
days after the initial filling of the swimming pool.
   D.   All persons owning or in charge of a swimming pool for which a fence is
required under this chapter shall construct or provide such fence within ninety
(90) days following the effective date hereof. (1975 Code Ch. 16 § XXIV)

control plans based on the following:
      1.   The control plan shall include sufficient measures to minimize
delivery of sediment from the site to adjacent or downstream streets, lands, or
water bodies that, by design, will discharge no more than 5 tons per acre per
year, or to the maximum extent practicable, of the sediment load carried in
runoff from initial grading to final stabilization.
      2.   Established guidelines, standards, and specifications included in,
but not limited to, applicable Storm Water Construction Technical Standards
developed and published by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.
      3.   This chapter may require all grading, excavating, fills, open cuts,
side slopes and other land disturbances to be mulched, seeded, sodded,
riprapped, or otherwise protected so that erosion and sedimentation are
controlled.
   B.   Standard For Tracking: The city building inspector shall not approve
any plan nor issue a permit for any land development activity or land
disturbing activity under this chapter unless he is satisfied that there will
be adequate provisions to clean up the tracking or dropping of dirt or other
materials from the site onto any public or private street.
   C.   Design Criteria, Engineering Standards And General Principles: The
applicant for a permit may employ any measures necessary to achieve all
applicable standards set out in subsections A and B of this section. However,
these measures will be evaluated to determine whether they follow currently
accepted design criteria and engineering standards. The following general
principles shall be used when evaluating control plans and granting permits
under this chapter:
      1.   The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any given
time during development.
      2.   Exposure shall be kept to as short a duration of time as is
practicable.
      3.   Temporary vegetation, mulching or other cover shall be used to
protect high erosion hazard areas exposed during development.
      4.   Permanent vegetative or structural protective measures shall be
installed as soon as possible.
      5.   The plan of development shall relate to the topography and soils of
the site so as to reduce the potential for excessive erosion.
      6.   Adverse impacts on the natural fauna, flora, watercourses, water
regimen and topography of the area caused by the proposed project shall be kept
to the practical minimum.
   D.   Effect Of Compliance: Compliance with the standards and criteria of
this section shall not bar a nuisance action or other civil action brought by
any injured public or private party for damage to property upon which the
erosion directly occurred or to property or other rights which were damaged by
erosion, sedimentation or runoff. (1975 Code Ch. 24 § VII; amd. Ord. 2023-24,

9-11-1: AUTHORITY:
   A.   This chapter is adopted by the common council under the authority
granted by section 62.234, Wisconsin statutes. This chapter supersedes all
conflicting and contradicting stormwater management regulations previously
enacted that relate to stormwater management regulations. Except as otherwise
specified in section 62.234, Wisconsin statutes, section 62.23, Wisconsin
statutes applies to this chapter and to any amendments to this chapter. (1975
Code Ch. 27 § I; amd. 2009 Code)
   B.   The provisions of this chapter are deemed not to limit any other lawful
regulatory powers of the city.
   C.   The common council hereby designates the city building inspector, with
assistance from city engineer to administer and enforce the provisions of this
chapter.
   D.   The requirements of this chapter do not preempt more stringent
stormwater management requirements that may be imposed by any of the following:
      1.   Wisconsin department of natural resources administrative rules,
permits or approvals including those authorized under sections 281.16 and
283.33, Wisconsin statutes.
      2.   Targeted nonagricultural performance standards promulgated in rules
by the Wisconsin department of natural resources under NR 151.004, Wisconsin
administrative code.
      3.   Other city ordinances and zoning regulations. (1975 Code Ch. 27 § I)
9-11-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
The common council finds that uncontrolled, postconstruction runoff has a
significant impact upon water resources and the health, safety and general
welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural
resources. Specifically, uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can:
   A.   Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion,
increasing streambed scour, diminishing ground water recharge, diminishing
stream base flows and increasing stream temperature.
   B.   Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic
life, recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of
sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, bacteria, pathogens and
other urban pollutants.
   C.   Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by
increasing pollutant loads.
   D.   Reduce the quality of ground water by increasing pollutant loading.
   E.   Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by
overtaxing storm sewers, drainageways, and other minor drainage facilities.
   F.   Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by
increasing major flood peaks and volumes.

9-11-3: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   Purpose: The general purpose of this chapter is to establish long term,
postconstruction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats
to public health, safety, welfare and the aquatic environment. Specific
purposes are to:
      1.   Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions.
      2.   Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater; prevent and
control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning
grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures
and land uses; preserve ground cover and scenic beauty; and promote sound
economic growth.
      3.   Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage
facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; control
increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter; and prevent
conditions that endanger downstream property.
   B.   Intent: It is the intent of the common council that this chapter
regulate postconstruction stormwater discharges within the city and to waters
of the state. This chapter may be applied on a site by site basis. The common
council recognizes, however, that the preferred method of achieving the
stormwater performance standards set forth in this chapter is through the
preparation and implementation of comprehensive, systems level stormwater
management plans that cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a
municipal and regional scale. Such plans may prescribe regional stormwater
devices, practices or systems, any of which may be designed to treat runoff
from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state. Where such
plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under section
281.16, Wisconsin statutes, for regional stormwater management measures and
have been approved by the common council, it is the intent of this chapter that
the approved plan be used to identify postconstruction management measures
acceptable for the community. (1975 Code Ch. 27 § III)
9-11-4: APPLICABILITY AND JURISDICTION:
   A.   Applicability:
      1.   Where not otherwise limited by law, this chapter applies after final
stabilization to a site of land development or land disturbing activity of any

this section, this chapter applies to postconstruction sites of any size that,
in the opinion of the administering authority, is likely to result in runoff
that exceeds the safe capacity of the existing drainage facilities or receiving
body of water, that causes undue channel erosion, that increases water
pollution by scouring or the transportation of particulate matter or that
endangers property or public safety.
      4.   The city building inspector, with assistance of city engineer, may
establish on site stormwater management requirements less stringent than those
set forth herein, provided that provisions are made to manage stormwater by an
off site facility; provided, that all of the following conditions for the off
site facility are met:
         a.   The off site facility is operational prior to commencing the
proposed land development or land disturbing activity.
         b.   The off site facility is designed and adequately sized to provide
a level of stormwater control equal to or greater than that which would be

predevelopment land use conditions, or less if downstream system capacity
problems exist.
         b.   Predevelopment conditions shall assume “good hydrologic
conditions” for appropriate land covers as identified in TR-55 or an equivalent
methodology. The meanings of “hydrologic soil group” and “runoff curve number”

9-12-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   Authority:
      1.   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety,
and general welfare of the citizens of the city through the regulation of
nonstormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) to
the maximum extent practicable as required by federal and state law. This
chapter establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into
the MS4 in order to comply with requirements of the Wisconsin pollutant
discharge elimination system (WPDES) permit process. The objectives of this
chapter are:
         a.   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the MS4 by
stormwater discharges by any user.
         b.   To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the MS4.
         c.   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection,
surveillance, monitoring, and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure
compliance with this chapter.
      2.   The provisions of this chapter are deemed not to limit any other
lawful regulatory powers of the city.
      3.   In instances where the provisions of this chapter conflict with
provisions of other city ordinances, zoning regulations, or the regulatory
provisions of state agencies, including, but not limited to, the WPDES
stormwater discharge permits issued by the WDNR under section 281.31, Wisconsin
statutes, the more stringent provision shall apply.
      4.   The city designates the director of public works as the person
responsible to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter.
   B.   Ultimate Responsibility: The standards set forth herein and promulgated
pursuant to this chapter are minimum standards; therefore, this chapter does
not intend or imply that compliance by any person will ensure that there will
be no contamination, pollution, or unauthorized discharge of pollutants.
   C.   Findings Of Fact: The city and adjacent towns are growing at a rapid
rate. Lake Menomin, Red Cedar River and its tributaries are of regional

subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section or may be
restrained by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law.
      2.   In the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public
health or public safety, the DPW is authorized to enter upon the subject
private property, without giving prior notice, to take any and all measures
necessary to abate the violation. The DPW is authorized to seek costs of the
abatement as outlined in subsection E of this section.
   B.   Warning Notice: When the DPW finds that any person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued
hereunder, the DPW may serve upon that person a written warning notice,
specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting
the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution
whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of
the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the alleged
violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of
the warning notice. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority of the
DPW to take action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a warning notice.
   C.   Notice Of Violation:
      1.   Whenever the DPW finds that a person has violated a prohibition or
failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the DPW may order compliance by
written notice of violation to the responsible person.
      2.   The notice of violation shall contain:
         a.   The name and address of the alleged violator;
         b.   The address when available or a description of the building,
structure or land upon which the violation is occurring, or has occurred;

compliance within the established time schedule, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or contractor and the expense thereof shall be
charged to the violator.
      3.   Such notice of violation may require without limitation:
         a.   The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
         b.   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
         c.   That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease
and desist;

contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected premises;
         e.   Payment of a penalty to cover administrative and remediation
costs; and
         f.   Preparing plans for and implementing BMPs.
   D.   Suspension Of MS4 Access:
      1.   Emergency Cease And Desist Orders: When the DPW finds that any
person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or
any order issued hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to
reoccur, and that the person's violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to
an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the state which
reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the DPW may issue an order
to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the violator to:
         a.   Immediately comply with all ordinance requirements; and
         b.   Take such appropriate preventative action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Any person notified of an
emergency order directed to it under this subsection shall immediately comply
and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the DPW may
take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or
waters of the state, and/or endangerment to persons or to the environment,
including immediate termination of a facility's water supply, sewer connection,
or other municipal utility services. The DPW may allow the person to recommence
its discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the DPW that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are
initiated against the discharger under this chapter. A person that is
responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes
of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence, to the DPW within five (5) days of receipt of the emergency order.
      2.   Suspension Due To Illicit Discharges In Emergency Situations: The
DPW may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when
such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or
to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the state. If
the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
the DPW may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage
to the MS4 or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to persons.
      3.   Suspension Due To Detection Of Illicit Discharge:
         a.   Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter
may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce
an illicit discharge. The DPW will notify a violator of the proposed
termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the DPW for a
reconsideration and hearing.
         b.   A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access
to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of
the DPW.
      4.   Prosecution And Penalties: Any person that has violated or continues
to violate this chapter shall be liable to prosecution to the fullest extent of
the law. In the event the alleged violator fails to take the remedial measures
set forth in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations
described therein within the set time period specified by the DPW, and after
the DPW has taken one or more of the actions described in this subsection, the
DPW may impose a penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per
day, the specific amount of which shall be determined by the severity of the
violation in question, for each day the violation remains unremedied after
receipt of the notice of violation. The DPW may also impose upon a violator
alternative compensatory actions, including, but not limited to, storm drain
stenciling/marking, attendance at compliance workshops, pond or drainageway
cleanup.
   E.   Cost Of Abatement Of Violation: Within thirty (30) days after abatement
of the violation, the owner of the premises will be notified of the cost of
abatement, including administrative costs. If the amount due is not paid by the
date determined by the city, the charges shall become a special charge against
the property, and shall constitute a lien on the property pursuant to section
66.0627, Wisconsin statutes. The city may recover all attorney fees, court
costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement of this chapter,
including sampling and monitoring expenses. (Ord. 2008-07, 5-19-2008)

entrance faces.
YARD, REAR: A yard extending the full width of the lot between the rear lot
line and the nearest wall of the main building, excluding only such projections

Code Ch. 18 § IV)
10-4-2: BUILDING USES:
   A.   Action To Abate Nuisance: No provision of this title shall be construed
to bar an action to enjoin or abate the use or occupancy of any land or
structure as a nuisance under the appropriate laws of the state of Wisconsin.
   B.   Public Utility Lines: No provision of this title shall be construed to
prohibit the customary and necessary construction, reconstruction or
maintenance of overground or underground public utility neighborhood service
lines and mechanical appurtenances thereto, where reasonably necessary for the
preservation of the public health, safety, convenience and welfare.
   C.   Compliance With District Regulations: The use of buildings hereafter
erected, converted in use, enlarged or structurally altered and the use of any
land shall be in compliance with the regulations established herein for the
district in which such land or building is located.
   D.   Buildings On Lot: Every building hereinafter erected, converted in use,
enlarged or structurally altered shall be located on a lot, and in no case
shall there be more than one main building on one lot, on lots in the single-
family residential, limited multiple-family residential and multiple-family
residential districts and on lots containing any dwelling structure, except in
a planned unit development, or as permitted by the board of zoning appeals.
   E.   Effect Of Title On Prior Building Permit Approvals:
      1.   Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans,
construction, size or designated use of any building or part thereof for which
a building permit has been issued before the effective date of this title, and
the construction of which shall have been started within six (6) months from
the date of such permit.
      2.   Effective upon the date of introduction of any ordinance amending
district boundaries, properties which are the subject of said proposed
ordinance shall be subject to the following restrictions until said ordinance
is finally acted upon by the common council:
         a.   No construction, structural alteration, moving or demolition for
which a permit is required shall be allowed.
         b.   No change of use shall be allowed.
   F.   Temporary Structures: Temporary structures erected for the purpose of
providing shelter for materials and equipment of those engaged in the
construction of a permanent building, or for use as a real estate sales field
office, shall not be required to conform to the regulations of this title.
Temporary structures shall require a temporary certificate of occupancy and
shall be allowed on the premises for a period not to exceed one year.
   G.   Service Station, Garage Or Parking Lot Location: No service station,
mechanical garage or public parking lot shall be erected, operated or
maintained where an entrance or exit for motor vehicles is located on the same
side of the street within three hundred feet (300') of a pedestrian entrance or
exit from a public or private school, park, parkway, playground, public
library, church, hospital, home for children or the aged, or other public or
semipublic institution of similar character.
   H.   Nonconforming Uses:
      1.   The existing lawful use of a building or premises at the time of the
enactment of this title or any amendment thereto may be continued although such
use does not conform with the provisions of this title for the district in
which it is located; but no building or premises containing a nonconforming use
shall be enlarged or extended. However, any building or structure, which is
considered nonconforming only because it cannot meet the setback requirements
of the zoning district, may be altered or structurally improved, provided that
such alteration or structural improvement shall not enlarge or extend any
existing nonconforming setback dimension.
      2.   If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a
building may be changed to another nonconforming use of a more restricted
classification. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a more
restricted nonconforming use or a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter
be changed to a less restricted use.
      3.   A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming
use of the same classification unless and until a permit therefor shall first
have been secured from the board of appeals, after investigation and public
hearing, provided that the board shall find that the proposed change of use
will be no more harmful to the character of the neighborhood than the existing
nonconforming use.
      4.   If the nonconforming use of a building or premises is discontinued
for a period of twelve (12) months, any future use of the building or premises
shall conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located.
      5.   The total structural repairs or alterations in any nonconforming use
shall not during its life exceed fifty percent (50%) of the equalized assessed
value of the building unless permanently changed to a conforming use.
      6.   The construction, improvement or alteration of fences, screenings or
plantings required for compliance with any other chapter or parts of this code
shall be deemed not to be structural repairs or alterations as those terms are
used in subsection H5 of this section.
   I.   Planned Unit Developments: Housing projects consisting of more than
twelve (12) dwelling units shall meet the requirements of a planned unit
development.
   J.   Accessory Buildings: Accessory buildings which are not a part of the
main building shall not occupy more than thirty percent (30%) of the area of
the required rear yard, shall not be more than eighteen feet (18') in building
height, as defined in this title, and shall not be nearer than six feet (6') to
any lot line. Where an accessory building is a part of the main building or is
substantially attached thereto, the side yard and rear yard requirements for
the main building shall be applied to the accessory building. Accessory
buildings on through lots shall comply with setback requirements on both street
frontages.
   K.   Uses Authorized After Investigation And Public Hearing: The board of
appeals, after investigation and public hearing, may authorize the location of
any of the following buildings or uses in any district, or, when specified,
only in the districts so specified from which they are excluded, provided that
the board shall find that the proposed location is necessary in order to serve
the public health, safety, convenience and welfare; and provided further, that
each such building or use shall comply with all other regulations for the
district in which it is proposed to be located. To protect the value of
neighboring buildings and uses, the board may attach reasonable conditions and
safeguards, in conformance with the general intent of this title. The following
uses may be authorized in any district or the districts specified, if any:

smaller than is required by this title, nor shall the density of population be
increased in any manner except in conformity with the area regulations hereby
established for the district in which a building or premises is located.
   B.   Where a lot has an area less than the minimum number of square feet per

district in which such building is to be located are each increased at least
one foot (1') for each foot of additional building height above the height
limit otherwise established for the district in which such building is to be
located.
   D.   Ornamental structures and accessory structures essential to the use or
protection of a building or to a manufacturing process carried on therein, when
the total horizontal cross sectional area of such structures does not exceed
twenty percent (20%) of the area of the roof to which they are attached; radio
and television broadcasting and receiving towers, telephone, telegraph and
power transmission poles, towers and lines, microwave radio relay structures

five feet (25') from any lot line.
   E.   Where a lot abuts on two (2) or more streets or alleys having different
average established grades, the higher of such grades shall control only for a
depth of one hundred twenty feet (120') from the line of the higher average
established grade.
   F.   On through lots which extend from street to street, the height of the
main building may be measured from the mean elevation of the finished grade

10-4-5: FRONT, SIDE AND REAR YARD REGULATIONS:
   A.   Yard Requirement For Each Lot: No part of a yard or other open space
provided about any building for the purpose of complying with the provisions of
this title shall be included as part of a yard or open space required for
another building.
   B.   Frontage Fifty Percent Or More: Where fifty percent (50%) or more of a
frontage is occupied by buildings having setbacks which are greater or less
than the setback required by this title for the district in which such frontage

setback of such buildings.
   C.   Frontage Less Than Fifty Percent: Where less than fifty percent (50%)
of a frontage is occupied by buildings, the following setbacks shall apply:
      1.   Where a vacant lot abuts an occupied lot having a setback greater
than is required by this title, the setback on the abutting vacant lot shall be
the average of the setback required by this title for the district in which
such lot is located and the setback on the occupied lot, or the average of such
required setback and the lesser of the setbacks on the occupied lots, if the
vacant lot abuts more than one occupied lot in the same frontage.
      2.   Where a vacant lot abuts a lot occupied by a building which has a
setback less than is required by this title, the setback on the vacant lot

not more than thirty inches (30"); provided that no such feature shall project
over a street line.
      2.   Bay Windows, Balconies And Chimneys: Bay windows, balconies and
chimneys may project into a required yard not more than three feet (3') in any
case, but not more than twenty percent (20%) of the width of any side yard
which does not abut on a street; provided that the total length of such
projections shall not be more than one-third (1/3) of the length of the
building wall on which they are located.
      3.   Fire Escapes: Fire escapes may project into a required yard not more
than five feet (5') in any case, but not more than twenty percent (20%) of the
width of any side yard which does not abut on a street; provided that no such

(1975 Code Ch. 18 § IV)
10-4-6: LAKE OR STREAM SETBACK LINES:
For the purpose of determining the distances buildings and other structures
shall be set back from lakes and streams, no land shall be used and no
buildings shall hereafter be converted in use, enlarged, structurally altered,
erected or moved except in accordance with the following rules as set forth in
chapter H65, Wisconsin administrative code:
   A.   Minimum Area And Width For Buildings Not Served By Public Sanitary
Sewer: The minimum lot area shall be twenty thousand (20,000) square feet and
the minimum lot width one hundred feet (100') at the building line and eighty
feet (80') at the water's edge.
   B.   Side Yards; Lot Sizes:
      1.   There shall be a side yard for each building not served by public
sanitary sewer. The minimum width of one side yard shall be ten feet (10'). The
minimum aggregate of both side yards shall be twenty five feet (25').
      2.   Lot sizes greater than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet shall be
provided in the following cases because in such instances a greater degree of
protection for natural resources and existing development is required:
         a.   Where soil conditions are such as to require larger lot sizes for
subdivisions of land under the provisions of chapter H65, Wisconsin
administrative code, then such large lot sizes shall be considered as required
by this title. (The building inspector is authorized to require percolation
tests as required by chapter H65, Wisconsin administrative code, before issuing
a building permit on soil he has reason to believe may be subject to this
provision.)
         b.   Where necessary to protect natural characteristics (such as
scenic beauty) or existing high quality development, lot sizes greater than
twenty thousand (20,000) square feet are required as determined by the planning
commission.
   C.   Substandard Lots:
      1.   Substandard Lots Served By A Public Sanitary Sewer: A substandard
lot served by a public sanitary sewer which is at least seven thousand five
hundred (7,500) square feet in area and is fifty feet (50') in width at the
building line and fifty feet (50') in width at the water line may be used as a
building site for a single-family dwelling upon issuance of a zoning permit, if
it meets the following requirements:
         a.   Such use is permitted in the zoning district.
         b.   The lot is of record in the county register of deeds office prior
to April 18, 1966.
         c.   The lot is in separate ownership from abutting lands. If abutting
lands and the substandard lot are owned by the same owner, the substandard lot
shall not be sold or used without full compliance with the terms of this title.
         d.   All dimensional requirements of this title are complied with
insofar as practicable.
      2.   Substandard Lots Not Served By Public Sanitary Sewer: The provisions
of subsection C1 of this section shall apply and, in addition, the minimum lot
area shall be ten thousand (10,000) square feet and the minimum lot width shall
be sixty six feet (66') at the building line and sixty six feet (66') at the
water line.
      3.   Other Substandard Lots: A building permit for the improvement of a
lot having lesser dimensions shall be issued only after the granting of a
variance by the board of appeals.
   D.   Setbacks From Water For Lots Abutting Navigable Waters:
      1.   All buildings and structures, except piers, marinas, boathouses and
similar uses which require a lesser setback, as determined by the board of
appeals, shall be set back at least seventy five feet (75') from the water line
and elevated at least two feet (2') above the experienced high water elevation,
unless otherwise specified by a floodplain zoning ordinance. Seepage pits and
soil absorption fields shall be set back at least fifty feet (50') from the
normal high water elevation. Boathouses shall not extend out over the high
water line and shall not be over eight feet (8') in height.
      2.   The building inspector shall determine the normal high water
elevation or line where not established.
   E.   Reduced Building Setbacks: A setback less than the setback required for
the appropriate class of highway may be permitted where there are at least five
(5) existing main buildings within five hundred feet (500') of the proposed
site that are built to less than the required setback. In such case, the
setback shall be the average of the nearest main building on each side of the
proposed site or, if there is not building on one side, the average of the
setback for the main building on one side and the required setback. Any other
setback may be permitted by the board of appeals.
   F.   Removal Of Shore Cover:
      1.   Purpose: These provisions shall apply within three hundred feet
(300') of all lakes and streams. Regulation of tree cutting along the shore of
navigable waters is necessary to protect scenic beauty, control erosion and
reduce effluent and nutrient flow from the shoreland. These provisions shall
not apply to the landowner, or to silvicultural thinning upon recommendation of
a forester.
      2.   Tree Cutting: Tree cutting in a strip paralleling the shoreline and
extending thirty five feet (35') inland from all points along the normal high
water mark of the shoreline shall be limited in accordance with the following
provisions:
         a.   No more than thirty percent (30%) of the length of this strip (as
measured along the normal high water mark) shall be clear cut to the depth of
the strip.
         b.   Provided further, that cutting of this thirty percent (30%) shall
not create a clear cut opening in this strip greater than thirty feet (30')
wide for every one hundred feet (100') of shoreline (measured along the normal
high water mark).
         c.   In the remaining seventy percent (70%) length of this strip
(distance measured along the normal high water mark) cutting shall leave
sufficient cover to screen cars, dwellings, accessory structures, except
boathouses, as seen from the water, to preserve natural beauty and to control
erosion.
         d.   Natural shrubbery shall be preserved as far as practicable, and
where removed it shall be replaced with other vegetation that is equally
effective in retarding runoff, preventing erosion and preserving natural
beauty.
         e.   The removal of natural shrubbery and its replacement shall
require the granting of a special exception by the building inspector.
         f.   When the highway setback and lake or stream setback regulations
conflict, the highway setback regulations shall govern.
         g.   Lake or stream setback regulations shall apply to all structures,
except piers or wharfs and boathouses. (1975 Code Ch. 18 § IV)

   A.   General Implementation Plan Process: Following the initial conference,
the applicant shall submit a general implementation plan to the city building
inspector together with an application for a zoning map amendment to a
traditional neighborhood development district.
      1.   Upon receipt of all the required submittal items for the general
implementation plan and an application for zoning map amendment, the building
inspector shall coordinate with other departments of the city to review the
plan and formulate a recommendation to the plan commission. At such time, the
city clerk shall schedule and give notice of public hearings before the plan
commission and common council in the same manner as required by section
10-3-1 of this title.
      2.   The plan commission shall review the proposed general implementation
plan in accordance with the review criteria set forth in this section. It shall
also consider the recommendation of the city staff and other comments received.
The plan commission shall then make its recommendation to the common council
for approval, approval with conditions, or denial.
      3.   The common council shall receive the recommendation from the plan
commission and a report from the municipal staff. Upon due consideration, the
common council shall either:
         a.   Approve the general implementation plan and zoning map amendment;
         b.   Approve the general implementation plan and zoning map amendment
with modifications; or
         c.   Deny the general implementation plan and zoning map amendment.
      4.   Final action on the general implementation plan lies with the common
council.
      5.   Approval by the common council of a general implementation plan
shall constitute an amendment to the zoning ordinance establishing the
traditional neighborhood development district, and that district shall be noted
on the official zoning map.
   B.   General Implementation Plan Submittal Requirements: The purpose of the
general implementation plan is to establish the intent, density, and intensity
for a proposed development. The general implementation plan shall include the
following:
      1.   A general location map of suitable scale, but no less than one inch
equals two hundred feet (1" = 200'), which shows the location of the property
within the community and adjacent parcels including locations of any public
streets, railroads, major streams or rivers and other major features within
three hundred fifty feet (350') of the site.
      2.   A site inventory and analysis to identify site assets or resources,
and constraints, including, but not limited to, floodplains, wetlands and soils
classified as "poorly drained" or "very poorly drained", soils with bedrock at
or within forty two inches (42") of the surface, utility easements for high
tension electrical transmission lines (>69kV), steep slopes greater than twelve
percent (12%) and brownfields.
      3.   A conceptual site plan, at a scale of no less than one inch equals
one hundred feet (1" = 100'), which indicates topography in two foot (2')
contours consisting of a map with proposed features and existing site features
and uses that will remain. These features should include building outlines,
location of streets, transit stops, drives and parking areas, pedestrian and
bicycle paths, service access areas for receiving material and trash removal,
and other impervious surfaces. The location of the proposed, and existing to
remain, trees and shrubs should also be included, along with any other
significant features.
      4.   A conceptual stormwater management plan identifying the proposed
patterns of major stormwater runoff, locations of stormwater infiltration
areas, and other significant stormwater best management practices.
      5.   Identification of the architectural style(s) of the traditional
neighborhood development and the accompanying site design style(s). The design
style of the traditional neighborhood development shall be conveyed with
drawings or computer simulations of typical proposed building elevations
(including dimensions of building height and width, and facade treatment).
      6.   A written report that provides general information about the
covenants, conservation easements, or agreements which will influence the use
and maintenance of the proposed development. The report shall also describe the
site conditions and the development objectives.
      7.   Names of owners of land within three hundred fifty feet (350') of
proposed development.
      8.   Any other information deemed necessary by the city in order to
evaluate plans.

Single-family dwellings.
"Special needs" housing, such as community living arrangements and assisted
living facilities.
Two-family dwellings.
   B.   Mixed use area, of commercial, residential, civic or institutional, and
open space uses as identified below. All residents should be within
approximately one-fourth (1/4) mile or a five (5) minute walk from existing or
proposed commercial, civic, and open space areas. Individual businesses should
not exceed six thousand (6,000) square feet in size.
      1.   Commercial uses:

   C.   Open space uses identified below should be incorporated in the
traditional neighborhood development, as appropriate. Large outdoor recreation
areas should be located at the periphery of neighborhoods rather than central
locations.
Community parks.
Environmental corridors.
Protected natural areas.
Stormwater detention/retention facilities.
Streams, ponds, and other water bodies. (1975 Code Ch. 18 § XXIV)
10-18-4-2: DEVELOPMENT UNITS:

permitted shall be calculated the same as subsection A of this section, plus an
additional number of units not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the amount
permitted above.
      2.   All dwelling units constructed above commercial uses shall be
permissible in addition to the number of dwelling units authorized under this
section. However, the total number of dwelling units shall not be increased by
more than ten (10) dwelling units or ten percent (10%), whichever is greater.
      3.   The total ground floor area of nonresidential development uses,
including off street parking areas, shall not exceed twenty five percent (25%)
of the traditional neighborhood development. (1975 Code Ch. 18 § XXIV)
10-18-4-3: OPEN SPACE:
At least fifteen percent (15%) of the gross acreage of the traditional
neighborhood development must be open space. Open space may include
undevelopable areas such as steep slopes and wetlands, and stormwater detention
and retention basins. At least twenty five percent (25%) of the open space must
be common open space dedicated to the public for park land. Ninety percent
(90%) of the lots within the areas devoted to mixed residential uses shall be
within a one-fourth (1/4) mile from common open space. (1975 Code Ch. 18
§ XXIV)
10-18-4-4: STORMWATER MANAGEMENT:
The design and development of the traditional neighborhood development should
minimize off site stormwater runoff, promote on site filtration, and minimize
the discharge of pollutants to ground and surface water. Natural topography and

perimeter blocks that are generally in the range of two hundred (200) to four
hundred feet (400') deep by four hundred (400) to eight hundred feet (800')
long. A variety of lot sizes should be provided to facilitate housing diversity
and choice and meet the projected requirements of people with different housing
needs.
   B.   Lot Widths: Lot widths should create a relatively symmetrical street
cross section that reinforces the public space of the street as a simple,
unified public space.
   C.   Building Setback, Front; Mixed Use Area: Structures in the mixed use
area have no minimum setback. Commercial and civic or institutional buildings
should abut the sidewalks in the mixed use area.

twenty five feet (25'). Two-family residences and multiple-residences shall
have a building setback in the front between ten (10) and fifteen feet (15').
   E.   Building Setback, Rear; Areas Of Mixed Residential Uses: The principal
building on lots devoted to single-family residences shall be set back no less
than thirty feet (30') from the rear lot line.
   F.   Side Setbacks: Provision for zero lot line single-family dwellings
should be made; provided, that a reciprocal access easement is recorded for
both lots and townhouses or other attached dwellings; provided further, that
all dwellings have pedestrian access to the rear yard through means other than
the principal structure. (1975 Code Ch. 18 § XXIV)
10-18-4-6: CIRCULATION STANDARDS:
The circulation system shall allow for different modes of transportation. The
circulation system shall provide functional and visual links within the
residential areas, mixed use area, and open space of the traditional
neighborhood development and shall be connected to existing and proposed
external development. The circulation system shall provide adequate traffic
capacity, provide connected pedestrian and bicycle routes (especially off
street bicycle or multi-use paths or bicycle lanes on the streets), control
through traffic, limit lot access to streets of lower traffic volumes, and
promote safe and efficient mobility through the traditional neighborhood
development. See table 1 of this section for minimum street standards.

to minimize conflicts with pedestrians and bicycles. Traffic calming features
such as "queuing streets", curb extensions, traffic circles, and medians may be
used to encourage slow traffic speeds.
      1.   Street Hierarchy: Each street within a traditional neighborhood
development shall be classified according to the following (arterial streets
should not bisect a traditional neighborhood development):
         a.   Collector: This street provides access to commercial or mixed use
buildings, but it is part of the city's major street network. On street
parking, whether diagonal or parallel, helps to slow traffic. Additional
parking is provided in lots to the side or rear of buildings.
         b.   Subcollector: This street provides primary access to individual
residential properties and connects streets of lower and higher function.
         c.   Local Street: This street provides primary access to individual
residential properties where traffic volumes are relatively low.
         d.   Alley: These streets provide secondary access to residential
properties where street frontages are narrow, where the street is designed with
a narrow width to provide limited on street parking, or where alley access
development is desired to increase residential densities. Alleys may also
provide delivery access or alternate parking access to commercial properties.
      2.   Street Layout: The traditional neighborhood development should
maintain the existing street grid, where present, and restore any disrupted
street grid where feasible.
      3.   Parking Requirements: Parking areas for shared or community use
should be encouraged. In addition, off street parking spaces shall be provided
as required by city ordinance.
      4.   Service Access: Access for service vehicles should provide a direct
route to service and loading dock areas, while avoiding movement through
parking areas. (1975 Code Ch. 18 § XXIV)
10-18-4-7: ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS:
A variety of architectural features and building materials is encouraged to
give each building or group of buildings a distinct character.
   A.   Guidelines For New Structures:
      1.   Height: New structures within a traditional neighborhood development
shall be no more than three (3) stories.
      2.   Entries And Facades:
         a.   The architectural features, materials, and the articulation of a
facade of a building shall be continued on all sides visible from a public
street.
         b.   The front facade of the principal building on any lot in a
traditional neighborhood development shall face onto a public street.
         c.   The front facade shall not be oriented to face directly toward a
parking lot.
         d.   Porches, pent roofs, roof overhangs, hooded front doors, or other
similar architectural elements shall define the front entrance to all
residences.
         e.   For commercial buildings, a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the
front facade on the ground floor shall be transparent, consisting of window or
door openings allowing views into and out of the interior.
         f.   New structures on opposite sides of the same street should follow
similar design guidelines. This provision shall not apply to buildings
bordering civic uses.
   B.   Guidelines For Garages And Secondary Dwelling Units: Garages and
secondary dwelling units may be placed on a single-family residential lot
within the principal building or an accessory building; provided, that the
secondary dwelling unit shall not exceed eight hundred (800) square feet.
   C.   Guidelines For Exterior Signage: A comprehensive sign program is
required for the entire traditional neighborhood development which establishes
a uniform sign theme. Signs shall share a common style (e.g., size, shape,
material) and conform with provisions of the sign ordinance provided in title
9, chapter 6 of this code.
   D.   Guidelines For Lighting:
      1.   Street lighting shall be provided along all streets. Generally more,
smaller lights, as opposed to fewer, high intensity lights, should be used.
Street lighting design shall meet the minimum standards developed by the
illumination engineering society.
      2.   Exterior lighting shall be directed downward in order to reduce
glare onto adjacent properties. (1975 Code Ch. 18 § XXIV)
10-18-4-8: LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING STANDARDS:
Overall composition and location of landscaping shall complement the scale of
the development and its surroundings. In general, larger, well placed
contiguous planting areas shall be preferred to smaller, disconnected areas.
Where screening is required by this chapter, it shall be at least three feet
(3') in height, unless otherwise specified. Required screening shall be at
least fifty percent (50%) opaque throughout the year. Required screening shall
be satisfied by one or some combination of a decorative fence not less than
fifty percent (50%) opaque behind a continuous landscaped area, a masonry wall,
or a hedge.
   A.   Street Trees: A minimum of one deciduous canopy tree per forty feet
(40') of street frontage, or fraction thereof, shall be required. Trees can be
clustered and do not need to be evenly spaced. Trees should preferably be
located between the sidewalk and the curb, within the landscaped area of a
boulevard, or in tree wells installed in pavement or concrete. If placement of
street trees within the right of way will interfere with utility lines, trees
may be planted within the front yard setback adjacent to the sidewalk.
   B.   Parking Area Landscaping And Screening:
      1.   Provisions: All parking and loading areas fronting public streets or
sidewalks, and all parking and loading areas abutting residential districts or
uses, shall provide:

   A.   Application As Overlay District: The planned unit development (PUD)
shall be applied as an overlay zoning district and is allowed in all zones
except conservancy and agriculture. When applied to a specific geographic area,
the PUD shall have the effect of allowing development to be designed, reviewed,
approved, constructed and managed according to the provisions of this chapter,
rather than as required by the underlying zoning district. However, the
underlying zoning district shall prevail in determining permitted and
conditional uses of land within the PUD as well as the maximum permitted
project density or intensity of land use, except as otherwise provided herein.
   B.   Development Applications: The planned unit development process shall be
required for the following development applications:
      1.   Any development where variations in lot sizes, dimensional
standards, clustering of principal buildings on one lot, provisions for common
open space, or other design considerations which are not normally allowed under
standard zoning districts and subdivision provisions are desired.
      2.   Any commercial or multi-family residential development involving a
shopping center, an office park, a business park, clustered multiple-family
dwellings or other unified development themes.
   C.   Improvements: Improvements, consistent with current city standards or
plans, including, but not limited to, comprehensive plan, bike plan, capital
improvements, and park plan, may be required as a condition of approval of a
planned development. Improvements may include, but are not limited to, paving,
curbs, gutters, sidewalks, bikeways, water lines, sewer lines, drainage works,
streetlights and landscaping. (1975 Code Ch. 18 § XX)

10-3-1 of this title.
The plan commission shall review the proposed general development plan in
accordance with the review criteria set forth in this chapter. It shall also
consider the recommendation of the city staff and other comments received. The
plan commission shall then make its recommendation to the common council for
approval, approval with conditions, or denial.
Final action on the general development plans lies with the common council.
Approval by the common council of a general development plan shall constitute
an amendment to the zoning ordinance establishing the appropriate PUD district,
and that district shall be noted on the official zoning map. If the general
development plan requires rezoning for permitted use or a conditional use
permit, common council approval of the general development plan is conditional
upon the rezoning or conditional use permit being granted.
   C.   Final Plan:
      1.   Following approval of a general development plan, a final plan of
the PUD shall be submitted to the building inspector for review. In the case of
a single phase PUD, the applicant may combine the general development plan and
final plan stages of the review process and follow the procedure set forth in
this chapter. The purpose of the final plan is to finalize the detailed
planning, engineering, design, ownership, management, maintenance and timing
aspects of the development. For this reason, the final plan will be prepared
only for those portions of a PUD which are expected to be developed in the
immediate future.
      2.   The final plan shall be in conformance with the approved general
development plan. If it is found that a proposed final plan differs from the
approved general development plan, the applicant must submit a new general
development plan beginning with the process in subsection A of this section.
      3.   No building permits shall be issued for construction within the PUD
without first obtaining common council approval of a final plan for that
portion of the PUD. All grading, construction, landscaping and other activities
associated with land development shall be carried out in strict conformance
with the approved final plan.
      4.   The list of items required to be submitted with a final plan are as
follows:
         a.   Actual external dimensions of buildings and distances to lot
lines.
         b.   Storm drainage system including calculations, sizing, materials
and location.
         c.   Proposed landscaping, including plant species, fences and
retaining walls.
         d.   Water main sizing, fire flows, materials and location.
         e.   Sanitary sewer main sizing, materials and location. If a grinder
pump or lift station is proposed, design calculations will be required.
         f.   Certified survey map.
      5.   Upon receipt of all the required items for the final plan, the
building inspector shall coordinate its review with other city departments for
the purpose of reviewing the final plan for compliance with the approved
general development plan. The proposed final plan shall then be brought to the
common council for final approval and development may then commence
accordingly. (1975 Code Ch. 18 § XX)
10-19-3: REVIEW CRITERIA:
   A.   General Development Plan:

consideration the recommendations of the city staff and comments received at
its public hearing.
   B.   Final Plan: In reviewing a final plan, the common council shall
consider the following criteria:
      1.   Strict conformance of the final plan to the adopted general
development plan, particularly in terms of the general layout and design of the
PUD; the overall density of dwelling units; the number and type of dwelling
units; the major categories of land use; the mix, magnitude and intensity of
nonresidential types of land uses; the parking and traffic circulation system;
and major features of the open space area.
      2.   The review criteria set forth in subsection A of this section.
   C.   Recording; Conditions Run With The Land:
      1.   A document shall be recorded by the applicant within thirty (30)
days of approval in the office of the register of deeds for the county within
which the PUD is located. Said document shall identify the property as being
part of a PUD which is on file with the city. Applicant shall furnish evidence
of such recording to the city prior to any final plan approval for multiple
phased projects or within fifteen (15) days of final approval for single phased
projects.
      2.   Any conditions attached to a general development plan or final plan
shall run with the land and shall not lapse or be waived as the result of any
subsequent change in the tenancy or ownership of any or all of said lands. Such
conditions shall be deemed to be part of the building permit issued for any use
or structure within the PUD.
   D.   Fees: Fees for a PUD general development plan approval shall be five
hundred dollars ($500.00) and for a PUD final plan approval shall be two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00). Fees are due from the applicant at the time of
plan submittal. (1975 Code Ch. 18 § XX)
10-19-4: STANDARDS AND SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Density And Housing Type (Residential PUD):
      1.   The maximum number of dwelling units per acre (project density) for
the PUD as a whole shall be based upon the underlying zoning district.
      2.   Adequate public and private facilities and services must be
available, both on and off the site, to support the number of units, including,
but not limited to, streets, parking, traffic control, water, sewer, drainage,
fire and police protection, recreational facilities, and schools.
      3.   The residential PUD will be based upon the following criteria:
         a.   Appropriateness of the scale and massing of structures.
         b.   Use of varied building elevations and staggered setbacks.
         c.   Effectiveness of landscaping, screening and buffering within the
PUD and along its perimeter.
         d.   Overall quality of design of the development, including, but not
limited to, streetscape, parking lots, open space, buildings, lighting, signs,
and pedestrian pathways.
         e.   Varied placement of buildings, demonstrating sensitivity to the
natural topographic features of the site.
         f.   Retention of unique natural features of the site and
incorporation of such features into the project's overall design.
         g.   Recreation areas that are provided are directly accessible to a
majority of the dwellings and are well designed for their intended purpose.
   B.   Lot Area, Lot Width, Setbacks: Lot area, lot width and setback
requirements for the PUD may vary from the underlying zoning district, provided
the developer has demonstrated that the proposed design and layout meet the
provisions of this chapter. Lot areas, lot widths and setbacks within the PUD
perimeter shall be designed to be compatible to existing or planned land uses
immediately outside the development.
   C.   Building And Structure Heights: Building and structure heights can only
exceed the maximum established by the underlying zoning district expressly
requested by the applicant and upon approval of such as part of the general
development plan.
   D.   Common Open Space (Residential PUD):
      1.   Since the PUD concept of development is intended to provide more
functional open space and to make more efficient use of land, utilities and
other improvements, at least fifteen percent (15%) of the total gross land area
of the PUD, exclusive of areas listed in subsection D3 of this section, shall
be permanently reserved as common open space. This provision may be waived by
the common council when it is determined that other options for providing open
space are available.
      2.   Common open space may be held in common, be privately owned, or
dedicated to the public, or any combination thereof. Any land dedicated to the
public must be officially accepted by the common council before such dedication
becomes valid. Land dedicated to the public may be considered part of the
required common open space area for the PUD.
      3.   The following areas shall not be included in calculating the minimum
amount of common space for the PUD:
         a.   Areas within required front and side yard setbacks.
         b.   Open spaces less than thirty feet (30') wide, unless approved as
a common pathway system.
         c.   Existing or proposed street rights of way.
         d.   Parking areas and driveways.
         e.   Building sites, unless used for recreational purposes.
      4.   Up to twenty five percent (25%) of the required common open space
may consist of designated floodway, the surface area of water bodies and/or
areas having slopes greater than thirty percent (30%), only if the following
findings are made:
         a.   Said areas are available by legal right for the use and enjoyment
of the residents of the PUD;
         b.   Said areas are functional in providing for the open space and
outdoor recreation needs of the residents of the PUD; and
         c.   Said areas are safely and conveniently accessible to the
residents of the PUD.
      5.   In the case of a PUD being developed in phases, an appropriate
proportion of the gross area of each phase of the PUD (subject to final
implementation plan approval) shall be reserved for common open space at all
times, unless such requirement is waived by the common council.
      6.   At the time of final plan approval, provision must be demonstrated
for the ownership and perpetual care and maintenance of all common open space
areas. Areas designated as common open space shall be permanently reserved as
such, using appropriate legal instruments, as approved by the city attorney, at
the time of final implementation plan approval. Covenants or other legal
arrangements shall specify ownership of the common open space, method of
maintenance, responsibility for maintenance, maintenance taxes and insurance,
compulsory membership and assessment provisions, guarantees that any entity
formed to own and maintain the common open space will not be dissolved without
the consent of the common council, and any specifications deemed reasonably
necessary by the common council.
   E.   Building Spacing And Orientation: The minimum spacing allowed between
buildings shall not be less than required by the applicable building codes.
However, greater distances may be required, taking into consideration the need
for privacy, light and ventilation, fire and safety, traffic circulation and
open space.
   F.   Off Street Parking: Off street parking spaces shall be provided as
required by city ordinance.
   G.   Streets, Utilities And Drainage:
      1.   All publicly dedicated streets, utilities and all drainage
facilities shall be designed in accordance with city code and policy.
      2.   Private streets shall only be allowed as approved on the general
development plan.
   H.   Circulation/Access:
      1.   Vehicular access to individual lots adjoining an arterial street, as
defined under the functional street classification system of the city, shall be
by way of a frontage road, service road, or other local street. Local street
access to arterial streets shall be minimized to whatever extent possible. Lot
access to collector streets shall be minimized to whatever extent is possible.
      2.   Each PUD shall be provided with at least two (2) separate points of
ingress and egress unless waived by the common council. Principal vehicular
access points to the project shall be designed to encourage smooth traffic
flows with controlled turning movements and minimum hazards to vehicular and
pedestrian traffic.
      3.   Internal streets, drives and parking surface areas shall be paved
and provide safe and convenient access to dwelling units and recreational
facilities, and for service and emergency vehicles. Streets shall not be
designed to encourage outside traffic to traverse the PUD on local streets, nor
create unnecessary fragmentation of the PUD into the smaller subareas.
   I.   Landscaping, Screening And Buffering: Landscaping must be in
conformance with title 9, chapter 9 of this code. In order to protect the
integrity of a PUD, and deemed necessary to provide protection to adjacent
properties, landscaping, screening and buffering may be required as part of the
general development plan. If so required, a screening and landscape plan shall
be submitted to the department for approval in conjunction with final plan
approval for each phase of a PUD. Landscape plans shall show the location,
species of plant material and the size of all plant materials. Screening plans
shall include typical details of fences, berms, and plant material to be used.
   J.   Signs: Signs shall be in conformance with title 9, chapter 6 of this
code. (1975 Code Ch. 18 § XX)

growths, the use of land, or any other matter, the more stringent regulations
or ordinances shall govern and prevail. (Ord. 2007-11, 8-6-2007)
10-20-4: PREEXISTING PERMITTED USE:
   A.   Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction
or alteration of any structure, if the construction or alteration of such was
begun prior to the effective date of this chapter, and if such is diligently
prosecuted.
   B.   Because of the special nature of this district with its unique purpose
and justification, the owner of any preexisting permitted use which, as a
result of fire, explosion, or other casualty, is damaged or destroyed, shall be
allowed to rebuild, reconstruct or rehabilitate the same preexisting permitted
use of the same parcel, provided all of the following requirements are met:
      1.   The preexisting permitted use complies with the height limitation
imposed by this chapter, and a statement showing such compliance is signed by
the department prior to any rebuilding, reconstruction, or rehabilitation.

may be expanded, altered, or otherwise enlarged as long as all of the following
requirements are met:
      1.   The expansion, alteration, or enlargement meets the requirements of
height limitation zoning, and a statement showing such compliance is signed by
the department prior to the expansion, alteration, or enlargement.
      2.   The expansion, alteration, or enlargement in no way increases or
creates any hazard within the airspace required for the flight of aircraft in
landing or taking off, or creates or increases any potential hazard to any
persons on the ground.
      3.   The expansion, alteration, or enlargement shall not exceed twenty
five percent (25%) of the gross floor area of the structure in existence as of
the effective date hereof. (Ord. 2007-11, 8-6-2007)

10-20-2 of this chapter, based upon the provisions, standards, and requirements
of this chapter, and state and federal airport safety standards.
   C.   If the proposed development is approved by the department and meets the
building requirements of the affected municipality, a building permit shall be
issued by the municipality. If the proposed development is not approved by the
department, no building permit shall be issued by the affected municipality.
   D.   The department shall have the right to remove, at the owner's expense,
any use, object, or structure which was developed, constructed, placed or
planted after the adoption of this chapter and found to be in violation of this
chapter. (Ord. 2007-11, 8-6-2007)
10-20-6: AIRPORT ZONES AND DISTRICT REGULATIONS:
In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby created
and established six (6) zones as shown on the airport zoning map, consisting of
one sheet, attached to ordinance 2007-11, and made a part of this chapter by
reference. For the purpose of this chapter, the lands and waters within three
(3) statute miles from the boundaries of the airport are divided into six (6)
districts defined as follows:
   A.   Zone 1 - Airport District: The "airport district" is defined as all
those lands controlled by the airport, either by fee ownership or by an
easement, and intended to be used for airport purposes. The airport district is
created to encompass areas that, due to the operation of aircraft, could be
exposed to excessive noise, are within the aircraft approach and departure
areas, or are in areas which are exposed to a greater risk of aircraft crashes
(crash hazard area). The airport district is established to protect the
approaches to the airport from incompatible land uses, and to preserve the
airport's ability to serve its present and future air transportation needs. Any
new building, or expansion, alteration, or enlargement of any existing
building, structure, or property within this zone must be approved by the
department. Any construction, expansion, alteration, or enlargement must
receive a favorable airspace review from FAA and the Wisconsin bureau of
aeronautics. The boundaries of the airport district are shown on the airport
zoning map.
      1.   Permitted Uses And Structures: Only uses and structures that are

of structures or objects shall comply with FAA design standards associated with
critical aircraft data presented on the latest approved airport layout plan,
and shall comply with FAA federal air regulation part 77.25, "Objects Affecting
Navigable Airspace - Civil Airport Imaginary Surfaces", by not penetrating any
of the design or imaginary surfaces.
   B.   Zone 2 - Runway Approach And Departure District: The purpose of this
district is to establish land use requirements in areas that are typically
overflown by aircraft during takeoff and landing maneuvers, and hence could be
subjected to excessive noise and greater risk of aircraft crashes.
      1.   Permitted Uses:
Agriculture, including essential nonresidential facilities.
Airport owned or operated facilities.
Commercial and governmental uses that are not places of public assembly.
Floriculture, horticulture, silvaculture, orchards, hatcheries, game farms,
except aviaries.

municipal setback requirements of the applicable municipal zoning code.
         c.   Lot Density: The maximum lot coverage allowed is fifty percent
(50%) or as allowed by the underlying municipal jurisdiction, whichever is more
restrictive.
   C.   Zone 2A - Modified Runway Approach And Departure District 2A: The
purpose of this district is to establish land use requirements similar to, but
less restrictive than zone 2, in areas that are overflown by aircraft during
takeoff and landing maneuvers, and hence could be subjected to occasional
excessive noise and risk of aircraft crashes.
      1.   Permitted Uses:

the water level has been lowered by pumping of the well.
EXISTING FACILITIES: "Existing facilities" means current facilities, practices,
and activities which may cause, or threaten to cause, environmental pollution
within that portion of the City's wellhead protection area that lies within the
corporate limits of the City. Existing facilities include, but are not limited
to, the type listed in the Department of Natural Resources' form 3300-215,
Public Water Supply Potential Contaminant Use Inventory Form which is
incorporated herein as if fully set forth.
GROUNDWATER PROTECTION OVERLAY DISTRICT: "Groundwater Protection Overlay
District" means that portion of the recharge area for the City wells that lies
within the City limits as shown on the City's official zoning map.
RECHARGE AREA: "Recharge area" means the land area which contributes water to a
well by infiltration of water into the subsurface and movement with groundwater
toward the well.
TIME OF TRAVEL: "Time of travel" means the determined or estimated time
required for a contaminant to move in the saturated zone from a specific point
to a well.
WELL FIELD: "Well field" means a piece of land used primarily for the purpose
of supplying a location for construction of wells to supply a Municipal water
system. (Ord. 2018-11, 9-17-2018)
10-22-3: GROUNDWATER PROTECTION OVERLAY DISTRICT:
   A.   The Groundwater Protection Overlay District is hereby divided into the
following zones: A, B, and C.

well aquifer and as the area most likely to transmit groundwater contamination
to the Municipal wells. Zone A is more restrictive than Zones B or C. This zone
extends four hundred feet (400') from each well.
         a.   Permitted Uses - Zone A: The following uses are permitted uses
within the Groundwater Protection Zone A. Uses not listed shall be considered
prohibited uses:
Parks, provided there is no on-site waste disposal or fuel storage tank
facilities associated with this use.
Playgrounds.
Residential, commercial, and industrial property, which is Municipally sewered,
and free of flammable and combustible liquid and underground storage tanks
(USTs).

      8.   Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage
and result in conflicts between property owners; and
      9.   Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable
alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain.
(Ord. 2007-04, 5-7-2007)
12-1-2: TITLE:
This title shall be known as the FLOODPLAIN ZONING ORDINANCE FOR MENOMONIE,
WISCONSIN. (Ord. 2007-04, 5-7-2007)
12-1-3: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Areas To Be Regulated: This title regulates all areas that would be
covered by the regional flood or base flood. Note: Base flood elevations are
derived from the flood profiles in the flood insurance study. Regional flood
elevations may be derived from other studies. Areas covered by the base flood
are identified as A zones on the flood insurance rate map.
   B.   Official Maps And Revisions: The boundaries of all floodplain districts
are designated as floodplains or A zones on the maps listed below and the
revisions in the city of Menomonie floodplain appendix. Any change to the base
flood elevations (BFE) in the flood insurance study (FIS) or on the flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA
before it is effective. No changes to regional flood elevations (RFEs) on non-
FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and
revisions are on file in the office of the city clerk of the city of Menomonie.
If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive
information shall apply.
      1.   Official maps based on the FIS: (Ord. 2007-04, 5-7-2007)
         a.   Flood insurance rate map (FIRM), panel numbers 55033C0312C,
55033C0314C, 55033C0316C, 55033C0317C, 55033C0318C, 55033C0319C, 55033C0336C,
55033C0427C and 55033C0431C, FIRM effective date December 2, 2011; with
corresponding profiles that are based on the flood insurance study (FIS)
effective date December 2, 2011, volume number 55033CV000A; (Ord. 2011-09, 10-
17-2011)
      2.   Official maps based on other studies:
         a.   Floodplain study appendix: See subsection 12-8-10A of this title.
   C.   Establishment Of Districts: The regional floodplain areas are divided
into three (3) districts as follows:
      1.   The floodway district (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and
those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the
regional floodwaters.
      2.   The floodfringe district (FF) is that portion of the floodplain
between the regional flood limits and the floodway.
      3.   The general floodplain district (GFP) is those areas that have been
or may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood.
   D.   Locating Floodplain Boundaries: Discrepancies between boundaries on the
official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved
using the criteria in subsection D1 or D2 of this section. If a significant
difference exists, the map shall be amended according to section
12-8-8 of this title. The building inspector can rely on a boundary derived
from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a
map amendment is required. The building inspector shall be responsible for
documenting actual predevelopment field conditions and the basis upon which the
district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required
under this section. Disputes between the building inspector and an applicant
over the district boundary line shall be settled according to subsection 12-8-
4C of this title and the criteria in subsections D1 and D2 of this section.
      1.   If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations
shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations
shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
      2.   Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary
shall be determined by the map scale, visual on site inspection and any
information provided by the department.
Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations
from a FIRM, FEMA must also approve any map amendment pursuant to subsection
12-8-8A5 of this title.
   E.   Removal Of Lands From Floodplain: Compliance with the provisions of
this title shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it
is filled at least two feet (2') above the regional or base flood elevation,
the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended
pursuant to section
12-8-8 of this title.
Note: This procedure does not remove the requirements for the mandatory
purchase of flood insurance. The property owner must contact FEMA to request a
"letter of map change" (LOMC).
   F.   Compliance: Any development or use within the areas regulated by this
title shall be in compliance with the terms of this title, and other applicable
local, state, and federal regulations.
   G.   Municipalities And State Agencies Regulated: Unless specifically
exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to
comply with this title and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are
required to comply if section 13.48(13), Wisconsin statutes, applies. The
construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and
bridges by the Wisconsin department of transportation is exempt when section
30.2022, Wisconsin statutes, applies.
   H.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions:
      1.   This title supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under section 62.23, Wisconsin statutes, or section 87.30,
Wisconsin statutes, which relate to floodplains. If another ordinance is more
restrictive than this title, that ordinance shall continue in full force and
effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
      2.   This title is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this title imposes
greater restrictions, the provisions of this title shall prevail.
   I.   Interpretation: In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this title are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the
governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers
granted by the Wisconsin statutes. If a provision of this title, required by
chapter NR 116, Wisconsin administrative code, is unclear, the provision shall
be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption
of this title or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to
this title.
   J.   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The flood protection standards in
this title are based on engineering experience and scientific research. Larger
floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural
causes. This title does not imply or guarantee that nonfloodplain areas or
permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. Nor
does this title create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against,
the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
may result from reliance on this title.
   K.   Severability: Should any portion of this title be declared
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder
of this title shall not be affected.
   L.   Annexed Areas For Cities: The Dunn County floodplain zoning provisions
in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be
enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality
adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of chapter NR
116, Wisconsin administrative code, and the national flood insurance program
(NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning
map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the
purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the
municipal building inspector. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the
regional flood elevation and the location of the floodway.
   M.   General Development Standards: The community shall review all permit
applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably
safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood prone area, all
new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed or modified and
adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the
structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed
with materials resistant to flood damage; be constructed by methods and
practices that minimize flood damages; and be constructed with electrical,
heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other
service facilities designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering
or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All
subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include
regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the
"subdivision" definition of this title. (Ord. 2007-04, 5-7-2007)

rate maps, that accompany the flood insurance study, form the basis for both
the regulatory and the insurance aspects of the national flood insurance
program.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas caused by one of the following
conditions:
A. The overflow or rise of inland waters;

FLOODFRINGE: That portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway which is
covered by floodwaters during the regional flood and associated with standing
water rather than flowing water.
FLOODPLAIN: Land which has been or may be covered by floodwater during the
regional flood. It includes the floodway and the floodfringe, and may include
other designated floodplain areas for regulatory purposes.

FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural provisions, changes or adjustments
to properties and structures, water and sanitary facilities and contents of
buildings subject to flooding, for the purpose of reducing or eliminating flood
damage.
FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain
adjoining the channel required to carry the regional flood discharge.
FREEBOARD: A safety factor expressed in terms of a specified number of feet
above a calculated flood level. Freeboard compensates for any factors that
cause flood heights greater than those calculated, including ice jams, debris
accumulation, wave action, obstruction of bridge openings and floodways, the
effects of watershed urbanization, loss of flood storage areas due to
development and aggregation of the river or stream bed.
HABITABLE STRUCTURE: Any structure or portion thereof used or designed for
human habitation.
HEARING NOTICE: Publication or posting meeting the requirements of chapter 985,
Wisconsin statutes. For appeals, a class 1 notice, published once at least one
week (7 days) before the hearing, is required. For all zoning ordinances and
amendments, a class 2 notice, published twice, once each week consecutively,
the last at least a week (7 days) before the hearing. Local ordinances or
bylaws may require additional notice, exceeding these minimums.
HIGH FLOOD DAMAGE POTENTIAL: Damage that could result from flooding that
includes any danger to life or health or any significant economic loss to a
structure or building and its contents.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is either:
   A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places or
preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the
requirements for individual listing on the national register;
   B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district;
   C.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states
with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary
of the interior; or
   D.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either
by an approved state program, as determined by the secretary of the interior,
or by the secretary of the interior in states without approved programs.
INCREASE IN REGIONAL FLOOD HEIGHT: A calculated upward rise in the regional
flood elevation, equal to or greater than 0.01 foot, based on a comparison of
existing conditions and proposed conditions which is directly attributable to
development in the floodplain but not attributable to manipulation of
mathematical variables such as roughness factors, expansion and contraction
coefficients and discharge.
LAND USE: Any nonstructural use made of unimproved or improved real estate
(also see definition of Development).
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" includes a mobile home but does not include a "mobile
recreational vehicle".
MOBILE RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle which is built on a single chassis, four
hundred (400) square feet or less, when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, designed to be self-propelled, carried or permanently towable by a
licensed, light duty vehicle, is licensed for highway use if registration is
required and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
Manufactured homes that are towed or carried onto a parcel of land, but do not
remain capable of being towed or carried, including park model homes, do not
fall within the definition of "mobile recreational vehicles".
MUNICIPALITY OR MUNICIPAL: The county, city or village governmental units
enacting, administering and enforcing this floodplain zoning ordinance.
NAVD OR NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM: Elevations referenced to mean sea level
datum, 1988 adjustment.
NGVD OR NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM: Elevations referenced to mean sea
level datum, 1929 adjustment.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means
structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the
effective date of floodplain zoning regulations adopted by this community and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For the purpose of
determining flood insurance rates, it includes any structures for which the
"start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial
FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE: An existing lawful structure or building which is not
in conformity with the dimensional or structural requirements of this title for
the area of the floodplain which it occupies. (For example, an existing
residential structure in the floodfringe district is a conforming use. However,
if the lowest floor is lower than the flood protection elevation, the structure
is nonconforming.)
NONCONFORMING USE: An existing lawful use or accessory use of a structure or
building which is not in conformity with the provisions of this title for the
area of the floodplain which it occupies (such as a residence in the floodway).
OBSTRUCTION TO FLOW: Any development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters
such that this development alone or together with any future development will
cause an increase in regional flood height.
OFFICIAL FLOODPLAIN ZONING MAP: That map, adopted and made part of this title,
as described in subsection 12-1-3B of this title, which has been approved by
the department and FEMA.
OPEN SPACE USE: Those uses having a relatively low flood damage potential and
not involving structures.
ORDINARY HIGH WATER MARK: The point on the bank or shore up to which the
presence and action of surface water is so continuous as to leave a distinctive
mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial vegetation,
predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized characteristic.
PERSON: An individual, or group of individuals, corporation, partnership,
association, municipality or state agency.
PRIVATE SEWAGE SYSTEM: A sewage treatment and disposal system serving one
structure with a septic tank and soil absorption field located on the same
parcel as the structure. It also means an alternative sewage system approved by
the department of commerce, including a substitute for the septic tank or soil
absorption field, a holding tank, a system serving more than one structure or a
system located on a different parcel than the structure.
PUBLIC UTILITIES: Those utilities using underground or overhead transmission
lines such as electric, telephone and telegraph, and distribution and
collection systems such as water, sanitary sewer and storm sewer.
REASONABLY SAFE FROM FLOODING: Base floodwaters will not inundate the land or
damage structures to be removed from the special flood hazard area and that any
subsurface waters related to the base flood will not damage existing or
proposed buildings.
REGIONAL FLOOD: A flood determined to be representative of large floods known
to have occurred in Wisconsin. A regional flood is a flood with a one percent
(1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, and if depicted on
the FIRM, the RFE is equivalent to the BFE.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the
permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and
filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual
"start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor
or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects
the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: Any manmade object with form, shape and utility, either permanently
or temporarily attached to, placed upon or set into the ground, streambed or

not considered an extension, modification or addition; these include painting,
decorating, paneling and the replacement of doors, windows and other
nonstructural components and the maintenance, repair or replacement of existing
private sewage or water supply systems or connections to public utilities.
Ordinary maintenance repairs do not include any costs associated with the
repair of a damaged structure.
The construction of a deck that does not exceed two hundred (200) square feet
and that is adjacent to the exterior wall of a principal structure is not an
extension, modification or addition. The roof of the structure may extend over
a portion of the deck in order to provide safe ingress and egress to the
principal structure.
      2.   If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming structure is
discontinued for twelve (12) consecutive months, it is no longer permitted, and
any future use of the property, and any structure or building thereon, shall
conform to the applicable requirements of this title.
      3.   The municipality shall keep a record which lists all nonconforming
uses and nonconforming structures, their present equalized assessed value, the
cost of all modifications or additions which have been permitted, and the
percentage of the structure's total current value those modifications
represent. (Ord. 2007-04, 5-7-2007)
      4.   No modification or addition to any nonconforming structure or any
structure with a nonconforming use, which over the life of the structure would
equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of its present equalized assessed value,
shall be allowed, unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a
conforming structure with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable
requirements of this title. Contiguous dryland access must be provided for
residential and commercial uses in compliance with subsection 12-5-3A of this

sections 62.23 and 62.231 and 87.30 and 144.26, Wisconsin statutes.
   B.   Findings Of Fact And Purpose: Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-
wetlands and pollution of the navigable waters of the municipality would
adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare and
impair the tax base. The legislature of Wisconsin has delegated responsibility
to all municipalities to:
      1.   Promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare;
      2.   Maintain the storm and flood water storage capacity of wetlands;
      3.   Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which
filter or store sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that
would otherwise drain into navigable waters;
      4.   Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life and
wildlife by preserving wetlands and other aquatic habitat;
      5.   Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area; and
      6.   Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal
of natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland-wetland excavation,
filling and other earth moving activities. (1975 Code Ch. 23 § I)
13-1-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purpose of administering and enforcing this title, the terms or words
used herein shall be interpreted as follows: words used in the present tense
include the future; words in the singular number include the plural number;
words in the plural number include the singular number. The word "shall" is
mandatory, not permissive. All distances unless otherwise specified, shall be
measured horizontally. The following terms used in this title mean:
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE OR USE: A detached subordinate structure or a use which is
clearly incidental to, and customarily found in connection with, the principal
structure or use to which it is related and which is located on the same lot as
that of the principal structure or use.
BOATHOUSE: As defined in section 30.121(1), Wisconsin statutes, means a
permanent structure used for the storage of watercraft and associated materials
and includes all structures which are totally enclosed, have roofs or walls or
any combination of structural parts.

985, Wisconsin statutes, in a newspaper of circulation in the affected area.
Publication is required on two (2) consecutive weeks, the last at least seven
(7) days prior to the hearing.
CONDITIONAL USE: A use which is permitted by this title; provided, that certain
conditions specified in this title are met and that a permit is granted by the
board of appeals or, where appropriate, the planning agency designated by the
municipal governing body.
DEPARTMENT: The Wisconsin department of natural resources.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, the construction of buildings, structures or
accessory structures; the construction of additions or substantial alterations
to buildings, structures or accessory structures; the placement of buildings or
structures; ditching, lagooning, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation

which collect surface runoff or ground water and convey it to a point of
discharge.
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL FACILITY: Any facility, temporary or permanent, which is
reasonably expected to abate, reduce or aid in the prevention, measurement,
control or monitoring of noise, air or water pollutants, solid waste and
thermal pollution, radiation or other pollutants, including facilities
installed principally to supplement or to replace existing property or
equipment not meeting or allegedly not meeting acceptable pollution control
standards or which are to be supplemented or replaced by other pollution
control facilities.
FIXED HOUSEBOAT: As defined in section 30.121(1), Wisconsin statutes, means a
structure not actually used for navigation which extends beyond the ordinary
high water mark of a navigable waterway and is retained in place either by
cables to the shoreline or by anchors or spudpoles attached to the bed of the
waterway.
NAVIGABLE WATERS: Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, all natural inland lakes within
Wisconsin, and all streams, ponds, sloughs, flowages and other waters within
the territorial limits of this state, including the Wisconsin portion of
boundary waters, which are navigable under the laws of this state. Under

bed differentiated from adjacent uplands and levels or flow sufficient to
support navigation by a recreational craft of the shallowest draft on an
annually recurring basis Muench v. Public Service Commission, 261 Wisconsin 492
(1952) and DeGaynor and Co., Inc., v. Department of Natural Resources, 70
Wisconsin 2d 936 (1975). For example, a stream which is navigable by skiff or
canoe during normal spring high water is navigable in fact under the laws of
this state though it may be dry during other seasons".
ORDINARY HIGH WATER MARK: The point on the bank or shore up to which the
presence and action of surface water is so continuous as to leave a distinctive
mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial vegetation,
predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized characteristic.
PLANNING AGENCY: The municipal plan commission created under section 62.23(1),
Wisconsin statutes, a board of public land commissioners or a committee of the
municipality's governing body which acts on matters pertaining to planning and
zoning.
SHORELAND-WETLAND DISTRICT: The zoning district, created in this title,
comprised of shorelands that are designated as wetlands on the wetlands
inventory maps which have been adopted and made a part of this title.
SHORELANDS: Lands within the following distances from the ordinary high water
mark of navigable waters: one thousand feet (1,000') from a lake, pond or
flowage; and three hundred feet (300') from a river or stream or to the
landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater.
UNNECESSARY HARDSHIP: That circumstance where special conditions, which were
not self-created, affect a particular property and make strict conformity with
restrictions governing area, setbacks, frontage, height or density
unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of this
title.
VARIANCE: An authorization granted by the board of appeals to construct or
alter a building or structure in a manner that deviates from the dimensional
standards of this title.
WETLAND ALTERATION: Any filling, flooding, draining, dredging, ditching,
tiling, excavating, temporary water level stabilization measures or dike and
dam construction in a wetland area.
WETLANDS: Those areas where water is at, near or above the land surface long
enough to support aquatic or hydrophytic vegetation and which have soils
indicative of wetland conditions. (1975 Code Ch. 23 § VIII)
13-1-3: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Compliance: The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within
the shoreland area of the municipality shall be in full compliance with the
terms of this title and other applicable local, state or federal regulations.
(However, see section
13-1-4 of this chapter, for the standards applicable to nonconforming uses.)
All permitted development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless
otherwise expressly excluded by a provision of this title.
   B.   Municipalities And State Agencies Regulated: Unless specifically
exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns and counties are required to
comply with this title and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are

      1.   This title supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under section 61.35, 62.23, or 87.30, Wisconsin statutes,
which relate to floodplains and shoreland-wetlands; except that, where another
municipal zoning ordinance is more restrictive than this title, that ordinance
shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater
restrictions, but not otherwise.
      2.   This title is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this title
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this title shall prevail.
   D.   Interpretation: In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this title shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the city and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal
of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin statutes. Where a provision of
this title is required by a standard in chapter NR 117, Wisconsin
administrative code, and where the title provision is unclear, the provision
shall be interpreted in light of the chapter NR 117 standards in effect on the
date of the adoption of this title or in effect on the date of the most recent
text amendment to this title.
   E.   Severability: Should any portion of this title be declared invalid or
unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this
title shall not be affected.
   F.   Annexed Areas: The Dunn County shoreland zoning provisions in effect on
the date of annexation remain in effect, administered by the city for all areas
annexed by the city after May 7, 1982. These annexed lands are described on the
city of Menomonie official zoning map. The Dunn County shoreland zoning
provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this
title and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator.

of a structure and which existed at the time of the adoption or subsequent
amendment of this title adopted under section 61.351 or 62.231, Wisconsin
statutes, may be continued although such use does not conform with the
provisions of this title. However, such nonconforming use may not be extended.

   B.   Methods Of Financing:
      1.   No final plat for the subdivision of land in the city, or within an
area for which an annexation petition has been filed, shall be approved by the
common council until the subdivider has made arrangements to install required
improvements, as provided under subsection B2 of this section. In this section,
"required improvements" means street improvements, including curb and gutter,
water facilities, sanitary sewer facilities and storm drainage facilities.
      2.   Required improvements may be provided in one of the following ways
at the discretion of the city:
         a.   By entering into a developer's agreement, suitable for recording
in the office of the Dunn County register of deeds, with the city before the
final plat is submitted for approval, whereby subdivider agrees to install the
required improvements. The subdivider shall file with said agreement a bond
meeting the approval of the city attorney or a certified check or letter of
credit, the choice of the guarantee being at the discretion of the city, in an
amount equal to the estimate of cost of said improvements as prepared by the
city engineer. Such bond, check or letter of credit shall constitute a
guarantee that such improvements will be completed by the subdivider not later
than three (3) years from the date of recording of the plat. It shall
constitute a further guarantee that all obligations to subcontractors for work
on the development are satisfied. The agreement will provide for the subdivider
to install the improvements, including engineering and inspection costs
reimbursed to the city by the subdivider, the same to be guaranteed as provided
herein.
All contractors and subcontractors who are to be engaged in construction or
improvements on dedicated street rights of way shall be designated as qualified
for such work by the city engineer.
         b.   Installation by the city subject to payments by the subdivider as
provided in subsections B2b(1), B2b(2) and B2b(3) of this section. The city may
choose this option if the developer demonstrates to the common council the
financial ability to reimburse the city for the installation of improvements by
providing to the city sufficient financial guarantee, marketing plan,
feasibility study, business plan, and benefits of the development to the city
are shown; and provided, that all requests be filed with the city no later than
December 31 of the year preceding improvement installation.
            (1)   The city shall award construction bids conditioned upon
subdivider paying to the city, within three (3) days of the award of bids, the
sum of ten percent (10%) of the total estimated project costs including, but
not limited to, the bid award and financing costs; and
            (2)   The subdivider shall be specially assessed the full amount of
such improvements less the sum paid pursuant to subsection B2b(1) of this
section, said special assessments to be paid in not more than ten (10) equal
annual principal installments with interest on the declining principal balance
at the rate of two percent (2%) above the rate of interest paid by the city at
the time of the levying of the special assessments; and
            (3)   In the event the subdivider sells a lot in the subdivision,
subdivider shall pay to the city an amount equal to one hundred twenty five
percent (125%) of the special assessments levied as to that lot. Such payments
will continue to be made until such time as the sum of all payments, together
with the amount of special assessments otherwise paid by the subdivider, equals
the total amount of the special assessments levied regarding this subdivision,
together with the unpaid interest thereon; and
            (4)   The subdivider and the city shall enter into a developer's
agreement, suitable for recording in the office of the Dunn County register of
deeds, which shall include, but not be limited to, the provisions of this
section. (1975 Code Ch. 22 § IV)

unsuitable for subdividing for the proposed use, the city plan commission shall
record its reasons therefor in writing, furnishing copies to the common council
and to the subdivider, and shall afford the subdivider an opportunity to appeal
such finding to the common council. (1975 Code Ch. 22 § V)
14-4-3: RECREATION, PARK OR OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Purpose: The requirements of this section are established to ensure
that adequate parks, open spaces and sites for other public uses are properly
located and preserved as the city grows. It has also been established to ensure
that the cost of providing the park and recreation sites and facilities
necessary to serve the additional people brought into the community by land
development may be equitably apportioned on the basis of the additional needs
created by the development. The requirements shall apply to all lands proposed
for any residential development, including residential planned unit
developments (PUD) pursuant to title 10, chapter 19 of this code.
   B.   General Design: In the design of a residential subdivision or minor
subdivision, provision shall be made for suitable park spaces, drainageways and
other public purposes. Such sites are to be shown on the preliminary plat and
final plat, and shall comply with the city's comprehensive plan and park plan.
Consideration shall be given to the preservation of scenic and historic sites,
stands of trees, marshes, lakes, ponds, streams, watercourses, watersheds,
ravines, woodlands, prairie, wetlands, and plant and animal communities.
   C.   Recreation, Park Or Open Space Areas: When a parcel of land is
developed for residential purposes which involves any division of land by
subdivision, minor subdivision or the creation of a residential planned unit
development (PUD) the developer shall be required to dedicate, for park,
recreation and other open space purposes, a parcel of land equal to ten percent
(10%) of the gross area of all property proposed for subdivision. Such parcel
shall be shown and marked on the plat as "Dedicated For Park Or Recreation
Purposes". The common council shall have sole authority to determine the
suitability and adequacy of lands proposed for such dedication. Drainageways,
wetlands or areas reserved for streets shall not be considered as satisfying
this land dedication requirement.
   D.   Minimum Size Of Dedication: Land reserved for recreation, open spaces
and park purposes shall have an area of at least two (2) acres. Dedicated land
shall have a total frontage on one or more streets of at least eighty feet
(80'), and no other dimension of the site shall be less than two hundred feet
(200').
   E.   Nonresidential Subdivisions Or Minor Subdivisions: Whenever a parcel of
land is developed for commercial or industrial uses in accordance with the
overlying zoning district which involves any division of land by minor
subdivision or subdivision, said division of land shall be exempt from the
requirements of this section, and no land dedication or park development fee
shall be required at the time of approval. If an unimproved parcel resulting
from that division is later developed for any residential purpose or use, the
owner of said parcel shall at that time be subject to the requirements of this
section. (1975 Code Ch. 22 § V)
   F.   Fees In Lieu Of Land: Where, in the sole discretion of the common
council, there is not land suitable for parks within the proposed subdivision
or minor subdivision, or the dedication of land would not be compatible with
the city's comprehensive plan or park plan, or the minimum size under
subsection D of this section cannot be met, or it is not feasible to require
such dedication, or a cash contribution would better serve the public interest,
the common council, upon recommendation of the plan commission, shall require
the subdivider to contribute a park development fee in lieu of land. The fee
collected shall be held in a separate nonlapsing fund account to be used for
purchase, development, improvement and maintenance of parks, open spaces or
other recreational sites and facilities. The total fee shall be computed on the
basis of the maximum number of residential buildings or units that are
permitted to be developed in the subdivision or minor subdivision according to
the particular zoning district under the zoning code. For lots upon which a
single-family dwelling, a two-family dwelling, a three-family dwelling or a
four-family dwelling may be built, the fee shall be four hundred dollars
($400.00) per lot. For lots upon which dwellings consisting of five (5) or more
residential units may be built, the fee shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00)
per residential unit. (Example 1: a five-family dwelling requires a fee of
$500.00; example 2: an eight-family dwelling requires a fee of $800.00.) The
fee shall be paid to the city as follows: one hundred percent (100%) at the
time of the approval of the final plat or certified survey approval.
   G.   Combination Of Land Dedication And Fee Payment: The common council may,
in its sole discretion, permit the subdivider to satisfy the requirements of
this section by combining a land dedication with a park development fee
payment. For example, if a land dedication of twenty five percent (25%) of the
required land dedication is made, the subdivider shall also contribute an
amount equal to seventy five percent (75%) of the required fee in lieu of land;
if a land dedication of fifty percent (50%) of the required dedication is made,
the subdivider shall also contribute an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of
the required fee in lieu of land; if a land dedication of seventy five percent
(75%) of the required dedication is made, the subdivider shall also contribute
an amount equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the required fee in lieu of
land. (Ord. 2008-12, 8-4-2008)
   H.   Development Of Area: When recreation, park or open space areas are
dedicated, the subdivider is required to bring the dedicated land up to the
contours established in the approved street and utility plans. If required by
the common council, the land shall be topsoiled, with a minimum of four inches
(4") of quality topsoil, and seeded. If topsoiling is required by the common
council, fine grading and seeding must occur within one year following issuance
of the first building permit within that subdivision, unless otherwise
authorized by the plan commission.

public street. When the distance between the public street and the high water
mark exceeds one hundred feet (100'), a cul-de-sac shall be provided with a
minimum diameter of one hundred twenty feet (120'), as close as practicable to
the high water mark.
   K.   Lands Included In Plat: The lands lying between the meander line,
established in accordance with section 236.20(2)(g), Wisconsin statutes, and
the water's edge, and any otherwise unplattable lands which lie between a
proposed subdivision and the water's edge, shall be included in the plat. (1975
Code Ch. 22 § V)

practical to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided, in which case the dedication of a half street may be
permitted. The probable length of time elapsing before the dedication of the
remainder shall be considered in this decision.
   I.   Street Names: Street names shall comply with the city of Menomonie
street naming and numbering system.

The subdivision shall be monumented as required by section 236.15 of the
Wisconsin statutes. All such monuments shall contain sufficient iron for
magnetic detection. (1975 Code Ch. 22 § VI)
14-5-2: STREETS AND UTILITIES:
   A.   Installation Procedure: Before the final plat of a subdivision located
within the city limits or within an area for which an annexation petition has
been filed will be approved, the subdivider shall complete one of the following
alternative procedures with respect to the installation of water facilities,
sanitary sewers, street grading and surfacing, and other required improvements:
      1.   Install such street grading, surfacing and utility improvements in
accordance with plans developed by the city and pay the cost of engineering,
legal, administration and inspection by the city prior to approval of the
subdivision.
      2.   Enter into a contract with the city agreeing to install such
improvements within a time schedule set by the plan commission and either file
a bond or deposit a certified check with the city clerk, to guarantee such
installations within such time. Such bond or certified check must be approved
by the city attorney and shall be in an amount equal to the total estimated
cost of the improvements, including inspection charges. The construction shall
conform to a time schedule which shall not exceed five (5) years. The
installation shall be in accordance with plans developed by the city. The
developer shall pay the costs of engineering, legal, administration and
inspection.
      3.   Petition the city clerk for installation of required improvements in
accordance with the applicable city special assessment policy for installation
of improvements and waive rights to notice and hearing for special assessments.
This procedure for installation of improvements may be used only when approved
by the common council following recommendation of the plan commission.
When special assessment procedure is used, the subdivider shall furnish
evidence and security as required by the city to ensure payment of levied
assessments including deposits and/or bonds.
   B.   Improvement Cost Sharing:
      1.   If any improvement is installed which benefits lands beyond the
boundaries of the subdivision, the city may make provision for causing a
portion of the cost of the improvement, representing the benefit to lands
beyond the boundaries of the subdivision, to be assessed against the same and
such portions of the whole cost of said improvements as will represent the
benefit to the property within the subdivision.
      2.   When the proposed subdivision is not adjacent to existing utilities,
the developer may request that the connecting utilities be installed by the
city with costs assessed to benefitted properties. If the area between the
subdivision and existing utilities is not developed, the city may require the
installation of connecting utilities as part of required improvements in the
subdivision with no participation by other properties. If assessment of
benefits is not currently determined feasible, the subdivider may enter into an
agreement with the city stating that the assessable costs of the utilities be
refunded to the subdivider when benefitted properties are subdivided or
connected to utilities. The agreement shall be consistent with the rules of the
Wisconsin public service commission.
   C.   Improvements Required:
      1.   Water Supply: When a proposed subdivision is located adjacent to or
reasonably near the existing service area of a public water system, water lines
shall be extended and service connections shall be stubbed to the property line
of each lot. Fire hydrants shall also be provided. The city shall determine
whether public water supply to the subdivision is feasible.
      2.   Sanitary Sewer: When a subdivision is located in an area which can
be served by public sewer, sanitary sewer mains and laterals shall be installed
so that each lot is adequately served. The city shall determine whether the
subdivision can be served by public sewer.
      3.   Storm Drainage: A drainage system that will adequately drain surface
water runoff within the subdivision shall be provided including ditches,
culverts, easements and piping if required.
      4.   Utilities:
         a.   The subdivider shall make necessary arrangements and pay
assessable costs and fees for the installation of adequate electrical power and
telephone within the subdivision. A copy of agreements for utility installation
shall be submitted to the city for approval.
         b.   Electric distribution lines, telephone and telegraph lines,
community antenna television cables, and services constructed within the
subdivision shall be buried underground, unless the common council shall
specifically find after study and recommendation by the plan commission that
the placing of utilities underground would not be compatible or feasible within
the subdivision.
      5.   Streets: Streets shall be graded to full width and roadways graded
to subgrade according to plans developed by the city. After installation of
water and sewer facilities, roadways shall be surfaced with six inches (6") of
three-fourths inch (3/4") maximum size crushed gravel or lime rock and an
asphalt seal coat in accordance with city specifications.
      6.   Public Access: Public access to waterways shall be graded and
surfaced as a public street.
      7.   Streetlights:

and fees for the installation of adequate street lighting within the
subdivision. Streetlights shall be installed at street intersections and at

with electrical distribution wiring in the subdivision. Where underground
wiring is installed the streetlight wires shall be underground.
