ordinances of a general nature in effect at the time of such codification,
shall be accepted in all courts without question as the official code and law
of the village as enacted by the president and board of trustees.
   Section 2: There is hereby adopted, as a method of perpetual codification,
the loose-leaf type of binding together with the continuous supplement service,
provided by Sterling Codifiers, Inc., whereby each newly adopted ordinance of a
general and permanent nature amending, altering, adding or deleting provisions
of the official village code is identified by the proper catchline and is
inserted in the proper place in each of the official copies. Each such new
provision shall become effective upon the passage of the ordinance and the

that said office is regularly open.
   Section 3: All ordinances of a general nature included in this official
village code shall be considered as a continuation of said ordinance provision
and the fact that some provisions have been deliberately eliminated by the
governing body shall not serve to cause any interruption in the continuous
effectiveness of ordinances included in said official village code. All
ordinances of a special nature, such as tax levy ordinances, bond ordinances,
franchises, vacating ordinances and annexation ordinances shall continue in
full force and effect unless specifically repealed or amended by a provision of
the village code. Such ordinances are not intended to be included in the

change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of such code, or
to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such
code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the village to be
misrepresented thereby.

record shall be made to the legal custodian or to the village clerk-treasurer,
who shall forward it to the legal custodian as soon as practicable. A request
shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or
the information requested. However, a request for a record without a reasonable
limitation as to subject matter or length of time represented by the record
does not constitute a sufficient request. A request may be made orally, but a
request must be in writing before an action to enforce the request is commenced
under section 19.37, Wisconsin statutes. Except as provided below, no request
may be refused because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment of a
fee is required under subsection 1-8-4E of this chapter.
   B.   Custodian Response: Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall,
as soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the
requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole or in
part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring with
the village attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be
unduly time consuming, the party making the request may first be required to
itemize his or her request in a manner which would permit reasonable
compliance.
   C.   Denial Of Request: A request for a record may be denied as provided in
section
1-8-6 of this chapter. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied
orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the
request is made by the requester within five (5) business days of the oral
denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall
receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every
written denial of a request shall inform the requester that, if the request for
the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review
upon petition for a writ of mandamus under section 19.37(1), Wisconsin
statutes, or upon application to the attorney general or a district attorney.
   D.   Request To Inspect And Copy; Records Regarding Employment Or Search
Warrant: The procedure set forth in this subsection will apply to the following

violation by the employee of a statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or policy
of the employee's employer; 2) a record obtained by the authority through a
subpoena or search warrant; or 3) a record prepared by an employer other than
an authority if that record contains information relating to an employee of
that employer unless the employee authorizes the authority to provide access to
that information.
      1.   Notice To Record Subject: If the authority decides to permit access
to a record described in this subsection, the authority shall, before
permitting access and within three (3) days after making the decision to permit
access, serve written notice of that decision on any record subject to whom the
record pertains, either by certified mail or personal service. The notice shall
briefly describe the requested record and include a description of the rights
of the record subject set forth in the following subsections.
      2.   Record Subject Response: Within five (5) days after receipt of a
notice, a record subject may provide written notification to the authority of
his/her intent to seek a court order restraining the authority from providing
access to the requested record.
      3.   Action By Record Subject: Within ten (10) days after receipt of a
notice, a record subject may commence an action seeking a court order to
restrain the authority from providing access to the requested record. If such
an action is commenced, the authority shall be named as a defendant. The record
requester may intervene in the action as a matter of right. If the record
requester does not intervene, the authority shall notify the requester of the
results of the proceeding.
      4.   Time For Authority To Act: The authority shall not provide access to
a requested record within twelve (12) days of sending a notice pertaining to
that record under this section. If the record subject commences an action under
this section, the authority shall not provide access to the requested record
during the pendency of the action and until any appeal is decided, until the
period for appealing or petitioning for review expires, until a petition for
review is denied, or the authority receives written notice from the record
subject that an appeal or petition will not be filed, whichever first occurs.
      5.   Exceptions: This subsection does not apply: a) to access to a record
pertaining to an employee provided to the employee who is the subject of the
record or to his or her representative to the extent required under section
103.13, Wisconsin statutes, or to a recognized or certified collective
bargaining representative to the extent required to fulfill a duty to bargain
or pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement under chapter 111, Wisconsin

to permit access to a record containing information relating to a record
subject who is an officer or employee of the authority holding a local public
office, the authority shall serve written notice of that decision on the record
subject by certified mail or personal service before permitting access and
within three (3) days after making the decision to permit access. The notice
shall describe the requested record and include a description of the rights of
the record subject as follows: Within five (5) days after receipt of the
notice, a record subject may augment the record to be released with written
comments and documentation selected by the record subject. In that event, the
authority shall release the record as augmented by the record subject. (Ord.

   C.   Records Which May Be Exempt Under Balancing Test: In responding to a
request for inspection or copying of a record which is not specifically exempt
from disclosure, the legal custodian, after conferring with the village
attorney, may deny the request, in whole or in part, only if he or she

   D.   Modifying Records To Separate Exempt From Nonexempt Information: If a
record contains information that may be made public and information that may
not be made public, the custodian of the record shall provide the information
that may be made public and delete the information that may not be made public
from the record before release. The custodian shall confer with the village
attorney prior to releasing any such record and shall follow the guidance of
the village attorney when separating out the exempt material. If, in the
judgment of the custodian and the village attorney, there is no feasible way to

jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the entire record shall be
withheld from disclosure. (Ord. 2005-1, 2-21-2005)

use charges shall be the metered water consumption of the person as shown in
the records of meter readings maintained by the village water department except
as noted in subsections F and G of this section.
   F.   Provisions For Deductions: In the event that a person discharging
industrial wastewater into the public sewers produces evidence satisfactory to
the approving authority that some of the total annual volume of water used for
all purposes does not reach the public sewer, then the determination of the
water consumption to be used in computing the wastewater volume discharged into
the public sewer may be made a matter of agreement between the approving
authority and the person.
   G.   Metering Of Wastewater: Devices for measuring the volume of wastewater
discharged may be required by the approving authority if this volume cannot
otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records. Metering
devices for determining the volume of wastewater shall be installed, owned, and
maintained by the person. Following approval and installation, such meters may
not be removed without the consent of the approving authority.
   H.   Wastewater Sampling: Industrial wastewater discharged into the public
sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection and a determination of a
character and concentration of said wastes. The determinations shall be made by
the industry as often as may be deemed necessary by the approving authority.

times, durations, and frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis
subject to approval by the approving authority.
Determination of the character and concentration of the industrial wastes shall
be made by the person discharging them, or his agent, as designated and
required by the approving authority. The village may also make its own analysis
on the wastes.
   J.   Pretreatment: Where required, in the opinion of the approving
authority, to modify or eliminate incompatible wastes that are harmful to the
structures, processes, or operation of the wastewater treatment works, the
person shall provide at his expense such preliminary treatment or processing
facilities as may be determined required to render his wastes acceptable for
admission to the public sewers.
   K.   Grease And/Or Sand Interceptors: Grease, oil, and sand interceptors
shall be provided when, in the opinion of the approving authority, they are
necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable grease
or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
approving authority and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible
for cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these interceptors, the
owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by
appropriate means of the captured material and shall maintain records of the
dates and means of disposal which are subject to review by the approving
authority. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials performed by
owner(s) personnel or by currently licensed waste disposal firms must be in
accordance with acceptable requirements of the department of natural resources
rules and regulations.

protection from accidental discharge of prohibited or regulated materials or
substances established by this chapter. Where necessary, facilities to prevent
accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained
at the discharger's cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the
approving authority for review and shall be approved by the approving authority
before construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures by the approving authority shall not relieve the
discharger from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet
the requirements of this chapter.
Dischargers shall notify the approving authority immediately upon the
occurrence of a "slug load", or accidental discharge of substances prohibited
by this chapter. The notification shall include location of discharge, date and
time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
Initial notification shall be followed within five (5) days by a written report
to the approving authority. Any discharger who discharges a slug load of
prohibited materials shall be liable for any expense, loss or damage to the
wastewater facilities or wastewater treatment works, in addition to the amount
of any fines imposed on the authority on account thereof under state or federal
law.
Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the discharger's
premises, advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or accidental
discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover
such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedure.

necessary and conducive to the protection of the public health, safety,
welfare, and convenience of the village to levy and collect charges, rentals,
or rates of service upon all the lands, lots, and premises served by and having
connections with the sewerage system of the village.
   B.   Policy: It shall be the policy of the village to obtain sufficient
revenues to pay the costs of the operation and maintenance of the sewerage
facilities, including a replacement fund through a system of "sewer service
charges" as defined in this section. A portion of the debit service cost may be
obtained by the levy of a mil rate tax, with the remaining portion obtained
through sewer service charges. The system shall assure that each user of the
sewerage system pay their proportionate share of the cost of the cost of such
facilities.
   C.   Category B Users: Category B users shall be charged a surcharge, in
addition to the volume charge, based on the prevailing category B service
charges for BOD, suspended solids, phosphorus, and ammonia nitrogen.
   D.   Category C Users: Category C users (septic tank and holding tank
wastes) shall be charged an administrative charge per load in addition to the
computed charges for volume, BOD, suspended solids, and ammonia nitrogen.
   E.   Sewer Users Served By Private Wells: If any person discharging
wastewater into the public sanitary sewer system procures any part or all of
his water sources other than the water department, all or part of which is
discharged into the public sanitary sewer system, the person shall be required
to have water meters installed for purposes of determining the volume of water
obtained from these other sources. Where sewage meters are already installed,
the water meters will not be required. The water meters shall be furnished by
the water department and installed under its supervision, all costs being at
the expense of the person requiring the meter.
The water department will charge for each meter a rental charge set by the
water department to compensate for the cost of furnishing and servicing the
meter. The rental charge shall be billed at the time the sewer user charge is
billed.
   F.   Credits For Water Not Reaching Sewage System: If a portion of the water
furnished to any premises is not discharged into the sewage system, the amount
of such water will be deducted in computing the sewerage service charge,
provided a separate meter is installed. The property owner desiring to install
such separate meter shall make application and payment for the meter to the
waterworks superintendent and engage a plumber to make the necessary piping
changes and install the couplings so that the meter can be set.
   G.   Discount For Filling Swimming Pools: An allowance shall be made for
water used to fill swimming pools, providing that such water is not discharged
into the sanitary sewer system when said swimming pool is emptied. Customers
shall request a credit by completing an application available from the village
clerk. The volume to be deducted from the sewer bill shall be determined by use
of a portable deduct meter supplied by the utility, by recording meter readings
immediately prior to and following filling of the pool, or by using a
volumetric calculation. The method used shall be approved by the utility
superintendent prior to filling the pool.
   H.   Amount Of Sewer Service Charges:
      1.   Sewer Service Charge: The sewer rates shall be reviewed and
determined by the Village Board on an annual basis.
   The village shall, at its discretion, test any or all of the individual
loads of holding tank and septic tank waste discharge to the system. In the
event that the average concentrations of holding tank or septic tank waste, as
tested by the village, exceeds the minimum assumed concentration by twenty five
percent (25%) for any or all parameters, the village may utilize the prescribed
formulas to determine the proper charge.
   Any load containing a mixture of septic tank and holding tank waste shall be
charged at the septic tank waste rate.
   I.   Reassignment Of Sewer Users: The approving authority will reassign
sewer users into appropriate sewer service charge categories if wastewater
sampling programs or other related information indicate a change of categories
is necessary.
   J.   Operation, Maintenance, And Replacement Fund Accounts: All sewer
service charge revenues collected for replacement costs shall be deposited in a
separate and distinct fund to be used solely for “replacement costs” as defined
in section
2-2-2-1 of this chapter. All sewer service charge revenues collected for other
operation and maintenance expenses shall also be deposited in a separate and
distinct fund.
   All revenues for the replacement fund and for operation and maintenance of
the wastewater treatment facilities shall be used solely for the replacement
fund and operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment facilities.
   K.   Charge For Toxic Pollutants: Any person discharging toxic pollutants
which cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or sludge from the
village’s wastewater treatment facility shall pay for such increased costs, as
may be determined by the approving authority.
   L.   Billing Practice: All charges for sewerage service shall be made
monthly and shall be payable on the first day of each month. A three percent
(3%) penalty shall be added to those bills not paid on or before the 20th day
after the due date of the bill with a thirty cent ($0.30) minimum penalty
charge. The failure to receive a bill shall not excuse non-payment. Sewerage
service charges shall be a lien on the property serviced according to Section
66.0809 and 74.01, Wis. Stats. (Ord., 3-18-1996, eff. 4-1-1996; amd. Ord. 6-00,

2-2-2-9: PRIVATE SEWER LATERALS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to prevent significant water
inflow and infiltration into the Village's sanitary sewer system and to protect
public health, safety and welfare by assuring that private laterals are tested,
inspected, maintained and repaired or replaced.
   B.   Owner Maintenance Required: The owner of property containing a private
lateral shall maintain their private lateral. Maintenance under this section
includes:
      1.   Clearing obstructions from the private lateral;
      2.   Repairing a defect in the private lateral that allows the
introduction of extraneous flow or debris into the sanitary sewer system;
      3.   Repairing a defect in the private lateral that allows the discharge
of sewage on the property;
      4.   Keeping a manhole cover in place or a clean out cap tight and in
place; and
      5.   Providing a solid manhole cover.
   C.   Testing And Notice Of Defective Private Laterals: Utility staff may
periodically perform special tests to confirm the integrity of the sanitary
sewer system, including smoke testing, dyed water testing, air testing,
hydraulic testing, closed circuit television inspection, and other testing and
inspection techniques approved by the Village Board.
The utility staff may enter private property to inspect and/or test a private
lateral as allowed by law.
The utility staff shall give the property owner no less than twenty four (24)
hours' written notice before personnel enter private property to conduct an
inspection or test unless:
      1.   Village personnel are conducting an investigation of a complaint or
responding to a customer request to test or inspect a private lateral; or
      2.   Sewage is exposed on the property in a manner that creates a
potential public health hazard.
Utility staff may identify defects in a private lateral that allows extraneous
flow or debris to enter the private lateral or the discharge of sewage on the
property, or a condition that may interfere with the proper operation of the
private lateral.
A defect under this section may include:
      1.   Any visible leak;
      2.   Evidence of pipe or joint deterioration;
      3.   Root intrusion into a pipe that separates a pipe joint or enlarges
an existing crack;
      4.   A misaligned pipe segment, sag, or lack of proper gradient;
      5.   A lack of necessary clean-out cap or manhole cover;
      6.   All failing materials;
      7.   A downspout, drain, or other connection that allows stormwater or
other extraneous water to enter the sanitary sewer system; or
      8.   A flaw that allows the discharge of sewage on the property or the
introduction of extraneous water into the sanitary sewer system.
If the utility staff identifies a defective private lateral or condition that
interferes with the proper operation of the private lateral, staff shall send
the property owner written notice of the defect or condition, including a
statement that the private lateral must be replaced or repaired, or the
condition corrected, no later than ninety (90) days after the date of the
notice, or within such no longer time deemed reasonable by the utility.
   D.   Repair Or Replacement Required: A property owner shall repair or
replace a defective private lateral from the main sewer line to the building.
The property owner shall pay the appropriate fee and obtain a permit from the
Village before performing the repair or replacement of a defective private
lateral. Correction of a defect may include the installation of a sump pit,
sump pump and drainage tile.
If sewage is exposed on the property in a manner that makes it a potential
public health hazard, a property owner must:
      1.   Stop the discharge of sewage immediately;
      2.   Remediate the site not later than twenty four (24) hours after the
owner has notice of the exposed sewage; and
      3.   Complete all necessary repairs or replacement of a private lateral
immediately, but not later than thirty (30) days after the owner has notice of
the exposed sewage.
A person who repairs an existing private lateral or installs a new or
rehabilitated private lateral shall perform the repair or installation as
prescribed by the sewer utility's sanitary sewer connection standards and the
State Plumbing Code.
The repair or replacement of the private lateral and the connection of the
private lateral to the sanitary sewer shall conform to the requirements of the
Building and Plumbing Codes or other applicable rules and regulations of the
Village. All connections to the sanitary sewer shall be made gastight and
watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be
approved by the utility personnel before installation.
The property owner is responsible for all costs of private lateral repair,
replacement and maintenance from the sewer line into the building. The Village
has the authority to contract for repair/replacements of laterals in the right-
of-way and special assess the cost to the property owner.
Generally, the sanitary sewer lateral will be remediated from the main sewer
line to the building foundation or the floor drain in the basement. The
sanitary sewer lateral between the terrace and the main line sewer that is not
remediated at the time of the sanitary sewer lateral repair will be replaced as
a part of a future street or sanitary sewer construction project. The property
owner will be responsible for the cost of replacement of the lateral from the
property line to the building foundation or the floor drain in the basement in
the future when that project is undertaken.
   E.   Repair And Replacement Inspection And Testing Requirements: During the
replacement of the private lateral the utility staff shall:
      1.   Inspect the private lateral to determine that it complies with the
sewer utility's sanitary sewer connection standards and the State Plumbing
Code; and
      2.   Observe the testing of the private lateral per current State Code.
If a private lateral fails the post-repair or post- replacement inspection or
test, the property owners shall perform additional repairs as required by
utility staff to correct the defect.
   F.   Sanitary Sewer Lateral Remediation Projects: The Village recognizes
that its public sewer system has a finite life and, in many cases, has exceeded
the useful life of the system. The Village also recognizes that private
building sewers possess many of the same characteristics as the public sewer
system. The Village will undertake the systematic reconstruction of the public
sewer system lying within the corporate limits. As a part of this
reconstruction, the Village will conduct sanitary sewer lateral remediation
projects.
During a sanitary sewer remediation project, the Village shall require that the
property owner replace and/or remediate their private lateral if the lateral is
found to be defective. The property owner shall, at the owner's expense, make
the necessary repairs to correct the deficiency(ies). The property owner may
elect to:
      1.   Contract with a properly licensed contractor to complete the repair.
All work needed to accomplish the repair shall be done at the expense of the
property owner.
      2.   Have the Village contractors complete the repair.
The Village will publicly bid all sanitary sewer lateral remediation projects
and the property owners, if they elect to have the Village contractors complete
the work, will be special assessed for the project costs per the Village's
special assessment policy. The sanitary sewer lateral remediation projects may
include:
      1.   Replacement or remediation of defective private laterals;
      2.   Installation of sump pump/pit and drainage tile where required;
      3.   Construction of mini-storm sewers in the terrace;
      4.   Construction of storm sewer laterals.
The property owner will be given the option of selecting the sewer lateral
remediation option. Options include but not limited to, open cut construction,
slip lining (6 inch laterals only) or pipe bursting or any other method allowed
by State Code.
On-site inspector will be provided for the replacement/remediation of the
sanitary sewer lateral by the Village.
The sanitary sewer lateral remediation project will include patching of
basement floors if needed. Any other restoration needed in the building and
basement shall be the responsibility of the property owners and will not be
done as a part of the sanitary sewer lateral remediation project.
Any, and all, fences, trees, shrubs, swimming pools, decks, sheds, porches or
other landscaping, paving or structures that will need to be removed in order
to facilitate remediation of the private lateral shall be removed and replaced
by the property owner at their expense.
Final restoration of the yard will be the responsibility of the property owner.
The Village contractor will backfill the trench or holes that are dug and rough
grade the top soil. The contractor will not be responsible for final
landscaping. It will be the responsibility of the property owner to restore the
lawn, pavement or garden areas that are disturbed as a part of the sanitary
sewer lateral remediation project.
   G.   Sanitary Sewer Lateral Fees:
      1.   Televising Refusal Fee: A one hundred dollar ($100.00) monthly fee
is hereby imposed for connection of sewer laterals against every property

2-4-1: GROUNDWATER PROTECTION OVERLAY DISTRICT:
   A.   Purpose. The residents of the Village of Reedsville depend exclusively
on groundwater for a safe drinking water supply. Certain land use practices and
activities can seriously threaten or degrade groundwater quality. The purpose
of this Ordinance is to establish a groundwater protection overlay district to
institute land use regulations and restrictions within a defined area which
contributes water directly to the municipal water supply providing protection
for the aquifer and municipal water supply of the Village of Reedsville and
promoting the public health, safety and general welfare of Village residents.
   B.   Authority. Statutory authority of the Village to enact these
regulations was established by the Wisconsin Legislature in 1983, Wisconsin Act
410 (effective May 11, 1984), which specifically added groundwater protection,
in § 59.97(1) {'{'}which has since been renumbered as § 59.69(1){'}'} and §
62.23(7)(c), Wis. Stats., to the statutory authorization for county and
municipal planning and zoning to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
In addition, § 61.35, Wis. Stats., the Village has the authority to enact this
ordinance, effective in the incorporated areas of the Village, to encourage the
protection of groundwater resources.
   C.   Application. The regulations specified in this Wellhead Protection
Ordinance shall apply within the area surrounding each municipal water supply
well that has been designated as a "wellhead protection area" by the Village in
the most recent and up to date wellhead protection plan, and are in addition to
the requirements in the underlying zoning district, if any. If there is a
conflict between this chapter and the zoning ordinance, the more restrictive
provision shall apply.
   D.   Groundwater protection overlay district. The location and boundaries of
the zoning districts established by this chapter are set forth in the Village
of Reedsville's most recent and up to date wellhead protection plan on the map
titled "Wellhead Protection Area" [on file in the Village of Reedsville office]
incorporated herein and hereby made a part of this ordinance. Said figures,
together with everything shown thereon and all amendments thereto, shall be as
much a part of this chapter as though fully set forth and described herein.
This chapter and thus promotes public health, safety, and welfare. The
groundwater protection overlay district is intended to protect the groundwater
recharge area for the water supply from contamination.
   Note: Wellhead protection areas are derived from hydrologic studies and are
based on the area surrounding a well where groundwater takes five (5)-years or
less to travel from the land surface to the pumping well. (Ord. 2021-1, 6-17-

village a monthly parking permit fee computed as follows: Beginning January 1,
1970, the local assessor shall determine the total fair market value of each
occupied mobile home in his district subject to the monthly parking permit fee.
The fair market value, minus the tax exempt household furnishing thus
established, shall be equalized to the general level of assessment on other
real and personal property in the district. The value of each occupied mobile
home thus determined shall be multiplied by the tax rate established on the
preceding January 1 assessment of general property. The parking permit fee
shall first be reduced by the credit allowed under section 79.10, Wisconsin
statutes. The total annual parking permit fee thus computed shall be divided by
twelve (12) and shall represent the monthly mobile home parking permit fee. The
fee shall be applicable to occupied mobile homes moving into the tax district
anytime during the year. The park operator shall furnish information to the
village clerk and the assessor on occupied mobile homes added to this park
within five (5) days after their arrival, on forms prescribed by the department
of revenue. As soon as the assessor receives the notice of an addition of an
occupied home to a park, he shall determine its fair market value and notify
the clerk of his determination. The clerk shall equalize the fair market value
established by the assessor and shall apply the tax rate for that year, divide
the annual parking permit fee thus determined by twelve (12) and notify the
mobile home owner of the monthly fee to be collected from said mobile home
owner. The mobile home park operator shall collect the monthly parking fee from
the mobile home owner. Liability for payment of the fee shall begin on the
first day of the next succeeding month and shall remain on the mobile home only
for such months as the occupied mobile home remains in the tax district. A new
fee rate and a new valuation shall be established each January and shall
continue for that calendar year. The valuation established shall be subject to
review as are other values established under chapter 70, Wisconsin statutes. If
the board of review reduces a valuation on which previous monthly payments have
been made, the tax district shall refund past excess fee payments. The monthly
parking permit fee shall be paid by the mobile home owner to the mobile park
owner, said payments to be made to the village treasurer by said mobile park
owner on or before the tenth of the month following the month for which such
parking permit fee is due. No such fee shall be imposed for any space occupied
by mobile home accompanied by an automobile if the mobile home and automobile
bear license plates issued by any other state, for an accumulating period not
to exceed sixty (60) days in any twelve (12) months or if the occupants of the
mobile home are nonresident tourists or vacationists. Exemption certificates in
duplicate shall be accepted by the village treasurer from qualified nonresident
tourists or vacationists in lieu of monthly mobile home permit fees. When one
or more persons occupying a mobile home are employed in this state, there shall
be no exemption from the monthly parking permit fee.
   The licensee of a park shall be liable for the monthly parking permit fee
for any mobile home occupying space therein as well as the owner and occupant
thereof. (1968 Code § 2.09; amd. Ord., 1-18-1999; Ord. 2010-8, 10-18-2010; Ord.

3-4-5: HEARING TO DETERMINE FEE, APPEAL:
   A.   Determination: The village shall make preliminary determination of the
amount of the per mobile home parking permit fee to be levied against a mobile
home park, and shall give notice of hearing on said proposed parking permit fee
to be held in the village hall where any interested person shall have an
opportunity to be heard.
   B.   Posting Notice: The village clerk shall post a notice of said hearing
in at least three (3) public places within the village, one posting of which
shall be in a conspicuous place on each mobile home park property. At least one
week shall intervene between the date of posting of such notice and the time of
the meeting. The village may, at such meeting, or at an adjourned meeting,
confirm or change the proposed parking permit fee and upon final determination
of the amount of the parking permit fee shall post notice on each mobile home
park property, stating the amount of the parking permit fee as finally
determined.
   C.   Appeal: If the owner of any parcel of land affected by such
determination feels himself aggrieved thereby, he may, within twenty (20) days
after the date of posting such determination, appeal to the circuit court of
the county, notice thereof to be served upon the village clerk, and by
executing a bond to the village in the sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00)
with two (2) sureties or a bonding company to be approved by the clerk
conditioned for the faithful prosecution of such appeal and the payment of all
costs adjudged against him. The clerk, in case such an appeal is taken, shall
make a brief statement of the proceedings had before the board, with its
determination thereon and shall submit the same with all relevant papers to the
clerk of the circuit court. Such appeal shall be tried and determined in the
same manner as cases originally commenced in the court. An appeal brought under
this chapter shall not be construed to prevent, during the pendency of such
appeal, the collection of any such monthly assessment currently or subsequently
to become due.

owned and operated by any county under the provisions of section 59.07(13)(b),

liability for such fee was incurred, effective as of the first day of the month
or year for which such fee is levied. The village shall provide that all such
license or permit fees not paid when due shall be extended upon the tax roll as
delinquent tax against the parcel where such park, camp or home is or was
situated at the time when liability for such fee was incurred, and such
proceedings in relation to the collection, return and sale of property for
delinquent real estate taxes shall apply to such delinquent license or permit
fee. (1968 Code § 2.09)

The village may retain ten percent (10%) of the monthly parking permit fees
collected in each month to cover the cost of administration and shall pay to
the school district in which the park is located, within twenty (20) days after
the end of each month, such proportion of the remainder of the fees collected
in the preceding month and the credit allowed under section 79.10, Wisconsin
statutes, as the ratio of the most recent property tax levy for school purposes
bears to the total tax levy for all purposes in the village. If the mobile home
park is located in more than one school district, each district shall receive a
share in the proportion that its property tax levy for school purposes bears to
the total school tax levy. (1968 Code § 2.09)

Exceptions
4-6-4: Severability
4-6-5: Penalties
4-6-1: FINDING AND ISSUE:
   A.   Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence and
sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an
extreme threat to public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use
physical violence and to repeat their offenses; and most sexual offenders
commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are
prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual
offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly
exorbitant.
   B.   It is the intent of this section not to impose a criminal penalty but
rather to serve the compelling interest of the village of Reedsville to
promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens
of the village by creating areas around locations where children regularly
congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual
predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence.

   B.   Summary Abatement:
      1.   Notice To Owner: If the inspecting officer shall determine that a
public nuisance exists within the village, and that there is great and
immediate danger to the public health, safety, peace, morals or decency, the
village president may direct the appropriate village official to serve notice
on the person causing, permitting or maintaining such nuisance or upon the

the owner, occupant or person causing, permitting or maintaining the nuisance,
as the case may be.

provided or if the owner, occupant or person causing the nuisance cannot be
found, the officer having the duty of enforcement shall cause the abatement or
removal of such public nuisance.
   C.   Abatement By Court Action: If the inspecting officer shall determine
that a public nuisance exists on private premises but that the nature of such
nuisance is not such as to threaten great and immediate danger to the public
health, safety, peace, morals or decency, he shall file a written report of his
findings to the village president, who shall, upon direction of the village

   A.   Peace officers of the village have a duty to suppress unlawful
assemblies within the village. For that reason any peace officer of the village
may order all persons who are part of an assembly to disperse.
   B.   An "unlawful assembly" is an assembly which consists of three (3) or
more persons and which causes such a disturbance of public order that it is
reasonable to believe that the assembly will cause injury to persons or damage
to property unless it is immediately dispersed. Any "unlawful assembly"
includes an assembly of persons who assemble for the purpose of blocking or
obstructing the lawful use by any other person or persons of any private or
public thoroughfares, property or of any positions of access or exits to or
from any private or public building, or dwelling place, or of any portion
thereof and which assembly does in fact so block or obstruct the lawful use by
any other person, or persons of any such private or public thoroughfares,
property or any position of access or exit to or from any private or public
building or dwelling place, or any portion thereof.
   C.   Whoever intentionally fails or refuses to withdraw from an unlawful
assembly from which he knows he has been ordered to disperse shall forfeit not
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00).
   D.   Whoever causes or attempts to cause, or participates in an unlawful
assembly upon any property of a public institution of higher education or upon
any highway abutting on such property is punishable under this section, if that
person fails to withdraw from the assembly promptly upon issuance of an order
to disperse, if such order is given in such manner that such person can
reasonably be expected to hear or read such order.
   E.   It shall be deemed unlawful assembly whenever three (3) or more persons
who are patrons of a tavern or other establishment to which a class B license
has been issued gather outside of said establishment and either intentionally
or unintentionally block the public thoroughfare when the said thoroughfare is
the public sidewalk or the public street. Should any passerby be required to
walk unto the public street or public highway around persons who have gathered
outside of said establishment, then it shall be prima facie evidence that the
persons who have gathered outside of said class B establishment have obstructed
the public thoroughfare. Any person convicted of so obstructing the public
thoroughfare shall be punished pursuant to subsection C of this section. (Ord.,
8-16-1982)

The building or structure to be moved shall conform with the existing buildings

and gutters over which said building has been moved and ascertain their
condition. If the removal of said building has caused any damage to any street,
curb, or gutter, the person to whom the permit was issued shall immediately
place them in as good repair as they were before the permit was granted. On the
failure of said permit holder to do so within ten (10) days thereafter to the
satisfaction of the village board acting through the village president, the
village shall order the repair of the damage to such street, curb or gutter and
hold the person obtaining such permit and sureties of the bond given
responsible for the payment of same.
   I.   Conformance With Code: No permit shall be issued to move a building

and of such construction that it will meet the requirements of this building
code in all respects. A complete plan of all further repairs, improvements, and
remodeling with reference to such building shall be submitted to the building
inspector and the building inspector shall make a finding of fact to the effect

thereof, the provisions with respect to the furnishing of plans and
specifications for proposed alterations to such building may be disregarded.
   J.   Utilities, Trees, Overhead Obstructions: Every person receiving a
permit to move a building or structure shall be responsible for obtaining all
permits required by the utilities involved and any other applicable parties of
interest. Damage done to any utilities shall be reported to that utility. The

overhead obstruction. The permit holder shall be responsible for payment of the

prohibitions, regulations or limitations imposed by the traffic and parking
regulations for that street.
   C.   No person shall park or occupy any mobile home on the premises of any

of any one floor of the dwelling unit (including the basement or cellar) shall
be used in the conduct of home occupation.

hazard, electrical interference or any other nuisance not normally associated
with the average residential use in the district.
   G.   Home occupations shall include the use of the premises by a physician,
surgeon, dentist, lawyer, clergyman or other professional persons for
consultation or emergency treatment, but not for the general practice of his
profession.
   H.   The following uses have a tendency to expand beyond the provisions for
home occupations and thereby impair the character of residential areas,
therefore, they shall not be permitted as accessory uses in residential
districts: small motor repair, painting of vehicles or boats, television
repair, auto repair.
   I.   Before anyone shall engage in any customary home occupation, they shall
first obtain a permit from the village clerk. This permission shall be

be a public building and subject to fire inspections under section

alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain.
(Ord. 2007-6, 11-19-2007; amd. Ord., 12-8-2022)
8-13-4: TITLE:
This chapter shall be known as the FLOODPLAIN ZONING ORDINANCE FOR VILLAGE OF
REEDSVILLE, WISCONSIN. (Ord. 2007-6, 11-19-2007; amd. Ord., 12-8-2022)
8-13-5: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Areas To Be Regulated: This chapter regulates all areas of special
flood hazard identified as zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map. Additional areas identified on maps approved by the Department of
Natural Resources (DNR) and local community may also be regulated under the
provisions of this chapter, where applicable.
   B.   Official Maps And Revisions: Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) are
designated as zones A, A1-30, AE, AH, AO, on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRMs) based on flood hazard analyses summarized in the Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) listed in subd. (1) below. Additional flood hazard areas subject to
regulation under this chapter are identified on maps based on studies approved
by the DNR and listed in subd. (2) below. These maps and revisions are on file
in the office of the Village Clerk-Treasurer.
      1.   Official Maps: Based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS):
      2.   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel numbers 55071C0140D and
55071C0145D, dated 08/02/2011;
      3.   Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Manitowoc County, volumes
55071CV001E and 55071CV002E, dated 02/23/2023.
      4.   Approved by: the DNR and FEMA.
   C.   Establishment Of Floodplain Zoning Districts: The flood hazard areas
regulated by this chapter are divided into districts as follows:
      1.   The floodway district (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and
those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the
regional floodwaters, within AE zones as shown on the FIRM, or within A Zones
shown on the FIRM when determined according to section
8-13-9(E) of this chapter.
      2.   The flood fringe district (FF) is that portion of a riverine special
flood hazard area outside the floodway within AE zones on the FIRM, or, when
floodway limits have been determined according to section
8-13-9(E) of this chapter, within A zones shown on the FIRM.
      3.   The general floodplain district (GFP) is those riverine areas that
may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood in which a floodway
boundary has not been delineated on the FIRM and also includes shallow flooding
areas identified as AH and AO zones on the FIRM.
   D.   Locating Floodplain Boundaries: Discrepancies between the exterior
boundaries of zones A1-30, AE, AH, or A on the official floodplain zoning map
and actual field conditions may be resolved using the criteria in subd. (1) or
(2) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended
according to section
8-13-12 of this chapter. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary
derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or
not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible
for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon
which the district boundary was determined. Disputes between the zoning
administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled
according to section
8-13-11(C) of this chapter and the criteria in (1) and (2) below. Where the
flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA
must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to section
8-13-12 of this chapter.
      1.   If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations
shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations
shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
      2.   Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, including any
boundary of zone A, AO, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the
map scale.
   E.   Removal Of Lands From Floodplain:
      1.   Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be grounds
for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet
(2') above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land
outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to section
8-13-12 of this chapter.
      2.   The delineation of any of the Floodplain Districts may be revised by
the community where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/or where more
detailed studies have been conducted. However, prior to any such change,
approval must be obtained from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources
and Federal Emergency Management Agency. A completed Letter of Map Revision is
a record of this approval. The floodplain administrator shall not sign a
community acknowledgment form unless all criteria set forth in the following
paragraphs are met:
         a.   The land and/or land around the structure must be filled at least
two feet (2') above the regional or base flood elevation;
         b.   The fill must be contiguous to land outside the floodplain;
applicant shall obtain floodplain development permit before applying for a LOMR
or LOMR-F;
      3.   Removal of lands from the floodplain may also occur by operation of
section 87.30(1)(e), Wisconsin statutes if a property owner has obtained a
letter of map amendment from the federal emergency management agency under 44
C.F.R. 70.
   F.   Compliance:
         1.   No structure or use within areas regulated by this chapter shall
hereafter be located, erected, constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended,
converted, enlarged, or altered without full compliance with the terms of these
regulations and all other applicable regulations that apply to uses within the
jurisdiction of these regulations.
   2.   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a violation
of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
8-13-13 of this chapter.
      3.   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the floodplain administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications, or
amendments thereto if approved by the floodplain administrator. Use,
arrangement, or construction contrary to that authorized shall be deemed a
violation of these regulations and punishable in accordance with section
8-13-13 of this chapter.
   G.   Municipalities And State Agencies Regulated: Unless specifically
exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to
comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are
required to comply if section 13.48(13), Wisconsin statutes, applies. The
construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and
bridges by the Wisconsin department of transportation is exempt when section
30.2022, Wisconsin statutes, applies. Although exempt from a local zoning
permit and permit fees, DOT must provide sufficient project documentation and
analysis to ensure that the community is in compliance with federal, state, and
local floodplain standards. If a local transportation project is located within
a zone A floodplain and is not WisDOT project under section 30.2022, then the
road project design documents (including appropriate detailed plans and
profiles) may be sufficient to meet the requirements for issuance of a local
floodplain permit if the following apply: The applicant provides documentation
to the floodplain administrator that the proposed project is a culvert
replacement or bridge replacement under twenty feet (20') span at the same
location, the project is exempt from a DNR permit under section 30.123(6)(d),
the capacity is not decreased, the top road grade is not raised, and no
floodway data is available from a federal, state, or other source. If floodway
data is available in the impacted area from a federal, state, or other source
that existing data must be utilized by the applicant in the analysis of the
project site.
   H.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions:
      1.   This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under sections 61.35 for villages; or 87.30, Wisconsin
statutes, which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance shall
continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions,
but not otherwise.
      2.   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this chapter imposes
greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
   I.   Interpretation: In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this chapter are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of
the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers
granted by the Wisconsin statutes. If a provision of this chapter, required by
chapter NR 116, Wisconsin administrative code, is unclear, the provision shall
be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption
hereof or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this
chapter.
   J.   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The flood protection standards in
this chapter are based on engineering experience and scientific research.
Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by manmade or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply or guarantee that nonfloodplain
areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood
damages. This chapter does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of
action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damage that may result from reliance on this chapter.
   K.   Severability: Should any portion of this chapter be declared
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder
of this chapter shall not be affected.
   L.   Annexed Areas For Cities And Villages: The Manitowoc County floodplain
zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect
and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the
municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of
chapter NR 116, Wisconsin administrative code and 44 CFR 59-72, national flood
insurance program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the
municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are
incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are
on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps
of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the floodway
location. (Ord. 2007-6, 11-19-2007; amd. Ord. 2011-4, 7-18-2011; Ord., 12-8-
2022)
8-13-6: GENERAL STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO ALL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS:
   A.   General Standards Applicable To All Floodplain Districts: The community
shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building
sites will be reasonably safe from flooding and assure that all necessary
permits have been received from those governmental agencies whose approval is
required by federal or state law.
      1.   If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new
construction and substantial improvements shall:
         a.   Be designed and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic
loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
         b.   Be constructed with flood-resistant materials;
         c.   Be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood
damages; and
         d.   Mechanical and utility equipment must be elevated to or above the
flood protection elevation.
      2.   If a subdivision or other proposed new development is in a flood-
prone area, the community shall assure that:
         a.   Such proposed subdivision or other proposed new development is
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage within the flood-prone area;
         b.   Public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical,
and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage; and
         c.   Adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazards.
      3.   All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall
include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that
meets the subdivision definition of this chapter and all other requirements in
section
8-13-11(A)(2) of this chapter.
   B.   Hydraulic And Hydrologic Analyses:
      1.   No floodplain development shall:
         a.   "Obstruct flow", defined as development which blocks the
conveyance of floodwaters by itself or with other development, causing any
increase in the regional flood height; or
         b.   Cause any increase in the regional flood height due to floodplain
storage area lost.
      2.   The zoning administrator shall deny permits if it is determined the
proposed development will obstruct flow or cause any increase in the regional
flood height, based on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map, unless
the provisions of
8-13-12 of this chapter are met.
   C.   Watercourse Alterations: No land use permit to alter or relocate a
watercourse in a mapped floodplain shall be issued until the local official has
notified in writing all adjacent municipalities, the department and FEMA
regional offices and required the applicant to secure all necessary state and
federal permits. The standards of subsection (B) of this section must be met
and the flood carrying capacity of any altered or relocated watercourse shall
be maintained.
As soon as is practicable, but not later than six (6) months after the date of
the watercourse alteration or relocation, and pursuant to
8-13-12 of this chapter, the community shall apply for a Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR) from FEMA. Any such alterations must be reviewed and approved by FEMA
and the DNR through the LOMC process.
   D.   Chapter 30, 31, Wisconsin Statutes Development: Development which
requires a permit from the department, under chapters 30 and 31, Wisconsin
statutes, such as docks, piers, wharves, bridges, culverts, dams and
navigational aids, may be allowed if the necessary permits are obtained and
amendments to the floodplain zoning ordinance are made according to
8-13-12 of this chapter.
   E.   Public Or Private Campgrounds: Public or private campgrounds shall have
a low flood damage potential and shall meet the following provisions:
      1.   The campground is approved by the department of agriculture, trade
and consumer protection.
      2.   A land use permit for the campground is issued by the zoning
administrator.
      3.   The character of the river system and the campground elevation are
such that a 72-hour warning of an impending flood can be given to all
campground occupants.
      4.   There is an adequate flood warning procedure for the campground that
offers the minimum notice required under this subsection to all persons in the
campground. This procedure shall include a written agreement between the
campground owner, the floodplain zoning agency or zoning administrator, the
municipal emergency government coordinator and the chief law enforcement
official which specifies the flood elevation at which evacuation shall occur,
personnel responsible for monitoring flood elevations, types of warning systems
to be used and the procedures for notifying at risk parties, and the methods
and personnel responsible for conducting the evacuation.
      5.   This agreement shall be for no more than one calendar year, at which
time the agreement shall be reviewed and updated by the officials identified in
subsection E4 of this section to remain in compliance with all applicable
regulations, including those of the state department of agriculture, trade and
consumer protection and all other applicable regulations. (Ord. 2007-6, 11-19-
2007; amd. Ord. 2011-4, 7-18-2011)
      6.   All mobile recreational vehicles placed on site must meet one of the
following:
         a.   Be fully licensed, if required, and ready for highway use;
         b.   Not occupy any site in the campground for more than 180
consecutive days, at which time the recreational vehicle must be removed from
the floodplain for a minimum of 24 hours; or
         c.   Meet the requirements in either section
8-13-7,
8-13-8, or
8-13-9 of this chapter for the floodplain district in which the structure is
located;
A mobile recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels
or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect utilities
and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
      7.   All camping units that remain on site for more than thirty (30) days
shall be issued a limited authorization by the campground operator, a written
copy of which is kept on file at the campground. Such authorization shall allow
placement of a camping unit consistent with subsection E6 and shall ensure
compliance with all the provisions of this section.
      8.   The municipality shall monitor the limited authorizations issued by
the campground operator to assure compliance with the terms of this subsection.
      9.   The campground shall have signs clearly posted at all entrances
warning of the flood hazard and the procedures for evacuation when a flood
warning is issued.
      10.   All service facilities, including, but not limited to, refuse
collection, electrical service, gas lines, propane tanks, sewage systems and
wells shall be properly anchored and placed at or floodproofed to the flood
protection elevation.
      11.   Standards for structures in a campground:
         a.   All structures must comply with this section or meet the
applicable requirements in
8-13-7,
8-13-8, or
8-13-9 for the floodplain district in which the structure is located;
         b.   Deck/landing: A portable landing may be allowed for a camping
unit for each entry provided that the landing is not permanently attached to
the ground or camping unit, is no more than two hundred (200) square feet in
size, shall be portable, contain no walls or roof, and can be removed from the
campground by a truck and/or trailer. Sections of such portable landings may be
placed together to form a single deck not greater than two hundred (200) square
feet at one entry point. Provisions for the removal of these temporary landings
during flood events must be addressed within the written agreement with the
municipality compliant with subsection E4 of this section. Any such deck/
landing structure may be constructed at elevations lower than the flood
protection elevation but must not obstruct flow of flood waters or cause any
increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the regional flood.
         c.   Decks/patios that are constructed completely at grade may be
allowed, but must also comply with applicable shoreland zoning standards.
         d.   Camping equipment and appurtenant equipment in the campground may
be allowed provided that the equipment is not permanently attached to the
ground or camping unit, is not used as a habitable structure, and must not
obstruct flow of flood waters or cause any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the regional flood. Provisions for the removal of this equipment
during flooding events shall be addressed within the written agreement with the
municipality compliant with subsection E4 of this section.
         e.   Once a flood warning in the written agreement has been issued for
the campground, the campground owner or the designated operator shall ensure
that all persons, camping units, decks, camping equipment and appurtenant
equipment in the campground shall be evacuated within the timelines specified
within the written agreement with the municipality compliant with subsection E4
of this section.
      12.   A land use permit shall be obtained as provided under
8-13-11A2 before any development; repair, modification or addition to an
existing structure; or change in the use of a building or structure, including
sewer and water facilities, may be initiated. (Ord. 2007-6, 11-19-2007; amd.

zoning ordinance with s. 87.30, Wisconsin statutes, and §§ NR 116.12-14,
Wisconsin administrative code and 44 CFR 59-72, these standards shall apply to
all modifications or additions to any nonconforming use or structure and to the
use of any structure or premises which was lawful before the passage of this
chapter or any amendment thereto. A party asserting existence of a lawfully
established nonconforming use or structure has the burden of proving that the
use or structure was compliant with the floodplain zoning ordinance in effect
at the time the use or structure was created.
         b.   As permit applications are received for additions, modifications,
or substantial improvements to nonconforming buildings in the floodplain,
municipalities shall develop a list of those nonconforming buildings, their
present equalized assessed value and a list of the cost of those activities
associated with changes to those buildings.
      2.   The existing lawful use of a structure or its accessory use which is
not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter may continue subject to
the following conditions:
         a.   No modifications or additions to a nonconforming use or structure
shall be permitted unless they comply with this chapter. The words
"modification" and "addition" include, but are not limited to, any alteration,
addition, modification, structural repair, rebuilding or replacement of any
such existing use, structure or accessory structure or use. Maintenance is not
considered a modification; this includes painting, decorating, paneling and
other nonstructural components and the maintenance, repair or replacement of
existing private sewage or water supply systems or connections to public
utilities. Any costs associated with the repair of a damaged structure are not
considered maintenance.
The construction of a deck that does not exceed two hundred (200) square feet
and that is adjacent to the exterior wall of a principal structure is not an
extension, modification or addition. The roof of the structure may extend over
a portion of the deck in order to provide safe ingress and egress to the
principal structure;
         b.   If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming structure is
discontinued for twelve (12) consecutive months, it is no longer permitted and
any future use of the property, and any structure or building thereon, shall
conform to the applicable requirements of this chapter;
         c.   The municipality shall keep a record which lists all
nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures, their present equalized
assessed value, the cost of all modifications or additions which have been
permitted, and the percentage of the structure's total current value those
modifications represent;
         d.   No modification or addition to any nonconforming structure or any
structure with a nonconforming use, which over the life of the structure would
equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of its present equalized assessed value,
shall be allowed unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a
conforming structure with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable
requirements of this chapter. Contiguous dry land access must be provided for
residential and commercial uses in compliance with subsection
8-13-8C1 of this chapter. The costs of elevating the lowest floor of a
nonconforming building or a building with a nonconforming use to the flood
protection elevation are excluded from the fifty percent (50%) provisions of
this subsection A2d;
         e.   No maintenance on a per event basis to any nonconforming
structure or any structure with a nonconforming use, the cost of which would
equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of its present equalized assessed value,
shall be allowed unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a
conforming structure with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable
requirements of this chapter. Contiguous dry land access must be provided for
residential and commercial uses in compliance with
8-13-8C1. Maintenance to any nonconforming structure, which does not exceed
fifty percent (50%) of its present equalized assessed value on a per event
basis, does not count against the cumulative calculations over the life of the
structure for substantial improvement calculations;
         f.   If on a per event basis the total value of the work being done
under (d) and (e) equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the present
equalized assessed value the work shall not be permitted unless the entire
structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure with a conforming
use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this chapter. Contiguous
dry land access must be provided for residential and commercial uses in
compliance with
8-13-8C1;
         g.   Except as provided in subsection (h), if any nonconforming
structure or any structure with a nonconforming use is destroyed or is
substantially damaged, it cannot be replaced, reconstructed or rebuilt unless
the use and the structure meet the current ordinance requirements. A structure
is considered substantially damaged if the total cost to restore the structure
to its pre-damaged condition equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
structure’s present equalized assessed value;
         h.   For nonconforming buildings that are substantially damaged or
destroyed by a nonflood disaster, the repair or reconstruction of any such
nonconforming building shall be permitted in order to restore it to the size
and use in effect prior to the damage event, provided that the following

adequate justification shall be provided for any parameters outside standard
accepted engineering practices.
                  ix.   The model must extend past the upstream limit of the
difference in the existing and proposed flood profiles in order to provide a
tie-in to existing studies. The height difference between the proposed flood
profile and the existing study profiles shall be no more than 0.00 feet.
               (C)   Mapping: A work map of the reach studied shall be
provided, showing all cross-section locations, floodway/floodplain limits based
on best available topographic data, geographic limits of the proposed
development and whether the proposed development is located in the floodway.
                  i.   If the proposed development is located outside of the
floodway, then it is determined to have no impact on the regional flood
elevation.
                  ii.   If any part of the proposed development is in the
floodway, it must be added to the base model to show the difference between
existing and proposed conditions. The study must ensure that all coefficients
remain the same as in the existing model, unless adequate justification based
on standard accepted engineering practices is provided.
            (2)   Zone AE Floodplains:
               (A)   Hydrology: If the proposed hydrology will change the
existing study, the appropriate method to be used shall be based on ch. NR

Regional Flood Discharge.
               (B)   Hydraulic Model: The regional flood elevation shall be
based on the standards in ch. NR 116.07(4), Wisconsin administrative code,
Hydraulic Analysis: Determination of Regional Flood Elevation and the
following:
                  i.   Duplicate Effective Model: The effective model shall be
reproduced to ensure correct transference of the model data and to allow
integration of the revised data to provide a continuous FIS model upstream and
downstream of the revised reach. If data from the effective model is available,
models shall be generated that duplicate the FIS profiles and the elevations
shown in the Floodway Data Table in the FIS report to within 0.1 foot.
                  ii.   Corrected Effective Model: The corrected effective
model shall not include any man-made physical changes since the effective model
date but shall import the model into the most current version of HEC-RAS for
department review.
                  iii.   Existing (Pre-Project Conditions) Model: The existing
model shall be required to support conclusions about the actual impacts of the
project associated with the revised (post-project) model or to establish more
up-to-date models on which to base the revised (post-project) model.
                  iv.   Revised (Post-Project Conditions) Model: The revised
(post-project conditions) model shall incorporate the existing model and any
proposed changes to the topography caused by the proposed development. This
model shall reflect proposed conditions.
                  v.   All changes to the duplicate effective model and
subsequent models must be supported by certified topographic information,
bridge plans, construction plans and survey notes.
                  vi.   Changes to the hydraulic models shall be limited to the
stream reach for which the revision is being requested. Cross sections upstream
and downstream of the revised reach shall be identical to those in the
effective model and result in water surface elevations and topwidths computed
by the revised models matching those in the effective models upstream and
downstream of the revised reach as required. The effective model shall not be
truncated.
               (C)   Mapping: Maps and associated engineering data shall be
submitted to the department for review which meet the following conditions:
                  i.   Consistency between the revised hydraulic models, the
revised floodplain and floodway delineations, the revised flood profiles,
topographic work map, annotated FIRMs and/or Flood Boundary floodway maps
(FBFMs), construction plans, bridge plans.
                  ii.   Certified topographic map of suitable scale, contour
interval, and a planimetric map showing the applicable items. If a digital
version of the map is available, it may be submitted in order that the FIRM may
be more easily revised.
                  iii.   Annotated FIRM panel showing the revised one percent
(1%) and 0.2% annual chance floodplains and floodway boundaries.
                  iv.   If an annotated FIRM and/or FBFM and digital mapping
data (GIS or CADD) are used then all supporting documentation or metadata must
be included with the data submission along with the Universal Transverse
Mercator (UTM) projection and State Plane Coordinate System in accordance with
FEMA mapping specifications.
                  v.   The revised floodplain boundaries shall tie into the
effective floodplain boundaries.
                  vi.   All cross sections from the effective model shall be
labeled in accordance with the effective map and a cross section lookup table
shall be included to relate to the model input numbering scheme.
                  vii.   Both the current and proposed floodways shall be shown
on the map.
                  viii.   The stream centerline, or profile baseline used to
measure stream distances in the model shall be visible on the map.
               (D)   Expiration: All permits issued under the authority of this
chapter shall expire no more than one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance.
The permit may be extended for a maximum of one hundred eighty (180) days for
good and sufficient cause. If the permitted work has not started within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date, the development must comply with
any regulation, including any revision to the FIRM or FIS, that took effect
after the permit date.
      3.   Certificate Of Compliance: No land shall be occupied or used, and no
building which is hereafter constructed, altered, added to, modified, repaired,
rebuilt or replaced shall be occupied until a certificate of compliance is
issued by the zoning administrator, except where no permit is required, subject
to the following provisions:
         a.   The certificate of compliance shall show that the building or
premises or part thereof, and the proposed use, conform to the provisions of
this chapter;

               of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the improvement or
               repair is started. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any
SUBSTANTIAL    repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the work performed.
IMPROVEMENT:   The term does not include either any project for the improvement of a building
               required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations
               identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary to assure
               safe living conditions; or any alteration of a historic structure provided that

8-14-7: Enforcement And Penalties
8-14-8: Definitions
8-14-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT, STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND
TITLE:
   A.   Statutory Authorization: This chapter is adopted pursuant to the
authorization in sections 61.35 and 61.351 for villages and 87.30 and 144.26,
Wisconsin statutes.
   B.   Findings Of Fact And Purpose: Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-
wetlands and pollution of the navigable waters of the municipality would
adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare
and impair the tax base. The legislature of Wisconsin has delegated
responsibility to all municipalities to:
      1.   Promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare;
      2.   Maintain the storm and flood water storage capacity of wetlands;
      3.   Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which
filter or store sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that
would otherwise drain into navigable waters;
      4.   Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life and
wildlife by preserving wetlands and other aquatic habitat;
      5.   Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area; and
      6.   Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal
of natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland- wetland excavation,
filling and other earth moving activities. (Ord., 1-3-1994)
8-14-2: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Compliance: The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within
the shoreland area of the municipality shall be in full compliance with the
terms of this chapter and other applicable local, state or federal regulations.
(However, see section
8-14-4 of this chapter, for the standards applicable to nonconforming uses.)
All permitted development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless
otherwise expressly excluded by a provision of this chapter.
   B.   Municipalities And State Agencies Regulated: Unless specifically
exempted by law, all villages are required to comply with this ordinance and
obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if section
13.48(13), Wisconsin statutes, applies. The construction, reconstruction,
maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin
department of transportation are exempt when section 30.12(4)(a), Wisconsin
statutes, applies.
   C.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions:
      1.   This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under sections 61.35, 62.23 or 87.30, Wisconsin statutes,
which relate to floodplains and shoreland-wetlands, except that where another
municipal zoning ordinance is more restrictive than this chapter, that
ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater
restrictions, but not otherwise.
      2.   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this chapter
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
   D.   Interpretation: In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the municipality and shall not be deemed a limitation or
repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin statutes. Where a provision
of this chapter is required by a standard in chapter NR 117, Wisconsin
administrative code, and where the chapter provision is unclear, the provision
shall be interpreted in light of the chapter NR 117 standards in effect on the
date of the adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most
recent text amendment to this chapter.
   E.   Severability: Should any portion of this chapter be declared invalid or
unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this
chapter shall not be affected.
   F.   Annexed Areas: The Manitowoc County shoreland zoning provisions in
effect on the date of annexation remain in effect administered by the
municipality for all areas annexed by the municipality after May 7, 1982. These
annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. The
Manitowoc County shoreland zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for
the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the
municipal zoning administrator. (Ord., 1-3-1994)
8-14-3: SHORELAND-WETLAND ZONING DISTRICT:
   A.   Shoreland-Wetland Zoning Maps: The following maps are hereby adopted
and made part of this chapter and are on file in the office of the municipal
clerk.
      1.   Wisconsin wetland inventory maps stamped "final" on September 9,
1993.
      2.   Floodplain zoning maps titled "flood insurance rate map #01" and
dated September 30, 1988.
      3.   United States geological survey maps dated.
      4.   Zoning maps titled.
   B.   District Boundaries:
      1.   Boundary Area: The shoreland-wetland zoning district includes all
wetlands in the municipality which are five (5) acres or more and are shown on
the final wetland inventory map that has been adopted and made a part of this
chapter and which are:
         a.   Within one thousand feet (1,000') of the ordinary high water mark
of the navigable lakes, ponds or flowages. Lakes, ponds or flowages in the
municipality shall be presumed to be navigable if they are shown on the United
States geological survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have
been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter.
         b.   Within three hundred feet (300') of the ordinary high water mark
of navigable rivers or streams, or to the landward side of the floodplain,
whichever distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be
navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways
on the United States geological survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base
maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter.
Floodplain zoning maps adopted in subsection A of this section shall be used to
determine the extent of floodplain areas.
      2.   Determination Made By Zoning Administrator: Determination of
navigability and ordinary high water mark location shall initially be made by
the zoning administrator. When questions arise, the zoning administrator shall
contact the appropriate district office of the department for a final
determination of navigability or ordinary high water mark.
      3.   Map Discrepancies: When an apparent discrepancy exists between the
shoreland-wetland district boundary shown on the official zoning maps and
actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the zoning
administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the department
to determine if the shoreland-wetland district boundary as mapped, is in error.
If department staff concur with the zoning administrator that a particular area
was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the zoning administrator shall have the
authority to immediately grant or deny a zoning permit in accordance with the
regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct
wetland mapping errors or acknowledge exempted wetlands designated in
subsections E and F of this section, the zoning administrator shall be
responsible for initiating a map amendment within a reasonable period.
      4.   Filled Wetlands: Wetlands which are filled prior to September 9,
1993, the date of which the municipality received final wetland inventory maps,
in a manner which affects their wetland characteristics to the extent that the
area can no longer be defined as wetland, are not subject to this chapter.
      5.   Wetlands Landward Of A Bulkhead Line: Wetlands located between the
original high water mark and a bulkhead line established prior to May 7, 1982,
under section 30.11, Wisconsin statutes, are not subject to this chapter.
   C.   Permitted Uses: The following uses are permitted subject to the
provisions of chapters 30 and 31, Wisconsin statutes, and the provisions of
other local, state and federal laws, if applicable:
      1.   Activities and uses which do not require the issuance of a zoning
permit, provided that no wetland alteration occurs:
         a.   Hiking, fishing, trapping, hunting, swimming, snowmobiling and
boating;
         b.   The harvesting of wild crops, such as marsh hay, ferns, moss,
wild rice, berries, tree fruits and tree seeds, in a manner that is not
injurious to the natural reproduction of such crops;
         c.   The practice of silviculture, including the planting, thinning

control facilities.
FIXED HOUSEBOAT: This term, as defined in section 30.121(1), Wisconsin
statutes, means a structure not actually used for navigation which extends
beyond the ordinary high water mark of a navigable waterway and is retained in
place either by cables to the shoreline or by anchors or spudpoles attached to

wetland zoning ordinance, comprised of shorelands that are designated as
wetlands on the wetlands inventory maps which have been adopted and made a part
of this chapter.
