§ 10.01 TITLE OF CODE.
   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the Town of Trafalgar,
Indiana, as revised, codified, rearranged, renumbered and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections, shall be known and designated
as the “Town Code,” for which designation “Code of Ordinances,” “codified
ordinances” or “code” may be substituted. Code title, chapter and section
headings do not constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.
§ 10.02 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.03 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.04 CONSTRUCTION OF CODE.
   (A)   This code is a codification of previously existing laws, amendments
thereto and newly enacted laws. Any previously existing law or amendment
thereto reenacted by this code shall continue in operation and effect, as if it

repealed or amended subsequent to the enactment of this code.
   (B)   Any appropriation repealed and reenacted by this code is continued
only for the period designated in the original enactment of that appropriation.
   (C)   The numerical order and position of sections in this code does not
resolve a conflict between two or more sections.
   (D)   Any irreconcilable conflict between sections shall be resolved by
reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or division.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning, application
or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)
§ 10.05 RULES OF INTERPRETATION; DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Rules of interpretation. This code shall be construed by the following
rules unless the construction is plainly repugnant to the legislative intent or
context of the provision.

sense. Technical words and phrases having a peculiar and appropriate meaning in
law shall be understood according to their technical import.
      (2)   Words imputing joint authority to three or more persons shall be
construed as imputing authority to a majority of the persons, unless otherwise
declared in the section giving the authority.
      (3)   Where a section requires an act to be done which, by law, an agent
or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.
      (4)   Words denoting the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the
feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,
and words in the plural shall include the singular; the use of a verb in the
present tense shall include the future, if applicable.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this code of ordinances, the following

different meaning.

§ 10.06 SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   If any section of this code now enacted or subsequently amended or its
application to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid section
or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is severable.
If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of
whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a statute stating that the provisions of an act are
severable as provided in division (B) of this section does not affect the
operation of division (B) with respect to that act.
(I.C. 1-1-1-8)
§ 10.07 REFERENCE TO OTHER SECTIONS.
   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof, the
reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified or renumbered, unless the subject matter is
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OFFICES; NAME DESIGNATIONS.
   (A)   Reference to offices. Reference to a public office or officer shall be
deemed to apply to any office, officer or employee of this municipality
exercising the powers, duties or functions contemplated in the provision,
irrespective of any transfer of functions or change in the official title of
the functionary.
   (B)   Name designations. Whenever any ordinance or resolution of the Council
refers to any board, bureau, commission, division, department, officer, agency,
authority or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; on the effective date of that ordinance or following the
effective date, the rights, powers, duties or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date
or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which the duties,
liabilities, powers and rights were transferred.
(I.C. 1-1-6-1)
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
the error.
§ 10.10 REASONABLE TIME.
   (A)   In all cases where an ordinance requires an act to be done in a
reasonable time or requires reasonable notice to be given, reasonable time or
notice shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of the act or the giving of the notice.
   (B)   The time within which an act is to be done, as herein provided, shall
be computed by excluding the first day and including the last. If the last day
be a Saturday, Sunday or a state holiday, it shall be excluded.
§ 10.11 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected
by the repeal and reenactment; but all suits, proceedings and prosecutions for
causes arising or acts committed prior to the effective date of this code may
be commenced and prosecuted with the same effect as if this code had not been
enacted.
Statutory reference:
   Periods of limitation, see I.C. 1-1-1-7

   (A)   If the legislative body shall desire to amend any existing chapter or
section of this code, the chapter or section shall be specifically repealed and
a new chapter or section, containing the desired amendment, substituted in its
place.
   (B)   Any ordinance which is proposed to add to the existing code a new
chapter or section shall indicate, with reference to the arrangement of this
code, the proper number of the chapter or section. In addition to an indication
thereof as may appear in the text of the proposed ordinance, a caption or title
shall be shown in concise form above the ordinance.
§ 10.15 SECTION HISTORIES; STATUTORY REFERENCES.
   (A)   As histories for the code sections, the specific number and passage
date of the original ordinance, and amending ordinances, if any, are listed
following the text of the code section. Example:

§ 10.16 PRESERVATION OF PENALTIES, OFFENSES, RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES.
   All offenses committed under laws in force prior to the effective date of
this code shall be prosecuted and remain punishable as provided by those laws.
This code does not affect any rights or liabilities accrued, penalties incurred
or proceedings begun prior to the effective date of this code. The liabilities,
proceedings and rights are continued; punishments, penalties or forfeitures
shall be enforced and imposed as if this code had not been enacted. In
particular, any agreement granting permission to utilize highway rights-of-way,
contracts entered into or franchises granted, the acceptance, establishment or
vacation of any highway, and the election of corporate officers shall remain

   (A)   The Trafalgar Town Council greatly values the voices of its citizens
and welcomes public comment on non-agenda items of community concern at two
points on its Regular Session agenda. Citizens may make general comments at
either the beginning of the meeting under Reports from the Public (limited to a
total cumulative time of 15 minutes) or at the end under Additional Reports
from the Public (limited to a total cumulative time of 20 minutes).
   (B)   In order to conduct meetings in the most effective manner possible,
the following rules apply to periods of general public comment and to periods
of public comment on a particular item:
      (1)   At each meeting, citizens may speak at only one of the two
opportunities for general public comment, but not both.
      (2)   Citizens are limited to one comment, not to exceed three minutes.
      (3)   When giving your comment, please state your name and address for
the record and speak directly into the microphone.
      (4)   All in-person comments must be made from the podium; speakers may

not engage the Council in a question-and-answer exchange during the Reports
from the Public periods.
      (6)   The Town Council encourages civility in public discourse and
requests that speakers refrain from language which would incite an immediate
breach of the peace; refrain from undue repetition, extended discussion of
irrelevancies, obscenity, and personal attacks against private individuals
unrelated to the operation of the town.
   (C)   These rules are intended to foster a fair, respectful, and productive
meeting. Any person who violates these rules will be declared out of order by
the President and will receive a warning. If an attendee receives three
warnings, the President may, upon issuing the third warning, direct:

      (2)   A law enforcement officer to remove the attendee from the meeting,
if the attendee refuses to leave when directed by the President for a violation
of these rules.

officer from immediately removing an attendee from a meeting if:
      (1)   Removal of the attendee is necessary to maintain order or ensure
the safety of another person;

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 33.01 NEPOTISM POLICY.
   (A)   The town finds that it is necessary and desirable to adopt a policy of
conduct with regard to nepotism in the employment with the town and in
contracting with the town in order to continue to be able to provide local
government services to its residents and to comply with the new laws effective
July 1, 2012, known as I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21, respectively.
   (B)   On July 1, 2012, the town shall have a nepotism and a contracting with
a unit policy that complies with the minimum requirements of I.C. 36-1-20.2
(hereinafter “Nepotism Policy”) and I.C. 36-1-21 (hereinafter “Contracting with
a Unit by a Relative Policy”) and implementation will begin.
   (C)   The “Town of Trafalgar Nepotism Policy” is hereby established
effective July 1, 2012, by adopting the minimum requirements provisions of I.C.
36-1-20.2, and including all future supplements and amendments thereto which
become law from time to time, and making them a part hereof as if fully set out
herein. In addition, a copy of I.C. 36-1-20.2 in effect on July 1 is attached
to Ordinance 2012-0009 and hereby adopted by reference as if set out in full.
   (D)   The “Town of Trafalgar Contracting with a Unit by a Relative Policy”
is hereby established effective July 1, 2012, by adopting the minimum
requirements provisions of I.C. 36-1-21, and including all future supplements
and amendments thereto which become law from time to time, and making them a
part hereof as if fully set out herein. In addition, a copy of I.C. 36-1-21 in
effect on July 1, 2012, is attached to Ordinance 2012-0009 and hereby adopted
by reference as if set out in full.
   (E)   The town finds that both I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21 specifically
allow a unit to adopt requirements that are “more stringent or detailed” and
that more detailed ones are necessary.
   (F)   The town further finds that a single member of the legislative body
cannot act for the body to make work assignments, compensation, grievances,
advancements or a performance evaluation without prior authority of a majority
of the body and, therefore, without such authority by the majority, he or she
will not be in the direct line of supervision. See I.C. 36-4-11 and I.C. 36-5-
2-9.4.
   (G)   The town finds that single members of governing bodies with authority
over employees in the town cannot act for the governing body to make work
assignments, compensation, grievances, advancement or a performance evaluation
without prior authority of a majority of the body, when a statute provides that
a majority is needed to act and, therefore, without such authority by the
majority the single member will not be in the direct line of supervision. See
[insert statute cite e.g. park board, plan commission, and the like].
   (H)   All elected and appointed officials and employees of the town are
hereby directed to cooperate fully in the implementation of the policies
created by this section and demonstrating compliance with these same policies.
   (I)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, compliance
and certifications connected with this Nepotism Policy is a violation and may
result in the discipline, including termination, of an employee or a transfer
from the direct line of supervision or other curative action. An elected or
appointed official of the town who fails to abide by or cooperate with the
implementation, with the compliance and with mandated certifications of the
Nepotism Policy, may be subject to action allowed by law.
   (J)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, compliance
and certifications connected with the Contracting with a Unit by a Relative
Policy is a violation and may result in the discipline, including termination,
of an employee or a curative action. An elected or appointed official of the
town who fails to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, with the
compliance and with mandated certifications of the Contracting with a Unit by a
Relative Policy may be subject to action allowed by law.
   (K)   (1)   The policies created by this section are hereby directed to be
implemented by any of the following actions:
         (a)   Posting a copy of this section in its entirety in at least one
of the locations in the town where it posts employer posters or other notices
to its employees;
         (b)   Providing a copy of this section to its employees and elected
and appointed officials;
         (c)   Providing or posting a notice of the adoption of this section;
or
         (d)   Any such other action or actions that would communicate the
policies established by this section to its employees and elected and appointed
officials.
      (2)   Upon the taking of any of these actions, the policies are deemed
implemented by the town.
   (L)   A copy of the provisions of I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21 effective
July 1, 2012, annexed to Ordinance 2012-0009, is hereby adopted by reference as
if set out in full herein. Two copies of these statutes, as supplemented or
amended, are on file in the office of the Clerk or Clerk Treasurer for the town
for public inspection as may be required by I.C. 36-4-5-4.

INVESTMENT OF TOWN FUNDS
§ 33.15 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this investment policy ordinance (the “policy”) is to set
forth the investment objectives and parameters for the management of public
funds of the town. This investment policy is designed to safeguard funds on
behalf of the town, to assure the availability of funds when needed, and
provide a competitive investment return.
(Ord. 2014-012, passed - - ; Ord. 2024-003, passed 2-15-2024)
§ 33.16 SCOPE.
   (A)   This policy applies to the investment of all funds of the city
including but not limited to, the general fund, special revenue funds, debt
service funds, project funds, and trust and agency funds.
   (B)   The town may consolidate fund balances to increase investment earnings
and to increase efficiencies with regard to investment pricing, banking fees
and administration. Investment income will be allocated to the various funds
based on their respective participation and in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.
(Ord. 2014-012, passed - - ; Ord. 2024-003, passed 2-15-2024)
§ 33.17 GENERAL OBJECTIVES.
   The primary objectives, in priority order, of investment activities shall be
safety, liquidity, and return.
   (A)   Safety.
      (1)   Credit risk. The town will minimize credit risk, which is the risk
of loss due to the failure of the security issuer or backer, by limiting
investments to the types of securities listed in §
33.20.
      (2)   Interest rate risk. The town will minimize interest rate risk,
which is the risk that the market value of securities in the portfolio will
fall due to changes in market interest rates, by structuring the investment
portfolio so that securities mature to meet cash requirements for ongoing
operations, thereby avoiding the need to sell securities prior to maturity.
   (B)   Liquidity. The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid
to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated. This is
accomplished by structuring the portfolio so that the securities mature
concurrent with cash needs to meet anticipated demands. Furthermore, since all
possible cash demands cannot be anticipated, a portion of the portfolio may be
placed in money market mutual funds or government investment pools which offer
same day liquidity for short-term funds.
   (C)   Yield. The investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective
of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles,
taking into account the investment risk constraints and liquidity needs. Return
on investment is of secondary importance compared to the safety and liquidity
objectives described above. The core of investments are limited to relatively
low risk securities in anticipation of earning a fair return relative to the
risk being assumed.
(Ord. 2014-012, passed - - ; Ord. 2024-003, passed 2-15-2024)
§ 33.18 STANDARDS OF CARE.
   (A)   Delegation of authority. The Trafalgar Clerk-Treasurer, hereinafter
referred to as the Investment Officer, shall be responsible to oversee the day-
to-day management of the town’s investments pursuant to I.C. 36-5-6-6. Should
the town elect to select an outside investment advisor, such advisor or firm
must be registered under the Investment Advisor’s Act of 1940.
   (B)   Prudence. The standard of prudence to be used by the Investment
Officer shall be the “prudent person” standard and shall be applied in the
context of managing all funds of the Town. The “prudent person” standard states
that, “Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances
then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence
exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for
investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the
probable income to be derived.”
   (C)   Ethics and conflicts of interest. The Investment Officer and employees
involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business
activity that could conflict with the proper execution and management of the
investment program, or that could impair their ability to make impartial
decisions. The Investment Officer and employees shall disclose any material
interests in financial institutions with which they conduct business. They
shall further disclose any personal financial/investment positions that could
be related to the performance of the investment portfolio.

CAPITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT POLICY
§ 33.35 PURPOSE.
   (A)   To describe the policies and procedures to be utilized in the Town of
Trafalgar's capital asset management system;
   (B)   To put in place guidelines for accounting for and depreciating the
Town of Trafalgar's capital assets;
   (C)   To ensure the town's capital assets are accounted for in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles; and
   (D)   To establish a consistent and cost-effective method for accounting for
the town's capital assets.
(Res. 2022-002, passed 1-20-2022)
§ 33.36 APPLICATION.
   This policy applies to all departments, councils, boards, commissions, and
any other public entity within the government of the Town of Trafalgar.
(Res. 2022-002, passed 1-20-2022)
§ 33.37 RESPONSIBILITY.
   The Town of Trafalgar Clerk-Treasurer and/or its designee shall be
responsible for implementation of the policy.
(Res. 2022-002, passed 1-20-2022)
§ 33.38 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this subchapter.
   CAPITAL ASSETS. Assets that are used in operations and have an initial
useful life in excess of one year. The term includes both tangible assets
(examples: land, construction in progress, buildings, building improvements,
vehicles, machinery, equipment, works of art, historical treasures,
infrastructure) and intangible assets (examples: easements, software, water
rights). Assets acquired for the purpose of sale or investment do not qualify
as capital assets, regardless of their form, because they are not used in
operations.
   CAPITALIZATION. Capitalization of an asset occurs when the cost of the asset
meets the "threshold", and the estimated useful life is in excess of one year.
   DEPRECIATION. The process of allocating the cost of property over a period
of time, rather than recognizing the cost as an expense in the year of
acquisition. Generally, at the end of an asset's life, the sum of the amounts
charged for depreciation in each accounting period (accumulated depreciation)
will equal the original cost, less salvage value.
   DONATED CAPITAL ASSET. Donated assets are those assets contributed to the
Town of Trafalgar at no cost. Donated assets are treated like capital assets
(using the Fair Market Value at the time of the donation).
   ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. The estimated number of months or years that an asset
will be able to be used for the purpose for which it was purchased. In
determining useful life, consideration is given to the asset's present
condition, use of the asset, construction type, maintenance policy, and how
long it is expected to meet service demands.
   FAIR MARKET VALUE. The price an asset would sell for on the open market,
which is the price of an asset under the following usual set of conditions:
prospective buyers and sellers are reasonably knowledgeable about the asset,
behaving in their own best interest, free of undue pressure to trade, and given
a reasonable time period for completing the transaction.
   HISTORICAL COST. Historical cost of a capital asset is the cost or estimated
cost at the time of acquisition, purchase, transportation, installation and
site preparation charges, and the cost of any subsequent additions or
improvements, excluding repairs.
   INFRASTRUCTURE ASSETS. Long-lived capital assets that can normally be
preserved for a significantly greater number of years than most capital assets
(non-infrastructure assets). Infrastructure assets are normally stationary in
nature.
   LAND. Defined as specified land, lots, parcels or acreage including rights
of way owned by the Town of Trafalgar, its various departments, boards or
commissions, regardless of the method or date of acquisition.
   SALVAGE VALUE. The salvage value of an asset is the value it is expected to
have when it is no longer useful for its intended purpose. In other words, the
salvage value is the estimated Fair Market Value for which the asset could be
sold at the end of its useful life.
   STRAIGHT LINE DEPRECIATION. Calculated by dividing the difference between an
asset's cost and its expected salvage value by the number of years in its
useful life.
   THRESHOLD. The dollar amount ($5,000 under this policy, as specified below)
that an asset must equal or exceed if that asset is to be capitalized.
Otherwise, the item would be considered as an expense at the time of
acquisition and would not be capitalized.
(Res. 2022-002, passed 1-20-2022)
§ 33.39 CAPITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT POLICY.
   (A)   Capitalization threshold. 
      (1)   To be considered a capital asset for financial reporting records,
an item must be at or above the capitalization threshold having a historical
cost of $5,000 or more, or for a donated capital asset, a Fair Market Value of
$5,000 or more at the time of donation. Capital assets will remain part of the
property records until they are retired, sold, traded, destroyed, or otherwise
disposed of, regardless of net book value amount.
      (2)   Land is to be considered a capital asset under this policy
regardless of its historical cost or Fair Market Value; but land is not subject
to depreciation.
      (3)   Assets acquired with debt proceeds may be capitalized regardless of
historical cost.
      (4)   Improvements to buildings and general infrastructure, in order to
be considered a capital asset, must be significant, and increase capacity (i.e.
adding square footage to an existing building, or adding new lanes to an
existing road), increase efficiency (i.e. same size, but service provided at
less cost), or extend the asset's estimated useful life beyond the original
expectation, in addition to meeting the threshold. Otherwise, costs, including
those that preserve the useful life of an improvement or infrastructure, are
expensed.
      (5)   Individual items with a historical cost less than $5,000 (or a fair
market value of less than $5,000 at the time of donation for a donated capital
asset), but that operate as a part of a network system may be capitalized in
the aggregate, by grouping the assets, if the estimated average useful life of
the individual items is at least one year. A network is defined as a cohesive
system that functions together for a common purpose, but that is comprised of
separate and independent components or parts (i.e., computer systems, telephone
systems, etc.). The overriding value to the Town of Trafalgar is the entire
network, not the individual component or part.
   (B)   Valuation. In accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, the Town of Trafalgar will value its capital assets at historical
costs (or fair market value in the case of donated capital assets). In
determining the historical cost (or fair market value in the case of donated
capital assets), due consideration will be made as to the cost or estimated
cost at the time of acquisition, purchase, transportation, installation, site
preparation, and subsequent additions and improvements.
   (C)   Capital assets inventory report.
      (1)   Annually, and by December 31 of each year, the heads of each
department of the Town of Trafalgar shall provide to the Clerk-Treasurer a
current inventory list of all Town of Trafalgar capital assets under their
respective oversight or control.
      (2)   The Clerk-Treasurer is to ensure that reporting for capital assets
is being exercised by establishing and maintaining a Master Capital Asset
Inventory. As part of the financial auditing, the Clerk-Treasurer shall submit
a capital asset report to the Town Council of the Town of Trafalgar on an
annual basis, by March 31 of each year. This report shall include the following
information:
         (a)   Type of asset (i.e. land, building, infrastructure);
         (b)   Date of acquisition;
         (c)   Acquisition cost;
         (d)   Estimated useful life;
         (e)   Annual depreciation; and
         (f)   Accumulated depreciation.
   (D)   Depreciation. The Town of Trafalgar will use straight-line
depreciation to depreciate capital assets, but land is not subject to
depreciation.
   (E)   Estimated useful life. The following ranges are general guidelines to
be used to estimate the useful life of an asset for the purpose of
depreciation:
      (1)   Buildings and other structures: 20-50 years;
      (2)   Vehicles: 4-15 years;
      (3)   Other equipment: 5-20 years; and
      (4)   Infrastructure: 20-75 years.
   (F)   Inventory. For internal control purposes, the Town of Trafalgar may
maintain an inventory listing of certain assets that do not meet the threshold
("Controlled Equipment"). These items should be specifically accounted for and
inventoried periodically due to its resale or salvage value and potential risk
of theft. These items may include, but not be limited to, computers,
construction equipment, and other office equipment. Each department, council,
board, or commission of the town of Trafalgar is responsible for all controlled
equipment within its control and area of responsibility.
   (G)   Capital assets purchased with grant funds. When federal grant funds
are used to purchase capital assets, compliance with the applicable uniform
administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for
federal awards in the Code of Federal Regulations is required. Grants typically
have requirements specified in the Grant Award Letter with which the Town of
Trafalgar shall comply.
   (H)   Disposal and transfer of assets. Disposition of assets owned by the
Town of Trafalgar shall be performed in accordance with applicable policies,
procedures, and ordinances of the Town of Trafalgar and in accordance with the
applicable sections of the Indiana Code.

WATER IMPACT, CAPACITY FEES, AND SERVICE CHARGES
WATER IMPACT, CAPACITY FEES, AND SERVICE CHARGES
(A) Impact fee.
   (1)   The impact fee reflects the costs associated with connecting or impacting each customer
to the town's system. Where a single customer shall make multiple connections, an appropriate
multiple of the single impact fee shall be charged.
   (2)   A single impact fee for each customer connecting to the system shall be $550, exclusive
of excavation, for the installation of a 5/8 or 3/4 inch residential water meter service. All
other services shall be installed at the town's actual cost, but at not less than $550.
(B)   Capacity fee.
   (1)   The capacity fee reflects the cost of the capacity in the town's water facilities which
must be permanently allocated to real estate requiring water service.
   (2)   The capacity fee for each equivalent dwelling unit (EDU) or single residential unit
connecting to the town's water system shall be $3,000.
   (3)   The capacity fees will be determined on the basis of the total number of EDUs with a
residential unit considered one EDU. All other parcels of land not used for residential dwelling
units shall be converted to EDUs on the basis of the anticipated water usage from such real
estate as compared to the anticipated water for residential dwelling units. When calculations of
EDUs result in a fraction, the result shall be rounded up to the next whole number. For example,
an EDU calculation of 3.3 for a property will be rounded up to four EDUs for purposes of
calculating the capacity fee for such property. For no reason shall any structure connecting to
the system (including but not limited to mobile homes, apartments and condominiums) be treated
as less than one EDU for purposes of any of the town's rates and charges.
(C)   Miscellaneous.
   (1)   The town shall not allow final and permanent connection or connections to the town's
potable water facilities of any structure requiring water service until a permit is obtained and
payment has been made to the town for the appropriate impact and capacity fees.
   (2)   Any developer of real estate applying for service shall pay the applicable fees by
platted sections before the sections are submitted for approval and recording, or otherwise
enter into an acceptable developer's agreement which shall provide for the future payment of the
impact and capacity fees prior to final and permanent connection.
   (3)   Impact and capacity fees shall be non-refundable.

(B)   Additional flow charge for metered users. In addition to the minimum base service charge set forth in
division (A) above, as the Phase 1 monthly flow charge, effective with the bills to be first issued in
October 2022 and due in November 2022 until completion of construction of the treatment plant expansion
initiated in August 2022, all metered users shall pay a flow charge based upon the users actual monthly
usage, in the amount of $7.61 for every incremental 1,000 gallons of monthly consumption, and as the Phase 2
monthly flow charge, effective with the bills first issued upon completion of construction of the treatment
plant expansion initiated in August 2022, all metered users shall pay a flow charge based upon the users
actual monthly usage, in the amount of $8.18 for every incremental 1,000 gallons of monthly consumption. By
way of example, under the Phase 1 monthly flow charge, a user with between 4,001 and 5,000 gallons of monthly
consumption will pay a flow charge in the amount of $38.05.
(C)   Monthly rates for non-metered users.
   (1)   All non-metered users shall pay a monthly combined charge based upon 5,000 gallons per month for
each equivalent dwelling unit (“EDU”) of anticipated wastewater flow and a meter size of a similar property
use with metered usage, as reasonably determined by the town. Single-family dwellings shall pay a monthly
charge based upon an anticipated wastewater flow of one EDU and a 5/8 in. - 3/4 in. sized meter category.
Thus, as the Phase 1 monthly charge for single-family dwellings, effective with the bills to be first issued
in October 2022 and due in November 2022, until completion of construction of the treatment plant expansion
initiated in August 2022, single-family dwellings shall pay a combined monthly charge of $86.32; and as the
Phase 2 monthly charge for single-family dwellings, effective with the bills first issued upon completion of
construction of the treatment plant expansion initiated in August 2022, single-family dwellings shall pay a
combined monthly charge of $92.80. In no event shall any single connection be judged to use less than one
EDU.
 
   (2)   The estimated flow for all users other than single-family dwellings shall be calculated in
accordance with 327 I.A.C. 3-6-11 and equated to EDUs by dividing the estimated daily flow by 310 gpd. If
there is no appropriate estimated flow factor listed in 327 I.A.C. 3-6-11(b), then the town shall determine
the estimated flows based upon good engineering judgment and reasonable information. The estimated flows
include domestic type wasteload estimates only and do not include processed water used in industrial or
commercial operations. The town shall have the right to reevaluate wasteloads at any time and take corrective
action to assess for actual usage levels.
 
Tap and Capacity Fees.  
(A) Tap fee.
   (1)   The tap fee reflects the costs associated with connecting or tapping each customer to the town's
system. Where a single customer shall make multiple connections, an appropriate multiple of the single tap
fee shall be charged.
   (2)   A single tap fee for each customer connecting to any portion of the system shall be $550, exclusive
of excavation, for the installation of a five-eighths or three-fourths inch residential meter service. All
other services shall be installed at the town's actual cost, but not less than $550.
(B)   Capacity fee.
   (1)   The capacity fee reflects the cost of the capacity in the town's sewage works system which must be
permanently allocated to real estate producing wastewater and connecting to the system.
   (2)   A capacity fee for each equivalent dwelling unit (EDU) or single residential unit connecting to the
system shall be $3,500.
   (3)   The capacity fees will be determined on the basis of total number of EDUs with a residential unit
considered one EDU. All other parcels of land not used for residential dwelling units shall be converted to
EDUs on the basis of the anticipated sewage from such real estate as compared to the anticipated sewage for
residential dwelling units. Residential units have been determined by the town to produce 310 gallons of
wastewater per day. For no reason shall any waste-producing structure connecting to the system (including but
not limited to mobile homes, apartments and condominiums) be treated as less than one EDU for purposes of any
of the town's rates and charges. When calculations of EDUs result in a fraction, the result shall be rounded
up to the next whole number. For example, an EDU calculation of 3.3 for a property will be rounded up to four
EDUs for purposes of calculating the capacity fee for such property.
   (4)   Capacity fees may, at the town's discretion, be excluded for parcels zoned agricultural or platted
for use as cemeteries, golf courses or parks or other non-wastewater producing real estate.
(C)   Miscellaneous.
(1)   The town shall not allow final and permanent connection or connections to the town's sewage facilities
of any real estate producing wastewater until a permit is obtained and payment has been made to the town for
the appropriate tap and capacity fees.
(2)   Any developer of real estate applying for service shall pay the applicable fees by platted sections
before the sections are submitted for approval and recording, or otherwise enter into an acceptable
developer's agreement which shall provide for the future payment of the tap and capacity fees prior to final
and permanent connection.
   (3)   Tap and capacity fees shall be nonrefundable.
 
Nonrecurring Charges and Service Charges. The following nonrecurring charges are hereby established for the
municipal sewage works system:

TERMINATION OF WATER SERVICE TO DELINQUENT SEWER USERS
§ 52.15 TERMINATION OF SERVICE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Pursuant to I.C. 36-9-23 the town, by and through its Utilities Clerk
or other designee of the Town Council, may order the termination of water
service to a sewer service address on account of nonpayment of a delinquent
account which is not less than 30 days delinquent. When so ordered, the water
utility shall terminate such service in accordance with the terms of their
agreement with the town.
   (B)   The fee for terminating residential service shall be $25, which shall
include charges assessed against the town by the water utility for effecting
the termination. The fee for terminating commercial and industrial services
shall be determined by the town based on usage. This fee shall be assessed
against the customer and added to the sewer delinquent bill. A deposit shall be
required of customers terminated due to delinquency in the amount of $50 for
residential customers and three months’ average usage for commercial and
industrial customers.
   (C)   The town may not terminate water service under this section if the
County Health Department has found and certified to the town that the
termination of water service will endanger the health of the user and others in
the municipality.
   (D)   (1)   Prior to the termination of water service because of sewer-user
fee delinquency, the town must first give notice of such delinquency and
impending termination at least 30 calendar days prior to the proposed
termination, by first-class mail addressed to the user to whom the service is
billed, which notice shall contain the following:
         (a)   The delinquent amount due, together with any penalty and fees;
         (b)   The date of the notice of termination;
         (c)   The date on and after which termination shall be made;
         (d)   Notice that water service may be disconnected if, prior to the
earliest possible date of termination given in the notice, the user does not
pay the delinquency together with any penalty and fees, or disputes the amount,
or makes other provisions for payment pursuant to this section; and
         (e)   A procedure, as provided in division (D)(2) below for resolving
a disputed bill.
      (2)   The town shall appoint an account review officer (ARO) to review
and resolve disputes. Before the earliest possible date of termination of water
service as specified in the notice, a user may request a hearing before the ARO
to dispute the correctness of all or part of the amount shown in accordance
with the provisions of this section. A user shall not be entitled to dispute
the correctness of all or part of the amount if all or part of the amount was
the subject of a previous dispute under this section.
   (E)   The procedure for a hearing on a user dispute shall be as follows.
      (1)   Before the earliest possible date of termination as specified on
the notice of termination, the user shall notify the ARO in writing that he or
she requests a hearing to dispute the correctness of all or part of the amounts
shown on the notice of termination, stating as completely as possible the basis
for the dispute.
      (2)   An informal hearing before the ARO shall be held within 15 days of
the ARO’s receipt of the user’s written request for a hearing on a disputed
bill.
      (3)   At the hearing, the user shall be entitled to present all evidence
that is, in the ARO’s view, relevant and material to the dispute.
      (4)   Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, the ARO, within ten
days of the completion of the hearing, shall issue a written decision formally
resolving the dispute. The ARO’s decision shall be final and binding.
   (F)   The ARO shall be authorized to resolve any disputed sewage bill and
shall be authorized to order the termination of water service under appropriate
circumstances. Upon approval by the ARO, the user may enter into an agreement
to amortize the unpaid balance of his or her account over a reasonable period
of time, not to exceed six months. No termination shall be effected for any
user complying with any such amortization agreement, provided the user also
keeps current his or her account for sewer service as charges accrue in each
subsequent billing period. If a user fails to comply with an amortization
agreement, the ARO may terminate water service, provided notice is given to the
user at least 48 hours prior to such termination and the notice includes
conditions the user is required to meet to avoid termination.
   (G)   Utilization of this hearing procedure shall not relieve a user of the
obligation to timely and completely pay all other undisputed water and sewage
bills or charges. Failure to timely and completely pay all such undisputed
amounts shall subject the user to the termination of service in accordance with
the provisions of this section.
   (H)   Until the date of the ARO’s decision, the town shall not terminate
water service of the user. If the ARO determines that the customer must pay
some or all of the disputed amount, the department or ARO in his or her written
decision, shall notify the user of the following:
      (1)   The amount to be paid;
      (2)   The date on or after which services will be terminated; and
      (3)   Notice that unless the town receives complete payment of the amount
shown prior to the earliest possible date of termination given in the notice,
water service shall be terminated.
   (I)   A USER for the purpose of this section is defined as:
      (1)   A person who requests, either orally or in writing, water and/or
sewage service from the city or water utilities; or
      (2)   A person in whose name water and/or sewage service is billed for
the rendering of the service.

§ 52.16 TERMINATION OF SERVICES NOT EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.
   The remedy provided herein for the collection of delinquent sewer user
charges or benefits shall not be construed to abridge or in any manner
interfere with the right and power of the town to enforce a collection thereof
by any other action or as otherwise provided by statute, but the remedy
provided in such section shall be taken and held as an additional means to
enforce payment of sewer service charges or benefits.

liening under I.C. 36-9-23-31 through I.C. 36-9-25-11 and which the town has
determined to be uncollectible;
      (2)   A statement setting forth the efforts that have been made to
collect such accounts and a statement that all such efforts have been
unsuccessful; and
      (3)   A statement, including the reasons therefor, that the town believes
it is economically not feasible to pursue collection measures on such accounts.
   (C)   The semi-annual schedule shall be submitted to the Town Council, which
by resolution may declare accounts listed in the schedule as uncollectible and
may authorize the town to cease further collection procedures and expense the
amounts outstanding on the accounts as bad debts.
   (D)   The semi-annual schedule prepared by the town shall be forwarded to
the Town Council for final approval. A sewer user account may be deemed
uncollectible only if the Council shall approve said schedule.

   (C)   Any customer deposits received shall be maintained by the town in a
separate fund.

(Ord., §§ 1-3, 1-4, passed - -1991)
§ 152.004 ZONE MAP AND ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS.

include the following zoning classifications:
      (1)   Residential: R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4;
      (2)   Commercial: CB;
      (3)   Industrial: I-1;
      (4)   Agricultural: A, AC;
      (5)   Institutional: IU; and
      (6)   Open Space/Parks: OS.
   (B)   The Zone Maps which are declared to be a part of this chapter show the
boundaries of and the area covered by the districts. Notations, references,
indications and other matters shown on the Zone Maps are as much a part of this
chapter as if they were fully described herein.
(Ord., § 1-5, passed - -1991; Ord. 2011-0009, passed 11-17-2011)
§ 152.005 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   The purpose of this section is for the determination and interpretation of
district boundaries.
   (A)   Determination of district boundaries. In determining the district
boundaries, and establishing the regulation applicable to each district, due
and careful consideration has been given to:
      (1)   Existing conditions;
      (2)   The character of buildings erected in each district;
      (3)   The most desirable use for which the land in each district nay be
adapted; and
      (4)   The conservation of property values throughout the jurisdictional
area.
   (B)   Uncertainty of district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists as to the
exact boundaries of any district as shown on the zone map, the following rules
shall apply.
      (1)   In unsubdivided areas, or where a district boundary subdivides a
lot, the exact location of the boundary shall be determined by use of the scale
on the zone map.
      (2)   In the case of further uncertainty, the Commission shall interpret
the intent of the zone map as to the location of the boundary in question.
(Ord., § 1-6, passed - -1991)
§ 152.006 PROCEDURE RELATING TO ANNEXED OR VACATED AREAS.
   (A)   Annexation procedures. Any territory hereafter annexed to the town
shall, upon annexation, be automatically classified in the R-1 District until
such territory is reclassified in a manner provided by law. However, in the
event the owner or owners of the land to be annexed desire zoning
reclassification simultaneously with annexation, in harmony with the land uses
for said property on the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map for the
environs of the town, adopted by the Town Council, the owner may petition for
said zoning classification or classifications simultaneously with the petition
for annexation. A public notice of a zoning hearing is required by I.C. 36-7-4-
604 and shall be advertised on or before annexation. After the zoning hearing
and recommendation of the Plan Commission, the Town Council shall either adopt
or reject the report of the Commission for the proposed zoning amendment at the
time of adoption of final ordinance annexing the territory. Annexation of
existing subdivisions or commercial developments shall be dependent upon the
petitioner’s compliance with the Trafalgar Standard Specification Document.
Changes to districts as a result of annexation shall be effectively illustrated
on the Official Zone Map.
   (B)   Vacated land procedure. Whenever any street, alley, public way,
railroad, right-of-way, waterway or other similar area is vacated by proper
authority, the districts adjoining each side of such street, alley, public way,
railroad, right-of-way, waterway or similar areas shall be extended
automatically to the center of such vacated area and all area included in the
vacation shall then and thenceforth be subject to appropriate regulations of
the extended districts.

PERMIT PROCEDURES
§ 152.020 GENERAL INTENT.
   Within the territorial jurisdiction of the Plan Commission (which
jurisdiction area includes the town and the contiguous unincorporated territory
shown on a map filed by the Town Plan Commission with the County Recorder), no
structure, improvement or use of land may be altered, changed, placed, erected
or located on platted or unplatted lands, unless the structure, improvement or
use and its location conform with this chapter and an improvement location
permit for such structure, improvement or use has been issued.
   (A)   Improvement location permits. Any application, issuance or
nullification of an improvement location permit shall conform to the following
rules, regulations and guidelines.
      (1)   All applications for an improvement location permit shall be
submitted to the Building Commissioner on the prescribed application form of
the Commission and accompanied by a plot or site plan, in triplicate, drawn to
scale showing the following:
         The actual description, dimensions and shape of the lot to be built
upon; the exact size and locations on the lot of buildings already existing, if
any; the size height and location of landscaping, screens, walls, fences and
other such buffering when required by ordinance or this code or grant from the
Board of Zoning Appeals; and the location and dimensions of all adjoining or
interior streets, alleys and easements, driveway entrances and exits, access
driveways and easements, signs, parking and the proposed building or
alteration.
      (2)   Such application shall include such other information as may be
required by the Building Commissioner, including existing or proposed building
or alteration; existing or proposed building or land; the number of families,
dwelling units or other units of measure the building is designed to
accommodate; conditions existing on the lot; and such other information as may
be necessary to determine conformance with and provide for the enforcement of
this chapter.
      (3)   The Building Commissioner may require the relocation of any
proposed building or structure or driveways, parking areas or other elements of
site development indicated or omitted on such site plan before issuing an
improvement location permit when such action is necessary to carry out the
purpose and intent of this chapter.
      (4)   One copy of the plans shall be returned to the applicant by the
Building Commissioner within five days from the date the application is filed,
after he or she has certified such copy either as approved or disapproved and
attested to the same by his or her signature on such copy. The original plan,
similarly marked, shall be retained by the Building Commissioner in the
Commission’s records. The second copy will be submitted to the Utility
Supervisor(s) for approval. If an application for improvement location permit
is disapproved, the administrative official shall state such disapproval in
writing, with the cause thereof, and shall immediately thereupon mail notice of
such refusal to the applicant at the address indicated on the application.
      (5)   No building permit shall be issued unless and until an improvement
location permit shall first have been approved. The issuance of an improvement
location permit shall in no case be construed as waiving any section of this
chapter nor of the necessity to obtain any other permits such as building
permits and access permits required by law.
      (6)   If the work described in any improvement location permit has not
begun within six months from the date of issuance thereof, such permit shall
expire, shall be canceled by the administrative official and written notice
thereof shall be given to the persons affected. If the work described in any
improvement location permit has not been substantially completed within two
years of the date of issuance thereof, such permit shall expire and be canceled
by the Building Commissioner and written notice thereof shall be given to the
persons affected, together with notice that further work described in the
canceled permit shall not proceed unless and until a new improvement location
permit has been obtained.
      (7)   The improvement location permit shall be publicly displayed upon
the premises involved from the time of its issuance until all alterations or
improvements authorized have been completed.
      (8)   No improvement location permit shall be issued for excavating for,
or the erection, reconstruction or structural alteration of, any building
before application has been made for a certificate of occupancy.
   (B)   Certificate of occupancy.
      (1)   No land shall be occupied or used, and no building, hereafter
erected, reconstructed or structurally altered, shall be occupied or used in
whole or in part for any purpose whatsoever, until a certificate of occupancy
shall have been issued by the Building Commissioner stating that the building
and use comply with all of the provisions of this chapter applicable to the
building or premises or the use in the district in which it is to be located.
      (2)   A certificate of occupancy shall be applied for simultaneously with
the application for an improvement location permit. A request for the issuance
of the certificate of occupancy shall be made within five days after the
authorized improvements have been completed and the certificate shall be issued
within ten days following receipt of the request.
      (3)   A record of all certificates of occupancy shall be kept on file in
the office of the Building Commissioner and copies shall be furnished upon
request to any person having a proprietary or tenancy interest in the building
or land affected.
   (C)   Building permits. Effective May 11, 1985, the General Administrative
Rules (GAR) were adopted by the Fire and Building Safety Commission.
      (1)   All building permits shall be issued by the Building Commissioner
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Fire Protection and Building
Safety Commission of this state and all statutes of the state applicable
thereto.
      (2)   No building (or structure) shall be hereafter erected,
reconstructed or structurally altered, in whole or in part, until a building
permit has been duly issued, as authorized by the provisions of this chapter
and further pursuant to the statutory law of this state.
   (D)   Special exception permits. Special exception permits shall be issued
subject to the same procedure as applies to the issuance of permits in the case
of a variance.
(Ord., § 1-9, passed - -1991)
§ 152.021 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   Any person seeking a modification of the specific requirements of this
chapter may apply for a variance by filing a written application to the
Building Commissioner.
   (A)   (1)   Use of land variance. Upon receipt of an application for a
variance for the use of land (as an example, where the applicant seeks to use
land in a R-1 District for uses only authorized in a R-2, or even a C-
1 District), the Building Commissioner shall first refer the application to the
Plan Commission, who shall investigate as to how the proposed use affects the
Master Plan, and if such proposed use is contradictory thereto. In the event
that the Commission finds that the proposed variance contradicts the Master
Plan, the Commission may, at its option, still recommend the approval thereof
to the Board of Zoning Appeals, if the Commission finds such proposed use is
not contrary to the spirit and intent of this chapter and does not interfere
with future planning on the part of the Commission.
      (2)   Technical requirement variance. If the application for variance is
concerned only with a variance from the technical requirements of the chapter
(as an example, a petition to reduce a setback line or to increase the height
of a fence and the like), then such variance shall be referred by the Building
Commissioner directly to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a public hearing
thereon by the said Board, without the same being referred to the Plan
Commission.
   (B)   The applicant for variance may appear before the Commission in support
of its issuance, but such appearance will not be mandatory nor will this
appearance be considered a public hearing thereon.
   (C)   The Commission shall report the results of its study to the Board
within 45 days following receipt of the application. If no such report has been
filed with the Board within this time period, the Board may proceed to process
the application.
   (D)   The Board shall then conduct a public hearing on the application in
the manner prescribed by this chapter and the laws of this state.
   (E)   The Board may authorize, upon appeal, in specific cases, such
variances from the terms of this chapter as will not:
      (1)   Be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special
conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the chapter will result
in unnecessary hardship and so that the spirit of this chapter shall be
observed and substantial justice done;
      (2)   Provided, however, that the Board shall not be required to
specially find, in writing, the facts as stated in division (E)(1) above, but
instead that the legal presumption shall be that the criteria were met at the
public hearing if the Board, in fact, grants such a variance.
(Ord., § 1-10, passed - -1991)

portion of a roof visible from ground level of State Road 135 or any adjacent
public thoroughfare or residentially zoned or used area.
         (d)   Roof-mounted equipment on exposed roofs shall be screened from
view. The appearance of roof screens shall be coordinated with the building to
maintain a unified appearance.
         (e)   The exposed walls and roofs of buildings shall be maintained in
a clean, orderly and attractive condition; free of cracks, dents, punctures,
breakage and other forms of visible marring. Materials that become excessively
faded, chalked or otherwise deteriorated shall be refinished, repainted or
replaced.
         (f)   Refuse and waste removal areas, loading berths, service yards,
storage yards and exterior work areas shall be screened from view from public
ways.
      (4)   Relationship of building to site.

minimum setback.
         (e)   Transitional yards.
            1.   Yards abutting a residential district.
               a.   (I)   Where a front yard lot line abuts a street right-of-
way on the opposite side of which is a residential district, the minimum
required front yard and setback shall be the same as the standard front yard
and setback requirements of division (B)(7)(a) above.
                  (ii)   The front yard use of the minimum required
transitional front yard shall not include off-street parking, collector, local,
arterial or cul-de-sac. If the abutting street is an expressway, the front yard
may include off-street parking, provided a 20-foot wide strip of said required
front yard, paralleling and measured from the front lot line and extending the
full length thereof (except for walks, access cuts and driveways), shall be
maintained as landscaped portion of the yard in conformance with division (B)
(7)(e)2. below).
               b.   Where a side or rear lot line abuts either side or rear lot
line in an adjacent residential district, a side or rear yard and setback, both
not less than 20 feet in depth, shall be provided along such side or rear lot
line; provided, however, where a dedicated alley separates such side or rear
lot line from the residential district, said side or rear yard and setback
shall be not less than ten feet.
            2.   Screening and landscaping of transitional yards, yards
fronting upon or abutting a residential district.
               a.   Front transitional yards (fronting upon a residential

                  (ii)   Ground area between such wall, fence or hedge and the
front lot line shall be planted and maintained in grass, other suitable
groundcover, shrubbery and/or trees. All shrubs and trees shall be planted,
balled and burlapped and shall meet the standards of the American Association
of Nurserymen.
                  (iii)   To provide maximum flexibility in the landscape
design of said screen and ground area, a variety of plant material may be used;
provided, however, that a plan indicating the species, variety, size, spacing
and location of all plants shall be filed and approved by the Building
Commissioner prior to the time planted.
               b.   Side and rear transitional yards (abutting a residential
district) shall be landscaped in grass and shrubbery, trees and/or hedge to
form an effective screening of the commercial use.
                  (I)   An ornamental, decorative fence or masonry wall may be
used in conjunction with the landscaping; provided, however, if any portion of
a side or rear transitional yard is used for a driveway or off-street parking,
there shall be provided and maintained along the entire length of such lot line
to the front yard setback line, a wall or fence of ornamental block, brick,
solid wall fencing or combination thereof.
                  (ii)   Said wall or fence shall be at least six feet in
height and shall be so constructed to such height to restrict the view.
         (f)   Use of required yards. All required yards shall be landscaped in
grass and shrubbery, trees and/or hedge, or in combination with other suitable
groundcover material, except:
            1.   a.   Required front yards may include:
                  (I)   Pedestrian walks, access cuts, driveways, flag poles
and similar appurtenant uses; and
                  (ii)   Off-street parking, gasoline service station pumps
and/or open canopies (attached or detached).
               b.   However, a six-foot wide strip of the required front yard,
paralleling and measured from the front lot line, and extending the full length
thereof (except for walks, access cuts and driveways), shall be maintained as a
landscaped portion of the front yard as required above, unless subject to the
transitional yard requirements of division (B)(7)(e) above.
            2.   Required side and rear yards may include:
               a.   Pedestrian walks, access cuts, driveways, flag poles and
similar appurtenant uses; and
               b.   Off-street parking, subject to the requirements of division
(B)(7)(e) above.
   (C)   Performance standards.
      (1)   Signs.
         (a)   Signs and advertising devices shall comply with the sign
regulations of §
152.100, and the regulations of this section. If this section and §
152.100 are in conflict, the section which establishes the higher standard
shall prevail.
         (b)   Signage shall be designed to an integral part of the
architectural and landscaping plans. The colors, materials and style of signage
shall be architecturally compatible and accentuate the buildings and
landscaping on the site. The colors, materials and lighting of every sign shall
be restrained and harmonious with the building and site to which it principally
relates.
         (c)   All signs, except private traffic direction signs, are
prohibited in the required greenbelt areas.
         (d)   Private traffic direction signs and pavement markings for the
direction and control of traffic into, out of and within the site shall conform
to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices as published by the State
Department of Highways.
         (e)   The integration of project signage to identify multiple
businesses is encouraged.
         (f)   Off-premises signage shall be prohibited in the C-2 District.
         (g)   All on-premises signage shall conform to the standards and
requirements of the underlying districts, except that:
            1.   No pole sign shall exceed 25 feet in height;
            2.   There shall be a minimum spacing of 100 feet between any pole
or ground sign located along State Road 135; and
            3.   In no instance shall pole signs for multiple businesses, strip
commercial centers or strip business centers exceed 200 square feet of copy
area.
         (h)   Every sign shall have good scale and proportion in its design
and in its visual relationship to buildings and surroundings.
         (I)   The number of graphic elements on a sign shall be held to the
minimum needed to convey the sign’s major message and shall be composed in
proportion to the area of the sign face.
         (j)   Each sign shall be compatible with the signs on adjoining
premises and shall not compete for attention.
         (k)   Identification signs of standardized design such as corporation
logos shall conform to the criteria for all other signs.
      (2)   Off-street parking.
         (a)   Off-street parking facilities shall be provided in accordance
with the off-street parking regulations of §
152.085 and the regulations of this section. If this section and §
152.085 are in conflict, the section which establishes the higher standard
shall prevail.
         (b)   Parking is to be discouraged between the greenbelt and the
building(s) when other suitable areas for parking exist on the property;
however, private parking may be permitted in the area between the greenbelt and
the planting adjacent to the building(s) and the planting on the periphery of
the property. Efforts to break up large expanses of pavement are to be
encouraged by the interspersing of appropriate planting areas wherever possible
(division (C)(5)(d) below).
            1.   The number of parking spaces required are as established
elsewhere in this chapter, depending upon the zoning and the intended land use.
Alternatives to the established parking requirements may be granted to
developments which have a mixture of uses whose peak parking requirements do
not coincide in time and thereby may share parking spaces. The applicant shall
provide expertly prepared justification for seeking such exceptions (i.e., a
reference such as “shared parking”, Urban Land Institute).
            2.   There shall be an appropriate number of parking spaces,
accessible to the building(s) and identified as reserved for use by disabled
individuals, and these spaces shall be a sufficient width (minimum of 12 feet)
to accommodate their needs.
      (3)   Off-street loading. Off-street loading facilities shall be provided
in accordance with the off- street loading regulations of §
152.086.
      (4)   Landscaping plan. A landscaping plan shall be submitted to the Plan
Commission for its approval at the same time other plans (i.e., architectural
design, lighting, parking, signage and site plans) are submitted. This plan
shall be drawn to scale, including dimensions and distances, shall delineate
all existing and proposed structures, private parking areas, walks, ramps for
disabled, terraces, driveways,
signs, lighting standards, steps and other similar structures; and shall
delineate the location, size and description of all landscape materials.
Landscape treatment for plazas, roads, paths, service and private parking areas
shall be designed as an integral and coordinated part of the landscape plan for
the entire lot.
      (5)   Areas to be landscaped.
         (a)   Greenbelt. The greenbelt shall be suitably landscaped and shall
be otherwise unoccupied except for steps, walks, terraces, driveways, lighting
standards and other similar structures, but excluding private parking areas.
Mounding and other innovative treatments are to be especially encouraged in
this area.
         (b)   Planting adjacent to freestanding buildings. 
            1.   A planting area equal to an area measuring five feet in depth
by the width of the front of the building plus five feet (to extend out on both
sides) shall be installed at the front of the building. A planting area equal
to an area five feet in depth by the remaining sides of the building shall be
installed on all other sides of the building.
            2.   Sidewalks may be permitted in these areas but shall not occupy
the entire area on any side of the building. These adjacent planting areas need
not be rectangular in shape as long as the required amount of space is
landscaped and innovative and original designs are encouraged. The adjacent
planting area at the rear of a structure is located less than 40 feet from the
rear property line and sufficient peripheral planting is included to compensate
for its removal.
         (c)   Peripheral planting. There shall be peripheral landscaping
strip, four feet in depth, located along the side of any private parking area
which abuts any side or rear property line separating the parcel from any
residentially zoned or used district. At least one tree for each 50 lineal feet
shall be planted in any such peripheral landscaping strip.
         (d)   Planting within parking lots. All parking lot landscaping shall
be of a quality to improve and enhance the site and its surrounding area.
Effective use of mounding and existing topography is encouraged. Landscaping
and planting areas shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the parking area,
and not less than 5% of a private parking lot shall be landscaped. (For
purposes of this computation, landscaping in the greenbelt, adjacent to
buildings, and on the periphery of the lot shall not be included.) Landscaped
traffic islands shall be specifically provided at the ends of interior parking
rows as a means of separating parking from major circulation aisles within
lots. Parking lots with only perimeter parking shall be exempt from the
requirements of this section.
      (6)   Landscaping standards.
         (a)   The interior dimensions, specifications and design of any
planting area or planting medium proposed to be constructed shall be sufficient
to protect the landscaping materials planted therein and to provide for proper
growth.
         (b)   The primary landscaping materials used in the greenbelt and
adjacent to buildings shall consist of one or a combination of one of the
following: shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, groundcovers, grass, mulches
and the like.
         (c)   The primary landscaping materials used in and around private
parking areas shall be trees which provide shade at maturity. Shrubbery, hedges
and other planting material may be used to complement tree landscaping, but
shall not be the sole contribution to the landscaping.
         (d)   All shade trees proposed to be used in accordance with any
landscaping plan shall be a minimum of eight feet in overall height and have a
minimum trunk diameter, 12 inches above the ground, of two inches upon
planting. They should be of a variety which will attain an average mature
spread greater than 20 feet.
         (e)   Landscaping materials selected should be appropriate to local
growing and climatic conditions. Wherever appropriate, existing trees should be
conserved and integrated into the landscaping plan. Plant material shall be
selected for interest in its structure, texture and color and for its ultimate
growth. Indigenous and other hardy plants that are harmonious to the design and
of good appearance shall be used.
         (f)   The landscaping plan shall ensure that sight distances are not
obstructed for drivers of motor vehicles.
         (g)   Where natural conditions or existing topographic patterns
contribute to beauty and utility of a development, they shall be preserved and
developed. Modification to topography shall be permitted where it contributes
to good appearance.
         (h)   Grades of walks, parking spaces, terraces and other paved areas
shall provide an inviting and stable appearance for walking and, if seating is
provided, for sitting.
         (I)   Landscaping treatment shall be provided to enhance architectural
features, strengthening vistas and important axes, and provide shade.
Spectacular effects shall be reserved for special locations only.
         (j)   Unity of design shall be achieved by repetition of certain plant
varieties and other materials and by correlation with adjacent developments.
         (k)   In locations where plants will be susceptible to injury by
pedestrian or motor traffic, they shall be protected by appropriate curbs, tree
guards or other devices.
         (l)   Parking areas and traffic ways shall be enhanced with landscaped
spaces containing trees or tree groupings.
         (m)   Where building sites limit planting, the placement of
appropriate trees and landscaping in parkways or paved areas is encouraged.
         (n)   Screening of service yards and other places that tend to be
unsightly shall be accomplished by use of walls, fencing, planting or
combinations of these. Screening shall be equally effective in winter and
summer.
         (o)   In areas where general planting will not prosper, other
materials such as fences, walls and pavings of wood, brick, stone, gravel and
cobbles shall be used. Carefully selected plants shall be combined with such
materials where possible.
         (p)   Miscellaneous structures and street hardware shall be designed
to be a part of the architectural concept of design and landscape. Materials
shall be compatible with buildings, scale shall be good, colors shall be in
harmony with buildings and surroundings, and proportions shall be attractive.
         (q)   Lighting in connection with miscellaneous structures and street
hardware shall be compatible to the site, landscaping, primary buildings and
signage.
      (7)   Landscaping installation and maintenance.
         (a)   Installation. All landscaping required by the approved
landscaping plan shall be installed prior to the issuance of a building
occupancy permit if said permit is issued during a planting season, or within
six months of the date an occupancy permit is issued if issued during a non-
planting season.
         (b)   Maintenance. It shall be the responsibility of the owners and
their agencies to ensure proper maintenance of the landscaping, in accordance
with the standards set by this chapter and as indicated on the landscaping plan
which has been approved by the Plan Commission. This is to include but is not
limited to replacing dead plantings with identical varieties or a suitable
substitute, and keeping the area free of refuse and debris.
         (c)   Changes after approval. No landscaping which has been approved
by the Plan Commission may later be altered, eliminated or sacrificed, without
first obtaining further Plan Commission approval.
         (d)   Inspection. The Plan Commission or Building Commissioner shall
have the authority to visit any lot within the State Road 135 Commercial
District to inspect the landscaping and check it against the approved plan on
file.
      (8)   Lighting requirements. In reviewing the lighting plan for a lot
proposed to be developed in the State Road 135 Commercial District, factors to
be considered by the Commission shall include but are not limited to:
         (a)   Safety provided by the lighting;
         (b)   Security provided by the lighting;
         (c)   Possible light spillage or glare into adjoining properties or
streets (spillage or glare into adjoining properties is prohibited);
         (d)   Attractiveness of the lighting standards and their compatibility
with the overall treatment of the property;
         (e)   Height and placement of lighting standards considering the use;
and
         (f)   Exterior lighting, when used, shall enhance the building design
and the adjoining landscape. Lighting standards and building fixtures shall be
of a design and size compatible with the building and adjacent areas. Lighting
shall be restrained in design and excessive brightness avoided.
      (9)   Access to individual sites.  
         (a)   The primary thoroughfares, must have reasonable restrictions as
to the number and location of access points within the C-2 District. State Road
135 represents a major thoroughfare which must be controlled as to the number
of access points (curb cuts) permitted. Therefore, in order to provide safe and
sufficient traffic movement to and from adjacent lands and to protect the
functional integrity of the corridor’s primary thoroughfares, in many cases
frontage roads, access roads and distributor roads will have to be built. Such
roads shall be coordinated with those of contiguous lots and designed to
preserve the aesthetic benefits provided by the greenbelt areas. Access at the
side or rear of buildings is encouraged. New access points onto the primary
thoroughfares in the State Road 135 corridor shall be coordinated with existing
access points whenever possible.
         (b)   The following curb cut policy shall apply throughout the
corridor: no closer than one for each 400 feet of frontage; no curb cuts within
300 feet of any intersection of public roads. Opposing curb cuts shall align
squarely or be offset no less than 300 feet. All curb cuts along state and U.S.
routes must have State Department of Transportation approval.
      (10)   Access to potential development sites. Dead-end (stub) streets
shall be built in all cases where adjacent lots have reasonable potential for
development. REASONABLE POTENTIAL shall include any adjacent parcel of adequate
size for commercial or residential development or any adjacent parcel so
determined by the Town Plan Commission.
      (11)   Other standards; paving requirements. All parking areas shall be
finished with a hard surface such as asphalt or concrete, per Trafalgar
Standard Specifications Document.

§ 152.073 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS (PUD).
   (A)   Purpose and intent. As provided for by I.C. 36-7-4-1500 et seq., the
purpose of these regulations is to allow greater design flexibility in
development of land while remaining consistent with the goals of the
Comprehensive Plan. The regulations are intended to encourage developments that
are innovative and/or responsive to unique opportunities or constraints of a
site. Planned unit developments should be used to address unique environmental
aspects, provide a mix of land uses, or otherwise better implement the goals of
the Comprehensive Plan than what could be accomplished with established zoning
districts. Planned unit developments should be avoided where a similar result
for the proposed development could be achieved through a conditional use
permit, variance, minor modification, or rezoning to a different zoning
district.
   (B)   Uses allowed.
      (1)   All uses are subject to the discretion and approval of the Plan
Commission and Council during the adoption of a planned unit development (PUD).
Uses must be compatible with the intent of the Comprehensive Plan and
surrounding existing and future land uses.
      (2)   Permitted and special exception uses shall be specified in the PUD
proposal. Special exception uses should be minimized.
   (C)   Development standards.
      (1)   Development standards and requirements shall be stated as part of a
planned unit development proposal. All proposed development standards shall be
subject to review and approval of the Plan Commission and Council during the
approval process.
      (2)   Generally, PUD proposals may provide standards in place of lot or
development standards stated in this chapter; sign development standards in
Chapter 151, the Sign Regulations; and standards in
Chapter 153, the Subdivision Control.
      (3)   Minimum land area. In order to encourage innovative design in a
variety of scales, there is no minimum land area required for a PUD.
      (4)   Minimum open space.
         (a)   In recognition that innovative designs, particularly those
proposing town center plans, may require flexibility in the amount of open
space provided in the development, there is no minimum open space required.
         (b)   However, proposals with less than 20% of the gross area
dedicated as open space must detail the design elements that justify lower
amounts of open space.
      (5)   Development standards that are not specified in the PUD shall
revert to the standards of the closest comparable established zoning district.
   (D)   Origin of proposals.
      (1)   An applicant may propose a planned unit development district in
accordance with the procedures established in this section.
      (2)   The applicant must be the landowner(s) or intended developer of the
development.
      (3)   The area proposed for a PUD may or may not be under single
ownership. If under multiple ownership, the owners must have a contractual
agreement to develop the property in accordance with the unified plan
stipulated in the PUD and to assure the completion of the PUD as planned and to
the satisfaction of the Plan Commission.
   (E)   Limitation on zoning ordinance amendments.
      (1)   Any amendment of the zoning ordinance that would affect an approved
planned unit development prior to its completion shall not be applied to the
PUD.
      (2)   New amendments to the zoning ordinance shall only apply to PUDs
that have expired or that have been completely developed.
   (F)   Procedures for approval. Applications shall be accompanied by all
plans and documents required by this code. A three-step application process
shall be used: pre-design conference, concept plan approval, and PUD master
plan approval.
   (G)   Pre-design conference. Prior to filing a formal application for
approval of a planned unit development, the applicant shall schedule a pre-
design conference with the Building Commissioner and the Plan Commission. The
purposes of this conference shall be:
      (1)   To allow the applicant to present a general concept and to discuss
characteristics of the proposed development; and
      (2)   To allow the Building Commissioner to inform the applicant of
applicable policies, standards, and procedures.
      (3)   This pre-design conference is for informational purposes only, and
no decision made during the conference is binding upon either party or upon the
Plan Commission.
      (4)   There is no limit to the number of pre-design meetings requested by
the applicant, if the meetings serve to advance the design and planning of the
proposal.
   (H)   Concept plan approval.
      (1)   An application for planned unit development, the PUD concept plan,
written development standards, other documentation, and filing fee shall be

Building Commissioner. The Building Commissioner shall confirm the application
to be complete and ready for review by the Technical Review Committee.
      (2)   The Technical Review Committee shall review the proposal and
prepare comments and recommendations.
      (3)   The application, Technical Review Committee comments and other
pertinent documents shall be forwarded to the Plan Commission for its
consideration, public hearing, and recommendation.
      (4)   The Plan Commission shall hold a public hearing on the application
in accordance with its Rules of Procedure.
      (5)   After the public hearing and review of the application, the Plan
Commission shall certify the application to the Town Council with a favorable
recommendation, an unfavorable recommendation, or no recommendation.
      (6)   The Town Council shall act upon the certified proposal as in the
case of any rezoning petition.
      (7)   Upon Council approval of the PUD concept plan, the PUD zoning shall
become effective and shown on the zoning map designated as a planned unit
development. After approval, the use and development of the site shall be
governed by the planned unit development concept plan, subject to the approval
of a PUD master plan. No permit of any kind shall be issued in the PUD district
until a PUD master plan has been approved.
   (I)   Planned unit development master plan approval. The purpose of the PUD
master plan is to set the specific regulations for development of the planned

      (2)   In the subdividing of any land, due regard shall be shown for all
natural features such as tree growth, watercourses, historic features, or
similar amenities which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the
proposed development.
      (3)   Due consideration shall be given to the prevention of air and
stream pollution, proper treatment and disposal of refuse and other waste, and
the elimination of other blighting characteristics.
      (4)   The subdivision layout shall be of such character that it protects
the health, safety, and general welfare of the town and its residents and
visitors.
      (5)   In designing a street system, the applicant shall be guided by the
following principles:
         (a)   Adequate vehicular and pedestrian access shall be provided to
all parcels.
         (b)   Local residential street systems shall be designed to mitigate
through-traffic movement. Street connections into and from adjacent areas may
be required in order to promote connectivity with the overall thoroughfare
system.
         (c)   Local street patterns shall provide reasonable direct access to
the primary circulation system of collector and arterial roadways.
         (d)   Local circulation systems and land development patterns shall
not significantly conflict with the effectiveness of bordering arterial routes.
         (e)   The street network shall pay consideration to the location of
traffic generators within residential areas.
         (f)   Planning and construction of residential streets shall relate to
their local function.
         (g)   Local streets shall be designed to discourage excessive speeds.
         (h)   Pedestrian-vehicular conflict points shall be minimized.
         (i)   Local streets shall be related to the topography.
   (B)   General street rights-of-way standards and requirements.
      (1)   Current AASHTO standards shall be followed as design standards
unless otherwise specified in this chapter. These standards are minimum
requirements.
      (2)   A minimum of two points of vehicular access onto a collector street
or an arterial street shall be required. One or no points of access may be
permitted or required by the Plan Commission if it is infeasible or impossible
to provide at least two access points, provided that the reduction does not
greatly adversely affect the safety and traffic circulation of the area.
      (3)   Half streets shall not be permitted.
      (4)   Rights-of-way and paving for proposed streets shall be extended to
the boundary lines of the proposed subdivision so that a connection can be made
to all adjacent properties unless such extension is not feasible because of
topography or other physical conditions, or unless, in the Plan Commission’s
opinion, such extension is not necessary or desirable for coordination with
existing streets or the most advantageous development of adjacent tracts. If an
adjoining development contains an existing stub street extending to the
property line, the developer of a proposed new subdivision adjacent to that
land must incorporate the stub street into the proposed subdivision. In any
event, no subdivision shall be designed so as to create or perpetuate the land-
locking of adjacent undeveloped land.
      (5)   A temporary dead-end street shall be permitted in any case where a
street is proposed to be, and should logically be. extended, but is not yet
constructed. An adequate easement for a turnaround shall be provided for any
temporary dead-end street that extends 200 feet or more in length. Such
easement shall be automatically vacated to abutting property owners when said
dead-end street is legally extended. The temporary easement shall have a 65-
foot radius, and the traveled surface used for vehicular turnaround shall be at
least 50 feet in radius. If the temporary turnaround is to be in place for
longer than two years, the surface material shall be that specified in the
Design Standards and Specifications Manual.
      (6)   In subdivisions that adjoin or include existing streets that do not
conform to the minimum right-of-way dimensions as established by this chapter
or the Thoroughfare Plan, the applicant shall dedicate additional width along
cither one or both sides of such streets so as to bring them up to standards.
If adjoining or included existing streets do not conform to the minimum
standards of the Design Standards and Specifications Manual, the applicant
shall improve said streets to meet the standards.
   (C)   Geometric street standards.
      (1)   All dedicated rights-of-way shall conform to the following minimum
dimensions:
Arterial streets            130 feet (or per design)
Major collector streets     100 feet
Minor collector streets     70 feet
Local streets               50 feet
Alley                        
   One-way               26 feet
   Two-way               30 feet
Cul-de-sac bulb              
   Commercial or industri65-loot radius
   Residential           65-foot radius
Crosswalks                  10 feet
 
      (2)   Street jogs, and entrances with traffic counts greater than 100
vehicles per day, with centerline offsets of less than 200 feet shall not be
permitted.
      (3)   All streets shall intersect at 90 degrees whenever possible for a
minimum distance of 100 feet; however, in no instance shall they intersect at
less than 80 degrees onto arterial or collector streets or less than 50 degrees
onto local streets.
      (4)   To ensure adequate sight distances, when the street centcrlines
deflect more than ten degrees, connections shall be made by horizontal curves.
The minimum centerline radius for local and cul-de-sac residential streets
shall be 100 feet, and 200 feet for all other residential streets.
      (5)   A tangent of at least 100 feet shall be introduced between reversed
curves on local and collector streets.
      (6)   Cul-de-sac streets are discouraged in favor of loop streets or
through streets. However, when used, the maximum length of a cul-de-sac street
shall be 600 feet, measured along the centerline from the intersection at
origin through the center of the circle to the end of the right-of-way. The
origin is defined as the nearest street intersection, where the cross street
does not lead to another cul-de-sac or dead-end street. Each cul-de-sac shall
have a terminus of nearly circular shape or a suitable alternate design that
provides an effective vehicular turnaround. For nonresidential subdivisions
only, an administrative waiver may be granted by the Technical Review Committee
and Plan Commission for a cul-de-sac length exceeding 600 feet.
   (D)   Block standards.
      (1)   Block length and width, or acreage between bounding streets, shall
be such as to accommodate the size of lot required in the area by in the Zoning
Ordinance and to provide for convenient access, circulation control, and safety
of street users. Blocks that are unreasonably large or small shall not be
approved.
      (2)   The maximum block length shall be 1,200 feet. In the design of
blocks longer than 800 feet, or where deemed necessary for the safety of non-
vehicular street users, the Plan Commission may specify the provision of
pedestrian crosswalks near the center of the block, or wherever most useful to
facilitate pedestrian circulation, such as to a school, park, recreation area,
shopping center, or other significant location.
      (3)   Residential blocks shall be of sufficient depth to accommodate two
tiers of lots of minimum depth, except where a single tier of lots are platted
adjacent to a freeway, arterial street, floodplain, property line, preservation
area, non-residential outlot. or other such similar feature.
      (4)   No specific rule concerning the shape of blocks is set forth, but
blocks must fit easily into the overall plan of the subdivision and their
design must evidence consideration of lot planning, traffic flow, and public
areas.
   (E)   Lot standards.
      (1)   Subdivision lots shall be adequate for the type of development and
land use proposed, and shall conform to the zoning ordinance requirements. No
subdivision of land shall be permitted that creates a non-conforming lot as
defined in the Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   The lot size, width, depth, shape, grade, location, and orientation
shall be in proper relation to street and block design and to existing and
proposed topographical conditions.
      (3)   Every lot or parcel shall have sufficient frontage and access to a
public street designated, designed, and improved in accordance with the terms
of this chapter and the Zoning Ordinance.
      (4)   The minimum lot width, measured at the building setback line, and
the minimum lot size, shall conform to the Zoning Ordinance, and shall apply to
all buildable parcels included in subdivision plats. No buildings shall be
permitted to be constructed on any parcels not meeting the minimum standards of
the Zoning Ordinance.
      (5)   The minimum setbacks required for each lot shall be in conformance
with the Zoning Ordinance.
      (6)   Corner lots shall be sufficiently Larger than interior lots to
allow maintenance of setback lines along both streets.
      (7)   For purposes of calculating minimum lot area, street rights-of-way
shall not be included.
      (8)   Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles or radial
to street lines. Corner lots of sufficient size and lots where all side lot
lines are parallel may be exceptions.
      (9)   Flag lots shall not be permitted.
      (10)   Double-frontage lots shall not be permitted except where the
purpose is to buffer residential development from adverse influences or to
minimize the number of intersections with arterial streets and highways. A no-
access, planted buffer strip of no less than ten feet in width may be required
by the Plan Commission along lot lines adjoining such adverse influence or
arterial street.
      (11)   Lots abutting a watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream shall
have additional minimum width or depth as required to provide an adequate
building site and afford the minimum usable area required for front, rear, and
side yards. An casement shall be provided parallel to all legal drainage ways
at a width of 75 feet from the top of bank, unless modified by the Drainage
Board.
      (12)   A lowest exterior building grade shall be provided for each lot.
The elevation shall be a minimum of two feet above the emergency flood outlet
stage for each lot (this includes localized flooding outside of the federally-
regulated 100 year flood zones).
   (F)   Commercial and industrial subdivisions.
      (1)   It is recognized that an applicant creating a commercial or
industrial subdivision faces unique problems of lot design not normally
encountered in residential subdivisions. For this reason, the initial emphasis
of the Plan Commission shall be upon street layout and block arrangement.
      (2)   Generally, the procedural requirements shall be for the owner to
follow the regular procedure outlined herein; however, the applicant need show
only two lots along with the street and block layout. Then, from time to time,
as prospective buyers or users express interest in lots sized to their required
specifications, the owner shall submit an amendment to the approved, recorded
subdivision plat for consideration. Regular procedural requirements of the Plan
Commission following the receipt of a secondary subdivision plat shall then
apply, except those streets that have been built by following an approved set
of plans on the previously approved secondary plat shall not have to be rebuilt
because of adoption of new specifications. This shall also apply to storm
drainage facilities within said subdivision, unless runoff characteristics have
been changed by newly proposed improvements or unauthorized existing
improvements.
      (3)   Commercial projects shall be subject to minimum lot areas,
setbacks, and other applicable regulations set forth in the Zoning Ordinance.
Each distinct business use shall occupy a separate lot, exempting strip
centers, malls, or buildings containing more than one business.
   (G)   Easements.
      (1)   Adequate areas of suitable size and location shall be allocated for
drainage and/or utility easements. Such easements shall provide reasonable
continuity from block to block and shall be of adequate width to provide for
proper drainage and utility function, and to provide adequate access for
maintenance. Generally, such easements shall be at least 20 feet in width along
all rear lot lines, and, where necessary, at least 15 feet in width along side
lot lines. All exterior boundaries of the subdivision shall be provided with an
easement of at least 20 feet in width. The Plan Commission may require larger
or smaller easements when necessary. All drainage and/or utility easements
shall be available to serve properties outside of the plat without further
consent.
      (2)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel, or stream, adequate areas for storm water or drainage easements shall
be allocated for the purpose of widening, deepening, sloping, improving, or
protecting said watercourses.
      (3)   Whenever practicable, the applicant shall design for the placement
of utility lines underground, following the required standards and
specifications established by each utility company. The location of each
underground utility system shall be shown by appropriate easement lines on the
proposed plat.
      (4)   Erection of structures with foundations shall be prohibited within
all easements. Placement of temporary, portable structures shall be prohibited
within drainage easements, as shall pavement above the contour elevation of
approved drainage swales. Projection of portions of structures over easements
shall be permitted as long as the entity controlling the easement provides
written approval.
   (H)   Common areas.
      (1)   Common areas shall be provided in the amount required by the Zoning
Ordinance in order to ensure the health, safety, and general welfare of the
subdivision residents, adjacent property owners, and the town.
         (a)   In the absence of a standard in the Zoning Ordinance, the Plan
Commission may require up to 25% of a residential subdivision’s gross area to
be common area, open space, preservation area, and the like.
         (b)   In the absence of a standard in the Zoning Ordinance, the Plan
Commission may require up to 20% of a non-residential subdivision's gross area
to be common area, open space, preservation area, buffering, and the like.
      (2)   Common areas shall be laid out so as to facilitate access to and
maintenance of the area by the property owners of the subdivision.
   (I)   Subdivision names, street names, and addressing.
      (1)   Subdivision names and street names shall be approved by the process
in §
154.15.
      (2)   No street names may be used which will duplicate or be confused
with names of existing streets in the Town of Trafalgar or in Johnson County.
Streets which are logical extensions or continuations of, or alignments with,
any existing streets, either constructed or appearing on any validly recorded
plat, shall bear the names of such existing streets. The Plan Commission staff
may implement more specific policy guidelines for naming streets.
      (3)   The Plan Commission staff shall assign address numbers for each lot
in a subdivision after approval of the secondary plat.

failure of the owners’ association to fulfill its responsibilities shall be
deemed a violation of this chapter.

      (1)   There are no areas of common ownership within the subdivision; and
      (2)   There are no privately-maintained facilities, or where there are
privately-maintained facilities, adequate funding sources other than an owners’
association have been established to provide maintenance in perpetuity.
