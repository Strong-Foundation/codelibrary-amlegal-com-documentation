   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the city, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered, and consolidated into component codes,
titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the “Gas City
Code,” for which designation “Code of Ordinances,” “Codified Ordinances,” or

same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.

   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless

reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or subsection.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters, or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)

authority, or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; on the effective date of that ordinance or following the
effective date, the rights, powers, duties, or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,

liabilities, powers, and rights were transferred.

not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section

proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture, or

DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY FOR CITY DRIVERS
§ 32.55 PURPOSE.
   It is the policy of the city that its drivers be free of substance abuse and
alcohol abuse. Consequently, the use of illegal drugs by drivers is prohibited.
Further, drivers shall not use alcohol or engage in prohibited conduct as
defined herein. The overall goal of this policy is to ensure a drug and alcohol
free transportation environment and to reduce accidents, injuries, and
fatalities.
(Ord. 2, 1996, passed 3-19-1996)
§ 32.56 TYPES OF TESTS.
   Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Department of Transportation

   (B)   Post-accident testing;
   (C)   Random testing;

§ 32.57 REFUSAL TO TEST.
   Refusal to submit to the types of drug and alcohol tests employed by the
city will be grounds for refusal to hire driver/applicants and to terminate
employment of existing drivers. A REFUSAL TO TEST is defined to be conduct
which would obstruct the proper administration of a test. A delay in providing
a urine or breath specimen could be considered a refusal. If a driver cannot
provide a sufficient urine specimen or adequate breath, he or she will be
evaluated by a physician of the city’s choice. If the physician cannot find a
legitimate medical explanation for the inability to provide a specimen (either
urine or breath), it will be considered a refusal to test. In that
circumstance, the driver has violated one of the prohibitions of the
regulations.
(Ord. 2, 1996, passed 3-19-1996)
§ 32.58 CONSEQUENCES OF POLICY VIOLATION.

(Ord. 2, 1996, passed 3-19-1996)
§ 32.59 PRE-EMPLOYMENT TESTING.
   (A)   All applicants for driving positions must submit to urine drug tests.
A driver/applicant is not required to submit to urine drug tests if the city

within the preceding 30 days and, while participating in that program, was
either tested within the past six months or participated in a random selection
program for the previous 12 months.
   (B)   The city must also ensure that no prior employer of the driver has
knowledge or records of a violation of the DOT alcohol rules within the
previous six months.
   (C)   If the driver/applicant has an alcohol test result between 0.02 and
0.0399, he or she shall not be allowed to drive for 24 hours. The driver shall
be removed from safety-sensitive functions, and the applicant is not allowed to
operate a commercial motor vehicle for 24 hours.

§ 32.60 RANDOM TESTING.
   (A)   The city conducts random drug and alcohol testing. The city or its
agents will submit all drivers to a random selection system. The random
selection system provides an equal chance for each driver to be selected each
time random selection occurs. Random selections will be reasonably spread
throughout the year. The city will drug test, at a minimum, 50% of the average
number of driver positions in each calendar year. The city will select, at a
minimum, 25% of the average number of driver positions for random alcohol
testing. Random selection, by its very nature, may result in drivers being
selected in successive selections or more than once a calendar year.
Alternatively, some drivers may not be selected in a calendar year.
   (B)   If a driver is selected at random, for either drug or alcohol testing,
a city official will notify the driver. Once notified, every action the driver
takes must lead to a collection. If the driver engages in conduct which does
not lead to a collection as soon as possible after notification, such conduct
may be considered a refusal to test.
(Ord. 2, 1996, passed 3-19-1996)
§ 32.61 POST-ACCIDENT TESTING.
   (A)   When a driver is involved in an accident where a fatality is involved,

driver is involved in a recordable accident and receives a citation for a
moving violation arising from the accident, the driver also must submit to a
drug and alcohol test. Following any accident, the driver must contact the city
as soon as possible.
   (B)   The DOT requires that any time a post-accident drug or alcohol test is
required, that it be performed as soon as possible following the accident. If
no alcohol collection can be made within eight hours, attempts to collect a
breath sample shall cease. If no urine collection can be obtained for purposes
of post-accident drug testing within 32 hours, attempts to make such collection
shall cease.
   (C)   In the event that federal, state, or local officials conduct breath or
blood tests for the use of alcohol and/or urine tests for the use of controlled
substances following an accident, these tests shall be considered to meet the
requirements of this section, provided the tests conform to applicable federal,
state, or local requirements. The employee will sign a release allowing the
city to obtain the test results from federal, state, or local officials.
   (D)   In the event a driver is so seriously injured that the driver cannot
provide a urine or breath specimen at the time of the accident, the driver must
provide necessary authorization for the city to obtain hospital records or
other documents that would indicate whether there were controlled substances or
alcohol in the driver’s system at the time of the accident.
(Ord. 2, 1996, passed 3-19-1996)
§ 32.62 REASONABLE SUSPICION TESTING.
   Reasonable suspicion for requiring a driver to submit to drug and/or alcohol
testing shall be deemed to exist when a driver manifests physical or behavioral
symptoms or reactions commonly attributed to the use of controlled substances
or alcohol. Such driver conduct must be witnessed by at least one supervisor
trained in compliance with 49 CFR § 382.603.
(Ord. 2, 1996, passed 3-19-1996)
§ 32.63 PROHIBITED CONDUCT.
   (A)   The following shall be considered PROHIBITED CONDUCT for purposes of
this subchapter.
      (1)   No driver shall report for duty or remain on duty while having an
alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater.
      (2)   No driver shall be on duty or operate a commercial motor vehicle
while the driver possesses alcohol unless the alcohol is manifested and
transported as part of a shipment.
      (3)   No driver shall use alcohol while performing safety-sensitive
functions.
      (4)   No driver shall perform safety-sensitive functions within four
hours after using alcohol.
      (5)   No driver required to take a post-accident alcohol test shall use
alcohol for eight hours following the accident or until he or she undergoes a
post-accident alcohol test, whichever occurs first.
      (6)   No driver shall refuse to submit to a post-accident, a random, a
reasonable suspicion, return-to-duty, or a follow-up breath alcohol or urine
drug test.
      (7)   No driver shall report for duty or remain on duty when the driver
uses any controlled substance, except when use is pursuant to the instructions
of a physician who has advised the driver that the substances does not
adversely affect the driver’s ability to operate a commercial motor vehicle.
   (B)   If the city has actual knowledge or has reason to believe that a
driver has engaged in prohibited conduct, the city may require the driver to
submit to drug and/or alcohol testing.
   (C)   If a driver engages in prohibited conduct, the driver is not qualified
to drive a commercial motor vehicle and shall be immediately removed from
service. The city may, in its discretion, at the request of the driver, keep
the driver’s position open while such driver attempts to become requalified.
The city may also take action against the employee, up to and including
termination.
(Ord. 2, 1996, passed 3-19-1996)
§ 32.64 SUBSTANCE ABUSE EVALUATION.
   Any driver who engages in prohibited conduct shall be provided with the
names, addresses, and telephone numbers of qualified substance abuse
professionals. If the driver desires to become requalified, the driver must be
evaluated by a substance abuse professional (SAP) and submit to any treatment
prescribed by the SAP. Following evaluation and treatment, if any, in order to
become requalified, the driver must submit to and successfully complete a
return-to-duty drug and/or alcohol test. Such driver
is also subject to follow-up testing. Follow-up testing is separate from and in
addition to the city’s reasonable suspicion, post-accident, and random testing
procedures. Follow-up testing shall be on a random basis and be in accordance
with the instructions of the substance abuse professional. Follow-up testing
may continue for a period of up to 60 months following the driver’s return to
duty. No fewer than six tests shall be performed in the first 12 months of a
follow-up testing. The costs of any SAP evaluation or prescribed treatment
shall be borne by the driver. The city does not guarantee or promise a position
to the driver should he or she regain qualified status.
(Ord. 2, 1996, passed 3-19-1996)
§ 32.65 AUTHORIZATION FOR PREVIOUS TEST RECORDS.
   Within 14 days of performing a safety-sensitive function, federal
regulations require that the city obtain certain drug and alcohol testing
records from driver’s previous employers for the previous two years. As a
condition to employment, the driver shall provide the city with a written
authorization for all previous employers within the past two years to release
such drug and alcohol testing records as are required under federal regulation.
(Ord. 2, 1996, passed 3-19-1996)
§ 32.66 DRUG URINALYSIS.
   (A)   Drug testing will be performed through urinalysis. Urinalysis will
test for the presence of drugs and/or metabolites of the following controlled
substances:
      (1)   Marijuana;
      (2)   Cocaine;
      (3)   Opiates;
      (4)   Amphetamines; and
      (5)   Phencyclidine (PCP).
   (B)   The urinalysis procedure starts with the collection or a urine
specimen. Urine specimens will be submitted to a SAMHSA-certified laboratory
for testing. As part of the collection process, the specimen provided will be
split into two vials; a primary vial and a secondary vial. The SAMHSA-certified
laboratory will perform initial screenings on all primary vials. In the event
that the primary specimen tests positive, a confirmation test of the specimen
will be performed before being reported by the laboratory to the MRO as a
positive.
   (C)   All laboratory results will be reported by the laboratory to a medical
review officer (MRO) designated by the city. Negative test results shall be
reported by the MRO to the city. Before reporting a positive test result to the
city, the MRO will attempt to contact the driver to discuss the test result. If
the MRO is unable to contact the driver directly, the MRO will contact the city
management official designated in advance by the city, who shall in turn
contact the driver and direct the driver to contact the MRO. Upon being so
directed, the driver shall contact the MRO immediately or, if after the MRO’s
business hours and the MRO is unavailable, at the start of the MRO’s next
business day. In the MRO’s sole discretion, a determination will be made as to
whether a result is positive or negative.
   (D)   Pursuant to DOT regulations, individual test results for driver/
applicants and drivers will be released to the city and will be kept strictly
confidential unless consent for the release of the test results has been
obtained. Any individual who has submitted to drug testing in compliance with
this policy is entitled to receive the results of such testing upon timely
written request.
   (E)   An individual testing positive may make a request of the MRO to have
the secondary vial tested. The driver may request that the secondary vial be
tested by a different SAMHSA-certified lab than tested the primary specimen.
The individual making the request for a test of the second specimen must pre-
pay all costs associated with the test. The request for testing of a second
specimen is timely if it is made to the MRO within 72 hours of the individual
being notified by the city of a positive test result.
(Ord. 2, 1996, passed 3-19-1996)
§ 32.67 ALCOHOL TESTS.
   The city will perform alcohol tests using an evidential breath testing
device. The city may provide use of an evidential breath testing device through
a vendor or agent. The driver shall report to the site of an evidential breath
testing device as notified by the city. The evidential breath testing device
will be operated by a breath alcohol technician. The driver shall follow all
instructions given by the breath alcohol technician. In the event that a
driver, on the basis of the evidential breath test, has a blood alcohol content
of 0.02 to 0.0399, the driver shall be removed from duty for 24 hours or until
his or her next scheduled on-duty time, whichever is longer. Applicants are not
medically qualified until after the 24-hour time frame expires. Drivers with
tests indicating a blood alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater are
considered to have prohibited conduct which may result in disciplinary action
up to and including termination. All alcohol tests shall be performed just
prior to, during, or just after duty.
(Ord. 2, 1996, passed 3-19-1996)
§ 32.68 TRAINING.
   (A)   The city shall ensure supervisors designated to determine whether
reasonable suspicion exists to require a driver to undergo testing under 49 CFR
§ 382.307 receive at least 60 minutes of training on alcohol misuse and receive
at least an additional 60 minutes of training on controlled substances use. The
training shall cover the physical, behavioral, speech, and performance
indicators of probable alcohol misuse and use of controlled substances.
   (B)   The city shall provide educational materials that explain the
requirements of 49 CFR § 382.601, consequences of violating the regulations and
the employer’s policies and procedures with the respect to meeting these
requirements. The materials supplied to drivers may include information on
additional employer policies with respect to the use or possession of alcohol
or controlled substances, for example, the consequences for a driver found to
have a specified alcohol or controlled substances level based on the employer’s
authority independent of 49 CFR § 382.601. City shall ensure each driver is
required to sign a statement certifying that he or she has received a copy of
these materials described in 49 CFR § 382.601.
   (C)   This policy is not intended, nor should it be construed, as a contract
between the city and employee. This policy may be changed at any time at the
sole discretion of the city.

§ 34.01 INTERNAL CONTROL POLICY ADOPTED.
   The city hereby adopts the internal control policy incorporated herein as §§
34.15 through
34.32.
(Ord. 12-2016, passed 12-20-2016)
§ 34.02 PERSONNEL TRAINING.
   The Controller is directed to ensure that all personnel receive training
concerning the internal control procedures adopted and approved herein prior to

(Ord. 12-2016, passed 12-20-2016)
INTERNAL CONTROL POLICY
§ 34.15 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this policy is to communicate the City Council’s internal
control objectives to all employees and elected officials of the city and to
firmly commit the city to the 17 key principles of internal controls as
established by the State Board of Accounts.
(Ord. 12-2016, passed 12-20-2016)
§ 34.16 COMMITMENT TO INTEGRITY AND ETHICAL VALUES.
   (A)   The city has the responsibility to establish and maintain an adequate
system of internal control and to furnish to the City Council, various boards
and commissions, governmental agencies, creditors, and others reliable
financial information on a timely basis. An adequate system of internal control
is necessary for the city to discharge these responsibilities.
   (B)   Controls help ensure that assets are not exposed to unauthorized
access and use, transactions are properly recorded in the financial records,
and the resultant financial information is reliable. External organizations and
stakeholders of the city rely on financial information to make decisions toward
appropriations, loans, and other debt, grants, and other contractual
relationships. City resources are dependent upon the system of internal
control. Auditors are required annually to report upon the adequacy of the
city’s systems for control over financial reporting and compliance per I.C. 5-
11-1-27(e). The safeguarding of city assets and the reliability which the city
and others can place upon its financial records is dependent upon the
effectiveness of the internal control process.
   (C)   As the fiscal body, the City Council expects the city administration
to effect an internal control
environment with policies and procedures necessary to provide reasonable
assurance that practices cause
effective and efficient operations, reliable financial reporting, and
compliance with applicable laws and
regulations.
   (D)   The system of internal control is meant to keep the city on course
toward its mission and to minimize surprises. The system promotes efficiency,
minimizes risks of asset loss, helps ensure the reliability of financial
information, and compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
   (E)   Internal control is a process; a means to an end, and not an end unto
itself. The control environment is the foundation upon which all components of
internal control are based. It sets the tone for city operations. Internal
control is about people, operations, communications, and the work environment.
It is not about policies and forms though it takes shape through the
implementation of relevant policies, procedures, and practices. Internal
control can provide reasonable assurance, but no system of control can provide
absolute assurance to the City Council and other users of financial
information.
   (F)   The Finance Department shall be charged with:
      (1)   Conveying periodic messages of the city’s internal control
philosophy and expectations to all employees;
      (2)   Evaluating the city’s internal control system for weaknesses on a
periodic (but no less frequently than annual) basis, providing solutions to any
discovered weaknesses, and informing employees of necessary changes in
procedures;
      (3)   Working with the Human Resources Department to establish a
confidential reporting system for individuals to report suspected fraud and
abuse of internal control policies; and
      (4)   Working with the Human Resources Department to institute procedures
to address violations of policies and consequences for violations.
(Ord. 12-2016, passed 12-20-2016)
§ 34.17 OVERSIGHT BODY.
   As the fiscal body for the city, the City Council is responsible for setting
the institutional expectations for internal control, ensuring management is
aware of those expectations, requiring the upward communications channels are
open through all levels of management, and evaluating management’s
effectiveness toward monitoring the control environment and implementing sound
control policies and procedures. As the city’s chief fiscal officer, the
Controller will be the City Council’s chief agent in implementing and managing
the internal control policies and procedures.
(Ord. 12-2016, passed 12-20-2016)
§ 34.18 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY.
   (A)   Individuals with delegated approval authority, e.g. elected officials
and department heads, are responsible for establishing, maintaining, and
supporting a system of internal controls within their areas of responsibility
and for creating the control environment that encourages compliance with city
policies and procedures.
   (B)   Adequate supervision is necessary to monitor that internal controls
are operating as intended, and to help ensure the reliability of accounting and
operational controls by pointing out errors, omissions, exceptions, and
inconsistencies in procedures. Staff in leadership roles are responsible for
the application of this policy and the design, development, implementation, and
maintenance of systems of internal controls focusing on the effectiveness of
operations and the safeguarding of assets within their respective areas of
responsibility. All levels of management and supervision are responsible for
strengthening internal controls when weaknesses are detected. Department
managers should periodically review departmental procedures to ensure that the
general principles of internal control are being followed.
   (C)   The Finance Department has the primary responsibility for internal
control over financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws, rules,
and regulations. The Controller is the city’s chief source for information and
assistance to staff and department heads on this topic and will make resources
available to assist in administering this policy.
   (D)   The Human Resources Department is responsible for internal controls
over employee recruitment, hiring, separation, promotion, job classification,
employee rights, and salary administration. The Benefits Coordinator and
Corporation Counsel are the city sources for information and assistance on this
topic and will make resources available to assist in administering this policy.
   (E)   All levels of internal control are subject to examination by external
auditors who are required to report on the adequacy of internal controls over
finance and compliance.
   (F)   Department heads are responsible for prompt corrective action on all
internal control findings and recommendations made by internal and external
auditors. The audit process is completed only after Department heads receive
the audit results and take action to correct internal control weaknesses,
improve systems, or demonstrate that management action is not warranted.
Department heads have the responsibility to ensure that those who report to
them have adequate knowledge, skills, and abilities to function within, and
contribute to, an effective internal control environment. This includes
providing access to appropriate training on topics relevant to their job
responsibilities.
(Ord. 12-2016, passed 12-20-2016)
§ 34.19 CITY EMPLOYEES.
   (A)   The City Employee Handbook provides a roadmap for recruiting and
maintaining quality employees. Prior to employment, individuals may be subject
to pre-employment background screening and/or a credit history check. While
employed, city employees are entitled to a benefits package, including health
and disability insurance and certain other post-employment benefits. The city
will continue to assess the best recruitment pools and tools for the different
skill sets of skills necessary to adequately implement and maintain quality
internal controls.
   (B)   Job descriptions will be updated where necessary to reflect internal
control responsibilities and duties. Employees will be regularly trained in
internal control methods and all training will be documented in employees’
personnel files. Employees will be regularly evaluated by their supervisors on
internal control duties and receive feedback on possible improvements.
(Ord. 12-2016, passed 12-20-2016)
§ 34.20 INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTABILITY.
   Individuals are held accountable for their internal control responsibilities
through a recognized structure which includes relevant job descriptions,
operating procedures, periodic reviews, regular feedback, and a progressive
disciplinary policy. Additionally, city administration seeks to address issues
in specific departments and positions through regular one-on-ones with
department heads.
(Ord. 12-2016, passed 12-20-2016)
§ 34.21 OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Through the creation of standard operating procedures and accurate
organizational reporting charts management conveys and identifies objectives,
missions, policies, and risk tolerances to employees. The Finance Department
will lead a risk analysis of three major areas:
      (1)   The effectiveness and efficiency of operations;
      (2)   The reliability of reporting for internal and external use; and
      (3)   Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
   (B)   For each category, the Finance Department will define objectives in
specific measurable terms in order to enable the design of internal control for
related risk, increase understanding at all levels, assess performance,
identify what is to be achieved, who is to achieve it, how it will be achieved,
when it will be achieved and incorporate external requirements.
(Ord. 12-2016, passed 12-20-2016)
§ 34.22 IDENTIFICATION OF RISKS.
   (A)   The Finance Department will identify, analyze, and respond to the
risks identified in §
34.21 by determining:
      (1)   How likely the risk is to occur;
      (2)   How it will impact the objective;
      (3)   If the risk is based on complex or unusual transactions; and
      (4)   If the risk is based on fraud.
   (B)   Once each risk has been identified and analyzed, the Finance
Department will work with department heads to determine how to respond to each
risk with a specific solution and action.
(Ord. 12-2016, passed 12-20-2016)
§ 34.23 POTENTIAL FOR FRAUD.
   Management is committed to fraud prevention by utilizing a “trust but
verify” approach. The potential for fraud, misappropriation, and outright theft
are contemplated as controls are designed for various city divisions. Fraud
responses will include statutorily required responses to fraud, including, but
not limited to, I.C. 5-11-1-27(l) relating to the report of misappropriation of
funds to State Board of Accounts and prosecuting attorney and I.C. 5-11-1-27(j)
relating to the report of material variances, losses, shortages, or thefts to
the State Board of Accounts. The city shall utilize a materiality threshold of
$500.
(Ord. 12-2016, passed 12-20-2016)
§ 34.24 RESPONSE TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE.
   The Finance Department, in coordination with department heads, will
regularly evaluate and adjust internal control policies in order to accommodate
for the impact of future changes, including, but not limited to, personnel
changes, newly elected officials, new programs, new technology, new laws and
regulations, and financial fluctuations.
(Ord. 12-2016, passed 12-20-2016)
§ 34.25 CONTROL ACTIVITIES.
   (A)   The Finance Department will establish and maintain a system of
internal controls that satisfies the city’s objectives in the following
categories:
      (1)   Risks are identified and effectively manages;
      (2)   Safeguarding of city assets;
      (3)   Reliability and integrity of financial information;
      (4)   Compliance with city policy, plans, procedures, laws, and
regulations;
      (5)   Economical and efficient use of city resources; and
      (6)   Meeting established objectives and goals for city operations and
programs.
   (B)   General internal control principles for departments are:
      (1)   Separation of duties:
         (a)   Duties are separated so that one person’s work routinely serves
as a check on another’s work; and
         (b)   No one person has complete control over more than one key
function or activity (e.g., authorizing, approving, certifying, disbursing,
receiving, or reconciling).
      (2)   Authorization and approval:
         (a)   Proposed transactions are authorized when proper and consistent
with city policy and the department’s plans; and
         (b)   Transactions are approved by the person who has delegated
approval authority, which is usually delegated on the basis of special
competency or knowledge.
      (3)   Custodial and security arrangements:
         (a)   Responsibility for physical security/custody of city assets is
separated from record keeping/accounting for those assets; and
         (b)   Unauthorized access to city assets and institutional data is
prevented.
      (4)   Timely and accurate review and reconciliation:
         (a)   Departmental accounting records and documents are examined by
employees who have sufficient understanding of the city accounting and
financial systems to verify that recorded transactions actually took place and
were made in accordance with city policies and procedures; and
         (b)   Departmental accounting records and documentation are compared
with city accounting system reports and financial statements to verify their
reasonableness, accuracy, and completeness.
      (5)   The general internal control principles should be applied to all
departmental operations, especially accounting records and reports, payroll,
purchasing/receiving/disbursement approval, equipment and supply inventories,
cash receipts, petty cash and change funds, billing, and accounts receivable.
   (C)   All city systems, processes, operations, functions, and activities are
subject to evaluations of
internal control systems. The results of these evaluations provide information
regarding the city’s overall system of control.
   (D)   Information must be timely and communicated in a manner that enables
people to carry out their responsibilities.
      (1)   (a)   All covered employees must be trained on internal controls
according to I.C. 5-11-1-27(g).
         (b)   All personnel must receive a clear message from the city’s
administration that control
responsibilities are to be taken seriously. Failure to comply with established
practices will subject individuals to the terms of disciplinary action or
dismissal.
      (2)   Employees must understand their own roles in the internal control
system, as well as how
individual activities relate to the work of others. To this end, whenever a new
budgetary unit, financial activity, and the like is set up, the Controller will
provide notification to the appropriate parties of the responsibilities
incumbent on them for good business practices and sound financial management,
including reference to the principles within this policy.
      (3)   Employees must have a means of communicating significant
information to the city’s administration.
      (4)   The city must communicate effectively with external parties, such
as auditors, creditors, contractors, suppliers, regulators, and other
stakeholders.
   (E)   Internal control is meant to keep the city focused on achieving its
mission while avoiding surprises. There is a balance between effective controls
and mission accomplishment. Costs associated with internal controls should not
exceed their benefit, nor should controls be allowed to stifle mission

project, including individuals performing work as independent contractors,
within five business days after the date the bids are due.
   (B)   In addition, each such first-tier subcontractor shall be required to
adhere to the requirements of §
50.15 as though it were bidding directly to the city, except that first-tier
subcontractors shall submit the required information (including the name,
address, and type of work for each of their first-tier subcontractors) to the
successful bidder no later than five business days prior to the subcontractor’s
first day of work on the public work project, and the bidder shall then forward
said information to the city.
   (C)   Upon request, the city may require any second and lower-tier

the second or lower-tier subcontractor from the project and replace it with a
responsive and responsible contractor.
   (D)   Failure of a subcontractor to submit the required information shall
not disqualify the successful bidder from performing work on the project and

subcontractor from the project and replace it with a responsive and responsible
subcontractor.
   (E)   The disclosure of a subcontractor (disclosed subcontractor) by a
bidder or a subcontractor shall not create any rights in the disclosed
subcontractor. Thus, a bidder and/or subcontractor may substitute another
subcontractor (substitute subcontractor) for a disclosed subcontractor by
giving the city written notice of the name, address, and type of work of the
substitute subcontractor. The substitute subcontractor is subject to all the
obligations of a subcontractor under this subchapter.

subcontractor shall still be permitted to bid on city public works projects.
   (C)   Any material changes to the contractor’s status, at any time, must be

qualification designation is solely within the discretion of the city, and the
city specifically reserves the right to change or revoke the designation for a
stated written reason(s).
   (D)   Denial of pre-qualification shall be in writing and shall be forwarded
to the contractor within seven working days of such decision. Any contractor
denied or losing pre-qualification status may request reconsideration of the
decision by submitting such request in writing to the city within five business
days of receipt of notice of denial.

contractor or subcontractor’s submission or any information obtained by the
city through its own independent verification of the information provided by
the contractor.
(Ord. 9-2021, passed 10-19-2021)
§ 50.20 CERTIFIED PAYROLL.
   (A)   For projects in which the cost is at least $250,000, the successful
bidder and all subcontractors working on a public work project shall submit a
certified payroll report utilizing the federal form now known as a WH-347 which
must be prepared on a weekly basis and submitted to the city within ten
calendar days after the end of each week in which the bidder or subcontractor
performed its work on the public work project. These certified payroll reports
shall identify the job title and craft of each employee on the project, e.g.,
journeyman electrician or apprentice electrician.
   (B)   The city may withhold payment due for work performed by a bidder if
the bidder fails to timely submit its certified payroll reports until such time
as such certified payroll reports are submitted. The city may also withhold
payment due for work performed by a subcontractor if the subcontractor fails to
timely submit its certified payroll reports until such time as such certified
payroll reports are submitted. The city shall not withhold payment to a bidder
for work performed by the bidder or for work performed by subcontractors who
have submitted their certified payroll reports, because one or more other
subcontractors failed to timely submit their certified payroll reports.

the property served by a connection to the public water system of the city for
cross-connections. On request, the owner, lessee, or occupant of any property
so served shall furnish to the inspection agency any pertinent information
regarding the piping system or systems on such property. The refusal of access
or refusal of requested pertinent information shall be deemed evidence of the
presence of cross-connections.

necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water system.
Water service shall be discontinued only after reasonable notice is served on
the owner, lessee, or occupants of the property or premises where a violation
is found or suspected to exist. Water service to such property shall not be
restored until the cross-connection(s) has been eliminated in compliance with
the provisions of this subchapter.
   (B)   If it is deemed by the City Water Utility that a cross-connection or
an emergency endangers public health, safety, or welfare and requires immediate
action, and a written finding to that effect is filed with the Clerk Treasurer
of the city and delivered to the consumer’s premises, service may be
immediately discontinued. The consumer shall have an opportunity for hearing
within ten days of such emergency discontinuance.

EMERGENCY CURTAILMENT AND LOAD REDUCTION PLAN
§ 53.35 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BASE MONTHLY CONSUMPTION. The customer’s average billing month usage based
upon the three-month period in the prior 12 months which corresponds to the
billing month being curtailed and the immediately preceding and succeeding
months. Adjustments may be made for customers with changed circumstances that
have caused the prior year’s usage during the period to be nonrepresentative of
current usage during the period.
   COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. Customers engaged primarily in wholesale or retail
trade and services including clubs, institutions, and city, local, state, and
federal governmental agencies, except educational institutions.
   DISPENSABLE USES. The following and similar types of uses of electric energy
shall be considered DISPENSABLE USES:
      (1)   Outdoor flood and advertising lighting, except for the minimum
level necessary to protect life and property and a single illuminated sign
identifying commercial facilities that are open after dark;
      (2)   General lighting levels in stores and offices greater than minimum
functional levels;
      (3)   Show window and display lighting;
      (4)   Greater number of elevators operating in office buildings during
non-peak hours than is necessary;
      (5)   Parking lot lighting above minimum functional levels;
      (6)   Energy greater than that necessary to maintain a temperature of not
less than 78°F during operation of cooling equipment and not more than 65°F
during operation of heating equipment;
      (7)   Greater than minimum work schedules, as for building cleaning and
maintenance, restocking, and the like, which shall require office or industrial
facilities to be illuminated, cooled, or heated beyond normal working hours;
      (8)   Night athletics and recreational activities; and
      (9)   Public museums, art galleries, and historical buildings requiring
illumination, cooling, or heating.
   HUMAN NEEDS CUSTOMERS. Hospitals, medical centers, nursing homes, and
customers where curtailment would adversely affect public health and safety
such as municipal fire departments, police departments, civil defense, and
emergency Red Cross services, and any other facility whose use of electric
energy is vital to public health and safety as determined by the utility.
   INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS. Customers who are engaged primarily in a process that
creates or changes raw or unfinished materials into another form or product.
   LIVING QUARTERS. As used in Service Priority Class II, hotels, motels,
dormitories, and similar dwelling places.
   RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS. Customers living in residential dwellings, mobile
homes, apartments, or condominiums.
   SERVICE OBLIGATION. The largest metered demand (peak demand for customers
served on industrial and commercial rates) in the previous 12 months. If no
such demand information is available, an estimate shall be used, determined by
dividing the kilowatt hours in the maximum usage month in such previous 12
months by 200 hours.

A     Flow of 100,000 gallons per day (0.1 MGD) Quarterly
      or more per average workday
      Flow from 0.04 MGD to 0.1 MGD per average
B     workday or discharge with constituents or Semiannually
      characteristics that result in a major
      contributor classification
 
      (2)   (a)   The surveillance period shall normally be for a period of
seven consecutive days, but may be of a longer or shorter duration at the
discretion of the Council or Superintendent.
         (b)   If the surveillance period extends for a greater number of
consecutive days than seven, the city shall have the prerogative of selecting
the seven consecutive days for establishing rates and charges as provided for
in §§

   (B)   Surveillance survey charge.
      (1)   The charge for each surveillance survey shall be $20 per day with a
maximum charge for seven days being $140. The Council may adopt a schedule of
lower surveillance fees and may waive any surveillance fees it deems necessary,
particularly when surveillance is to protect or determine improper discharge
found not to exist. If no improper discharge is found, the Council may
nevertheless charge a minimum fee of $10.
      (2)   If the industry has an ongoing pretreatment facility or system
approved by the state or by the Council, there shall be no surveillance fee,
unless the Council finds the user repeatedly violating the effluent standards
applicable to that user.
(Prior Code, § 36-9-23-1-4.3)
   (C)   Monitoring of major contributors.
      (1)   (a)   A major contributor shall install at its own expense:
            1.   A suitable control manhole or other access means, together
with such necessary appurtenances in or on each building lateral sewer to
facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastewater; and
            2.   Such sampling devices as may be reasonably necessary, all
unless otherwise instructed by the city.
         (b)   1.   A user may be required by the city to install such manholes
or other access means to verify his or her status as a major contributor or
otherwise.
            2.   The manholes or other access means and sampling and testing
devices shall be constructed and maintained to the satisfaction of the city and
at the expense of the owner.
            3.   All such access devices, including manholes, shall be under
the control of the city.
      (2)   The city may provide monitoring equipment during a surveillance
period for control manholes or other access means.
      (3)   Monitoring equipment shall include a device for automatically
measuring flow and a device for automatically taking a composite sample of
wastewater during a 24-hour period, unless otherwise specified by the city.

SEWER CHARGES, SURCHARGES, AND SERVICE FEES
§ 54.060 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Persons subject to fees and sewer charges. For the use and service
rendered by the sewerage works, sewer charges shall be collected from the
person who owns each and every parcel of real estate that is connected directly
or indirectly to the city’s sewerage system or otherwise discharges wastewater
either directly or indirectly into the sewerage system of the city, which sewer
charges shall be payable as provided in this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 36-9-23-1-5.1)
   (B)   Effective date; extension to additional property. The sewer charges
fixed by this subchapter shall become effective at the time the user first
discharges to the sewerage system. These sewer charges shall be extended to and
cover any additional premises thereafter served, without the necessity of any
hearing or notice.
(Prior Code, § 36-9-23-1-5.2)
   (C)   Rate basis. The sewer flow charges shall be based on the quantity of
water as measured by the water meter used on or in the premises subject to such
sewer charges, except as otherwise provided in this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 36-9-23-1-5.3)
   (D)   Schedule of meter reading. Water meters shall be read once each month
or, at the option of the city, at other intervals.
(Prior Code, § 36-9-23-1-5.4) (Ord. 2-1981, passed 2-24-1981; Ord. 3-1982,
passed 7-6-1982)
§ 54.061 PROCEDURE WHEN WATER IS OBTAINED PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY FROM SOURCES
OTHER THAN CITY WATERWORKS.
   If a user obtains water partially or wholly from sources other than the City
Waterworks, the total water used shall be measured or determined as provided in
§§
54.026(B) and 54.041(C), or by other reasonable means as the Council may
direct. In the case of single-family household having a private well but no
city water supply, the sewer flow charge shall be for 6,000 gallons per month,
unless a meter is installed on the well at the request of either the user or
the city, in which case, the cost of installation shall be paid for by the user
and the meter shall be provided by the city. The installation of any such meter
shall be approved by the city.
(Prior Code, § 36-9-23-1-5.5) (Ord. 2-1981, passed 2-24-1981; Ord. 3-1982,
passed 7-6-1982)
§ 54.062 PROCEDURE WHEN SINGLE METER SERVES MORE THAN ONE USER.
   If two or more premises, including apartments and trailers discharging
wastewater into the city’s sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, are
consumers of water, and the quantity of water is measured by a single water
meter, then in that case, for billing purposes, the quantity of water used
shall be the average for each user, and the minimum charge and the sewage rates
and charges shall apply to each of the number of premises served through the
single water meter.
(Prior Code, § 36-9-23-1-5.6) (Ord. 2-1981, passed 2-24-1981; Ord. 3-1982,
passed 7-6-1982)
§ 54.063 PORTION OF WATER NOT ENTERING SEWERAGE SYSTEM.
   If a user utilizes more than 30,000 gallons of water per month, and can
substantiate to the city that a portion of that water does not and cannot enter
the sewerage system, the Council shall either determine the portion of the
measured water to be used in determining the appropriate sewer charges, or
approve the manner and technique of flow measurement provided by the user for
determining wastewater discharged to the sewerage system. Facilities utilized
to accomplish this shall be installed and maintained in a serviceable condition
by the user at his or her expense, but shall be under the exclusive control of
the city.
(Prior Code, § 36-9-23-1-5.7) (Ord. 2-1981, passed 2-24-1981; Ord. 3-1982,
passed 7-6-1982)
§ 54.064 BILLING PROCEDURE GENERALLY.
   (A)   Sewer billings and invoices shall be rendered and collected
approximately monthly.
   (B)   The Council shall make and enforce all bylaws and regulations which it
deems necessary for the regulation, collection, rebating, and refunding of the
sewer charges prescribed by this subchapter.
   (C)   Major contributors with a flow in excess of 50,000 gallons per average
work day shall have billing determined on the basis of wastewater discharged as
monitored per §
54.041(A), with the following exception.
   (D)   At its option, the city may accept monitoring data and information
from such a major contributor to substantiate billing determination on a more
frequent basis than as established in §
54.041(A). That allowance, however, shall not exempt the major contributor from
the surveillance survey fee set by the city to offset the costs of monitoring
performed by the city.
   (E)   If there is a difference in analytical results that is not explainable
by normal variation in the testing procedure, the user may, within 30 days of
billing, appeal to the Council.
   (F)   (1)   So that domestic and residential users of sewage service shall
not be penalized for sprinkling lawns during the months of July, August, and
September, the billing for sewage service for residential and/or domestic users
for those months of July, August, and September shall be based upon the water
usage for the previous months of January, February, and March. If the water
usage for those previous months of January, February, and March is greater than
the water usage of those months of July, August, and September, then the
billing for sewage service shall be computed on the actual water used in the
month for which the sewage service bill is being rendered.
      (2)   Domestic and/or residential sewage service as applicable to the
sprinkling rate shall apply to each lot, parcel of real estate, or building
which is occupied and used as a residence. This sprinkling rate shall not apply
to any premises which are partially or wholly used for commercial or industrial
purposes. If a portion of those premises shall be used for commercial or
industrial purposes, the owner shall have the privilege of separating the water
service so that the residential portion of the premises is served through a
separate water meter, and in that case, the water usage as registered by the
water meter serving that portion of the premises used for residential purposes
shall qualify for the sprinkling rate.
(Prior Code, § 36-9-23-1-5.8) (Ord. 2-1981, passed 2-24-1981; Ord. 3-1982,
passed 7-6-1982)
§ 54.065 TENANTS MAY BE BILLED; RIGHT OF OWNERS TO EXAMINE RECORDS.
   The sewer charges may be billed to the tenants occupying the premises
served, unless otherwise instructed in writing by the person who owns the
premises. These billings shall in no way relieve the owner of liability if
payment is not made as required by this subchapter. The owners of the premises
served, which are occupied by tenants, shall have the rights to examine the
city collection records to determine if these sewer charges have been paid by
those tenants. Any such examination shall be made at the office at which the
records are kept and during the normal business hours of that office.
(Prior Code, § 36-9-23-1-5.9) (Ord. 2-1981, passed 2-24-1981; Ord. 3-1982,

§ 54.067 SURCHARGE BASED ON FLOW AND CONCENTRATION OF WASTEWATER.
   (A)   All wastewater discharged by major contributors shall meet the
admissibility standards in §§
54.040 through
54.048, by pretreatment if necessary in the determination of the Council.
Wastewater beyond the limits of admissibility set forth in §
54.045(E)(1) may be accepted and surcharged in accordance with the schedule in
§
54.068.
   (B)   Surcharges shall be based on actual quantities discharged for
treatment as determined from measured concentration and flow. Surcharge rates
for wastewater characteristics not provided for in this subchapter may be set
at the reasonable discretion of the Council, taking into account all of the
Sewer Department’s significant cost factors, relating to treatment, handling,
and disposal.
(Prior Code, § 36-9-23-1-5.11) (Ord. 2-1981, passed 2-24-1981; Ord. 3-1982,

§ 54.068 RATES OF SURCHARGE.
   The rate of surcharge, in addition to volumetric charges, for the following
constituents shall be as follows:
   (A)   For biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in excess of 250 milligrams per
liter: $0.203 per pound;
   (B)   For chemical oxygen demand (COD) where BOD cannot be determined in
excess of 500 milligrams per liter: $0.203 per pound;
   (C)   For suspended solids in excess of 250 milligrams per liter: $0.178 per

ordinance for the orderly and efficient development of the city.
   (B)   Land to be subdivided shall be of such a character that it can be

for serving the subdivision.
   (C)   Both existing and proposed public facilities serving the subdivision
shall be properly related and conform to the official City Comprehensive Land
Use Plan, related policies, and implementation programs including the capital
budget, official map, thoroughfare plan, zoning ordinance, and Housing and

(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.004 AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION.
   (A)   The ordinance from which this chapter is derived was enacted pursuant
to Indiana home rule and planning enabling legislation (I.C. 36-1-3-4 and 36-7-
4-700, as amended) authorizes the City Advisory Plan Commission to review and
approve or disapprove plats for subdivision throughout the city, which show
lots, blocks, or sites with or without new streets or highways. This authority
extends to the development or resubdivision of undeveloped portions of already
recorded plats.
   (B)   No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any
parcel or plat of land which was created by subdivision after the effective
date of, and not in conformity with, the provisions of these subdivision
regulations, and no excavation of land or construction of any public or private
improvements shall take place or be commenced except in conformity with the
regulations contained herein and in conformity with construction standards
adopted by the city.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.005 ENACTMENT.
   In order that land may be subdivided in accordance with these purposes and
policies, these subdivision regulations are hereby adopted.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.006 INTERPRETATION AND CONFLICT.
   (A)   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of these regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements
for the promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   Conflict with public and private provisions.
      (1)   Public provisions. The regulations are not intended to interfere
with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule, or regulation, statute, or
other provision of law. Where any provision of these regulations imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by any other provision of these
regulations or any other ordinance, rule, or regulation, or other provision of
law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall
control.
      (2)   Private provisions. These regulations are not intended to abrogate
any easement, covenant, or any other private agreement or restriction, provided
that where the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or impose
higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant, or other private
agreement or restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall govern.
Where the provisions of the easement, covenant, or private agreement or
restriction impose duties and obligations more restrictive, or higher standards
than the requirements of these regulations, or the determinations of the
Commission in approving a subdivision or in enforcing these regulations, and
such private provisions are not inconsistent with these regulations or
determinations thereunder, then such private provisions shall be operative and
supplemental to these regulations and determinations made thereunder.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.007 SAVING PROVISION.
   These regulations shall not be construed as abating any action now pending
under, or by virtue of, prior existing subdivision regulations, or as
discontinuing, abating, modifying, or altering any penalty accruing or about to
accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm, or corporation, or
as waiving any right of the city under any section or provision existing at the
time of adoption of these regulations, or as vacating or annulling any rights
obtained by any person, firm, or corporation, by lawful action of the city
except as shall be expressly provided for in these regulations.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.008 AMENDMENTS.
   For the purpose of providing for the public health, safety, and general
welfare, the city, on recommendation of the Commission, may from time to time
amend the provisions imposed by these subdivision regulations. Public hearings
on all proposed amendments shall be held by the Commission and/or the city in
the manner prescribed by law.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.009 CONDITIONS.
   Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable
conditions to land subdivision is an exercise of valid police power delegated
by the state to this city. The developer has the duty of compliance with
reasonable conditions laid down by the Commission for design, dedication,
improvement, and restrictive use of the land in order to conform to the
physical and economical development of the city and to the safety and general
welfare of the future plot owners in the subdivision and of the city at large.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.010 RESUBDIVISION OF LAND.
   (A)   Procedure for resubdivision. For any changes in a map of an approved
or recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on
such map, or area reserved thereon for public use, or any lot line, of if it
affects any map or plan legally reached prior to the adoption of any
regulations controlling subdivisions, such parcel shall be approved by the
Commission by the same procedure, rules, and regulations as for a subdivision.
   (B)   Procedure for subdivisions where future resubdivision is indicated.
Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or
more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are indications that
such lots will eventually be resubdivided into smaller building sites, the
Commission may require that such parcel of land allow for the future opening
and extension of such streets may be made a requirement of the plat.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.011 VACATION OF PLATS.
   Any recorded plat or part of any recorded plat may be vacated only in
accordance with I.C. 36-7-3, as amended in 1982, 1983, and 1986.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.012 VARIANCES.
   (A)   General. Where the Commission finds that extraordinary hardships or
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations
and/or the purposes of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by
an alternative proposal, the Commission may approve variances to these
subdivision regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public
interest secured, provided that such variances shall not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations; and further provided
the Commission shall not approve variances unless it shall make findings based
upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
      (1)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other nearby property;
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property;
      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these regulations are carried out; and
      (4)   The variance will not in any manner contravene the provisions of
the zoning ordinance, Comprehensive Plan, or official map as interpreted by the
Commission and the City Engineer.
   (B)   Conditions. In approving variances, the Commission may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements of these regulations.
   (C)   Procedures. A petition for any such variance may be submitted in
writing by the subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat is filed for
the consideration of the Commission. The petition shall state fully the grounds
for the application and all of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.

be subject to all of the appropriate requirements of this chapter.

individual or governmental unit be directed to remove a structure erected in

Commission is successful in its suit, the respondent shall pay the Commission’s
reasonable attorney fees and all costs related to the enforcement of this
chapter.

requesting an individual or governmental unit be directed, where such

(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
APPLICATION AND APPROVAL PROCEDURES
§ 150.025 GENERAL PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Discussion of requirements; predesign conference. Prior to submitting
any of the materials required by this chapter, the applicant or his or her
representative should discuss with the Administrator the nature of the land
division being proposed, so that the applicant may be instructed concerning the
classification of his or her subdivision and what regulatory procedures apply
to it and must be followed under this chapter in order to secure primary and
secondary approval. Where applicable, requirements concerning the general
layout of streets and for reservations of land, street improvements, drainage,
sewerage, fire protection, and similar matters, as well as the availability of
existing services should be discussed. The Administrator shall also advise the
applicant, where appropriate, to discuss the proposed land division with those
other officials who must eventually approve those aspects of the subdivision
plat coming within their jurisdiction. The distinction between major and minor
subdivisions and exempt divisions as defined in this chapter, shall be made by
the Administrator when the applicant submits an application for sketch plan
approval in the case of major and minor subdivisions or, in the case of exempt
divisions, provides the Administrator at a predesign conference with adequate
information to enable him or her to determine that the proposed division is an
exempt division.
   (B)   Classification of land divisions.
      (1)   All land to be divided shall be categorized into one of the three
main classes of land division indicated in this chapter’s definition of
subdivision. These classes are:
         (a)   Major subdivisions;
         (b)   Minor subdivision; and
         (c)   Exempt divisions.
      (2)   Exempt divisions are not subject to the requirements of this
chapter beyond the determination by the Commission that they meet all the
requirements for exempt divisions set forth in §
150.029. However, lots created by Exempt I divisions (except Exemption F) shall
be ten or more acres in size to be eligible as principal use building sites
(Exemption A in the definition of subdivision), unless such lots have been
created by order of a court (Exemption C). No building site for principal use
created through Exemption A shall be reduced below ten acres unless through
subdivision or by order of a court (Exemption C). For purposes of this
paragraph, a lot is “created” on the date of its recording. (See § 150.014 for
the definition of a principal use building.)
      (3)   Before any permit shall be granted for a structure to be erected on
land to be subdivided into a major or minor subdivision, the subdividing owner
or his or her subdivision agent shall apply for and secure approval of the
proposed subdivision in accordance with §
150.026 and either §§
150.027 or
150.028 as appropriate. Before any permit shall be granted for a structure to
be erected on a parcel of land to be created or altered by an exempt division,
the land divider or his or her agent shall certify to the satisfaction of the
Commission that all requirements for exemption have been met, as detailed in §
150.029, in order to exempt the land division from all other requirements of
this chapter.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.026 MAJOR AND MINOR SUBDIVISIONS; SKETCH PLAN APPLICATION.
   (A)   Application requirements. In order to begin the subdivision process,
the applicant shall file an application for review of sketch plan and
certificate with the Administrator and be entitled to a signed receipt for
same. This application shall:
      (1)   Be made on forms available at the office of the Commission and
signed by the owner;
      (2)   Include indication of all contiguous holdings of the owner
including land in the same ownership, with an indication of the portion which
is proposed to be subdivided, accompanied by an affidavit of ownership, which
shall include the dates the respective holdings of land were acquired, together
with the book and page of each conveyance to the present owner as recorded in
the County Recorder’s office. The affidavit shall advise as to the legal owner
of the property, the contract owner of the property, optionee of the property,
and the date on which the contract of sale was executed. If any corporations
are involved, the Administrator may request a complete list of all directors,
officers, and a listing of stockholders if less than ten in number;
      (3)   Be presented to the Administrator in duplicate;
      (4)   Be accompanied by a minimum of three copies of the sketch plan;
      (5)   Be accompanied by a fee of $50 plus $5 per lot in excess of four
lots;
      (6)   Include an address and telephone number of an agent located within
the territory of the Commission, who shall be authorized to receive all notices
required by this chapter; and
      (7)   Include a listing signed by the checkpoint agencies indicating that
they have received a copy of the proposed sketch plan or a certification that
it has been sent.
   (B)   Checkpoint submission.
      (1)   In order to fulfill this last application requirement, a copy of
the proposed plan shall be submitted to each of the checkpoint agencies so that
their comment may be made to the Administrator. The checkpoint agencies are:
         (a)   City Engineer;
         (b)   County Board of Health;
         (c)   City Board of Works;
         (d)   City Fire Chief;
         (e)   City Police Chief;
         (f)   Mississinewa Community School Corporation; and
         (g)   City Review Board.
      (2)   The Administrator shall request that all officials and agencies to
whom a request for review has been made submit a written report to him or her
within 15 days after receipt of the request. No response from an agency shall
be interpreted as meaning “no objection.”
   (C)   Classification of subdivision. After an application for sketch plan
approval has been submitted, and at the time of sketch plan review, the
Administrator shall classify the proposed subdivision as either major or minor
as defined in this chapter. The required procedures and approvals for major
subdivisions are described in §
150.027; corresponding information concerning the minor subdivision approval
process is provided in §
150.028.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.027 MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   General procedures for primary and secondary approval. If the
Administrator, during sketch plan review, classifies the proposed land division
as a major subdivision, the subdivider shall follow the procedures and be
subject to the processes outlined in division (H) below, and detailed in this
section. In addition to a sketch plan submitted by applicant which is reviewed
by the Administrator and checkpoint agencies, the applicant seeking approval of
a major subdivision shall submit a preliminary subdivision plat to be approved,
conditionally approved, or rejected by the Commission at a public hearing.
Subsequently the applicant shall submit for secondary approval a final
subdivision plat which must be found in compliance with the preliminary plat as
approved by the Commission at a public hearing in order to be signed and
recorded.
   (B)   Official submission dates. The deadline for submittal of a sketch plan
and application for certificate of approval shall be 61 calendar days prior to
the date of the public hearing at which the subdivider intends to have his or
her preliminary plat submission heard, and 31 calendar days prior to the
deadline for the submission of the preliminary plat. Thus, as a minimum, sketch
plan submission shall precede preliminary plat submission by no less than 31
calendar days, which in turn shall precede the public hearing at which it is
intended to be heard by no less than 30 calendar days.
   (C)   Sketch plan review process. Within 20 calendar days of the
subdivider’s sketch plan application submittal, the Administrator shall have
studied the proposal, reviewed checkpoint reports received, and met with the
subdivider to discuss pertinent aspects of the possible modifications and/or
changes that may be suggested or required by this chapter. The Administrator
shall request that a representative of each checkpoint agency wishing to be
involved in a sketch plan review be present to participate in the sketch plan
review meeting. In taking into consideration the requirements of this chapter,
particular attention shall be given to the arrangement, location, and width of
streets, their relation to the topography of the land, sewage disposal
drainage, lot size, and arrangement, the further development of adjoining lands
as yet unsubdivided, and the requirements of the official map or thoroughfare
plan, and Comprehensive Plan as adopted by the city. Subsequent to this
meeting, the Administrator shall provide the participants with a written record
of the proceedings of that meeting.
   (D)   Preliminary plat procedures for primary approval.
      (1)   Submission requirements. Following the submission, review, and
report on the sketch plan application, the subdivider may file for primary
approval of a preliminary plat. This submission shall:
         (a)   Be made on forms available at the office of the Commission and
be submitted with a fee of $5 per lot for each lot which was not included in
the sketch plan;
         (b)   Include indication of all land which the applicant proposes to
subdivide and all land immediately adjacent and across any street or railroad
right-of-way, extending 600 feet therefrom, but not more than two property
owners deep from the proposed subdivision, with the names and addresses of the
title owners as shown in the County Auditor’s files. This information may be
shown on a separate current plat map reproduction from the County Auditor’s
office showing the boundaries of the subdivision superimposed thereon;
         (c)   Be presented in duplicate to the Administrator no later than 30
calendar days prior to the regular meeting of the Commission at which it is
intended to be heard;
         (d)   Be accompanied by ten copies of the preliminary plat as
described in this chapter; and
         (e)   Generally comply with the sketch plan as reviewed.
      (2)   Placement on the Commission agenda. Subsequent to the submission
for primary approval, the Commission shall place the matter on its next regular
meeting agenda for formal action.
      (3)   Administrative review. Subsequent to placement on the agenda, and
prior to the date of the public hearing, the Administrator and other
appropriate members of the Commission shall review the proposal and prepare a
written report to the Commission and applicant indicating a recommendation with
regard to the subdivision being proposed.
      (4)   Public hearing notification and sign posting requirements. The
Commission shall hold a public hearing on the preliminary plat and notice of
such hearing shall be in one local newspaper of general circulation ten days
prior to the hearing (per I.C. 5-3-1) at the applicant’s expense. At the time
of the public hearing, the applicant shall submit an affidavit stating that the
applicant has placed posters provided by the Administrator (advising interested
parties of the hearing) at the locations designated by the Administrator on the
proposed subdivision property at least ten days prior to the public hearing and
show proof of publication that the notice of public hearing was published at
least ten days prior to the public hearing. Interested parties shall also be
notified by the applicant of the date, time, place, and purpose of the public
hearing on the subdivision at least ten days in advance of the hearing by
certified mail with return receipt requested. The applicant shall file with the
Commission at the time of the public hearing an affidavit so testifying along
with the proof of mailing by certified mail, with return receipt requested as
date mailed by the post office as to the time of mailing and with any return
receipts actually received by applicant prior to the public hearing.
      (5)   Primary approval of the preliminary plat. After the Commission has
held a hearing upon the preliminary plat, the Administrator’s report,
checkpoint recommendations, testimony, and exhibits submitted at the public
hearing, the applicant shall be advised on any required changes and/or
additions. The Commission shall, at a public hearing, grant primary approval,
or disapprove the preliminary plat. One copy of the preliminary plat shall be
returned to the applicant with the date of approval, conditional approval, or
disapproval and the reasons therefor accompanying the plat within five days of
the public hearing. Primary approval by the Commission is subject to review by
certiorari. Secondary approval of a subdivision cannot occur until a minimum of
30 days has elapsed since the granting of primary approval.
      (6)   Field trip. The Commission, at its discretion, upon hearing the
request for primary approval, may elect to continue the matter until its next
regularly scheduled public meeting, and may schedule a field trip to the site
of the proposed subdivision, accompanied by the applicant or his or her
representative, or any other person or persons, at the discretion of the
Commission.
      (7)   Effective period of primary approval. Unless extended, the primary
approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of five years
after the date of primary approval, at the end of which time, secondary
approval of the subdivision must have been obtained and certified by the
President and Secretary of the Commission. Any plats not receiving secondary
approval within the period of time set forth herein shall be null and void, and
the developer shall be required to resubmit a new application for sketch plan
review and certificate subject to all the zoning restrictions and subdivision
regulations in effect at the time of resubmission. Upon request of the
applicant, the Commission may extend the primary approval of a preliminary plat
in increments of two years beyond an expiration date without further notice and
public hearing.
   (E)   Approval of construction plans.
      (1)   Submission procedure and requirements. Following the review of the
sketch plan and prior to submission of the final plat for secondary approval,
the applicant, if he or she wishes to proceed with the subdivision, shall file
with the Administrator before starting work on any improvements three sets of
the detailed plans and specifications thereof for approval.
      (2)   Review process. The Administrator shall immediately refer these
plans to the checkpoint agencies for review. Once these agencies indicate their
approval of the construction plans or 14 working days have elapsed since their
distribution without a written response, the Administrator shall stamp the
plans approved and return one set to the applicant. In no event shall secondary
approval (of the final plat) be given prior to approval of the construction
plans.
      (3)   Installation of improvements. The installation of improvements
shall be inspected by the Administrator. Such inspections are required in all
instances regardless of whether the work is performed before or after secondary
approval. Failure to request or to procure inspection of work performed after
the date of this chapter and before secondary approval may be cause for denial
of secondary approval.
   (F)   Final plat procedure (secondary approval).
      (1)   Submission requirements. Following primary approval or conditional
primary approval of the preliminary plat and approval of the construction
plans, the applicant, if he or she wishes to proceed with the subdivision,
shall file with the Administrator a request for secondary approval of a final
plat. The applicant shall:
         (a)   Be submitted on forms available at the office of the Commission;
         (b)   Include the entire subdivision, or section thereof;
         (c)   Be accompanied by ten copies of the final subdivision plat as
described in this chapter;
         (d)   Totally comply with the chapter and the terms and conditions of
primary approval;
         (e)   Be accompanied by the performance bond, if required, in a form
satisfactory to the Commission Attorney and in an amount established by the
Commission and shall guarantee the completion of all required subdivision and
off-site public improvements; and
         (f)   Be accompanied by any restrictive covenants in a form approved
by the Commission, where proposed by the subdivider or required by the
Commission.
      (2)   Determination of conformance (secondary approval).
         (a)   In order to be recorded, a final subdivision plat shall be found
to be in conformance with the primary approval by the Commission at a public
meeting. The subdivider shall request Commission review in writing no less than
30 calendar days prior to the date of the public meeting at which he or she
intends to have his or her final plat reviewed. The Commission shall place the
matter on its next regular meeting agenda. The Administrator shall review the
proposal and submit a written report and recommendations to the Commission and
the applicant; and, at the public meeting, the Commission shall give secondary
approval or disapproval of the final plat.
         (b)   If granted secondary approval, the final plat shall be signed by
the designated officials of the Commission. If not granted secondary approval,
the subdivider shall be informed as to the insufficiency of his or her
submittal. In the event the final subdivision plat deviates from the
preliminary plat that received primary approval, the subdivision shall be
resubmitted to the Commission at a public hearing for a new primary approval.
      (3)   Sectionalizing plats.
         (a)   Prior to granting secondary approval of a major subdivision
plat, the Commission may permit the plat to be divided into two or more
sections and may impose such conditions upon the filing of the sections as it
may deem necessary to assure the orderly development of the plat. The
Commission may require that the performance bond be in such amount as will be
commensurate with the section or sections of the plat to be filed and may defer
the remaining required performance bond principal amount until the remaining
sections of the plat are offered for filing. Such sections must contain at
least 20 lots or 10% of the total number of lots contained in the approved
plat, whichever is less.
         (b)   The approval of all remaining sections not filed with the
Administrator shall automatically expire after five years from the date of
primary approval of the preliminary plat, unless the expiration date has been
extended.
   (G)   Signing and recording plat.
      (1)   Signing of plat.
         (a)   When the filing of a performance bond is required, the
designated officials of the Commission shall endorse approval on the plat by
signing the certificate only after the bond and the construction plans have
been approved, and all the conditions of the primary approval have been
satisfied.
         (b)   When installation of improvements is required, the designated
officials of the Commission shall endorse secondary approval of the plat by
signing the certificate after all conditions of the primary approval have been
satisfied, all improvements satisfactorily completed and accepted for public
maintenance (when required), “as built” construction plans submitted (as
required by § 150.075(B)(5) and a maintenance bond provided (as required by §
150.077(B). Written evidence shall be furnished that the required public
facilities have been installed in a manner satisfactory to the City Board of
Works as shown by a certificate signed by the City Board of Works.
      (2)   Assurance to subdivider. If the subdivider elects to install all
improvements before he or she applies for secondary approval and it is shown
that the conditions of the chapter have been met, and if the final plat
completely conforms to the primary approval, the Commission shall have no other
recourse than to grant secondary approval.
      (3)   Recording of final plat.
         (a)   The designated officials shall sign the certificate which shall
be part of the tracing cloth or reproducible Mylar of the subdivision plat,
plus two Mylar prints of the subdivision plat. The Mylar prints shall be
returned to the subdivider and his or her engineer or surveyor.

150.999
§ 150.028 MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   General procedures for primary approval and secondary approval. If the
Administrator, upon examination of the sketch plan application, classifies the
proposed land division as a minor subdivision, the subdivider shall follow the
procedures and be subject to the process outlined in division (I) below, and
detailed in this section. In addition to a sketch plan for a minor subdivision
submitted by applicant which is reviewed by the Administrator and checkpoint
agencies, the Commission shall approve, conditionally approve, or reject the
sketch plan at a public hearing. Subsequently, the applicant shall submit for
secondary approval a final subdivision plat which must be found in compliance
with the sketch plan as approved by the Commission at public hearing in order
to be signed and recorded.
   (B)   Official submission date and placement on the agenda. An application
for sketch plan approval shall be submitted no less than 30 calendar days prior
to a regularly scheduled public meeting of the Commission at which the proposal
is intended to be acted upon. The Administrator shall place such application on
the agenda of the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Commission to occur
30 days after the date on which a complete application is submitted.
   (C)   Sketch plan review process. Within 20 calendar days of the
subdivider’s sketch plan application submittal, the Administrator shall have
studied the proposal, reviewed checkpoint reports received, and met with the
subdivider to discuss pertinent aspects of the proposed subdivision and
possible modifications and/or changes that may be suggested or required by this
chapter. The Administrator shall request that a representative of each
checkpoint agency that wishes to be involved in a sketch plan review be present
to participate in the sketch plan review meeting. In taking into consideration
the requirements of this chapter, particular attention shall be given to sewage
disposal, drainage, lot size, and arrangement, the further development of
adjoining lands as yet unsubdivided, and the requirements of the official map
or thoroughfare plan and Comprehensive Plan as adopted by the city. Subsequent
to the meeting, the Administrator shall provide the participants with a written
record of the proceedings of that meeting.
   (D)   Administrative review. Subsequent to placement of the agenda, and
prior to the date of public hearing, the Administrator and other appropriate
members of the Commission shall review the proposal and prepare a written
report to the Commission and applicant indicating a recommendation with regard
to the subdivision being proposed.
   (E)   Public hearing notification and sign posting requirements. The
Commission shall hold a public hearing on the sketch plan, and notice of such
hearing shall be in one local newspaper of general circulation ten days prior
to the hearing (per I.C. 5-3-1) at the applicant’s expense. At the time of the
public hearing, the applicant shall submit an affidavit stating that the
applicant has placed posters provided by the Administrator (advising interested
parties of the hearing) at the locations designated by him or her on the
proposed subdivision property at least ten days prior to the public hearing and
show proof of publication that the notice of public hearing was published at
least ten days prior to the public hearing. Interested parties shall be
notified by the applicant of the date, time, place, and purpose of the public
hearing on the subdivision at least ten days in advance of the hearing by
certified mail with return receipt requested. The applicant shall file with the
Commission at the time of the public hearing an affidavit so testifying, along
with the proof of mailing by certified mail with return receipt requested as
date mailed by the post office as to the time of mailing and with any return
receipts actually received by applicant prior to the public hearing.
   (F)   Primary approval of the sketch plan. After the Commission has, at a
regularly scheduled hearing, examined the sketch plan, Administrator’s report,
checkpoint recommendations, testimony, and exhibits submitted, the Commission
shall, at a regularly scheduled hearing, approve, conditionally approve, or
disapprove the sketch plan. One copy of the sketch plan shall be returned to
the applicant with the date of approval, conditional approval, or disapproval
and the reasons therefor accompanying the sketch plan within five days after
the public hearing. Primary approval by the Commission is subject to review by
certiorari. Secondary approval of a subdivision cannot occur until the minimum
of 30 days has elapsed since the granting of primary approval or conditional
approval or conditional primary approval.
   (G)   Effective period of primary approval. Unless extended, the primary
approval of a minor subdivision sketch plan shall be effective for a period of
two years after the date of primary approval, at the end of which time,
secondary approval of the subdivision must have been obtained and certified by
the President and Secretary of the Commission. Any plats not receiving
secondary approval within the period of time set forth herein shall be null and
void, and the developer shall be required to resubmit a new application for
sketch plan review and certificate, subject to all the zoning restrictions and
subdivision regulations in effect at the time of resubmission. Upon written
application of the applicant, the Commission may extend the primary approval of
a minor sketch plan in increments of two years beyond an expiration date
without further notice and public hearing.
   (H)   Final subdivision plat procedure for secondary approval.
      (1)   Application requirements.
         (a)   Following approval or conditional approval of the sketch plan,
the applicant, if he or she wishes to proceed with the subdivision, shall file
with the Administrator an application for secondary approval of a subdivision
plat. The application shall:
            1.   Be submitted on forms available at the office of the
Commission;
            2.   Include the entire subdivision or section thereof;
            3.   Be accompanied by ten copies of the final subdivision plat as
described in this chapter;
            4.   Totally comply with this chapter and the terms and conditions
of primary approval; and
            5.   Be accompanied by the performance bond, if required, in a form
satisfactory to the Commission Attorney and in an amount established by the
Commission and shall guarantee the completion of all required subdivision and
off-site public improvements.
         (b)   When installation of improvements is required, the designated
officials of the Commission shall endorse secondary approval on the plat by
signing the certificate after all conditions of the primary approval have been
satisfied, all improvements satisfactorily completed and accepted for public
maintenance (when required), “as built” construction plans submitted (as
required by § 150.075(B)(5), and a maintenance bond provided (as required by §
150.077(B). Written evidence shall be furnished that the required public
facilities have been installed in a manner satisfactory to the City Board of
Works as shown by a certificate signed by the City Board of Works.
      (2)   Assurance to subdivider. If the subdivider elects to install all
improvements before he or she applies for secondary approval and it is shown
that the conditions of the chapter have been met, and if the final plat
completely conforms to the primary approval, the Commission shall have no other
recourse than to grant secondary approval.
      (3)   Recording of plat.
         (a)   The designated officials shall sign the certificate granting
secondary approval which shall be part of the tracing cloth or reproducible
Mylar of the subdivision plat, plus two Mylar prints of the subdivision plat.
The Mylar prints shall be returned to the applicant and his or her engineer or
surveyor.
         (b)   The subdivider in the presence of the Administrator or his or
her designee shall record the plat with the County Recorder within 30 days of
the date of signature. Failure of the subdivider to file the plat as herein
provided within 30 days shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
   (I)   Approval process for minor subdivisions.

(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992) Penalty, see §
150.999
§ 150.029 EXEMPT DIVISIONS.
   (A)   General provisions for Exempt I divisions. In order for a land
division to be considered an Exempt I division, the information prescribed for
the applicable type of subdivision under §
150.094 as exhibits to a petition for a certificate of exclusion for Exempt I
division shall be submitted to the Administrator. The Administrator shall place
the matter on the Commission’s next regular meeting agenda. At such public
meeting, the Commission shall determine whether the proposed land division
meets the provisions of the definitions under §§
150.014 and
150.025 for this classification. If the Commission determines that the proposed
land division is an Exempt I division, the Commission shall issue a certificate
of exclusion for an Exempt I division signed by the designated officials of the
Commission. Both the subdivider and the Commission shall hold copies of the
certificate of exclusion for an Exempt I division. When the parcel so exempted
by this certificate of exclusion is conveyed to another party, the original
certificate of exclusion shall be filed and recorded with the County Auditor
and County Recorder, respectively, along with the conveyance of the parcel.
   (B)   General procedure for Exempt II divisions. In order for a land
division to be considered an Exempt II division, the information required under
§
150.095 in compliance with the conditions under division (C) below as exhibits
to a petition for a certificate of exclusion for Exempt II division shall be
submitted to the Administrator. The Administrator shall place the matter on the
Commission’s next regular meeting agenda. At such public meeting, the
Commissioner shall determine whether the proposed land division meets the
provisions of the definitions under §§
150.014 and
150.025 for this classification and complies with the conditions under division
(C) below. If the Commission determines that the proposed land division is an
Exempt II division, the Commission shall issue a certificate of exclusion for
an Exempt II division signed by the designated officials of the Commission.
Both the subdivider and the Commission shall hold copies of the certificate of
exclusion for an Exempt II division. When the parcel so exempted by this
certificate of exclusion is conveyed to another party the original certificate
of exclusion shall be filed and recorded with the County Auditor and County
Recorder, respectively, along with the conveyance(s) of the parcel(s).
   (C)   Necessary conditions for Exempt II divisions. In addition to
definitional requirements of §§
150.014 and
150.025, a land division qualifying as an Exempt II division shall be shown as
meeting the following conditions.
      (1)   Sewer service. If a parcel created by such an exempt division does
not have sanitary sewer service available to it, the tract shall contain within
its boundaries sufficient soil of a kind defined by Indiana State Board of
Health Bulletin HSE 25-R or its successor to allow for the proper installation
of an on-site septic sewage disposal system.
      (2)   Dedication of right-of-way. If a parcel created by such an exempt
division has frontage on a public road, the land divider shall dedicate to the
public real property of a width sufficient to meet one-half of the required
right-of-way for that specific public road as indicated on the city
thoroughfare plan or the official map and a length along that public road equal
to the length of that parcel along that roadway.
      (3)   Depth of parcel. If a parcel created by such an exempt division has
frontage on a public road, the depth of that parcel shall not be greater than
twice the length of that frontage, such depth being measured from the front lot
line to the rear line of the parcel.
      (4)   Private roadways. If a parcel created by such an exempt division
requires a private roadway because such parcel lacks frontage on a public road,
such roadway shall either be fully constructed in accordance with the following
minimum standards prior to the issuance of a building permit or be adequately
assured to the permit issuer’s satisfaction that it will be constructed to the
following minimum standards:
         (a)   Minimum width of 16 feet; and
         (b)   Minimum depth of eight inches of Type P or O made stone or
gravel. Such private roadway need only provide access as far as the parcel’s
property line and is not intended to include any individual drive within the
parcel.
      (5)   Certificate of Exempt II divisions. As the conditions in division
(B) above apply, the land divider shall provide to the Administrator:
         (a)   Written evidence that the County Board of Health has been
satisfied by a duly authorized representative of a qualified soil testing
service as to the presence within the parcel of sufficient soil of a kind
defined by Indiana State Board of Health Bulletin HSE 25-R or its successor to
allow for the proper installation of an on-site septic sewage disposal system;
         (b)   Official documentation indicating the dedication of right-of-way
to the city;
         (c)   A metes and bounds description of the parcel being created
indicating that its depth is no more than twice the frontage; and
         (d)   A notarized affidavit assuring construction of a private roadway
to the standards previously indicated, prior to the issuance of a building
permit for that parcel.
      (6)   Dissolution.
         (a)   A recorded Exempt II division or portion thereof may be
dissolved by the property owner or owners if, in doing so, no provision of this
or any other ordinance, rule, regulation, statute, or provision of law is
violated. To do so, ten copies of a statement dissolving the Exempt II division
(or any part of it) shall be submitted to the Administrator for review of
compliance with the above-stated ordinances, rules, and the like. This
statement, signed by all legal owners, contract buyers, and optionees of the
property and notarized, shall contain the Exempt II division number assigned by
the Administrator and legal descriptions of the parcels involved. The
Administrator shall place the matter on the Commission’s next regular meeting
agenda.
         (b)   Upon a finding of compliance at such public meeting, the
Commission, by the designated officials of the Commission, shall sign all ten
statements. Once signed, the approved dissolution is eligible to be recorded.
         (c)   The land divider, in the presence of the Administrator or his or
her designee, shall file and record the approved dissolution with the County
Auditor and County Recorder, respectively, within 30 days of the date of
signature. Failure of the land divider to so file and record shall
automatically invalidate the approval, rendering the approval null and void and
requiring a complete resubmittal for approval.
         (d)   Upon recording the dissolution statement, the landowner is once
more eligible to pursue the full Exempt II division process as per this
section. The land involved, for purposes of land division, is restored to its
pre-exempt division status.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPROVEMENTS, RESERVATIONS, AND DESIGN
§ 150.040 GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Conformance to applicable rules and regulations. In addition to the
requirements established herein, all subdivision plats shall comply with the
following laws, rules, and regulations:
      (1)   All applicable state and local statutory provisions;
      (2)   The city zoning ordinance, Building and Housing Codes, and all
other applicable laws and ordinances of the appropriate jurisdictions;
      (3)   The Comprehensive Plan, official map, or thoroughfare plan, public
utilities plan, and capital improvements program of the city, including all
streets, drainage systems, and parks shown on the official map or Comprehensive
Plan as adopted;
      (4)   The special requirements of these regulations and any rules of the
Health Department and/or appropriate state agencies;
      (5)   The rules and regulations of the State Department of Highways if
the subdivision or any lot contained therein abut a state highway or state
frontage road;
      (6)   The highways and drainage standards and regulations adopted by the
City Engineer and all boards, commissions, agencies, and officials of the city;
and
      (7)   All pertinent standards contained within still valid planning
guides published by the Plan Commission.
   (B)   Withholding of plat approval. Plat approval may be withheld if a
subdivision is not in conformity with the guides and requirements in division
(A) above or with the policies and purposes of these regulations established in
§
150.004.
   (C)   Self-imposed restrictions. If the owner places restrictions on any of
the land contained in the subdivision greater than those required by the zoning
ordinance or these regulations, such restrictions or reference thereto may be
required to be indicated on the subdivision plat, or the Commission may require
that restrictive covenants be recorded with the County Recorder in a form to be
approved by the Commission Attorney.
   (D)   Plats straddling municipal boundaries. Whenever access to the
subdivision is required across land in another jurisdiction, the Commission may
request assurance from the City Attorney that such access is legally
established, and from the City Engineer that the access road is adequately
improved, or that a performance bond has been duly executed and is sufficient
in the amount to assure the construction of the access road. Lot lines shall be
laid out so as not to cross municipal boundary lines.
   (E)   Boundary improvements.
      (1)   The subdivider shall have placed, under the supervision of a
registered land surveyor, concrete monuments four inches square or four inches
in diameter and 40 inches long with an iron pipe cast in the center, at each
corner or angle of the ultimate outside boundary. They shall be set following
grading of each phase of the subdivision.
      (2)   The subdivider shall have placed, under the supervision of a
registered land surveyor, pipes or steel rods, three-quarters of an inch in
diameter by 30 inches in length at the corners of each lot. They shall be set
prior to the issuance of any building permit.
   (F)   Character of land. Land which the Commission finds to be unsuitable
for subdivision or development because of flooding, improper drainage, steep
slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or topography, utility
easements, or other features which might reasonably be harmful to the safety,
health, and general welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the
subdivision and/or its surrounding areas, shall not be subdivided or developed
unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer and approved by the
Commission, upon recommendation of the City Engineer, to solve the problems
created by the unsuitable land conditions. Such land shall be set aside for
such uses permitted by the zoning ordinance as shall not involve any such
danger.
   (G)   Subdivision name. The proposed name of the subdivision shall not
duplicate, or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other
subdivision in the area covered by these regulations. The Commission shall have
final authority to designate the name of the subdivision which shall be
determined at the time of primary approval.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.041 LOT IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Lot arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulties for reasons of topography or other conditions in
securing building permits to build on each of the created lots in compliance
with the zoning ordinance and health regulations and in providing driveway
access to buildings on such lots from the appropriate approved street.
   (B)   Lot dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards
in the zoning ordinance. Where lots are more than double the minimum required
area for the zoning district, the Commission may require that such lots be
arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets
where they would be necessary to serve all such potential lots in compliance
with the zoning ordinance and these regulations. In general, side lot lines
shall be at right angles to the street lines (or radial to curving street
lines) unless a variation from this rule will give a better street or lot plan.
Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for erection of
buildings, observing the minimum front yard setback from both streets. Depth
and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial, or
industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for all of the off-street
parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and development
contemplated, as established in the zoning ordinance.
   (C)   Double frontage lots and access to lots.
      (1)   Double frontage lots. Double frontage and reversed frontage lots
shall be avoided except where necessary to provide for the separation of
residential development from the traffic on bordering arterials or to overcome
specific disadvantages of topography and orientation affecting the subdivided
lots.
      (2)   Access from primary and secondary arterials. Lots shall not, in
general, derive access from a primary or secondary arterial street. Where
driveway access from a primary or secondary arterial street may be the only
possible access for several adjoining lots, the Commission may require that
such lots be served by a combined access drive in order to limit possible
traffic hazards from multiple access to such streets. Where possible, driveways
should be designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back into
traffic on primary or secondary arterials.
   (D)   Soil preservation, grading, and seeding.
      (1)   Soil preservation and final grading. No certificates of occupancy
shall be issued until final grading has been completed in accordance with the
approved construction plans and the lot precovered with topsoil having an
average depth of at least six inches, which shall contain no particles over two
inches in diameter over the entire area of the lot, except that portion covered
by buildings or included in streets, or where the grade has not been changed or
natural vegetation seriously damaged. Topsoil shall not be removed from
residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to provide
at least six inches of cover between the sidewalks and curbs, and shall be
stabilized by seeding or planting.
      (2)   Lot drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive
drainage away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be
coordinated with the general storm water drainage pattern for the area.
Drainage shall be designated so as to avoid the accumulation of storm water on
any one or more lots from adjacent lots. It shall be the responsibility of the
lot owner to maintain the lot grade, as it applies to drainage, as provided for
in the approved construction plans.
      (3)   Lawn-grass seed and sod. Lawn-grass seed shall be sown at not less
than four pounds to each 1,000 square feet of land area. The seed shall be sown
between March 15 and September 30. The seed shall consist of a minimum of 10%
rye grass by weight and a minimum of 90% of permanent bluegrass and/or fescue
grass by weight. All seed shall have been tested for germination within one
year of the date of seeding, and the date of testing shall be on the label
containing the seed analysis. All lots shall be seeded from the roadside edge
of the unpaved right-of-way back to a distance of 25 feet behind the principal
residence on the lot. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until
respreading of soil and seeding of lawn has been completed; except that between
October 15 and March 15 and between May 15 and August 15, the applicant shall
submit an agreement in writing signed by the developer and property owner, with
a copy to the building permit official, that respreading of soil and seeding of
the lawn will be done during the immediately following planting season as set
forth above in this section, and leave a cash escrow for performance in such
amount as shall be determined by the building permit official. Sod may be used
to comply with any requirement of seeding set forth herein.
   (E)   Debris and waste. No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones,
soil, junk, rubbish, or other waste material of any kind shall be buried in any
land, or left or deposited on any lot or street at the time of occupancy within
a subdivision, nor shall any be left or deposited in any area of the
subdivision at the time of expiration of the performance bond or dedication of
public improvements, whichever is sooner.
   (F)   Fencing. Each subdivider and/or developer shall be required to furnish
and install fences wherever the Commission determines that a hazardous
condition may exist. The fences shall be constructed according to standards
established by the City Engineer and shall be noted as to height and material
on the final plat. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until said fence
improvements have been duly installed.
   (G)   Water bodies and watercourses. If a tract being subdivided contains a
water body, or portion thereof, lot lines shall be drawn as to distribute the
entire ownership of the water body among the fees of adjacent lots. The
Commission may approve an alternative allocation of interests whereby the
ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body is so
placed that it will not become a local government responsibility. No part of
the minimum area of a lot required under the zoning ordinance may be satisfied
by land which is underwater. Where a watercourse separates the buildable area
of a lot from the street from which it has access, provisions shall be made for
installation of a culvert or other structure of a design approved by the City
Engineer.
   (H)   Performance bond to include lot improvement. The performance bond
shall include an amount to guarantee completion of all requirements contained
in this section, including, but not limited to, soil preservation, final
grading, lot drainage, lawn-grass seeding, removal of debris and waste,
fencing, and all other lot improvements required by the Commission. Whether or
not a certificate of occupancy has been issued, at the expiration of the
performance bond, the city may enforce the provisions of the bond where
compliance with the provisions of this section or any other applicable law,
ordinance, or regulation has not occurred.
   (I)   Lot and frontage examples.

(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.042 DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS.
   (A)   General requirements. The Commission shall not recommend for approval
any subdivision plat which does not make adequate provision for storm or flood
water runoff does not make adequate provision for storm or flood water runoff
channels or basins. The storm water drainage system shall be separate and
independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where required, shall
be designed by the Rational Method, or other methods as approved by the
Commission and the City Engineer, and a copy of the design computations shall
be submitted along with the plans. (The Rational Method is described in Chapter
Three of the County Storm Drainage Manual by Christopher B. Burke, Project for
Indiana Counties and Cities, School of Civil Engineering, Purdue University,
West Lafayette, May 1981, hereinafter referred to as Drainage Manual.) Inlets
shall be provided so that surface water is not carried across or around any
intersection, nor for a distance of more than 600 feet in the gutter or when
the encroachment of storm water into the street disrupts traffic (Drainage
Manual, p. 5-27). When calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded
at a point, no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and
catch basins or inlets shall be used to intercept flow at that point. Surface
water drainage patterns shall be shown for each and every lot and block.
   (B)   Nature of storm facilities.
      (1)   Location. The applicant may be required by the Commission to carry
away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist, either
previously to, or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage facilities
shall be located in the street right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual,
unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be constructed in
accordance with the city’s construction standards and specifications.
      (2)   Accessibility to public storm sewers.
         (a)   Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall
install storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable
distance, adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm water,
subject to the specifications of the City Engineer. However, in subdivisions
containing lots of less than 15,000 square feet in area and in business and
industrial districts, underground storm sewer systems shall be constructed
throughout the subdivision and be conducted to an approved outfall. Inspection
of facilities shall be conducted by the City Engineer.
         (b)   If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided
eventually, as determined by the City Engineer and the Commission, the
developer shall make arrangements for future storm water disposal by the public
utility system at the time the plat receives final approval. Cost provision(s)
for such connection(s) shall be incorporated by inclusion in the amount of the
performance bond or equivalent required for the subdivision plat.
      (3)   Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert or other
drainage facility shall, in each case, be large enough to accommodate potential
runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
subdivision. The City Engineer shall determine the necessary size of the
facility, based on the provisions of the required construction standards and
specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed development
permitted by the zoning ordinance.
      (4)   Effect on downstream drainage areas. The City Engineer shall
determine the effect of each proposed subdivision on existing drainage
facilities outside the area of the subdivision. County and city drainage
studies, together with such other studies as may be available and appropriate,
shall serve as a guide to needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that the
additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload
an existing downstream drainage facility, the Commission may withhold secondary
approval of the subdivision until provision (such as a storage facility) has
been made for the improvement of said potential condition in such sum as the
Commission shall determine. No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate
drainage from it will be provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or
facility.
      (5)   Areas of poor drainage. Areas which are not in the floodplain but
contain soils which are subject to flooding may be approved for subdivision by
the Commission, provided that the subdivider fills the affected areas of said
subdivision to an elevation sufficient to place building sites and streets two
feet above ponding levels.
      (6)   Areas of high seasonal water tables. In areas characterized by
soils having a high seasonal water table as determined by the County Soil and
Water Conservation District, lots shall be limited to a slab type construction
unless the Commission determines that appropriate engineering techniques will
be applied to alleviate the subsurface problem.
      (7)   Floodway areas. If a subdivision of land is proposed within the
floodplain, floodways shall be preserved and not diminished in capacity by
filing or obstruction, except as approved by the Natural Resources Commission
in writing. No residential building site may be located within the floodway.
      (8)   Floodway fringe areas. Where a subdivision is proposed within an
area of the floodplain designated as a floodway fringe, the Commission may
approve such subdivision provided that: all streets are elevated sufficiently
to be above the regulatory flood elevation; all lots for residential usage have
a flood protection grade two feet above the regulatory flood elevation; where
provided, water and sanitary sewer facilities are constructed to eliminate
contamination of or by, flood water; and approval to fill the area from the
Natural Resource Commission has been obtained in writing. Lands below the
regulatory flood elevation shall not be used for computing the area requirement
for any lot.
      (9)   Floodplain areas.
         (a)   General. Where a subdivision is proposed within an area of the
floodplain for which floodway and floodway fringe designations have not been
made, the Commission shall not approve such a subdivision unless all streets
are raised sufficiently to be above the regulatory flood elevation; all lots
for residential usage have a flood protection grade of two feet above the
regulatory flood elevation; where provided, public water and sanitary sewer
facilities are constructed to eliminate contamination of or by flood water;
and, filling to achieve the above will not raise the level of the regulatory
flood elevation more than one-tenth of one foot for that reach of the stream.
All filling in the floodplain must be approved in writing by the state’s
Natural Resources Commission. Lands below the regulatory flood elevation shall
not be used for computing the area requirement for any lot.
         (b)   Subdivisions of floodplain.

      (10)   Recording of plats in the floodplain and floodway fringe. All
final plats having within their boundaries areas whose elevation is below that
of the regulatory flood elevation shall show and label the regulatory flood
boundary and elevation, as of the date the final plat is drawn, on the final
plat for recording.
   (C)   Dedication of drainage easements.
      (1)   General requirements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a
drainage course, drainageway channel, or stream, a storm water easement or
drainage right-of-way shall be provided, granted, or dedicated to the city
conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of such width
and construction or both as will be adequate for the purpose of both drainage
and maintenance of the right-of-way. Wherever possible, it is desirable that
the drainage be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and
adequate width for maximum potential volume of flow.
      (2)   Drainage easements.
         (a)   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within street rights-of-way,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for such drainage
facilities shall be provided across property outside the right-of-way lines and
with satisfactory access to the street. Easements shall be indicated on the
plat. Drainage easements shall be carried from the street to a natural
watercourse or to other drainage facilities.
         (b)   The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or
conservation, easement land on both sides of existing watercourses of a width
to be determined by the Commission and, in the case of legal drains, the County
Drainage Board.
         (c)   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the plat.
         (d)   Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as
drainageways. Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be
included in the computations for determining the number of lots allowable under
average density procedures nor for computing the area requirement for any
individual lot.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.043 WATER FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements.
      (1)   The applicant shall take all actions necessary to extend or create
a water-supply district for the purpose of providing a water-supply system
capable of providing for domestic water use and fire protection.
      (2)   Where a public water main is accessible, the subdivider shall
install adequate water facilities (including fire hydrants) conforming to the
requirements and specifications of the state or local authorities. All water
mains shall be least six inches in diameter.
      (3)   Water main extensions shall be approved by the officially
designated agency of the state or city.
      (4)   To facilitate the above, the location of all fire hydrants, water
supply improvements, and the boundary lines of proposed districts indicating
all improvements proposed to be served, shall be shown on the preliminary plat,
and the cost of installing same shall be included in the performance bond to be
furnished by the subdivider.
      (5)   The design of all water facilities shall conform to or exceed the
standards described in the latest edition of Recommended Standards for Water
Works as published by Health Education Service, Inc., Albany, New York.
   (B)   Individual wells and central water systems.
      (1)   In low-intensity zoning districts, if a public water system is not
available, at the discretion of the Commission, individual wells may be used or
a central water system provided in such a manner that an adequate supply of
potable water will be available to every lot in the subdivision. Water sample
test results shall be submitted to the Health Department for its approval, and
individual wells and central water systems shall be approved by the appropriate
health authorities. These approvals shall be submitted to the Commission.
      (2)   If the Commission requires that a connection to a public water main
eventually provided as a condition for approval of an individual well or
central water system, the applicant shall make arrangements for future water
service at the time the plat receives secondary approval. Performance or cash
bonds may be required to ensure compliance.
   (C)   Fire hydrants. Hydrants should be provided at each street intersection
and at intermediate points between intersections as recommended by the State
Insurance Services Office and the local Fire Department. Generally, hydrant
spacing may range from 350 to 600 feet depending on the nature of the area
being served as determined by the City Engineer.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.044 SEWERAGE FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements. The subdivider shall install sanitary sewer
facilities in a manner prescribed by the city construction standards and
specifications. All plans shall be designed in accordance with the rules,
regulations, and standards of the City Engineer, Health Department, and other
appropriate state and federal agencies. In addition, the design shall meet or
exceed the minimum standards described in the latest edition of Recommended
Standards for Sewage Works as published by the Health Education Service,
Albany, New York, and plans shall be approved by all state and federal agencies
where required by those agencies.
   (B)   Sanitary sewerage system requirements. Where provided, sanitary
sewerage facilities shall connect with public sanitary sewerage systems, and
shall be installed to serve each lot to grades and sizes required by approving
officials and agencies. Sanitary sewerage facilities (including the
installation of laterals in the right-of-way) shall be subject to the
specifications, rules, regulations, and guidelines of the Health Officer,
participating jurisdiction, and appropriate state agency.
   (C)   Individual disposal system requirements. If public sewer facilities
are not available and individual disposal systems are proposed, minimum lot
areas shall conform to the requirements of the zoning ordinance and any
ordinance of any participating jurisdiction (where applicable) establishing lot
areas for individual sewerage disposal systems.
   (D)   Selected design criteria.
      (1)   Alignment. All sewers shall be laid with a straight alignment
between manholes, unless otherwise directed or approved by the City Engineer.
      (2)   Manhole location. Manholes shall be installed at the end of each
line, and at distances not greater than 400 feet for sewers 18 inches in
diameter and larger.
      (3)   Manholes. The difference in elevation between any incoming sewer
and the manhole invert shall not exceed 12 inches where required to match
crowns. The use of drop manholes requires approval by the City Engineer. The
minimum inside diameter of the manholes shall conform to those specified by the
City Engineer. Inside drop manholes will require special consideration;
however, in no case shall the minimum clear distance be less than that
indicated herein. The relationships between intersection sewer lines shall meet
the standards required by the City Engineer. (See division (D)(1) above.)
      (4)   Sewerage locations. Sanitary sewers shall be located within street
or alley rights-of-way unless topography dictates otherwise. When located in
easements on private property, access shall be provided to all manholes. Where
sewer lines in private easements cross public street or alley rights-of-way, a
manhole shall be provided in such rights-of-way where possible. Imposed loading
shall be considered at all manhole locations. Not less than six feet of cover
shall be provided over the top of pipe in street and alley rights-of-way or
three feet in all other areas.
      (5)   Cleanouts. Cleanouts will not be permitted.
      (6)   Water supply interconnections. There shall be no physical
connection between a public or private potable water supply system and a sewer
which will permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable
water system. Sewers shall be kept removed from water supply wells or other
water supply sources and structures.
      (7)   Relation of sewers to water mains. A minimum horizontal distance of
ten feet shall be maintained between parallel water and sewer lines. At points
where sewers cross water mains, the sewer shall be constructed of cast iron
pipe or encased in concrete for a distance of ten feet in each direction from
the crossing, measured perpendicular to the water line. This will not be
required when the water line is at least two feet above the sewer line.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.045 SIDEWALKS.
   (A)   Required improvements.
      (1)   Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated, unpaved portions
of the rights-of-way of all streets as follows.
 
Required Sidewalks in Urban Cross-Section
Street Type                                               Standard Width
All residential: place, local street, collecter, arterial Four feet
Arterial                                                  Six feet
Nonresidential: local street, collector                   Four feet
 
      (2)   Concrete curbs are required for all streets where sidewalks are
required by these regulations or required at the discretion of the Commission.
      (3)   A grassed or landscaped median strip at least two feet wide shall
separate all sidewalks from adjacent curbs. The median strip shall be improved
according to §
150.041(B).
   (B)   Pedestrian accesses. In order to facilitate pedestrian access from the
street to schools, parks, playgrounds, or other nearby streets, the Commission
may require perpetual unobstructed easements at least 20 feet in width. Such
easements shall be indicated on both the preliminary and final plats.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.046 UTILITIES.
   (A)   Location. All utility lines, including, but not limited to, gas,
electric power, telephone, and CATV cables shall be located underground
throughout the subdivision. Wherever existing lines are located above ground,
except on public roads and rights-of-way, they shall be removed and placed
underground. All utility lines and other facilities existing and proposed
throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the preliminary plat or sketch
plan in the case of a minor subdivision. Underground service connections to the
street property line of each platted lot shall be installed at the subdivider’s
expense. At the discretion of the Commission, the requirement for service
connections to each lot may be waived in the case of adjoining lots to be
retained in single ownership intended to be developed for the same primary use.
   (B)   Easements.
      (1)   Easements centered on rear lot lines shall be provided for
utilities (private and municipal). Such easements shall be at least ten feet
wide. Proper coordination shall be established between the subdivider and the
applicable utility companies for the coordination of utility easements with
those established in adjoining properties.
      (2)   Where topographical or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of utilities within the rear lot lines, perpetual
unobserved easements at least ten feet in width shall be provided along side
lot lines with satisfactory access to the road or rear lot lines. All easements
shall be indicated on preliminary and final plats.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.047 PUBLIC USES.
   (A)   Parks, playgrounds, and recreation areas.
      (1)   Recreation standards. The Commission shall require that land be
reserved for parks and playgrounds or other recreational purposes in locations
designated on the Comprehensive Plan or otherwise where such reservations would
be appropriate. Each reservation shall be of suitable size, dimension,
topography, and general character and shall have adequate road access for the
particular purposes envisioned by the Commission. The area shall be shown and
marked on the plat: “reserved for park and/or recreational purposes.” When
recreation areas are required, the Commission shall determine the number of
acres to be reserved from the following table, which has been prepared on the
basis of providing three acres of recreation area for every 100 dwelling units.
The Commission may refer such proposed reservations to the local government
official or agency in charge of parks and recreation for recommendation. If
approved by such official or agency, the developer shall dedicate all such
recreation areas to the local government as a condition of secondary approval.
         (a)   Recreation requirements are as follows.
Recreation Requirements
Single-Family Lots    Percentage of Total Land in Subdivision to be Reserved
Size of Lot (Sq. ft.) for Recreation Purposes
Recreation Requirements
Single-Family Lots    Percentage of Total Land in Subdivision to be Reserved
Size of Lot (Sq. ft.) for Recreation Purposes
80,000 and greater    1.5%
50,000                2.5%
40,000                3%
35,000                3.5%
25,000                5%
15,000                8%
 
         (b)   In general, land reserved for recreation purposes shall have an
area of at least four acres. When the Commission may require that the
recreation area be located at a suitable place on the edge of the subdivision
so that additional land may be added at such time as the adjacent land is
subdivided. In no case shall an area of less than two acres be reserved for
recreational purposes where it is impractical or impossible to secure
additional lands in order to increase its area. When recreational land in any
subdivision is not reserved, or the land reserved is less than the percentage
indicated in division (A)(1)(a) above, the provisions of division (A)(4) below
shall be applicable.
      (2)   Recreation sites. Land to be reserved for recreation purposes shall
be of a character and location suitable for use as playground, play field, or
other active recreation purposes and shall be relatively level and dry. It
shall be improved by the developer to the standards required by the Commission,
and the cost of the improvements shall be included in the amount of the
performance bond. Passive recreation areas along stream valleys may be accepted
by the Commission as part of the required area if adequate flat land is also
provided for space-consuming recreation activities. A recreation site shall
have a total frontage on one or more streets of at least 200 feet except for
stream-valley and other linear passive recreation areas which shall at no point
be narrower than 50 feet. The Commission may refer any subdivision intended to
contain a dedicated park to the local government official, department, or
agency in charge of parks and recreation for a recommendation. All land to be
reserved for dedication to the city for park purposes shall have the prior
approval of the city and shall be shown as a plat as “reserved for park or
recreation purposes.”
      (3)   Applicability to land using average density provisions. Any
subdivision plat in which the principal of flexible zoning has been used shall
not be exempt from the provisions of this section except as to any portion of
the land area which is actually dedicated to the city for park and recreation
purposes. If no additional area, other than the area to be reserved through
averaging, is required by the Commissions, the full fee shall be paid as
required in division (A)(4) below. If further land is required for reservation,
apart from the reserved by averaging, credit shall be given as provided by
division (A)(4) below.
      (4)   Other recreation reservations. The provisions of this section are
minimum standards. None of the preceding sections of this chapter shall be
construed as prohibiting a developer from reserving other land for recreation
purposes in addition to the requirements of this section.
   (B)   Other public uses.
      (1)   Plat to provide for public uses. Whenever a tract to be subdivided
includes a school, recreation areas, (in excess of the requirements of division
(A) above), or other public uses as indicated on the Comprehensive Plan or any
portion thereof, such space shall be suitably incorporated by the applicant
into his or her sketch plan except when an applicant uses planned unit
development procedures in which land is set aside by the developer for public
use as required under those procedures in the zoning ordinance. After proper
determination of its necessity by the Commission and the appropriate city
official or other public agency involved in the acquisition and use of each
such site and a determination has been made to acquire the site by the public
agency, the site shall be suitably incorporated by the applicant into the
preliminary and final plats. Upon such determination by the Commission, the
following shall apply.
         (a)   Referral to public agency. The Commission shall refer the sketch
plan to the public agency concerned with acquisition for its consideration and
report. The Commission may propose alternate areas for such acquisition and
shall allow the public agency 30 days for reply. The public agency’s
recommendation, if affirmative, shall include a map showing the boundaries and
area of the parcel to be acquired and an estimate of the time within five years
required to complete the acquisition.
         (b)   Notice to property owner. Upon a receipt of an affirmative
report the Commission shall notify the property owner and the Administrator
shall designate on the preliminary and final plats each area proposed to be
acquired by a public agency.
      (2)   Duration of land reservation. The acquisition of land reserved by a
public agency on the final plat shall be initiated within five years of
notification in writing from the owner that he or she intends to develop the
land. Such letter of intent shall be accompanied by a site plan of the proposed
development and a tentative schedule of construction. Failure on the part of a
public agency to initiate acquisition within the prescribed five years shall
result in the removal of the “reserved” designation from the property involved
and the freeing of the property for development in accordance with these
regulations.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.048 PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES AND AMENITIES.
   (A)   General. Existing features which would add value to the type of
intended development or to the city as a whole, such as trees, watercourses
falls, beaches, historic spots, and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be
preserved in the design of the subdivision. No trees shall be removed from any
subdivision nor any change of grade of the land affected until primary approval
of the preliminary plat has been granted. All trees on the plat which are
required to be retained shall be preserved, and all trees, where needed, shall
be welled and protected against change of grade. The sketch plan shall show the
number and location of existing trees, as required by these regulations, and
shall further indicate all those marked for retention and the location of all
proposed shade trees required along the street side(s) of each lot as required
by these regulations.
   (B)   Shade trees planted by developer.
      (1)   As a requirement for subdivision secondary approval, the applicant
shall plant trees on the property of the subdivision. Such trees are to be
planted within five feet of the right-of-way of the street or streets within
and abutting the subdivision, or at the discretion of the Commission and the
City Engineer, within the right-of-way of such streets. One tree shall be
planted for every 40 feet of frontage along each street unless the Commission,
upon recommendation of the City Engineer, shall grant a waiver in accordance
with §
150.012. Such waiver shall be granted only if there are existing trees growing
along such a right-of-way or on the abutting property which, in the opinion of
the Commission, comply with these regulations.
      (2)   New trees to be provided pursuant to these regulations shall be
approved by the City Engineer shall be planted in accordance with the
regulations of the City Engineer. Such trees have a minimum trunk diameter
(measured 12 inches above ground level) of not less than two inches. Only Oak,
Honey Locust, Hard Maples, Ginkgo, or other long-lived shade trees acceptable
to the City Engineer and to the Commission, shall be planted.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.049 NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   General. If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for
commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect
to such land shall meet such special provisions as the Commission finds
appropriate and requires. A nonresidential subdivision shall also be subject to
all the requirements set forth in the zoning ordinance. Site plan approval and
nonresidential subdivision plat approval may proceed simultaneously at the
discretion of the Planning Commission. A nonresidential subdivision shall be
subject to all the requirements of these regulations as well as such additional
standards required by the Commission and shall conform to the proposed land use
and standards established in the Comprehensive Plan, official map, and zoning
ordinance, except that where lot lines are to be established incrementally,
they need not be shown on the sketch plan or the preliminary plat for primary
approval. All shopping centers and other nonresidential subdivisions of
buildings for leasehold shall be subject to the relevant provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)   Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in these
regulations which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the
applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commission that the
street, parcel, and block pattern proposed for the uses anticipated and
adequately take into account other uses in the vicinity. The following
principles and standards shall be observed.
      (1)   Proposed commercial or industrial parcels shall be suitable in
minimum area and dimensions to the types of industrial development anticipated.
Proposals for incremental lot by lot subdivision must be made clear in a
statement on the preliminary plat which is satisfactory to the Commission.
      (2)   Street rights-of-way and pavement construction shall be adequate to
accommodate the type and volume of traffic to be generated thereupon.
      (3)   Special requirements may be imposed by the Commission upon
recommendation of the city with respect to street, curb, gutter, and sidewalk
design and construction.
      (4)   Special requirements may be imposed by the Commission with respect
to the installation of public utilities, including water, sewer, and storm
water drainage and preprocessing of sewage. Special requirements may also be
imposed regarding the storage and disposal of toxic materials.
      (5)   Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas
from potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision,
including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing onto existing or
potential residential development and provision of a permanently landscaped
buffer strip where necessary.
      (6)   Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic,
shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or
potential residential areas.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
STREETS
§ 150.060 GENERAL.
   (A)   Frontage on improved streets. No subdivision shall be approved unless
the area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and access from an existing
street on the official map, or if there is not an official map, unless such a
street is:
      (1)   An existing state, county, or township highway; or
      (2)   A street shown upon a plat approved by the Commission and recorded
in the office of the County Recorder. Such street or highway must be suitably
improved as required by the highway rules, regulation specifications, or
orders, or be secured by a performance bond required under these regulations,
with the width and right-of-way required by these regulations or as indicated
on the official map or thoroughfare plan. Whenever the area to be subdivided is
to use an existing street frontage, such street shall be suitably improved as
provided hereinabove.
   (B)   Grading and improvement plan. Streets shall be graded and improved and
conform to the city construction standards and specifications and shall be
approved as to design and specifications by the City Engineer, in accordance
with the construction plans required to be submitted prior to secondary
approval.
   (C)   Topography and arrangement.
      (1)   Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. All
streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building
sites at, or above, the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform
as closely as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep
grades and sharp curves shall be avoided. Specific standards are contained in
the design standards of these regulations.
      (2)   All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights-of-way as established on
the official map or thoroughfare plan, and/or Comprehensive Plan.
      (3)   All arterials and collector streets shall be properly related to
special traffic generators such as industries, business districts, schools,
churches, and shopping centers, to population densities, and to the pattern of
existing and proposed land uses.
      (4)   Minor or local streets shall be laid out to conform as much as
possible to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit
efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of
streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to the property.
      (5)   Rigid, rectangular “gridiron” street patterns are generally to be
avoided, and the use of casually curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, or loop
streets shall be encouraged where such use will result in a more desirable
layout and relate better to the existing topography. On flat land, innovative,
varying geometrical street patterns shall be encouraged where they are likely
to enhance visual interest and a sense of order for those using them (e.g.,
non-grid rectilinear, trapezoidal, polygonal, or other geometric patterns).
      (6)   Proposed streets shall, where appropriate, be extended to the
boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided unless this is prevented by
topography or other physical conditions, or unless, in the opinion of the
Commission, such extension(s) is/are not necessary or desirable for the
coordination of the layout of the subdivision under consideration with the
existing street layout or for the most advantageous future development of
adjacent tracts (see § 150.061(A)).
      (7)   In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, walkways, bikeways, and parking areas so as to minimize
conflict of movement between the various types of vehicular and pedestrian
traffic.
   (D)   Blocks.
      (1)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots
of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be
permitted in blocks adjacent to arterial streets, railroads, and waterways.
      (2)   The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated, but
block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed 2,600 feet nor be less than
400 feet in length. Blocks along arterial and collector streets shall not be
less than 1,000 feet in length.
      (3)   In long blocks, the Commission may require the reservation of
easements through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, or
pedestrian traffic. Pedestrianways or crosswalks not less than ten feet wide
may be required by the Commission through the center of blocks more than 800
feet long or at other appropriate locations and at the ends of the cul-de-sacs
where deemed essential to provide for circulation or access to schools,
playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, or other community facilities.
Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of such length and width as may be
determined to be suitable by the Commission for the intended use.
   (E)   Access to collector streets. Where possible, lots in single family
residential subdivisions fronting on collector streets shall be avoided and
lots at the corners of intersections between local and collector streets shall
front on the local street and have driveway access to it only and not to the
collector street. In multiple-family residential areas entrances to group
parking lots shall have access only to collector streets (where possible), and
such entrances shall be widely spaced.
   (F)   Access to primary arterials. Where a subdivision borders on or
contains an existing or proposed primary arterial, the Commission may require
that access to it be limited by one of the following means:
      (1)   The subdivision of the lots so as to back onto the primary arterial
and front onto a parallel local street; no access shall be provided for the
primary arterial, and screening shall be provided within a strip of land along
the rear property line of such lots;
      (2)   The series of cul-de-sacs, or loop streets entered from, and
designed generally to be at right angles to an access street that is at some
distance from and parallel to the arterial street, with the rear lines of their
terminal lots backing onto the arterial; and
      (3)   A marginal access or service road (separated from the primary
arterial by a landscaped and/or decoratively fenced grass trip and having
access thereto at widely spaced suitable points).
   (G)   Street names. The sketch plan, as submitted, shall indicate names of
proposed streets. As part of his or her review, the Administrator shall refer
proposed street names to the local postmaster for his or her comments regarding
duplication of names and possible confusion. After reviewing them, the
Administrator shall inform the subdivider of his or her recommendations for
their possible revision during the sketch plan review. Names shall be
sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other street names in the
county or other nearby areas so as to avoid confusion. A street which is, or is
planned as, a continuation of an existing street shall bear the same name.
   (H)   Street regulatory signs. The applicant shall provide and install a
street sign at every street intersection within his or her subdivision as
required by the City Engineer. The city shall inspect and approve all street
signs before issuance of certificates of occupancy for any residence on the
approved streets.
   (I)   Street lights. Installation of street lights shall be required in
accordance with design and specification standards approved by the City
Engineer. Street light standards and fixtures shall also be in accordance with
the visual design standards of the City Engineer.
   (J)   Reserve strips. The creation of reserve strips shall not be permitted
adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as to deny access to it from
adjacent property if such street is a local service street rather than a
collector or arterial street. (See divisions (E) and (F) above).
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.061 CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   Construction of streets other than cul-de-sacs. The arrangement of
streets shall provide for the continuation of streets between adjacent
subdivisions or other properties when such continuation is necessary for the
convenient movement of traffic, for effective fire protection, for efficient
provision of utilities, and where such continuation is in accordance with the
Comprehensive Plan. If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must
be a dead-end (stub) street temporarily, the right-of-way shall be provided for
all such temporary dead-end streets, with the notation on the subdivision plan
that land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abutters
whenever the street is continued. Temporary turnarounds must be provided at the
ends of such stub streets. The Commission may limit the length of temporary
dead-end streets in accordance with the design standards in these regulations.
   (B)   Cul-de-sacs (permanent dead-end streets). Where a street does not
extend beyond the boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not
required by the Commission for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall
normally not be nearer to such boundary than 50 feet. However, the Commission
may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage
facilities, pedestrian traffic, or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be
provided at the end of a permanent dead-end street in accordance with city
construction standards and specifications available from the City Engineer’s
office. For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire
protection, permanent dead-end streets shall be limited in length in accordance
with the design standards in these regulations.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.062 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   General. In order to provide for streets of suitable location, width,
and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory
access for police, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation, and street
maintenance equipment, and to coordinate street location in order to achieve a
convenient system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the
following design standards for streets are hereby required. (Street
classifications may be indicated in the Comprehensive Plan, thoroughfare plan,
or on the official map; otherwise, they shall be determined by the Commission.)
   (B)   Street surfacing and improvements. After sewer and water utilities
have been installed by the developer, the applicant shall construct curbs and
gutters and shall surface or cause the roadways to be surfaced to the widths
prescribed in these regulations. Said surfacing shall be of such character as
is suitable for the expected traffic and in harmony with similar improvements
in the surrounding areas. Types of pavement shall be as determined by the City
Engineer. Adequate provision shall be made for culverts, drains, and bridges.
All street pavement, shoulders, drainage improvements, and structures, curbs,
turnarounds, and sidewalks shall conform to all construction standards and
specifications adopted by the Commission, City Engineer, or the city and shall
be incorporated into the construction plans required to be submitted by the
developer for plat approval.
   (C)   Excess right-of-way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards
designed in these regulations shall be required whenever, due to topography,
additional width is necessary to provide for adequate and stable earth slopes.
Such slopes shall not be in excess of three to one.
   (D)   Railroads and limited access highways. Railroad rights-of-way and
limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of
adjoining lands shall be treated as follows.
      (1)   In residential districts, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth
in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be
provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This
strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat:
“this strip is reserved for screening. The placement of structures hereon other
than earth berms, walls, fences, and other landscape screening devices approved
by the Commission is prohibited.”
      (2)   In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses,
the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to a railroad
shall, wherever practical, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure a
suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
      (3)   Streets parallel to a railroad when intersecting a street which
crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance
shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for
future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
   (E)   Intersections.
      (1)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible
at right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an angle of less
than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should be
approximately at right angles for at least 100 feet therefrom. Not more than
two streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by
the Commission.
      (2)   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street
shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersection on the
opposite side of such street. Street jogs with center line offsets of less than
150 feet shall not be permitted except where the intersected street has
separated, dual drives, without median breaks at either such intersection.
Where local streets intersect with arterials, their alignment shall be
continuous. Intersections of arterials shall be at least 800 feet apart.
      (3)   Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two local streets shall
be at least 20 feet, and minimum curb radius at an intersection involving a
collector street shall be at least 25 feet. Alley intersections and abrupt
changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in
accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular
movement.
      (4)   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever
practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a
leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a 2% grade at a
distance of 60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the
intersection street.
      (5)   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing
vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting
visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation (including
trimming trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to
the extent deemed necessary by the City Engineer to provide an adequate sight
distance.
      (6)   The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be
3% or less.
   (F)   Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by
the Commission, shall be constructed at the full expense of the applicant
without reimbursement from the city. The sharing of expense for the
construction of bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined
by the Commission, will be fixed by special agreement between the city and the
applicant. Said cost shall be charged to the applicant pro-rata as the
percentage of his or her land developed and so served.
   (G)   Typical rural cross-sections for major streets.

§ 150.063 DEDICATIONS AND RESERVATIONS.
   (A)   New perimeter streets. Street systems in new subdivisions shall be
laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets. Where an
existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the
street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider. The Commission may
authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves and dedicates
the entire required right-of-way width within his or her own subdivision’s
boundaries.
   (B)   Widening and realignment of existing streets. Where a subdivision
borders an existing narrow
street or when the Comprehensive Plan, thoroughfare plan, or zoning setback
regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening of a street that would
require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant shall be
required to improve and dedicate such streets at his or her own expense. Such
frontage streets and other streets on which subdivision lots front shall be
improved and dedicated by the applicant at his or her own expense to the full
width required by these subdivision regulations. Land reserved for any street
purposes may not be counted in satisfying the yard or area requirements of the
zoning ordinance.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
ASSURANCE FOR COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS
§ 150.075 IMPROVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (A)   Completion of improvements. Before the plan is signed by the
designated officials, all applicants shall be required to complete, in
accordance with the Commission’s decision and to the satisfaction of the City
Engineer, all the streets, sanitary, and other public improvements, including
lot improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision as required in this
chapter, specified in the approved construction plans and on the final
subdivision plat, and as approved by the Commission and to dedicate the public
improvements to the city, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the
property and public improvements thus dedicated.
   (B)   Performance bond.
      (1)   The Commission, in its sole discretion, may waive the requirement
that the applicant complete all public improvements prior to the approval of
the final subdivision plat or section thereof, and that, in lieu thereof, the
applicant shall post bond securable to city, hereinafter referred to as
“performance bond,” in an amount equivalent to 100% of the estimated cost of
completion of the required public improvements. This amount of bond shall be
sufficient to secure to the city jurisdiction the satisfactory construction and
installation of the uncompleted portion of required public improvements, as
provided for in §§
150.027(G)(1)(a) and 150.028(H)(1)(a).
      (2)   In lieu of such a bond, the subdivider may submit a certified check
made payable to the city in an amount equivalent to 100% of the estimated cost
of completion of the uncompleted portion of required public improvements as
provided for in §§
150.027(G)(1)(a) and 150.028(H)(1)(a). Any such check shall be held by the
Clerk Treasurer of the city.
      (3)   In lieu of such a bond, the subdivider may submit irrevocable
letters of credit on behalf of the subdivider and securable by the city in an
amount equivalent to 100% of the estimated cost of completion of the
uncompleted portion of required public improvements as provided in §§
150.027(G)(1)(a) and 150.028(H)(1)(a). In the event an irrevocable letter of
credit is used, it shall be written for a maximum length of two years. The
Commission, two months prior to the expiration of the letter of credit, shall
determine if the public improvements have been accepted for maintenance by the
city or other units of government having jurisdiction over them, and if they
have not been accepted, shall so notify the subdivider of the city’s intent to
secure the funds pledged by such letter of credit or, at the discretion of the
Commission, to grant an extension of the original period fixed by the
Commission. No extension shall exceed one year, and the subdivider filing with
the Commission a new letter of credit for the period so extended.
      (4)   In lieu of such a bond, the subdivider may submit a certificate of
deposit made out to either the city and the subdivider to be held by the Clerk
Treasurer of the city in the amount equivalent to 100% of the cost of
completion of the uncompleted portion of required public improvements as
provided for §§
150.027(G)(1)(a) and 150.028(H)(1)(a). The subdivider must endorse the
certificate of deposit before submitting it to the Commission so the said city
may secure the funds.
      (5)   A performance bond furnished pursuant to this chapter shall comply
with all statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to the Commission
Attorney as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution as set forth in this
chapter. (See Appendix A for forms.) The period within which required public
improvements must be completed shall be specified by the Commission in the
primary approval of the preliminary plat and shall be incorporated into the
bond and shall not in any event exceed two years from date of secondary
approval. Such bond shall be approved by the participating jurisdiction as to
amount. The Commission may, upon proof of difficulty, grant an extension of the
completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum period of one additional
year, provided that the bond submitted for this extension period meets all
other requirements herein. The Commission may, at any time during the term of
such bond, accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond.
   (C)   Temporary public improvements. The applicant shall build and pay for
all costs of temporary improvements required by the Commission and shall
maintain same for the period specified by the Commission. Prior to construction
of any temporary public facility or improvement, the subdivider shall file with
the Commission a separate suitable bond for temporary facilities. This bond
shall ensure that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed,
maintained, and removed (except for turnaround at ends of the peripheral stub
streets intended for connection into adjacent future subdivisions).
   (D)   Cost of public improvements. All required public improvements shall be
made by the applicant at his or her expense without reimbursement by the city
or any public improvement district therein, unless sharing of expenses is
agreed upon by the city.
   (E)   Governmental units. Governmental units to which these bond provisions
apply may file a certified resolution or ordinance from officers or agencies
authorized to act in their behalf, agreeing to comply with the provisions of
this section in lieu of said bond.
   (F)   Failure to complete public improvements. For subdivisions for which no
performance bond has been posted, if the public improvements are not completed
within the period specified by the Commission in the primary approval of the
preliminary plat, or the sketch plan in the case of a minor subdivision, the
approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where a performance
bond has been posted and the required public improvements have not been
installed within the terms of such performance bond, the participating
jurisdiction may thereupon request the city to declare the bond to be in
default and cause all public improvements to be installed according to
secondary approval regardless of the extent of the building development at the
time the bond is declared to be in default.
   (G)   Acceptance of dedication offers. The approval by the Commission of a
subdivider plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by
the city of any street, easement, or park shown on said plat. The Commission
may require said plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. The
approval relates only to the real property itself.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.076 INSPECTION OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   General procedure.
      (1)   If the city finds upon inspection per §§
150.027(G)(1)(a) and 150.028(H)(1)(a) that any of the improvements have not
been constructed in accordance with the approved construction plans, the
applicant shall be responsible for completing the public improvements according
to such plans.
      (2)   Where the cost of the public improvements is covered by a
performance bond, the applicant and the bonding company shall be severally and
jointly liable for completing the public improvements according to
specifications.
   (B)   Release or reduction of performance bond.
      (1)   Certificate of satisfactory completion.
         (a)   The city shall not accept required public improvements, nor the
Commission release nor reduce a performance bond, until the city has submitted
to it a certificate stating that all required public improvements or a pro rata
part in the case of a reduction have been satisfactorily completed.
         (b)   The applicant’s engineer or surveyor shall provide the
participating jurisdiction with detailed “as built” construction plans of the
public improvements, indicating location, dimensions, materials, and other
information required by the Commission or participating jurisdiction.
         (c)   Upon such certification, the city shall thereafter accept the
public improvements for maintenance in accordance with the established
procedures unless the city has reliable information as to noncompliance with
the plans and specifications.
      (2)   Reduction of performance bond. A performance bond shall be reduced
upon actual acceptance of public improvements, but only by the amount
originally estimated for the completion of said public improvements.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992)
§ 150.077 MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   The applicant shall be required to maintain all public improvements on
the individual subdivided lots and provide for snow removal on streets and
sidewalks (where required) until acceptance of said public improvements by the
city.
   (B)   (1)   The applicant shall be required to file a maintenance bond with
the Commission prior to acceptance, in an amount not to exceed 10% of the cost
of all public improvements, and in form satisfactory to the Commission
Attorney.
      (2)   The maintenance bond is provided to assure the satisfactory
condition of the required public improvements for a period of three years after
the date of their acceptance by the city.
(Ord. 5-1992, passed 7-21-1992) Penalty, see §
150.999
§ 150.078 ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS.
   No building permits shall be issued for the last 10% of lots in a final
subdivision plat or section thereof, or if 10% be less than two, for the last
two lots of a subdivision or section thereof, until all public improvements
required by the Commission for the plat with the exception of sidewalks have
been fully completed and accepted for maintenance by the city.

§ 151.022 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   District boundaries shown within the lines of streets, streams, and
transportation rights-of-way shall be deemed to follow the center lines. The
vacation of streets shall not affect the location of such district boundaries.
When the Administrative Officer cannot definitely determine the location of a
district boundary by such center lines, by the scale or dimensions stated on
the zone map, or by the fact that it clearly coincides with a property line, he
or she shall refuse action, and the Advisory Board of Zoning Appeals, upon
appeal, shall interpret the location of the district boundary with reference to
the scale of the zone map and the purpose set forth in all relevant provisions
of this chapter.

§ 151.023 RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   Districts designated for residential use, R-1, R-2, and R-3, are limited to
dwellings and public or semi-public uses which are normally associated with
residential neighborhoods. The only uses permitted in the residential districts
are those which would not detract from the residential character of the
neighborhood. The purpose of these three districts shall be to create an
attractive, stable, and orderly residential environment. However, the families
per dwelling and the lot and yard requirements are different in the three
districts to provide for the various housing needs and desires of the citizens.
(Prior Code, § 36-7-4-600-204) (Ord. 712, passed 4-2-1957; Ord. 1964-9, passed

§ 151.024 BUSINESS DISTRICTS.
   The districts designated for business, B-1 and B-2, are limited to business,
public, and certain residential uses. By establishing compact districts for
such uses, more efficient traffic movement, parking facilities, fire
protection, and police protection may be provided. Industrial uses are excluded
in order to reduce the hazards caused by extensive truck and rail movements
normally associated with such uses. The purpose of those districts is to
provide unified shopping districts conveniently located.

existing industries and their expansion, as well as for future industrial
development. Performance standards, parking specifications, and yard
regulations are set forth in this chapter in order to ensure safe industrial
development compatible with adjacent uses.

and certain other open land uses. Residential and related uses are permitted if
approved by the Advisory Board of Zoning Appeals. The purpose of this district
is to prevent intensive development of land that is unsuitable for development
because of topography, soil conditions, or periodic flooding.

permitted in the district in which the plan is located, except that limited
business facilities, intended to serve only the planned unit residential
project area and fully integrated into the design of the project, may be
considered, and multiple-family dwellings may be considered in single-family
residential districts if they are so designed and sited that they do not
detract from the character of the neighborhood in which they occur.
   (H)   The unit plan shall be consistent with the purpose of this chapter.
   (I)   The unit plan shall be reviewed, and recommendations made, by the
Advisory Plan Commission to determine if the proposed project is consistent

under the city jurisdiction without first obtaining a street cut permit from
the City Zoning Office. Each street cut shall require a separate street cut
permit.
   (B)   The edges of all excavations into paved or finished pavements,
gutters, and curbs shall be sawed to a minimum depth of one-third the depth of
the pavement, gutter, or curb. In no case will the sawed cut be allowed to be
less than two inches.
   (C)   All excavations or cuts made into, under, across, or extending three
feet from the finished edges of pavements, gutters, or curbs shall be back
filled with flowable fill, also known as controlled density fill.
   (D)   All materials, cuts, and excavations, unless specifically stated
otherwise, shall be in accordance with the current State Department of
Transportation (INDOT) standard specifications.
(Ord. 2001-12, passed 2-5-2002) Penalty, see §
153.99
§ 153.16 FLOWABLE FILL.
   (A)   Composition.
      (1)   The flowable fill shall have a compressive strength from 50 PSI
(pounds per square inch) to 150 PSI.
      (2)   The flowable fill shall have a flow test spread diameter greater
than eight inches.
      (3)   The test for flow shall consist of filling a three-inch diameter by
six-inch high open-ended cylinder placed on a smooth, level, nonporous surface
to the top with the flowable fill. The cylinder shall be pulled straight up
within five seconds. The spread of the fill shall be measured. The minimum
spread shall be eight inches. This test shall be performed by the Street
Commissioner of the City or his or her designated representative.
      (4)   The flowable fill mix may consist of the following materials and be
proportioned within the following limits for each material per cubic yard:
         (a)   Portland concrete: 25 to 75 pounds per cubic yard;
         (b)   Fly ash: zero to 1,500 pounds per cubic yard;
         (c)   Fine aggregate: 2,010 to 3,150 pounds per cubic yard; and
         (d)   Water: as required, approximately 500 pounds per cubic yard.
      (5)   The producer may use water reducing admixtures and also air-
entraining admixtures when used in accordance with the admixture’s
manufacturer’s recommendations. The flowable fill may have an air content
ranging from 0-25% by volume.
      (6)   The proposed mix design shall be submitted and approved by the City
Street Commissioner. A trial batch demonstration and compressive strength
report may be required.
   (B)   Placement.
      (1)   Before any flowable fill is placed, any pipes, structures, or other
objects that might be displaced by the placement of the flowable fill shall be
adequately anchored, braced, or otherwise secured.
      (2)   No flowable fill or any other fill shall be placed in the
excavation until the excavation and any required bracing has been inspected by
the Street Commissioner of the city or his or her designated representative.
      (3)   The mixture shall be delivered and discharged using ready-mix
trucks approved for use by the State Department of Transportation.
      (4)   A copy of the batch ticket for the delivered flowable fill shall be
required to be turned into the Zoning Officer of the city upon completion of
the street cut.
      (5)   Flowable fill shall not be placed on frozen ground.
      (6)   Flowable fill shall be protected from freezing until the material
has stiffened and bleeding water subsided. When the temperature at placement is
below freezing (32°F), the Street Commissioner of the city may require that
freezing protection extend for as long as 48 hours.
      (7)   When the flowable fill is being placed in industrial streets,
commercial streets, federal aid highways, or other streets used for
nonresidential uses, the flowable fill shall extend to a minimum of six inches
below the finished surface of the adjacent pavement. If the final six inches of
the pavement is being finished with concrete, the concrete may be placed as
soon as bleeding water has subsided from the flowable fill. The concrete shall
be protected from traffic for a minimum of 48 hours, unless otherwise approved
by the Street Commissioner of the city or his or her designated representative.
When hot asphalt is used for restoring the final six inches, the flowable fill
shall be allowed to cure for a minimum of 24 hours, unless otherwise approved
by the Street Commissioner of the city or his or her designated representative.
The hot asphalt shall consist of five inches of HAC #5 base and one inch of HAC
#11 surface meeting current INDOT specifications. When the existing pavement
depth is greater than six inches, the Street Commissioner of the city may
require that the final restoration match the existing pavement depth.
      (8)   When flowable fill is being placed in residential streets or
alleys, the flowable fill shall extend to a minimum of four and one-half inches
below the finished surface of the adjacent pavement. Placing of concrete is the
same as for industrial streets above but the depth may be four and one-half
inches. After the flowable fill has cured for 24 hours, unless otherwise
approved by the Street Commissioner of the city, hot asphalt may be placed and
shall consist of three and one-half inches of HAC #5 base and one inch of HAC
#11 surface meeting current INDOT specifications. When the existing pavement
depth is greater than four and one-half inches, the Street Commissioner of the
city may require that the final restoration match the existing pavement.
      (9)   When flowable fill is being placed in unpaved streets or alleys,
the flowable fill shall extend to a minimum of six inches below the adjacent
surface grade. After the flowable fill has cured for 24 hours, unless otherwise
approved by the Street Commissioner of the City, six inches of compacted
aggregate #73 limestone, meeting current INDOT specifications, shall be placed
and compacted.
(Ord. 2001-12, passed 2-5-2002) Penalty, see §
153.99
§ 153.17 RESTORATION TO MATCH EXISTING SURROUNDINGS.
   (A)   All gutters and curbs shall be restored as near as possible to match
the existing gutter and curbs.
   (B)   Any driveways or landscape that have been disturbed shall be restored
to match the existing driveway and landscape.
(Ord. 2001-12, passed 2-5-2002) Penalty, see §
153.99
§ 153.18 WAIVER.
   (A)   Any request for waiver of the flowable fill requirement shall be made
in writing and approved by the Street Commissioner of the city. If such waiver
is granted, granular backfill, meeting INDOT specifications for B Borrow, #53
compacted aggregate, and #73 compacted aggregate, may be used when placed in
eight-inch lifts and compacted to 95% of the maximum dry density, as determined
by accepted AASHTO (American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials) standards and procedures, and confirmed by test results from a INDOT
certified laboratory. The number of tests to be taken will be determined by the
Street Commissioner of the city and is dependent upon the depth and length of
the excavation being restored. The cost of these tests, if any, will be borne
by the permit holder. In any event, the structure(s), pipe, cable, and the like
shall be covered to a height of not less than 12 inches with flowable fill
prior to placement of the granular fill material.
   (B)   If the city, or any of its departments, determines that an emergency
situation exists, the requirements of this subchapter may be temporarily waived
in order to protect the health, welfare, and safety of the traveling public.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The state legislature has, in I.C. 36-7-4, granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
City Council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 12-2014, passed 12-8-2014)
§ 154.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately floodproofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 12-2014, passed 12-8-2014)
§ 154.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provision designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
   (F)   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and
their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 12-2014, passed 12-8-2014)
§ 154.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains; and
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
(Ord. 12-2014, passed 12-8-2014)
§ 154.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions apply unless the
context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. Unless specifically
defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as
to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its
most reasonable application.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A ZONES, flood
waters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR, and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are
presented below.
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   ZONE AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. (ZONE AE is on new and revised maps in place of ZONES
A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed ADDITION, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community’s
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular
program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use, or store hazardous materials
or hazardous waste.
   DEVELOPMENT.
      (1)   Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any
addition to a structure;

manufactured home, or installing a recreational vehicle on a site for more than
180 days;
         (c)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction
of roads, or similar projects;
         (d)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements, and the like;
         (e)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling
operations;
         (f)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
         (g)   Storage of materials; or
         (h)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
      (2)   DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the maintenance of
existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing, resurfacing
roads, or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent
structures.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter
walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or
columns (posts and piers).
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. A certified statement that verifies a structure’s
elevation information.
   EMERGENCY PROGRAM. The first phase under which a community participates in
the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. See FLOOD.
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA. See FREEBOARD.
   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The FLOODPLAIN includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited
to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in
flood prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to
as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention
ordinance, and floodplain management requirements.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for
nonresidential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel or a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP (AS RELATED TO VARIANCES OF THIS CHAPTER). The exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Board of
Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar
to the property involved. Mere economic or financial HARDSHIP alone is not
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURES. Any structures individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include letter of map amendment (LOMA), letter of map revision
(LOMR), and letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below.
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in

(Ord. 12-2014, passed 12-8-2014) Penalty, see §
154.99
§ 154.44 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   (1)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
154.07, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the State Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1, a permit for
construction in a floodway from the State Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving, and the like, undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure.
      (2)   However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the State Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the State Department of Natural
Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
State Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in the
floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the State Department of Natural Resources, the
Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in §§
154.40 through
154.47 have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the State
Department of Natural Resources. However, a community’s more restrictive
regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least 15
hundredths of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation
under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition
as proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 C.F.R. § 65.12.
(Ord. 12-2014, passed 12-8-2014)
§ 154.45 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
154.40 through
154.47 have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of
any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.
(Ord. 12-2014, passed 12-8-2014)
§ 154.46 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the State Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the State Department of Natural Resources. Once the
Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit for construction in a
floodway (including letters of authorization) or floodplain analysis/regulatory
assessment approving the proposed development, a floodplain development permit
may be issued, provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are
not less restrictive than the conditions received from the State Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in §§
154.40 through
154.47 have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
154.40 through
154.47 have been met.
   (C)   Cumulative effect. The total cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
shall not increase the regulatory flood more than 14 hundredths of one foot and
shall not increase flood damages or potential flood damages.
(Ord. 12-2014, passed 12-8-2014)
§ 154.47 STANDARDS FOR FLOOD PRONE AREAS.
   All development in known flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or
where no FEMA published map is available, shall meet applicable standards as
required per §§
154.40 through
154.47.
