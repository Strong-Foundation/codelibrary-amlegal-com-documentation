not revived unless it so expressly provides.  The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides.  The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture, or
liability.

home, the meter is to be placed on a utility pole that is to be supplied by the
customer.  All meters must be easily accessible for reading and servicing. 
Upon request in writing by the customer prior to installation, the meter and
service line will be located at the point requested, if feasible, under proper
utility standards.
      (1)   The customer will provide access rights to the utility strip
occupied by the service cables and to other company equipment required by the

(1996 Code, § 9-55)  (Ord. 1986-7, Rule 6, passed 10-7-1986)
§ 50.019  METER TESTS UPON WRITTEN REQUEST BY THE CUSTOMER.
   Each utility shall make a test of the accuracy of registration of a meter
upon written request by a customer.  A second test of the customer’s meter may
be requested after a 12-month period.  The customer may be required to bear the
full cost of any subsequent test of his or her meter if a test is requested at
less than 36 months after the preceding test.  A written report explaining the
results of the test shall be made to the customer within 10 days after the test
is completed and a record of such shall be kept on file in the utility office. 
Any appeal in regard to the results of the customer’s meter test shall be filed
with the Utility Board under Rule 8 within 5 days after the date of the report.
(1996 Code, § 9-56)  (Ord. 1986-7, Rule 7, passed 10-7-1986)
§ 50.020  METER TESTS UPON APPLICATION TO THE UTILITY BOARD.
   (A)   A test will be made of a customer’s meter by the utility under the
supervision of an employee of the Utility Board upon written application to the
utility by the customer.  The applications for the test shall be accompanied by
a fee as set out below in this paragraph.  This fee shall be retained by the
utility; however, if the tests show a meter to be more than 2% fast, the
utility supplying the meter shall reimburse the customer the amount of the fee.
   (B)   The amount of fee to be paid for a meter test made upon the written
application to the Utility Board shall be as follows:
Type     Size                              Test Charge
Electric Regular meter                     $20
        Large meter, 3 phase and the like actual cost
Water    5/8 inch to 3/4 inch meter        $20
        1 inch to 2 inch meter            $60

Gas      Regular meter                     $40
        Large meter                       actual cost
 
   (C)   This rule shall not interfere with the practice of a utility in its
tests of meters except that, in the event of a written application to the
Utility Board by a customer for a test, the utility shall not knowingly remove
or interfere with the meter without consent previously given in writing by the
customer.
(1996 Code, § 9-57)  (Ord. 1986-7, Rule 8, passed 10-7-1986)
§ 50.021  METER TAMPERING.
   No customer shall tamper with any utility meter, or knowingly allow anyone
else other than an employee of the utility to do so.  Tampering includes
turning on, shutting off, or altering in any way the registering devise of the
meters.  In the case of water service, this would also include the removal of
the lid from the meter pit.  It would also include the placing of electric
meters in the meter base backwards or the use of a magnet or magnetic device to
slow the register.  Tampering shall be deemed a criminal offense and may be
treated as such by the Board.
(1996 Code, § 9-58)  (Ord. 1986-7, Rule 9, passed 10-7-1986)

delinquent;
      (8)   Collection charge or late payment fee schedule;
      (9)   If an estimated billing, it shall be noted that it is an estimated
amount of usage; and

than 17 days following the billing date on the statement shall be a delinquent
bill.  If the bill is deemed a delinquent bill, the utility shall add a late
payment charge in the amount of 10% of the delinquent bill.
(Ord. 1988-10, § 10b, passed 12-6-1988)
   (C)   A utility may estimate the bill of any customer pursuant to a billing
procedure approved by the Utility Board or for other good cause, including but
not limited to:  request by the customer; inclement weather; labor or union
disputes; inaccessibility of a customer’s meter, and other circumstances beyond
the control of the utility, its agents, and employees.
(1996 Code, § 9-59)  (Ord. 1986-7, Rule 10c, passed 10-7-1986)
§ 50.036  ADJUSTMENT OF BILLS.
   (A)   Adjustment to bill due to meter error.  If any service meter shall be
found to have a percentage of error greater than allowed, the following
provisions for the adjustment of bills shall be observed:
      (1)   Fast meters.  When a meter is found to have a positive average
error (i.e., is fast) in excess of 5%, the utility shall credit the customer’s
account with the amount in excess of that determined to be an average for ½ the
time elapsed since the previous test, or 1 year, whichever is the shorter
period. This average charge shall be calculated on the basis of units
registered on the meter over the corresponding periods either prior or
subsequent to the period for which the meter is determined to be fast.  No part
of a minimum charge will be credited.
      (2)   Stopped or slowed meters.  When a meter is stopped or has a
negative average error (i.e., is slow) in excess of 5%, the utility may charge
the customer an amount estimated to be an average charge for ½ the time lapsed
since the previous test, or 1 year, whichever is the shorter period.  This
average shall be calculated on the basis of units registered on the meter over
the corresponding periods either prior or subsequent to the period for which
the meter is determined to be slowed or stopped.  This action may be taken only
in cases where the utility is not at fault for allowing the stopped or slowed
meter to remain in service.
   (B)   Other billing adjustments.  All other billing errors, including but
not limited to incorrect tariff applications, may be adjusted to the known date
of error or for a period of 1 year, whichever period is shorter.
(1996 Code, § 9-60)  (Ord. 1986-7, Rule 11, passed 10-7-1986)
§ 50.037  GUARANTEE DEPOSITS TO INSURE PAYMENTS OF BILLS.
   (A)   General requirements.  Each utility shall determine the
creditworthiness of an applicant pursuant to Rule 12b in an equitable and
nondiscriminatory method without regard to the economic character of the area,
or any part thereof, wherein the applicant or customer resides and shall
determine the creditworthiness solely upon the credit risk of an individual
without regard to the collective credit reputation of the area in which he or
she lives.
   (B)   New applicants.  Each new applicant for utility service shall be
deemed creditworthy and shall not be required to make a cash deposit as a
condition of receiving service if the applicant satisfies the following
conditions:
      (1)   If the applicant has:
         (a)   Been a customer of any town utility within the last 2 years;
         (b)   Owes no outstanding bills for service rendered by any utility;
         (c)   Did not have during the last 12 consecutive months that the
service was provided more than 1 bill that was delinquent to any utility; or if
service has been rendered for less than 12 months, has not had any delinquent
bills in such a period; and
         (d)   Within the last 2 years did not have a service that was
disconnected by a town utility for nonpayment of a bill for services rendered.
      (2)   Any applicant who has not been a customer of a town utility during
the previous 2 years shall be deemed creditworthy if he or she meets the
following requirements: Applicant either owns or is buying his or her own home
or has had utility service in his or her name at a rental property that he or
she has occupied for 2 or more years and has not had more than 2 delinquent
utility bills during that time.
      (3)   If the applicant fails to establish that he or she is creditworthy
pursuant to the above criteria, the applicant may be required to make
reasonable cash deposit for each utility.
   (C)   Present customers.  A utility may require a present customer to make
deposits when the customer has been mailed disconnect notices for 2 consecutive
months or any 3 months within the preceding 12-month period, or when service
has been disconnected pursuant to the rules for nonpayment of bills.
   (D)   Refunds.
      (1)   Any deposit shall be refunded at the end of the first 12-month
period, provided that the customer has not had more than 1 delinquent utility
bill within that period.  In the event that the customer has had more than 1
delinquent bill, then the deposits will be retained for another consecutive 12-
month period with the same conditions for refund being applicable.
      (2)   Following the customer’s request for termination of service, the
utility shall apply the deposits to the final billing and refund any excess
amount to the customer.
      (3)   Each utility shall maintain a record of each applicant or customer
making a deposit as prescribed by the State Board of Accounts.
      (4)   Each customer shall be provided with a written receipt from the
utility at the time his or her deposits are paid in full.  The utility shall
provide a reasonable method by which a customer, who is unable to locate his or
her receipt, may establish that he or she is entitled to a refund of his or her
deposit.
   (E)   Former customers seeking to reestablish service.  In order to improve
collection of delinquent utility accounts, it is necessary to increase the
security deposit for former customers who seek to reestablish utility service
with the town if the customer failed to pay for utility services within the
time frame set forth by the town code.
      (1)   Regular security deposits for residential utility customers shall
be exactly double (2 times) the standard deposit amount for any returning
customer who voluntarily or involuntarily terminated utility service with the
town and had an unpaid balance that remained on the account for over 90 days.
      (2)   The following security deposit schedule is directly referenced to
the language in division (E)(1) of this section. 
 
Deposit Type                      Amount
Residential water deposit         $80
Residential sewer deposit         $80
Residential gas deposit           $200
Residential electric deposit      $100
Residential electric only deposit $300
 
      (3)   Residential electric only is defined as a residence with no gas
service.
(Ord. 2006-4, passed 9-15-2006)
§ 50.038  DISCONNECTION OF SERVICE.
   (A)   Upon a customer’s request.
      (1)   A customer shall notify the utility in writing at least 2 working
days in advance of the day of disconnection.  The customer shall remain
responsible for all service used and the billings therefor until service is
disconnected pursuant to the notice.  In case of an emergency, disconnection
may be done immediately either at the request of the customer or at the
discretion of the utility.
      (2)   Upon request in writing by a customer of a utility to disconnect
service, the utility shall disconnect the service within 2 working days of the
requested disconnection date.  The customer shall not be liable for any service
rendered to that address or location after the expiration of these 2 days.
   (B)   Without customer’s request.
      (1)   A utility may disconnect service without request by the customer
and without prior notice for any of the following:
         (a)   A condition that is dangerous or hazardous to life, physical
safety, or property exists;
         (b)   Upon order by any court or duly authorized public authority;
         (c)   If fraudulent or unauthorized use is detected by the utility and
the utility has reasonable grounds to believe that the affected customer is
responsible for the use; and/or
         (d)   If the utility’s regulating or measuring equipment has been
tampered with and the utility has reasonable grounds to believe that the
affected customer is responsible for or has knowledge of the tampering.
      (2)   In all other instances a utility, upon providing the customer with
the proper notice, may disconnect service subject to the other provisions of
these rules.
   (C)   Postponement of disconnection.
      (1)   A utility may postpone disconnection of service for 10 days if,
prior to the disconnection date specified on the notice, the customer provides
the utility with a written medical statement from a licensed physician or
public health official which states that disconnection of service would be a
serious and immediate threat to the health and safety of a designated person in
the household of the customer.
      (2)   A utility may postpone disconnection of service if a customer shows
cause for his or her inability to pay the full amount due immediately and:
         (a)   Completes an extension of time agreement with the utility;
         (b)   Pays an amount equal to 1/10 of the bill due, but not less than
$10;
         (c)   Agrees to pay the remainder outstanding bill no later than the
twenty-eighth day of the month following the month that the billing was
generated;
         (d)   Agrees to pay all undisputed future bills for service rendered
as they become due; and
         (e)   Has not breached any similar agreement made with the utility in
the past.
      (3)   Conditions: 
         (a)   Provided that the utility may add to the unpaid balance a late
payment charge as previously established;
         (b)   Provided further, that the above terms of the agreement shall be
put in writing by the utility and signed by the customer and a representative
of the utility; and
         (c)   Provided further, that only 1 extension of time may be granted
in a 12-month period.
   (D)   Postponement of disconnection due to disputed bill.  
      (1)   If a customer is unable to pay a bill which is unusually large due
to prior incorrect reading of the meter, incorrect application of the rate
schedule, incorrect connection or functioning of the meter, prior estimates
where no actual readings were taken over a 3-month period, stopped or slow
meter, or any human or mechanical error of the utility, the customer must:
         (a)   Pay a reasonable portion of the bill, not to exceed an amount
equal to the customer’s average bill for the 12 bills immediately preceding the
bill in question;
         (b)   Agree to pay the remainder of the bill at a reasonable rate; and
         (c)   Agree to pay all undisputed future bills for service rendered as
they become due.

EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE
§ 50.060  EXTENSION OF UTILITY SERVICES.
   Fees for extension of utility services shall be the actual costs incurred.
§ 50.061  POLICY REGARDING WATER LEAKS.
   (A)   If a customer experiences a concealed water leak on the customer’s
side of the water meter, the customer’s bill shall be computed as follows:
      (1)   The usage from the same month of the previous year (base amount);
plus
      (2)   ½ of the extra amount of usage due to the leak.
      Example: Customer used 100 units in May 2002 and experiences a leak in
May 2003, which usage is 250 units. The customer pays 100 units plus 75 units
for a total of 175 units.
      (3)   If the customer did not reside at the residence such that the
methodology in division (2) above cannot be calculated, then the customer’s
usage will be averaged for the months that he or she has had water service at
that location to determine the base amount of his or her usage. The base amount
shall be added to ½ the leak amount for a total consumption for which the
customer shall be billed.
   (B)   The rate payer shall not be responsible for the accompanying sewer
bill when it is readily ascertainable by the Town of Bainbridge, through its
employees, that the water leak did not result in water going through the Town
of Bainbridge sewer system. In that case, the rate payer shall not be required
to pay the sewer bill for the portion of the leaked water. If the town
employees believe that the water did go through the sanitary sewer system, or
cannot prove otherwise, the rate payer shall be responsible for the companion
sewer bill for the full amount of the water leak.
   (C)   This reduction in the amount of the current bill is available to
customers only one time in a three-year period.  Any exceptions to this rule
must be submitted to the Utility Board for review at its next regularly
scheduled board meeting.
(Res. 2003-7, passed 6-12-2003)
§ 50.062  NEW SERVICE REGULATIONS FOR SEWER AND WATER.

that does not presently have service, shall inform the Town Clerk-Treasurer or
the Superintendent of the utility that the service is desired.
   (B)   The Superintendent shall then, within a reasonable time, provide an
estimate as to the cost for installation of the water or sewer (or both)
hookup.
   (C)   The customer, upon receipt of the estimate, shall then deposit with
the Clerk-Treasurer of the Town of Bainbridge an amount equal to the
Superintendent’s estimate prior to any work beginning.
   (D)   Once the water or sewer (or both) lines are installed by the utility,
the Superintendent shall provide an itemized billing to the customer for the
work performed.  If the work is less than the original estimate, the Clerk-
Treasurer will refund that amount or apply it to the customer’s future bills,
whichever the customer prefers.  If the work performed exceeds the original
estimate, the customer shall pay this difference to the utility within 30 days
of receipt of the invoice.
   (E)   The customer shall hold the Utility Board, the Town of Bainbridge, and
any of its employees, harmless of any damage that may arise in the customer’s
home from the new hookons.  These damages will include but not be limited to
damages to the customer’s home or contents that may be caused by leaks or
bursts due to the greater pressure on the customer’s system, gross negligence
on part of the utility excluded.

taken at the control manhole, except for applications for NPDES permits and
report thereof which shall be conducted in accordance with rules and
regulations adopted by the USEPA (40 C.F.R. Pt. 136).  In the event that no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property.  The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken.  Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are
determined from periodic grab samples.
   (F)   No statement contained in this subchapter shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the town and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the town for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the
industrial concern, at such rates as are compatible with the rate ordinance.

(1996 Code, § 9-37)  (Ord. 1989-5, § 3, passed 11-7-1988; Am. Ord. 1997-2,
passed 8-13-1997; Am. Ord. 2002-3, passed 5-9-2002)
§ 53.33  ADDITIONAL FACTORS FOR BILLING PURPOSES.
   The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewage system and
obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the town shall be
determined by the town in a manner as the town shall reasonably elect, and the
sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates; except, as is
hereinafter provided in this section, the town may make proper allowances in
determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be
consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the town that the
quantities do not enter the sewage system.
   (A)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the town’s
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied
by the water utility serving the town, then the amount of water used shall be
otherwise measured or determined by the town.  In order to ascertain the rate
or charge provided in this subchapter, the owner or other interested party
shall, at his or her expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric
measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable
to the town for the determining of sewage discharge.  Residential (single-
family) users may be exempted from this requirement.
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the town’s
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water supplied by
the water utility serving the town, and in addition, is a user of water from
another resource which is not measured by a water meter or is measured by a
meter not acceptable to the town, then the amount of water used shall be
otherwise measured or determined by the town.  In order to ascertain the rates
or charges, the owner of other interested parties shall, at his or her expense,
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the town for the
determination of sewage discharge.
   (C)   In the event 2 or more residential lots, parcels of real estate or
buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the town’s
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and the
quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each such case,
for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for each
user and the base charge and the flow rates and charges shall apply to each of
the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate or buildings served
through the single water meter.
   (D)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the town’s
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess of
10,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the town
that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not and
cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other interested
party shall, at his or her expense, install and maintain meters, weirs,
volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the town for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (E)   Where a metered water supply is used for fire protection as well as
for other uses not entering the sewer system, the town may, in its discretion,
make adjustments in the user charges as may be equitable.
(1996 Code, § 9-38)  (Ord. 1989-5, § 4, passed 11-7-1988)
§ 53.34  VOLUME, STRENGTH AND CHARACTER OF DISCHARGES.
   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably adjusted to
the service rendered to users, the town shall base its charges not only on the
volume, but also on strength and character of the stronger-than-normal domestic
sewage and shall require the user to determine the strength and content of all
sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly, into the sewage
system, in such manner and by such method as the town may deem practicable in
the light of the conditions and attending circumstances of the case, in order
to determine the proper charge.  The user shall furnish a sampling point, as
defined in the sewer use ordinance, available to the town at all times.
   (A)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a biochemical
oxygen demand of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid or suspended solids in
excess of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid or ammonia in excess of 25
milligrams per liter of fluid.  Additional charges for treating stronger-than-
normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis:
      (1)   Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids.  There shall be an
additional charge of $.17  per pound of suspended solids for suspended solids
received in excess of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid.
      (2)   Rate surcharge based upon BOD.  There shall be an additional charge
of $.17 per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for biochemical oxygen demand
received in excess of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid.
      (3)   Rate surcharge based upon NH3.   There shall be an additional
charge of $.12 per pounds of ammonia for NH 3 received in excess of 25
milligrams per liter of fluid.
   (B)   The determination of suspended solids, 5-day biochemical oxygen
demand, and ammonia contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the
current edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage and
Industrial Wastes, as written by the American Public Health Association, the
American Water Works Association and the Water Pollution Control Federation.
(1996 Code, § 9-39)  (Ord. 1989-5, § 5, passed 11-7-1988)
§ 53.35  BILLING AND COLLECTION PROCEDURES.
   The rates and charges shall be prepared, billed and collected by the town in
the manner provided by law and ordinance.
   (A)   The rate and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed
monthly.  At the end of each year, each user shall be given a notice of the
rates charged and the basis for the charges for operation, maintenance and
replacement.
   (B)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying
the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but
the billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in the event
payment is not made as herein required.  The owners of properties serviced,
which are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to examine the
collection records of the town for the purpose of determining whether bills
have been paid by the tenant or tenants, provided that the examination shall be
made at the office at which the records are kept and during the hours that the
office is open for business.
   (C)   As provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when due are
declared to be delinquent and a penalty of 10% of the amount of the rates or
charges shall thereupon attach thereto.  The time at which the rates or charges
shall be paid is now fixed at 17 days after the date of mailing of the bill.
(1996 Code, § 9-40)  (Ord. 1989-5, § 6, passed 11-7-1988)
§ 53.36  BIENNIAL STUDIES ON RATES AND CHARGES.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain
proportional to the cost of providing services to the various uses of user
classes and that the charges may remain sufficient to fund adequately the
necessary replacement costs and other revenue and reserve requirements, the
town shall cause a study to be made no less than biennially, following the date
on which this subchapter goes into effect.  The town shall, upon completion of
the study, revise and adjust the rates and charges as necessary in accordance
therewith, in order to maintain the proportionality and sufficiency of the
rates. The study shall include but not be limited to an analysis of the costs
associated with the treatment of excessive strength effluents from industrial
users, volume and delivery flow rate characteristics attributed to the various
users or user classes, the financial position of the sewage works and the
adequacy of its revenue to provide adequate funds for the operation and
maintenance, replacements, debt service requirements and capital improvements
to the waste treatment systems.  The study shall be made for the purpose of (1)
reviewing the sufficiency of the revenues to operate properly the wastewater
treatment facility and all appurtenances attached thereto; and (2) maintaining
proportionality among the user classes of the rates and charges for sewage
services.
   (B)   The studies shall be conducted by officers or employees of the town,
or by a firm of certified public accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers
which firms shall have experience in such studies, or by a combination of
officers, employees, certified public accountants or engineers as the town
shall determine to be best under the circumstances.

HOUSE NUMBERING
§ 150.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter shall be to set standards for house numbering
in the town, and to establish the authority and methods to be used when
assigning addresses to properties in the town.  These standards shall be used
to establish residence locations which will be used in the implementation of an
Enhanced 911 emergency response system in Putnam County.  It is intended to
provide continuity, avoid duplication, and prevent general confusion regarding
the location of developed parcels of land in the Town of Bainbridge.
(1996 Code, § 7-45)  (Ord. 1992-7, § 1, passed 11-11-1992)
§ 150.02  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BLOCK INTERVAL.  The 100-number interval is the distance between grid lines,
or the point where the next highest block number designation is used.
   CUSTOMER (ADDRESSEE).  A family, individual, residence, business, or
industry which receives mail at a delivery point.
   LOT. A lot is a designated parcel, tract, development, or area of land which
either is now being or will be used eventually for construction of a structure.
   PRIMARY ADDRESS NUMBER (CITY-TYPE ADDRESS). The numeric or alphanumeric
component of a city-type address which precedes the street name.
(1996 Code, § 7-46)  (Ord. 1992-7, § 2, passed 11-11-1992)
§ 150.03  THE PROPERTY ADDRESS NUMBERING SYSTEM; ADVANTAGES.
   A street numbering system and corresponding property addresses provide
individual structures with an exact geographic location in the county.  City-
type street/road addresses are necessary in order to provide a structure with a
specific and more accurate identification for efficient mail delivery; to
provide an easily identifiable geographic reference point for quick dispatch of
police, fire, and emergency rescue equipment; to provide utility companies with
a permanent address record for billing and service calls tied to a specific
structure; and to provide ease of location identification for friends, service
vehicles, or other individuals trying to locate a specific structure.  A
numbering system should make it easy for anyone to find the location of a
residential property in a short period of time and allow for a systematic
expansion of address numbers as community growth occurs.
(1996 Code, § 7-47)  (Ord. 1992-7, § 3, passed 11-11-1992)
§ 150.04  ASSIGNMENT OF OFFICIAL PERMANENT PROPERTY ADDRESSES.
   All residential, commercial, industrial, and public structures located in
the town shall be assigned permanent city-type street addresses. 
   (A)   Structures located on the south side of an east-west street/road and
those located on the west side of a north-south street/road shall have an even
number property address. 
   (B)   Structures located on the north side of an east-west street/road and
those located on the east side of a north-south street/road shall have an odd
number property address.
(1996 Code, § 7-48)  (Ord. 1992-7, § 4, passed 11-11-1992)
§ 150.05  PLACEMENT AND SIZE OF ADDRESS NUMBERS.
   Once a property address has been assigned to a specific structure, it shall
be the responsibility of the property owner or resident to provide the address
number on the structure, mailbox, or mailbox post in the rural area, or on a
sign facing the street/road in a non-rural area.  Numbers are to be placed on
structures in a location which faces the street upon which it is addressed. 
The numbers, and the complete address if desired, should be placed on the
structure near a main entry door or on a cornice, porch and the like that is
located at least 5 feet above the threshold on the right side (as you are
standing outside facing the door) of any entrance door.  In all situations,
property numbers and lettering shall be no less than 3 inches in vertical
height, and the color of the letters shall contrast with the background of the
mailbox or structure, in order to be readable.  Street address numbers and
lettering shall be placed in a visible location on all residential, commercial,
industrial, and public structures on or before July 1, 1993.

shows 33% or more damage or deterioration of its supporting member or members,
or 50% damage or deterioration of its nonsupporting members, enclosing or
outside walls or coverings;

         (b)   Freely accessible to persons for the purpose of committing
unlawful acts.
      (13)   Whenever any building or structure has been constructed, exists,

characteristics, or weather-resisting qualities or characteristics required by
law, in the case of a newly constructed building of like area, height, and
occupancy in the same location;
      (15)   Whenever a building or structure, used or intended to be used, for
dwelling purposes, because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, decay,
damage, faulty construction or arrangement, inadequate light, air or sanitation
facilities, or otherwise, is determined by the Putnam County Sanitarian to be
unsanitary, unfit for human habitation, or in such a condition that is likely
to cause sickness or disease;
