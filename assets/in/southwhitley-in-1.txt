   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the town, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered, and consolidated into component codes,
titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the “South
Whitley Town Code”, for which designation “code of ordinances”, “codified
ordinances”, or “code” may be substituted. Code title, chapter, and section
headings do not constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.

same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.

   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless

resolve a conflict between two or more sections.

reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or division.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters, or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.

incorrectly stated; on the effective date of that ordinance or following the
effective date, the rights, powers, duties, or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority, or

   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section

proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture, or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12  LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice

judgment, the employee's absence would create serious operational difficulties.

of the jury duty absence. Accrual for benefits calculations, such as vacation,
sick leave, or holiday benefits, will not be affected during paid or unpaid
jury duty leave.

   (B)   Beginning on the first day of an accident or eighth day for a sickness
(outside of employment) the insurance plan will pay 50% of the regular pay

the insurance plan will pay 66.66% of the regular pay scale up to a maximum of
$1,500 per month for a period of two years. In addition, the town will
compensate the employee the difference between the insurance payments
(including workers' compensation payments) and the employee's regular salary
for the first 30 days.
   (C)   The town provides a comprehensive workers' compensation insurance
program at no cost to employees. This program covers any injury or illness

hospital treatment. Subject to applicable legal requirements, workers’
compensation insurance provides benefits after a short waiting period or, if
the employee is hospitalized, immediately.
   (D)   Any employee who sustains a work-related injury or illness shall

§ 35.29  HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS CONTINUATION.
    The Federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) gives
employees and their qualified beneficiaries the opportunity to continue health
insurance coverage under the town's health plan when a “qualifying event” would
normally result in loss of eligibility. Some common qualifying events are
resignation, termination of employment, or death of an employee; a reduction in
the employee's hours or a leave of absence; an employee's divorce or legal
separation; and a dependent child no longer meeting eligibility requirements.
Under COBRA, the employee or beneficiary pays the full cost of coverage at the
town's group rates plus an administration fee set by the Town Council. The town
provides each eligible employee with a written notice describing rights granted
under COBRA when the employee becomes eligible for coverage under the
employer's health insurance plan. The notice contains important information
about the employee's rights and obligations.

§ 35.38  SEXUAL AND OTHER UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT.

discrimination and unlawful harassment. Actions, words, jokes, or comments
based on an individual's sex, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or any other

   (A)   The Town of South Whitley is a drug and alcohol-free workplace. The
use of or being under the influence of illegal drugs and/or alcohol is

and alcohol and misuse of prescribed and over the counter drugs subjects
employees and visitors to unacceptable safety risks that undermine the town's
ability to operate safely, effectively and efficiently.
   (B)   The use, possession, distribution or sale of controlled substances
such as drugs or alcohol, being under the influence of such controlled
substances (drugs and alcohol) or testing positive for alcohol or any drug

with the use of such drugs is strictly prohibited while on duty, while on town
premises or work sites or while operating the town's equipment or vehicles.
   (C)   The town participates in post-offer, random and post-accident drug and
alcohol testing. If injured on the job you may be expected to participate in a
drug and alcohol test immediately following the injury.
   (D)   Over the counter (OTC) drugs may be possessed in the original
container and administered, as needed and consistent with label instructions.
   (E)   Physician-prescribed medication may be possessed in the original
container and used by the designated patient, provided such use impairs neither
job performance, nor workplace safety.
   (F)   Since misuse of controlled-substances is a treatable illness, an
employee participating in the town's medical insurance program may be eligible
for Insurance benefits. If the employee does not seek help for controlled
substance abuse, and the problem comes to the attention of the town, then the
employee will be subject to disciplinary action.
   (G)   Any person convicted of a drug or alcohol-related crime based upon
conduct while working for the town, must notify the person's supervisor within
five days of such conviction.
   (H)   Any violation of this policy will result in adverse employment action
up to and including dismissal and referral for criminal prosecution.

time, with notice as required by law for formal action. Nothing contained in

arrangement between two otherwise separate systems; one of which contains
potable water from the town water system and the other from a private source,
water of unknown or questionable safety, or steam, gases, chemicals; whereby
there may be a flow from one system to the other, the direction of flow
depending on the pressure differential between the two systems.
   (B)   No person, firm, or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established, or maintain or permit to be maintained, any cross-connection. No
interconnection shall be established whereby potable water from a private,
auxiliary, or emergency water supply, other than the regular public water
supply of the town, may enter the supply or distribution system of the
municipality, unless such private auxiliary or emergency water supply and the
method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the
town water utility and by the state’s Department of Environmental Management in
accordance with 327 I.A.C. 8-10.
   (C)   It shall be the duty of the Water Department to cause inspections to
be made of all properties served by the public water system where cross-
connections with the public water system are deemed possible. The frequency of
inspections and re-inspections, based on potential health hazards involved,
shall be established by the Water Department.
   (D)   Upon presentation of credentials, the representative of the Water
Department shall have the right to request entry at any reasonable time to
examine the property served by a connection to the public water system of the
town for cross-connections. On request, the owner, lessee, or occupant of any
property so served shall furnish to the inspection agency with any pertinent
information regarding the piping system or systems on such property. The
refusal of access or refusal of requested pertinent information shall be deemed
evidence of the presence of cross-connections.
   (E)   The town water utility is hereby authorized and directed to
discontinue water service to any property wherein any connection in violation
of this section exists, and to take such other precautionary measures deemed
necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water system.
Water service shall be discontinued only after reasonable notice is served on
the owner, lessee, or occupants of the property or premises where a violation
is found or suspected to exist. Water service to such property shall not be
restored until the cross-connection(s) has been eliminated in compliance with
the provisions of this section.
   (F)   If it is deemed by the town water utility that a cross-connection or
an emergency endangers public health, safety, or welfare and requires immediate
action, and a written finding to that effect is filed with the Town Clerk-
Treasurer, and delivered to the consumer’s premises, service may be immediately
discontinued. The consumer shall have an opportunity for a hearing within ten
days of such emergency discontinuance.
   (G)   All consumers using toxic or hazardous liquids, all hospitals,
mortuaries, wastewater treatment plants, laboratories, and all other hazardous
users shall install and maintain a reduced-pressure, principal backflow
preventer in the main water line serving each building on the premises. The

backflow prevention device is necessary for the safety of the public water
system, the Water Department Supervisor will give notice to the water consumer
to install such an approved device immediately. The water consumer shall, at
his, her, or its own expense, install such an approved device at a location and
in a manner approved by the Water Department Supervisor, and shall have
inspections and tests made of such approved devises as required by the Water
Department Supervisor and in accordance with IDEM Rule 327 I.A.C. 8-10.

   (H)   The owner(s) or authorities, or agents thereof, of any parcel of
ground unto which a water well is to be installed, or replacement of an
existing water well is planned, shall obtain a written permit signed by the
Health Officer before any construction begins. The owner shall apply for a
permit on a form provided by the Health Officer. The applicant shall supplement
the application with plans, specifications, and other information deemed
necessary by the Health Officer. The Health Officer shall then make a site
review of the area proposed, in person, within two working days of the filed
application. The Health Officer will provide drawings of area(s) in which the
water well may be placed, to the owner, and well driller. The applicant shall
pay a permit and inspection fee of $10, as established under I.C. 16-1-4-24, to
the County Health Department at the time the application is filed. The fee
shall be accounted for and paid into the County Health Department. The
installation or repair of well lines, screens, pump, pressure tanks, and the
like are exempted unless a new well is also installed.
   (I)   No permit for a water well shall become effective until the
installation is completed to the satisfaction of the Health Officer. The Health
Officer shall be allowed to inspect the work at any stage of construction. The
applicant for the permit shall notify the Health Department when the well
construction is completed; during the day it was finished or the following
weekday. The Health Officer shall make the inspection within two working days
of the receipt of notice from the applicant.
   (J)   The Health Officer shall, upon the request of the applicant, sample
and test the new water well for total conform, nitrate/nitrogen, and any other
substances as deemed necessary by the Health Officer. The applicant may employ
private laboratory personnel, from state-certified labs, to conduct the
required test under the direction of the Health Officer. The Health Officer
may, in any event, conduct tests deemed necessary by the Health Officer. All
final sample results must be within acceptable primary standards as established
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for public drinking water
sources. All fees and charges for water testing shall be the responsibility of
the individual property owner.
   (K)   All water tests shall be ran according to the most recent Standard
Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater. These test results will be
provided in writing to the Health Department within 45 days from the date of
well completion. The failure of a water well to meet any of these primary water
quality standards will constitute grounds for rejection of the water well by
the Health Officer.
   (L)   The applicant will post the permit in a conspicuous place at or near
the building where the water well is under construction. The notice shall be
plainly visible from the public thoroughfare nearest this building.
   (M)   Subdivisions designed to utilize water wells, the plans for which were
duly recorded in the office of the County Recorder prior to January 1, 1997,
are exempt from the provisions of this subchapter regarding location, and may
be located in accordance with the best judgment of the Health Officer.
   (N)   The water well permit is valid for a term of one year from the date of
issue, unless otherwise voided by the Health Officer.
   (O)   In cases of extreme emergency and when the Board of Health is not open
for public business, a water well may be installed without first obtaining a
local permit; provided, that the property owner or his or her agent obtains a
local well permit within the next working day. The water well must meet all
other requirements of this subchapter.
   (P)   No person shall install a water well in the town without being
licensed by the state’s Department of Natural Resources, under authority of
I.C. 25-39-3.

dewatering well governed by divisions (E)(8) or (E)(9) below), shall be filled
with natural clay materials, neat cement, bentonite slurry, or medium-grade or
coarse-grade or pelletized bentonite from the bottom of the borehole to a depth
of no less than 25 feet below ground surface. The borehole shall be filled with
neat cement, or medium-grade or coarse-grade crushed or pelletized bentonite
from a depth no less than 25 feet below ground surface to within two feet below
ground surface. The remaining borehole shall be filled with natural clay
material to ground surface.
      (6)   A cased or uncased monitoring well shall be plugged from the bottom
of the well or borehole to the ground surface with a bentonite slurry or
pelletized or coarse-grade crushed bentonite.
      (7)   A bucket well shall be plugged as follows.
         (a)   A bucket well installed as buried slab construction shall be
filled with gravel from the bottom of the well to within ten feet below the
ground surface. Neat cement, bentonite slurry, or pelletized, medium-grade, or
coarse-grade crushed bentonite shall be installed in the casing or well pipe
from no less than ten feet below the ground surface to within two feet below
the ground surface. The well pipe shall be severed at least two feet below the
ground surface and covered with a cement plug larger in diameter than the well
pipe. The remaining hole shall be filled with natural clay material to the
ground surface.
         (b)   Bucket well construction using casing with an inside diameter of
less than 12 inches extending the entire length of the borehole and equipped
with a well screen shall be abandoned under division (E)(4)(a) above.
         (c)   An uncased borehole drilled by a bucket rig shall be filled with
natural clay material from the bottom of the hole to the ground surface. The
clay material shall be thoroughly tamped to minimized settling.
         (d)   For other than buried slab construction, a bucket well shall be
filled with gravel from the bottom of the well to at least five feet below
ground surface. The top section of the concrete or tile well casing shall be
removed to cause the top of the well to terminate below ground surface, the top
section of the concrete or tile well casing shall be removed to cause the top
of the well to terminate below ground surface. The well shall be filled with at
least one foot or neat cement bentonite slurry, or pelletized medium-grade, or
coarse-grade crushed bentonite from at least five feet below ground surface to
the top of the well casing. The well casing shall be covered with a cement plug
larger in diameter than the borehole. The remaining borehole shall be filled
with natural clay material to ground surface.
      (8)   If a dewatering well casing is removed following use, the remaining
borehole shall initially be filled with granular, pelletized, medium-grade, or
coarse-grade crushed bentonite a minimum of one foot thick. The remainder of
the borehole shall be filled with natural earth materials obtained during the
drilling process to the ground surface and be thoroughly tamped to minimize
settling.
      (9)   If a dewatering well casing is removed following use and the well

borehole shall be filled with natural earth materials obtained during the
drilling process to the ground surface and be thoroughly tamped to minimize
settling.
   (F)   The Division of Water shall be notified in writing of a well
abandonment within 30 days after plugging is completed.
(Ord. 98-3-1, passed - -1998)
§ 51.34  CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   In the event that any provision of this subchapter is ultimately
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to conflict with any provision
of the state’s Department of Natural Resources Code, Title 310, and I.C. 25-39-
1.5; then and in any such event, the more strict provision shall govern.
   (B)   In the event that any provision of this subchapter is ultimately
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be preempted by any state or
federal law or regulation, this subchapter shall automatically be deemed
amended by eliminating the preempted provision and incorporating in its place
the applicable provision of the preempting state or federal law or regulation.
   (C)   Each provision of this subchapter shall be construed as separate, to
end that if any part of it shall be held invalid for any reason, the remainder
shall continue in full force and effect.
   (D)   Compliance with the requirements of this subchapter does not obviate
or eliminate the necessity of complying with any other applicable federal,
state, or local laws and regulations affecting water wells.
(Ord. 98-3-1, passed - -1998)
§ 51.35  HEALTH OFFICER.
   It is hereby acknowledged, understood, and declared by the Town Council that
under this subchapter the Health Officer is required to exercise and is vested
with the authority to exercise his or her discretion and judgment in order to

this subchapter is hereby declared to be discretionary.
(Ord. 98-3-1, passed - -1998)
§ 51.36  DISCLAIMER.
   Because of many interrelating factors contributing in the failure of a water
well, acceptance of a water well does no imply approval, and it cannot be
considered as a guarantee by the Board of Health of successful potability or
operation. The Health Officer’s signature merely signifies that as of the date
of signing the water well meets the Board of Health’s minimum standards. The
Health Officer’s signature makes no other representation.

shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at the control manhole.
   (C)   In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control
manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public
sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected.
   (D)   Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, CBOD5,  ammonia and suspended solids analyses are
obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH is determined from
periodic grab samples. (CBOD5, ammonia includes five-day carbonaceous
biochemical oxygen demand).

(Prior Code, § 52.76)  (Ord. 91-12-1, passed 12-10-1991)
§ 52.076  CERTAIN RATES MODIFIED DUE TO STRENGTH, CHARACTER OF DISCHARGE.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered to industrial users, the town shall base its
charges not only on the volume, but also on the strength and character of the
stronger-than-normal industrial sewage and wastes which it is required to treat
and dispose of. The town shall require the owner or other industrial user to
determine the strength and content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either
directly or indirectly, into the sanitary sewage system, in a manner and by the
method as the town may deem practicable in the light of the conditions and
attending circumstances of the case, in order to determine the proper charge.
The owner or other user shall furnish a central sampling point available to the

   (A)   In order that the single-family domestic and residential users of
sewage service shall not be penalized for sprinkling lawns during the summer
months of May, June, July, and August, the billing for sewage service for
residential or domestic users for said months shall be based on the water usage
for the previous month of April.
   (B)   In the event the water usage for the previous month of April is
greater than the water usage for the summer month, then the billing for sewage
services shall be computed on the actual water used in the month for which the
sewage service bill is being rendered.
   (C)   Domestic or residential sewage service, as applicable to the
sprinkling rate, shall apply to each lot, parcel of real estate, or building
which is occupied and used as a single-family residence. Said sprinkling rate
shall not apply to any premises which are partially or wholly used for
commercial or industrial purposes. In the event a portion of such premises
shall be used for commercial or industrial purposes, the owner shall have the
privilege of separating the water served through a separate meter purchased and
maintained at the owner’s expense, and in such case, the water usage as
registered by the water meter serving such portion of the premises used for
residential purposes shall qualify for the sprinkling rate.

regulations of the town as hereinafter provided for, and shall be collected in
the manner provided by law and ordinance. The rates and charges will be billed
to the tenant or tenants occupying the property served unless otherwise
requested in writing by the owners, but the billing shall in no way relieve the
owner from liability in the event payment is not made as herein required.
   (B)   The owners of the properties served which are occupied by tenants
shall have the right to examine the collection records of the town for the
purpose of determining whether the rates and charges have been paid by the
tenants, provided that the examination shall be made in the office in which the
records are kept and during the hours that the office is open for business.

   (A)   In order that the fees and charges for sewage services may remain fair
and equitable and be in proportion to the cost of providing services to the
various users or user classes, the town shall cause a study to be made within a
reasonable period of time following the first full calendar year of operation,
subsequent to the completion of the improvement project. The study shall
include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the costs associated with the
treatment of excessive strength effluents received from industrial users as
defined by the Environmental Protection Agency, the volume and delivery flow
rate characteristics attributable to the various users or user classes, the
financial position of the sewage works and the adequacy of its revenue to
provide reasonable funds for operation and maintenance, replacements, debt
service requirements, and capital improvements to the waste treatment system.
   (B)   Thereafter, on an annual basis, within a reasonable period of time
following the normal accounting period, the town shall cause a similar study to
be made for the purpose of reviewing the fairness and equity of the fees and

§ 152.01  PERMIT REQUIRED.
   Before any mobile home may be located on any real estate within the
jurisdictional limits of the Plan Commission, regardless of the zoning of the
real estate, a permit shall be required, issued by the Building Commissioner
upon the consent and direction of the Plan Commission after the following
procedure has been followed.
(Prior Code, § 152.01)  (Ord. 1-77, passed 2-14-1977)  Penalty, see §
152.99
§ 152.02  APPLICATION FOR PERMIT.
   (A)   An application in a form to be designed by the Plan Commission
containing such information as the Commission shall desire shall be filed with
the Clerk-Treasurer together with a fee in the sum of $25 or other amount as
the Plan Commission may from time to time determine. The application shall
designate the location to be used for the mobile home, the size of the real
estate involved, the make and model of the mobile home, the arrangements for
water and sewer or sanitary system, and such other information as the Plan
Commission may desire.
   (B)   At the next regular meeting of the Plan Commission, the plan shall be
considered. If the application meets the requirements of the Plan Commission
and of this chapter, the Plan Commission may grant the permit, although the
Plan Commission shall not be obligated to grant a permit if it feels that the
granting of the same is not harmonious with the other provisions of the master
plan and Zoning Code and would interfere with the use of surrounding real
estate or the value of the same if granted.
   (C)   If the application is approved, the Plan Commission shall direct the
Building Commissioner to issue a permit, which permit shall specify any
restrictions or requirements of the Plan Commission placed upon the owner. The
permit may be either for a permanent location of a mobile home or a temporary
location of a mobile home to be occupied during the construction of a permanent
residence for a period of not more than 12 months.

   This chapter shall be effective and this procedure is binding upon the
owners of any presently existing mobile home within the jurisdictional limits
of the Plan Commission in the event the ownership of the mobile home shall
change after the date of adoption of this chapter. It is the intent of this
chapter not to affect preexisting mobile homes but that the same shall be
binding upon any future owners of the mobile homes, and their failure to comply
with this chapter may result in a cease and desist order being issued pursuant
to the terms of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 152.05)  (Ord. 1-77, passed 2-14-1977)
§ 152.06  MOBILE HOMES NOT TO BE RENTED.

152.99
§ 152.07  VIOLATIONS.
   If any person shall cause to be installed a mobile home within the
jurisdictional limits of the Plan Commission without complying with this
chapter or if the ownership of a preexisting mobile home changes hands without
the new owner complying with this chapter, the Building Commissioner shall
notify the Plan Commission, which shall issue a cease and desist order giving
the owner of the mobile home a period of 30 days in which to either remove the
mobile home or submit the appropriate application and comply with the terms of
any permit which may be granted.
(Prior Code, § 152.07)  (Ord. 1-77, passed 2-14-1977)

to compel the removal of the same by an action in the nature of ejectment or
eviction, if applicable, or may impose a fine in the amount of not more than
$2,500 per day until the use is discontinued. Any fine imposed and uncollected
may be certified to the County Treasurer to be assessed against the property
and collected as taxes.

angle of more than ten degrees in the alignment of a street occurs, a curve
shall be introduced providing for:
      (1)   Major streets, a minimum radius of 300 feet, but should be greater
wherever possible; and
      (2)   Other streets, a minimum radius of 100 feet, but should be much

      (3)   The subdivider shall provide the subdivision with standard street
signs at the intersection of all streets.
   (F)   Grades.
      (1)   Streets shall be completed to grades and to specifications as shown

filed with the Town Council.
   (H)   Variance. Where the subdivider can show that a provision of divisions
(C), (D), or (E) above would cause unnecessary hardship if strictly adhered to
and where, in the opinion of the Commission, because of topographical or other
conditions peculiar to the site, a departure may be made without destroying the
intent of the provision, the Commission may authorize a variance. Any variance
thus authorized is required to be entered in writing in the minutes of the
Commission and the reasoning on which the departure was justified set forth.

LEGAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.001  TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited hereinafter as the “Zoning
Chapter of the Town of South Whitley”.
(Ord. 01-04-01, passed 4-10-2001)
§ 154.002  PURPOSE.
   (A)   As established by I.C. 36-7-4-601, the purpose of this chapter is to
regulate and control the zoning of land and the consequent use of said land
within the town, and its jurisdictional area, in order to secure adequate
light, air, convenience of access; safety from fire, flood, and other danger;
lessen or avoid congestion in public ways; and promote the public health,
safety, comfort, morals, convenience, and general welfare.
   (B)   To achieve these purposes, these regulations are specifically designed
to:
      (1)   Protect the character and stability of residential, recreational,
commercial, industrial, and open space areas within the town and promote their
orderly and beneficial development;
      (2)   Provide privacy and convenience of access to property;
      (3)   Regulate the intensity of land use and establish open areas
surrounding buildings and structures necessary to provide adequate light and
ventilation, and to protect public safety and health;
      (4)   Regulate and limit the height of buildings and structures;
      (5)   Lessen and avoid congestion on public streets by providing for off-
street parking and loading areas;
      (6)   Regulate and limit the density of population based on the town’s
ability to provide for water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other essential
public services, buildings, or structures permitted within;
      (7)   Divide the town into zoning districts and establish by reference to
a map, the boundaries of said districts;
      (8)   Fix reasonable standards to which land, buildings, structures, and
their uses must conform;
      (9)   Prohibit uses, buildings, or structures which are incompatible with
the character of development or uses, specified zoning districts;
      (10)   Prevent illegal additions or alterations of existing buildings or
structures;
      (11)   Protect against fire, explosion, noxious fumes, odors, heat, dust,
smoke, glare, noise, vibration, radioactivity, and other nuisances and hazards,
in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare;
      (12)   Prevent the overcrowding of land and the undue concentration of
buildings and structures so far as is possible and appropriate in each zoning
district by regulating the land around them;
      (13)   Preserve and enhance the taxable value of land, buildings, and
structures throughout the town and its jurisdictional area;
      (14)   Provide for the completion, restoration, reconstruction, or
extension of non-conforming uses (see §§
154.025 through
154.034);
      (15)   Designate and define the powers and duties of the official(s)
administering and enforcing this chapter; and
      (16)   Provide penalties for the violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 01-04-01, passed 4-10-2001)
§ 154.003  INTERPRETATION AND CONFLICT.
   (A)   Minimum requirements. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of these regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements
for the promotion of public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   Conflict with public and private provisions.
      (1)   Public provisions. The regulations are not intended to interfere
with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or
other provision of law. Where any provision of these regulations imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or
regulation, or other provision of law, those provisions which are more
restrictive or impose higher standards shall control.
      (2)   Private provisions. These regulations are not intended to abrogate
any easement, covenant or any other private agreement or restriction, provided
that where the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or impose
higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant, or other private
agreement or restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall govern.
Where the provisions of the easement, covenant, or private agreement or
restriction impose duties and obligations more restrictive, or higher standards
than the requirements of these regulations, or the determinations of the
Commission in enforcing these regulations and such private provisions are not
inconsistent with these regulations or determinations thereunder, then such
private provisions shall be operative and supplemental to these regulations and
determinations made thereunder. Private provisions can only be enforced
privately unless a public agency such as the Plan Commission has been made a
party to such agreements.
(Ord. 01-04-01, passed 4-10-2001)
§ 154.004  COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS.
   The regulations set by this chapter within each district shall be minimum
regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or
land, except as hereinafter provided.
   (A)   No building shall be erected, converted, placed, enlarged,
reconstructed, or structurally altered, nor shall any building or land be used
except for a purpose and in the manner permitted in the district in which the
building or land is located.
   (B)   No land required for yards, open spaces, or off-street parking or
loading spaces about an existing building or any building hereafter erected or
structurally altered shall be considered as required yard or lot area for more
than one building, unless otherwise provided for in this chapter.
   (C)   Every building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be
located on a lot, and in no case shall there be more than one principal
commercial or residential building on one lot, except as otherwise provided in
this chapter.
   (D)   The provisions of these regulations shall be considered the minimum
requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, morals, comfort,
and general welfare. Where the provisions of the regulations of this chapter
impose greater restrictions than those of any other statute, ordinance, or
regulation, the provisions of this chapter shall be controlling. Where the
provisions of any other statute, ordinance, or regulation impose greater
restrictions than this chapter, the provisions of such statute, ordinance, or
regulation shall be controlling.
   (E)   This chapter is not intended to abrogate or annul any easement,
covenant, or other private agreement. However, where any provision of this
chapter is more restrictive or imposes a higher standard or requirement than
such easement, covenant, or other private agreement, the provisions of this
chapter shall govern.
(Ord. 01-04-01, passed 4-10-2001)

§ 154.006  SAVING PROVISIONS.
   This chapter shall not be construed as abating any action now pending under,
or by virtue of, prior existing zoning ordinance, or as discontinuing, abating,
modifying, or altering any penalty accruing or about to accrue, or as affecting
the liability of any person, firm, or corporation, or as waiving any right of
the town under any section or provision existing at the time of the effective
date of this chapter, or as vacating or annulling any rights obtained by any
person, firm, or corporation, by lawful action of the town except as shall be
expressly provided for in this chapter.

of zoning appeals now or hereafter established, to restrict or regulate the
exercise of the power of eminent domain by the state or by its agencies.

for a change of a zoning district classification be approved for all or only a
portion of the property described in the application.
         (c)   Approval of a different classification. The Plan Commission may
recommend, and the Town Board may approve, a zoning district classification
other than the classification requested in the application as long as the
recommended and approved zoning district is of the same “family” and of lower
intensity. (Example: Requested zoning district classification is R-2, Plan
Commission may recommend R-1, but not R-3 or commercial, industrial, or other
classification “family”.)
      (2)   The Town Council. After receiving at the Plan Commission’s
certification on the proposed amendment, the Town Council may proceed to take
action on the proposed amendment. At the first regular meeting after the
proposed amendment is certified, the Town Council may adopt, reject, or amend
the proposal.
         (a)   Adoption. If the Town Council adopts the proposal as certified
by the Plan Commission, it takes effect as any other ordinance.
         (b)   Failure to act. If the Town Council fails to act upon the
proposal within 90 days following the Plan Commission’s certification, the
action recommended by the Plan Commission in their certification shall
automatically take effect.
         (c)   Rejection or amendment. If the Town Council rejects the action
recommended by the Plan Commission’s certification, or amends the proposal
contrary to the recommendation of the Plan Commission, the proposal shall be
returned to the Plan Commission for its further consideration, with a statement
of the Town Board’s reasons for the rejection or amendment.
            1.   If the Plan Commission approves the action of the Town
Council, or fails to act within 45 days of the Town Council’s report, the Town
Board’s action stands as passed by the Town Council, upon the filing of the
Commission’s report of approval, or the end of the 45-day period.
            2.   If the Plan Commission rejects the Town Council’s action, the
original action of the Town Board stands only if confirmed by another vote of
the Town Board within 45 days following the report of the Plan Commission’s
rejection. If the Town Board fails to confirm its original action within this
45-day period, then the action recommended in the Plan Commission’s original
certification on the proposed amendment takes effect.
      (3)   Basis for consideration and action. In preparing and/or considering
proposals to amend this chapter, the Plan Commission and the Town Council shall
pay reasonable regard to:
         (a)   The comprehensive plan;
         (b)   The current conditions and the character of current structures
and uses in each district;
         (c)   The most desirable use for which the land in each district is
adapted;
         (d)   The conservation of property values within the neighborhood and
jurisdiction; and
         (e)   Responsible development and growth.
      (4)   Burden of proof. In assessing the relevance or acceptability of a
proposed amendment, the burden of proof in justifying the request shall rest
with the applicant, both before the Plan Commission and the Town Council.
      (5)   Withdrawal. Any request for withdrawal of a legally filed
application for an amendment to this chapter must be filed in writing and must
be applied for prior to final action on the proposal by the Plan Commission.
   (G)   Reapplication for amendments. In the event that any application to
amend this chapter is denied on final review by the Town Council, reapplication
for the purposes of additional review of the same application shall not be
accepted by the Plan Commission until 12 months following the date of the final
action on the original application has elapsed, unless it can be shown to the
satisfaction of the Plan Commission that substantial new evidence, not
available during the original review of the application, will be presented.

certifications, inspection of property, and issuance of stop work, stop use
orders, and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.
   (A)   Designation of the Administrator. The Town Council hereby designates
the Plan Commission as the Administrator for the purposes of implementing this
chapter and has the principal responsibility for enforcing this chapter. The
Plan Commission shall have the following duties with respect to this chapter:
      (1)   May designate one or more additional members of the Commission, as
well as members of other town departments who have a particular skill or

appropriate permits;
      (4)   May cause the cessation of any erection, construction,
reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance, or use in violation of
this chapter by issuing a stop work or stop use order;
      (5)   May adopt such administrative policies as it deems necessary to the
carrying out of its enforcement responsibilities, which policies shall have
general applicability to cases of similar character;
      (6)   May determine the actual location of a boundary line between zoning

of Zoning Appeals in accordance with §§
154.215 through
154.220;
      (7)   May refer any violation of this chapter to the Plan Commission
Attorney for prosecution or other appropriate action when deemed necessary; and
      (8)   May exercise any other authority granted by the provisions of this
chapter or any other town ordinances.
   (B)   Permits, orders, and certifications.
      (1)   It shall be unlawful to commence or to proceed with the erection,
construction, major reconstruction, conversion, alteration, enlargement,
extension, razing, or moving of any building or structure or any portion
thereof; no new use, extension, or alteration of an existing use, or conversion
from one use to another, shall be allowed in any building, structure, or land
or part thereof, until issuance of a proper permit; except for the raising of
agricultural crops, orchards or forestry, without first having applied in
writing to the Department (Building Commissioner) for an ILP/BP (improvement
location/building permit) to do so and an ILP/BP has been granted therefor.
However, this requirement shall not be interpreted as including normal
maintenance or minor repair of existing structures. Primary responsibility for
securing the necessary permits shall be the property owner’s.
      (2)   However, if the property owner should contract part or all of the
proposed work, it is the responsibility of the person or firm hired to ensure
that all required permits and approvals have been secured prior to any work
being initiated.
      (3)   Blank forms shall be provided by the Department for the use of
those applying for permits as provided in this chapter. Any permits issued by
the Department shall be on standard forms for such purpose. There shall be a
separate permit for each building or structure to be constructed, altered, or
erected, except for accessory buildings which may be included in the permit for
the principal building when construction is simultaneous. Following issuance of
the required permit, the applicant’s copy shall be prominently posted at the
site of the proposed work to the public view.
      (4)   Any ILP/BP under which no construction work has been commenced
within one year after the date of issuance of said permit, or under which
proposed construction has not been completed within eighteen months of the time
of issuance, shall expire by limitation. A new permit must be obtained before
any further construction can occur. The new permit will be issued on the basis
of the entire original project, and fees assessed accordingly.
      (5)   A permit may be revoked by the Department at any time prior to the
completion of the building or structure for which the same was issued, or after
the change of character of use, when it shall appear to it that there is
departure from the plans, specifications, or conditions as required under terms
of the permit, that the same was procured by false representation or that any
provisions of this chapter are being violated.
      (6)   Written notice of such revocation shall be served upon the owner,
his or her agent or contractor, or upon any person employed on the building or
structure for which such permit was issued, via a stop-work order for
construction, which shall be posted in a prominent location, or a certified
letter citing the violation(s) for the character of use, and thereafter no such
construction or use shall proceed in violation of this chapter.
      (7)   No building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be
constructed or altered until issuance of a proper ILP/BP. No building or
structure or part thereof shall be occupied without issuance of a certificate
of occupancy by the Building Commissioner.
      (8)   Pending the issuance of a regular certificate of occupancy, a
temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued by the Department for a period
not exceeding 30 days from the issuance of the temporary certificate of
occupancy, during completion if not deemed to endanger health or safety. Upon
expiration of the original temporary certificate of occupancy, one extension
not exceeding 30 days may be granted provided there remains no danger to health
or safety.
      (9)   Pending issuance of a regular certificate of occupancy, a partial
certificate of occupancy may be issued to allow use of completed portions of
any new construction or alterations provided the area(s) for which the partial
certificate of occupancy is issued contain no circumstances or conditions which
may endanger health or safety.
      (10)   Certificate of occupancy shall state that the building or proposed
use of a building or land complies with all the building, health laws, and
ordinances of the town and with the provisions of these regulations. A record
of all certificates shall be kept on file in the office of the Town Clerk, and
copies shall be furnished, on request, to any person having a proprietary or
tenancy interest in the building affected. No fee shall be charged for a
certificate of occupancy.
      (11)   The cessation of any erection, construction, reconstruction,
alteration, conversion, or maintenance in violation of this chapter may be
effected by posting a stop work order, stating the nature of the violation, to
the owner of the property involved or to his or her agents or to the person
doing the work.
      (12)   Permits or certificates issued on the basis of approved plans and
applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in
approved plans and applications, and no other use, arrangement, or
construction. Use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and punishable as
provided by §
154.999.
   (C)   Entry and inspection of land and buildings.
      (1)   The Building Commissioner or his or her authorized representatives
are hereby empowered, to the fullest extent of the law in performance of their
assigned functions, to enter upon any land within the jurisdictional area of

allowed. It is the intent of these regulations to identify those forms of
manufactured homes which may be located outside of manufactured home
developments as well as to identify those requirements and limitations
applicable to them in conformance with state law.
   (B)   Definitions for manufactured housing.
      (1)   Manufactured home. A dwelling unit, designed and built in a
factory, which bears a seal certifying that it was built in compliance with the
federal manufactured housing construction and safety standards law (42 U.S.C.
§§ 5401 et seq.). This seal is currently placed on the outside on the back left
side. It is currently silver framed with a red background.
      (2)   Modular home. A dwelling unit, designed and built in a factory,
which bears a state modular unit label, stating it was built in compliance with
applicable state laws. This label is currently placed in the electrical box.
   (C)   Classification of qualifying manufactured homes. Qualifying
manufactured homes shall be classified either a Type I or Type II manufactured
home as defined herein.
      (1)   Type I Manufactured Home. A Type I manufactured home shall be a
dwelling unit consisting of a double section or larger multi-section unit.
These units may be either federally inspected manufactured homes or state
inspected modular homes for the purpose of this chapter. Use of an expando or
add-a-room unit in conjunction with a single-section manufactured home shall
not be considered a qualifying dwelling unit for this classification.
      (2)   Type II Manufactured Home. A Type II manufactured home shall be a
dwelling unit consisting of a single section, either with or without expando or
add-a-room units. A mobile home, as defined in division (B) above, is a Type II
manufactured home for the purpose of this chapter.
   (D)   Qualifying manufactured homes.
      (1)   Manufactured housing meeting the following criteria may be located
outside of manufactured home developments and within those zoning districts
where other forms of residential housing are allowed, subject to the
requirements and limitations of the respective districts.
      (2)   Such manufactured homes shall:
         (a)   Have been constructed within the last ten years and a location
permit issued within this minimum period of time;
         (b)   Have more than 950 square feet of occupied space;
         (c)   Have siding material of a type customarily used on
conventionally built residences, as specified in division (E)(1) below;
         (d)   Have roofing material of a type customarily used on
conventionally built residences, as specified in division (E)(1) below;

         (h)   Be anchored to the ground, in accordance with the state’s One-
and Two-Family Dwelling Code and manufacturer’s specifications;
         (i)   Have utilities connected in accordance with the state’s One- and
Two-Family Dwelling Code and manufacturer’s specifications; and
         (j)   Receive all required permits and inspections, and conform with
the zoning ordinances and all other town ordinances.
   (E)   Appearance/installation standards.
      (1)   Approved siding materials. Type I and II manufactured homes shall
use one or more of the following siding materials:
         (a)   Residential horizontal aluminum lap siding;
         (b)   Residential horizontal vinyl lap siding;
         (c)   Cedar, Redwood, or other decorative wood lap siding;
         (d)   Wood grain, weather resistant, press board siding;
         (e)   Stucco siding; or
         (f)   Brick or stone siding.
      (2)   Special exceptions. The Board of Zoning Appeals may approve other
forms of residential siding as a special exception in those instances where it
can be specifically shown by the applicant that the material proposed is
compatible with that used on conventionally built housing in the immediate
neighborhood of the proposed location. Vertical, riveted, or welded metal
siding shall not qualify for consideration under this provision.
      (3)   Approved roofing materials.
         (a)   Type I and II manufactured homes shall use one of the following
roofing materials on a roof pitched according to the design specifications of
the respective material:

            4.   Tile materials.
         (b)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may approve other forms of roofing
materials as a special exception in those instances where it can be
specifically shown by the applicant that the material proposed is compatible
with that used on conventionally built housing in the immediate neighborhood of
the proposed location. Tarpaper, tar or asphalt “build-up” roofs, or riveted or
welded metal roofing shall not qualify for consideration under this provision.
      (4)   Permanent foundation.
         (a)    Type I and II manufactured homes shall be placed upon a
permanent foundation. For the purposes of this chapter, a PERMANENT FOUNDATION
is defined as a structural system that:
            1.   Transfers loads imposed by the home to firm substrata;
            2.   Has a lower surface placed below the frostline;
            3.   Is attached to the home in such a way as to secure the home to
the foundation so that the home becomes a part of the real estate; and
            4.   Causes the home to be assessed for taxation as an improvement
to the real estate.
         (b)   The design and construction of these load-bearing foundations
shall be in conformance with the requirements of the state’s One- and Two-
Family Dwelling Code and with the manufacturer’s installation specifications.
      (5)   Permanent perimeter enclosure. Type I and II manufactured homes
shall utilize a permanent perimeter enclosure. For the purposes of this
chapter, a PERMANENT PERIMETER ENCLOSURE shall mean a structural system
consisting of materials such as Portland cement, mortared cement block, or
mortared brick completely enclosing (with the exception of required openings)
the space between the floor joists of the home and the under-floor grade. The
permanent perimeter enclosure and the permanent foundation may be constructed
as a unified structural system for those homes with a design compatible with
such an approach. Design and construction of the permanent perimeter enclosure
shall comply with the requirements of the state’s One- and Two-Family Dwelling
Code.
      (6)   Structural alteration. Due to its integral design, any structural
alteration or modification of a manufactured home after it is placed on the
site shall be approved by the authorized County Building Administrator.

§ 154.087  NON-CONFORMING MANUFACTURED HOMES.
   (A)   Non-conforming homes. Where, on or before the date of adoption of
these ordinances, a manufactured or mobile home has been lawfully placed and
maintained on a tract of land that would no longer be permissible under the
provisions of this chapter, such home may be continued to be used, at that
location, so long as it conforms to the other applicable requirements of this
chapter.
   (B)   Replacement of non-conforming homes. If following the date of adoption
of these ordinances, should a non-conforming manufactured or mobile home be
removed, it shall only be replaced by a manufactured home conforming to the
requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 01-04-01, passed 4-10-2001)
§ 154.088  MANUFACTURED/MOBILE HOME PARK.
   (A)   Purpose. The Manufactured/Mobile Home Park (MMHP) designation is
intended to provide for and encourage the organization and development of
mobile homes and other pre-manufactured dwellings in a single-family
residential neighborhood setting, and to:
      (1)   Bring about manufactured home developments which are an asset to
the community and to prevent the development of those which would be a
detriment to the community;
      (2)   To promote manufactured home developments with the character of
residential neighborhoods;
      (3)   To protect the health, safety, and welfare of manufactured home
residents and the surrounding community;
      (4)   To harmonize this type of residential development with other
existing and proposed land uses; and
      (5)   To assure adequate service by essential public facilities and
services such as roads, police, water and sewers, drainage structures, and that
the establishment of any manufactured home development shall not equal
excessive public expense for the facilities and services.
   (B)   Location of manufactured/mobile home park. To adequately ensure the
purpose of the manufactured/mobile home park designation, applicants will be
required to be in an R-2 Residential District and to acquire a special
exception as set forth in §§
154.215 through
154.220.
   (C)   Limitation on permitted uses. Within all non-conforming parks, the
permitted uses of such parks shall be limited to the following:
      (1)   Manufactured homes, mobile homes, and modular homes;
      (2)   Accessory buildings or structures, under park management and
supervision, used only as office space, storage, laundry facilities, recreation
facilities, garage storage, or other necessary service for park resident use
only. An accessory building or structure shall not exceed 25 feet in height, or
two stories; and shall meet the requirements of the town’s Building Code;
      (3)   Each residence may have one accessory building on a lot. The
accessory building shall not exceed a height of 16 feet, nor two stories in
height, nor be closer than five feet from any side or rear property line;
      (4)   Signs as regulated by §§
154.195 through
154.204; and
      (5)   Location permits will be issued by the county’s Building
Department.
   (D)   General regulations.
      (1)   Minimum development area. The total land area of a manufactured
home development shall be not less than ten acres.
      (2)   Application of regulations. A manufactured home unit shall not be
permitted to occupy a site, either initially when brought into a manufactured
home development or upon addition to or replacement of an existing manufactured
home, which violates the yard or area requirements established herein. It is
recognized that due to the pre-manufactured nature of such homes, lots
exceeding the minimum area requirements of this chapter may be necessary to
accommodate some models within the required yard setbacks. Recognizing this
fact, it is assumed that suitable provision will be made by the developers of
the manufactured home development in their advance planning to provide for such
homes in their design. Based upon this guideline, the fact that the size of a
particular home, or class of home, would create a violation of any of the yard
requirements of this chapter when applied to a specific lot, shall not, in
itself, be considered an adequate basis for the granting of a variance from
such requirements. Further, it is the express intent of this chapter to
encourage and promote manufactured home developments similar in nature to and
recognizable as single-family residential neighborhoods. The mere desire of an
individual to rezone a single lot or a series of lots not clearly in
conformance with the intent, shall not be considered adequate basis for a
variance from the minimum development size requirements previously stated in
this chapter.
      (3)   Recorded plat required. No permit for the erection or location of a
manufactured home within a manufactured/mobile home park shall be issued until
a subdivision plat for the land encompassed by the manufactured home park has
been approved in accordance with the requirements of the subdivision
regulations. It is the intention of this requirement to provide for the
eventual sale of the lots within the manufactured home development to the home
owners who shall reside upon those lots. The recording of a site plan or other
similar instrument shall not be considered as meeting this requirement.
      (4)   Minimum accommodations. Recognizing that a variety of manufactured
buildings exist not specifically designed for residential purposes, each
manufactured home placed, erected, or located within a manufactured home
development shall contain, at a minimum, a flush toilet, sleeping
accommodations, a tub or shower bath, kitchen facilities, and plumbing and
electrical connections designed for attachment to appropriate external systems.
      (5)   Permanent foundation/perimeter enclosure required. All manufactured
homes located within an approved manufactured home development shall be placed
upon a permanent foundation and provided with a perimeter enclosure as defined
by §
154.086. For the purposes of this chapter, placement of a manufactured home
upon uniform jacks or blocks, upon a concrete pad, skirted with sheet metal,
aluminum, wood, or other temporary material, and secured by tie-downs, shall
not be considered a permanent foundation and perimeter enclosure meeting this
requirement.
   (E)   Area regulations and performance standards.
      (1)   Park area regulations and performance standards.
         (a)   The minimum area for a manufactured/mobile home park is ten
acres.
         (b)   A 40-foot wide buffer zone along the perimeter of the
manufactured/mobile home park shall contain plantings so as to provide an
opaque barrier or screen between the park and adjacent property and along
adjacent roadways. No plantings or other visual barriers shall encroach beyond
the home park property line. No home or accessory structure shall encroach upon
the buffer zone.
         (c)   Manufactured homes shall be located on lots containing an area
of at least 4,500 square feet or more.
         (d)   For uses other than manufactured homes, the lot area shall be
adequate to provide the yard area required to meet the setback requirements of
this district and the off-street parking requirements contained in §§
154.175 through
154.181, but in no case shall be less than 4,500 square feet.
         (e)   Not less than 10%, exclusive of community building facilities,
of the gross area of the parks, and not less than 10% of any expansion area,
must be improved for recreational activity for the residents of the park.
         (f)   The park shall be provided with primary and secondary access
points with suitable signage placed in a landscaped setting.
      (2)   Individual lot area regulations and performance standards.
         (a)   Minimum lot depth shall be 100 feet.
         (b)   Minimum lot width at the minimum building setback line shall be
45 feet. Where a lot fronts on a cul-de-sac, a 35-foot lot width at the street
right-of-way is required. Lot width must be a minimum of 60-feet at the
building line.
         (c)   Front yard setback: not less than 25 feet.
         (d)   Side yards setback: not less than eight feet on each side of the
dwelling.
         (e)   Rear yard setback: not less than ten feet.
         (f)   The height of structures within the park shall not exceed 25
feet or two stories. Accessory structures shall not exceed 16 feet.
         (g)   Off-street parking for two vehicles shall be provided for each
home (excluding the garage). In no case shall that portion of the paved area
designated for the off-street parking encroach upon the street right-of-way.
   (F)   Development standards.
      (1)   Design and construction of improvements. All improvements
including, but not limited to, roadways, sidewalks, storm drainage facilities,
water distribution facilities, and sanitary sewer facilities shall be designed
and constructed in conformance with the adopted standards and specifications of
the town for public improvements, whether intended as private improvements
maintained by the owner(s) or for eventual dedication to the town.
      (2)   Access. A lot within a manufactured home development shall have
frontage on and access to a public or private street. Where double-frontage
lots occur, access shall be limited to the minor street.
      (3)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks not less than four feet in width shall be
required on both sides of all interior streets. In those instances where the
manufactured home development borders one side of an arterial or collector
street, sidewalks conforming to this requirement shall only be required upon
that side of the street.
      (4)   Underground utilities. All electric, telephone, and other utilities
extended within the home development to each lot shall be constructed
underground. All water and sanitary sewage service connections shall not exceed
ten feet in length above ground directly beneath the manufactured home, and
shall be suitably protected against freezing.
      (5)   Street trees required. A deciduous tree of a minimum of two inches
in caliper, as measured one foot above the ground level, shall be planted on
each lot within the manufactured/mobile home park.
Some trees, such as ailanthus, silver maple, poplar, boxelder, catalpa, or
willow have roots which penetrate through or under the surface of any public
place in the town, therefore they are hereby declared to be an undesirable
species of tree for street planting.
      (6)   Landscape maintenance. The landscaping materials depicted upon the
approved plat shall be considered a binding element of the project. The
developer, his or her successor, or subsequent owners of the overall
development shall be responsible for its continued maintenance. Plant material
which exhibits evidence of insect pests, disease, and/or damage shall be
removed and replaced within the next planting season. This maintenance
responsibility shall rest with the developer and subsequent owners for the
duration of the manufactured/mobile home park.
      (7)   Street lights. Street lights are required to be put in at the
developers expense, as per Town Council.
(Ord. 01-04-01, passed 4-10-2001)
§ 154.089  NON-CONFORMING MANUFACTURED/MOBILE HOME PARK.
   (A)   General. Mobile home parks are a historic anachronism. Originally
designed to serve the same function as today’s recreational vehicle parks and
campgrounds, changes in technology and the public’s attitudes towards the use
of mobile homes as residences have largely changed mobile home parks from
locations of temporary occupancy to locations of permanent residence.
Unfortunately, as mobile homes have become larger and more permanent, the
design and organization of mobile home parks have not correspondingly changed
to keep pace. As a result, such parks often reflect unacceptable density of
development, lack of open space, substandard private improvements, and a
general lack of amenities, among other problems, not conducive to the
development of a single-family residential neighborhood.
   (B)   Intent. Non-conforming mobile home parks are declared by this chapter
to be incompatible with the buildings, structures, and uses permitted by this
chapter. Such parks are not to be expanded and should be reduced to conformity
as quickly as the fair interest to the parties involved will permit. With this
background, it is the intent of this section to permit such non-conforming
parks to continue until such time as they are discontinued, damaged (see
division (G) below), or removed.
   (C)   Application of the regulations. Where, on the date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter, a lawful mobile home park existed that is no longer
permissible under the provisions of this chapter, such mobile home park may
continue so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following
provisions.
      (1)   Violations not validated. A non-conforming mobile home park in
violation of a provision of the ordinance which this repeals shall not be
validated by the adoption of this chapter.
      (2)   Enlargement. No such non-conforming mobile home park shall be
enlarged, expanded, or extended to occupy, on the date of adoption or amendment
of this chapter, and no additional accessory use, building, or structure shall
be established thereon, unless in complete compliance with the requirements of
this chapter; nor shall the mobile homes within the existing site be rearranged
to increase their number or density within the existing confines of the park.
      (3)   Relocation. No such non-conforming mobile home park shall be moved
in whole or in part to any other portion of such parcel or lot not so occupied
on the date of adoption of this chapter.
      (4)   Destruction. Should any such non-conforming mobile home park be
destroyed by any means to an extent of 50% or more of its replacement, it shall
not be reconstructed except in conformity with the requirements of this
chapter. (See division (B) above.)
      (5)   Discontinuance. If such non-conforming mobile home park ceases to
exist for any reason for a period of more than 180 consecutive days (except
where government action causes such cessation), the subsequent use of such
parcel or lot shall conform to the regulations and provisions set by this
chapter for the district in which such parcel or lot is located.
   (D)   Ownership. Non-conforming mobile home parks shall remain in one
ownership and shall be primarily designed for the purpose of renting spaces for
the placement of mobile home dwelling units. In no instance shall a non-
conforming mobile home park be sold as individual lots for permanent mobile
home residence.
   (E)   Minimum distances. Within all non-conforming mobile home parks, the
minimum distances maintained between mobile homes shall be maintained as they
currently exist on the date of adoption of this chapter, subject to no existing
violation being present from the previous ordinance which this chapter repeals.
In no case shall the mobile homes within a non-conforming mobile home park be
rearranged to increase their number or density within the existing confines of
the park. In addition, these minimum distances shall be subject to the health
and safety requirements of the town’s adopted Building Fire Codes, applicable
state laws, and/or a development plan previously approved by the town.
   (F)   Minimum accommodations. All mobile homes within non-conforming mobile
home parks shall be subject to the requirements of §
154.088(D)(4).
   (G)   Limitation on permitted uses. Within all non-conforming mobile home
parks, the permitted uses of such park shall be limited to the following:
      (1)   Manufactured homes, mobile homes, and modular homes;
      (2)   Accessory buildings or structures, under park management and
supervision, used only as office space, storage, laundry facilities, recreation
facilities, garage storage, or other necessary service for park resident use
only. An accessory building or structure shall not exceed 25 feet in height,
nor two stories; and shall meet the requirements of the town’s Building Code;
      (3)   Each residence may have one accessory building on a lot. The
accessory building shall not exceed a height of 12 feet, nor two stories in
height, nor be closer than five feet from any side or rear property line; and
      (4)   Signs as regulated by §§
154.195 through
154.204.
   (H)   Periodic replacement of mobile homes. Recognizing the mobile home
parks are designed for the purpose of renting or leasing locations for mobile
homes owned by others, it is understood that, from time-to-time, existing
mobile homes within the park will be replaced. Such replacements are
permissible, provided the other requirements of this chapter are maintained.
   (I)   Park maintenance. Park owners and management are required to maintain
the physical and natural facilities and features of the park in a neat,
orderly, and safe condition.
   (J)   Parking. No parking area or parking space which exists at the time
this chapter becomes effective or which subsequent thereto is provided for the
purpose of complying with the provisions of this chapter shall thereafter be
relinquished or reduced in any manner.
   (K)   Siding/skirting. All manufactured or mobile homes without a permanent
perimeter enclosure shall have an approved foundation siding/skirting enclosing
the entire perimeter of the home. Foundation siding/skirting and back-up
framing shall be of weather-resistant, non-combustible or self-extinguishing
materials, which blend with the exterior siding of the home. Below grade level
and for a minimum distance of six inches above finish grade, the materials
shall be unaffected by decay or oxidation. The siding shall be installed in
accordance with the manufacture’s recommendations or approved equal standards.
The siding shall be ventilated by openings, which shall have a net area of not
less than one and one-half square feet for each 25 linear feet of exterior
perimeter. The openings shall be covered with corrosion resistant wire mesh not
larger than one-half inch in any dimension. The under-floor area shall be
provided with an 18-inch by 24-inch minimum size access crawl hole, which shall
not be blocked by pipes, ducts, or other construction interfering with the
accessibility of the under-floor space, or other approved access mechanism.
   (L)   Support system. All mobile homes not placed on a permanent foundation
shall be installed on a support system in conformance with the manufacturer’s
installation specifications or with the support system regulations in the ANSI/
NFPA 501A 1977 installations standards.
   (M)   Existence of a non-conforming mobile home park. In cases of doubt, and
on specific questions raised concerning whether a mobile home park has non-
conforming status, or if an element of such park has non-conforming status, it
shall be treated as a question of fact and shall be decided by the Board of
Zoning Appeals.

increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health and safety.
   (A)   Standards. Within the floodway identified on the flood boundary and
floodway map or the flood insurance rate map, the following standards shall
apply.
      (1)   No development shall be allowed which, acting alone or in
combination with existing or future development works, will cause any increase
in the elevation of the regulatory flood.
      (2)   For all project involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees), the town shall submit the data and request to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency to revise the regulatory flood data.
   (B)   A Zones. Within all SFHAs identified as A Zones (no 100-year flood
elevation and/or floodway/floodway fringe delineation has been provided), the
following standard shall apply. The total cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
will not increase the regulatory flood elevation more than one-tenth of one
foot and will not increase flood damages or potential flood damages.
   (C)   Public health standards in all SFHAs.
      (1)   No development in the SFHA shall include locating or storing
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, pollutants, or
other hazardous or toxic materials below the flood protection grade, unless

DEVELOPMENT PLAN APPROVAL
§ 154.155  INTENT.
   It is recognized by this subchapter that there is a value to the public in
establishing safe and convenient traffic movement to and from higher density
sites, both within the site and on the access streets; that there is value in
encouraging a harmonious relationship of buildings and uses both within a site
and in relation to adjacent uses; that there is a value in insuring that new
development is an investment in the continued quality of life of the community
rather than a cost; and further, that there are benefits to the public in
conserving natural resources. Toward this end, the review and approval of a
development plan by the Plan Commission is required of certain buildings and
types of development that can be expected to have an impact on natural
resources, traffic patterns and intensity, adjacent land uses, and the
character of future urban development.

(Ord. 01-04-01, passed 4-10-2001)
§ 154.178  SCREENING AND LANDSCAPING.
   (A)   Screening. All parking and loading areas shall be properly screened
and landscaped as hereinafter set forth. It is the purpose and intent of this
section to require adequate protection for contiguous property against
undesirable effects from the creation and operation of parking or loading areas
and to protect, improve, and preserve the appearance and character of the
surrounding neighborhoods and of the town through the screening effects and
aesthetic qualities of such landscaping.
   (B)   Innovative landscape plans. It is recognized that standardized
requirements are not always responsive to all situations and circumstances. In
order to provide an avenue for the development of creative approaches to
landscaping, the Plan Director, in conjunction with the town’s Utility
Department, shall have the authority under this section to approve innovative
landscape plan. Such plans may vary the arrangement and location of landscaping
and landscape areas, such as clustering of trees, berming, and locating of
plots for traffic control purposes that provide for unique and functional
designs using topography and existing site characteristics, provided the total
area of all landscaping and the total amount of landscape materials is
maintained.
   (C)   Plan denied. In those instances where a plan is denied, or the
applicant is aggrieved of any decision of the town’s Utility Department, the
applicant may appeal said decision to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 01-04-01, passed 4-10-2001)
§ 154.179  ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Determination of required number of spaces.
      (1)   Fractional spaces. When determination of the number of off-street
parking spaces required by this regulation results in a fractional space, the
fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded, and a fraction in excess of
one-half shall be counted as one parking space.
      (2)   Floor area. Floor area, when used as a measurement for determining
the number of parking spaces for office, merchandising, or service uses, shall
mean the gross floor area used, or intended to be used for service to the
public as patrons or patients, including areas occupied by fixtures and
equipment used for display or sale of merchandise. It shall not include areas
used principally for non-public purposes such as storage, processing or
packaging of merchandise, show windows, or rest rooms or utilities, dressing,
fitting, or alteration rooms. Within restaurants, kitchen areas will not be
included. The burden shall rest with the applicant to provide the detailed
information necessary to prove what should or should not be included.
      (3)   Beds. Bassinets shall not be counted as beds in determining the
number of parking spaces based upon the number of beds.
      (4)   Employees. Employees, when used as a measurement for determining
the number of parking spaces for a new or established expanding business, shall
be considered the total number of employees present upon the property during
the maximum shift.
   (B)   Parking exception for churches. Off-street parking facilities required
for churches may be reduced by 50% where churches are located in nonresidential
districts and within 300 feet of usable public or private off-street parking
areas, and further provided that an agreement filed on record with the County
Recorder is provided reflecting that the use of such accessory parking
facilities by the church will be permitted by the property owner. For the
purposes of this chapter, the term CHURCH shall be considered a building used
principally for religious worship, but shall not include or mean an
undertaker’s chapel, funeral building, a religious educational building, day
care center, group home of any nature, or any other similar venture.
   (C)   Parking for multiple use buildings. The number of parking spaces
required for land or buildings used for two or more purposes, shall be the sum
of the requirements for the various uses, computed in accordance with this
chapter. Parking facilities for one use shall not be considered as providing
the required parking facilities for any other use, except churches.
   (D)   Use of required parking spaces. Required accessory off-street parking
facilities provided for the commercial and industrial uses hereinafter listed
(in § 154.180) shall be solely for the parking of motor vehicles in operating
condition of patrons, occupants, or employees of such uses and shall not be
used for the storage of other vehicles, boats, motor homes, campers, mobile
homes or materials, or for the parking of delivery trucks or tractor trailers
used in conducting the business or use. In no case shall any parking spaces
devoted to the principal use of a lot be leased, rented, or sold for the
purpose of use by any other person, firm, company, corporation, or use other
than those located upon the property.
   (E)   Exception. In the event of special limited time sales or seasonal
events, the Board of Public Works and Safety may grant a temporary permit for a
specified period, with the opportunity for renewal for a longer period.
   (F)   Number of entrances and exits. There shall be not more than one
entrance and one exit or one combined entrance and exit along any street. In
the instance of multiple properties along street frontage, the Director of the
town’s Utility Department may require the use of joint access points and the
recording of appropriate cross-easements at his or her discretion. Concerning
corner lots located at the intersection of a major and minor road, the access
to the parking area shall be limited to the minor road. In the instance of the
intersection of two major roads, the access to the parking area shall be as
approved by the Director of town’s Utility Department for the alleviation of
traffic congestion and interference of traffic movement along the related
street.
   (G)   Accessory parking lots. All required off-street parking or loading
spaces shall be provided on the same parcel of land occupied by the use or
building to which it is appurtenant; provided, however, that where there are,
in the judgment of the Board of Zoning Appeals, practical difficulties in
satisfying the requirement for parking space and/or if the public safety or
convenience would be better served by another location, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may authorize an alternate location for any portion of the required
parking for a nonresidential use which will adequately serve the conditions:
      (1)   Required accessory off-street parking facilities may be provided
elsewhere than on the lot on which the principal use served is located,
provided that the property occupied as parking is in the same possession as the
principal use served, either by deed, by easement, or by long-term lease which
has a term equal to or exceeding the projected life of the facility occupied by
the principal use, and further provided that the owner shall be bound by
covenants filed on record in the office of the County Recorder, requiring the
owners, heirs, or assigns to maintain the required number of off-street parking
spaces during the existence of such principal use is provided to the Planning
and Building Department;
      (2)   Pedestrian access shall be available within a walking distance of
not more than 300 feet measured from the nearest point of public access to the
accessory parking area;
      (3)   Such separated parking space shall be usable without causing
unreasonable traffic congestion, detriment to any residential neighborhood or
hazard to pedestrians or vehicular traffic; and/or
      (4)   All accessory parking lots shall be located on property zoned
within the same or similar zoning district.
   (H)   Changes in use. No off-street parking space required under this
subchapter shall be used for any other purpose. Where a change in use creates
greater parking requirements than the amount being provided, an occupancy
permit shall not be issued until provision is made for the increased amount of
required off-street parking.
   (I)   Additions to buildings, structures, or uses. Where an addition is made
to an existing structure served by an existing non-conforming parking lot, only
the additional parking required for the proposed addition shall conform to all
of the requirements of this subchapter. The existing parking area shall not be
required to be reconstructed to come into conformance with the current off-
street parking requirements as a result of the addition, with the exception of
the paving requirements of §
154.177. However, these paving requirements shall only apply to customer or
tenant parking and the access drives to the street.
   (J)   Existing parking. No parking area or parking space which exists at the
time this chapter becomes effective or which subsequent thereto is provided for
the purpose of complying with the provisions of this chapter shall thereafter
be relinquished or reduced in any manner below the requirements established by
this chapter.
   (K)   Maintenance of parking facilities. Any persons operating or owning a
parking lot shall keep it free, as may be practical, of dust, loose particles,
trash, debris, and broken glass, and shall promptly remove the snow and ice
from the surface of the parking lot. Such persons shall also keep all adjacent
sidewalks free from dirt, ice, sleet, and snow and shall keep the sidewalks in
a safe condition for use by pedestrians. All signs, markers, or any other
methods used to indicate direction of traffic movement and location of parking
spaces shall be maintained in a neat and legible condition. Likewise any walls,
landscaping, including trees and shrubbery, as well as surfacing and curbing of
the parking lot, shall be maintained in good condition throughout its use for
parking purposes and the Director of Community Development and/or the Board of
Public Works and Safety shall have the authority to prohibit the use of the
area for parking purposes unless and until proper maintenance, repair, or
rehabilitation is completed, including the replacement of any landscaping
material which may die from time to time, or the failure of the landscape
irrigation or surface drainage system within the parking area.
   (L)   Shared parking. Notwithstanding the parking requirements set out in §
154.179, the number of parking spaces may be reduced by 20%, at the discretion
of the Board of Zoning Appeals, if the developer demonstrates that the parking
required is so located and designed such that shared parking within the
proposed development meets the minimum requirements of this subchapter. A
reduction in required parking shall not be permitted in those instances where
the Board of Zoning Appeals determines that there is a potential for changes in
use, over the short term, creating a change in the basic mixture of uses upon
which the justification for shared parking is based.
   (M)   Survey. For the purposes of this section, adequate data shall be
considered a professionally prepared survey, conducted under replicable
conditions, which yield a statistically significant result.

      (1)   Except where herein otherwise stated, the provisions of this
section shall be administered by the Plan Commission or by its designee.
      (2)   The Department (or its authorized representative) is hereby
empowered in performance of Departmental functions to enter upon any land in
the town for the purpose of making inspections, examinations, and surveys, or
to place and maintain thereon markers, notices, or signs required to effect
provisions of this subchapter. The above authorized person shall be required to
present proper credentials upon demand when entering upon any land or structure
for the purpose of this subchapter.
   (B)   Duties of the Plan Commission.
      (1)   The Commission shall have the power to grant sign permits and to
make inspections of buildings or premises necessary to carry out the
Commission’s duties in the enforcement of this subchapter.
      (2)   It shall be improper for the Commission to approve plans or issue
any permits or certificates for any sign until such plans have been inspected
in detail and found to be in conformance with this subchapter, nor shall the
Commission vary or change any terms of this subchapter.
      (3)   If the Commission shall find that any of the provisions of this
subchapter are being violated, the Commission shall notify in writing the
person responsible for such violations, indicating the nature of the violation.
The Commission shall order discontinuance of illegal use of land, buildings, or
structures; removal of illegal signage; discontinuance of any illegal work
being done; or shall take any other action authorized by this chapter to ensure
compliance with or to prevent violation of its provisions.
   (C)   Permit required.
      (1)   It shall be unlawful to commence or to proceed with the erection,
construction, reconstruction, conversion, alteration, enlargement, extension,
or moving of any sign or sign structure or any portion thereof without first
having applied in writing to the Commission for a sign permit to do so and a
sign permit has been granted therefor. Primary responsibility for securing the
necessary permits shall be the property owner’s. However, if the property owner
should contract part or all of the proposed work, it shall become the
responsibility of the person or firm hired to ensure that all required permits
and approvals have been secured prior to any work being initiated.
      (2)   Blank forms shall be provided by the Commission for the use of
those applying for permits as provided in this subchapter. Any permits issued
by the Commission shall be on standard forms for such purpose. There shall be a
separate permit for each sign to be constructed, altered, or erected.
      (3)   Any sign permit under which no construction work has been commenced
within six months after the date of issuance of said permit or under which
proposed construction has not been completed within one year of the time of
issuance shall expire by limitation.
   (D)   Voiding of sign permit. A permit may be revoked by the Commission at
any time prior to the completion of the sign for which the same was issued,
when it shall appear to him that there is any departure from the plans,
specifications, or conditions, as required under terms of the permit, that the
same was procured by false representation, or that any provisions of this
subchapter are being violated. Written notice of such revocation shall be
served upon the owner, his or her agent or contractor, or upon any person
employed of the building or structure for which such permit was issued, via a
stop-work order, which shall be posted in a prominent location, and thereafter
no such construction shall proceed.
   (E)   Compliance with sign permits. Sign permits issued on the basis of
approved plans and applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and
construction set forth in the approved plans and applications, and no other
use, arrangement, or construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at
variance with that authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter as
provided herein.
   (F)   Violations. If it is found that a sign is in violation of this
chapter, the Commission or its designee shall give notice to the owner of the
sign, or if the owner cannot be located, to the owner or property management
agent of the premises on which the sign is located or, if the sign erection is
not complete, to the sign erector, either personally, by U.S. Mail, or by
posting such a notice on the premises, such notice stating:

permit(s) and/or building permit(s) for which the variance was granted. The
improvement location permit and/or building permit(s) is good for one year from
the date it is obtained. If any further expansion, extension, enlargement,

owner with the condition or commitment of the grant, or with the terms of this
chapter in the same manner as if the variance had not been granted.
      (6)   Any variances granted prior to this chapter are subject to the
current provisions of this chapter.

Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, and all

special exception.
      (4)   If a special exception ceases or is discontinued at the site for a
12-month period during which time it is not succeeded by the same specifically

exception is required.

Appeals, upon filing of an application therefor by an interested person or the
Administrator, and upon finding at a public hearing, with notice to the
property owner, that the terms of this chapter or conditions of approval or
commitments have not been complied with.
      (6)   All special exceptions shall be approved for the originating

   A commercial or professional activity, regardless of whether engaged in for
profit, conducted by one or more residents in his, her, or their dwelling, or
structure accessory thereto, and is clearly incidental and secondary to the use
of the principal structure for dwelling purposes, and is located within a
residentially or agriculturally zoned district may be classified as a home
occupation.
   (A)   General restrictions and limitations. Home occupations shall be
permitted as an accessory use to a permitted residential use in any
residentially or agriculturally zoned district subject to the requirements of
this section.
      (1)   Home occupations shall be entirely operated from an enclosed, four-
walled structure, provided that all doors (including garage doors greater than
four feet in width) shall be kept closed during use of the structure for a home
occupation, except during incidental use for ingress and egress.
      (2)   Such use shall not occupy a total floor area greater than the
amount of square footage represented by 20% of the total square footage of the
principal structure whether operated from within the dwelling or in an
accessory structure. For the purposes of this section, “total floor area of the
dwelling” shall not include basements or cellars (whether finished for
habitation or not), garages (whether attached or detached), attics, or other
non-habitable portions of the residence. For the purposes of this section, the
total floor area occupied by the home occupation activity shall include the
total floor area of any room or rooms, where the home occupation is conducted
or supplies, material, inventory, or equipment is stored.
      (3)   The use of the property for an accessory home occupation shall be
clearly incidental and subordinate to its principal use as a residence by its
occupants, and shall not dominate or cause variations in the residential
character of the property, principal structure, or surrounding neighborhood.
      (4)   There shall be no visible evidence of the home occupation
including, but not limited to, alterations to the exterior of the residence
which changes the character thereof as a residence, exterior displays, or the
outdoor storage of materials or equipment used in the home occupation. For the
purpose of this section, “outdoor storage” shall include not only equipment or
materials generally used in the occupation, but also the accumulation of used,
discarded, or worn-out materials or manufactured products, any of which may or
may not be reusable or saleable.
      (5)   Parking generated by the conduct of the home occupation shall be
provided off-street and in conformance with this chapter. The conducting of the
home occupation shall in no way result in the parking of any motorized vehicle,
other than those owned and registered in the name of the residents, either upon
the lot upon which the home occupation is conducted, or the adjoining public or
private street, overnight or longer.
      (6)   The home occupation shall comply with the requirements of the
general performance standards of §§
154.025 through
154.034. In no case shall any equipment or process be used which creates visual
or audible interference in any radio or television receiver located off the lot
on which such home occupation is conducted, or which causes fluctuation in line
voltage beyond the property line of the lot upon which the home occupation is
conducted.
      (7)   The use of any tool or equipment powered by electricity, gasoline
or diesel engine, or high pressure gas shall not be used before 7:00 a.m. or
after 7:00 p.m. of any day.
      (8)   (a)   Permitted home occupations shall be limited to those
occupations conducted entirely by mail or telephone, those occupations in which
the offered goods or services are delivered directly to a location other than
the property where the home occupation is located, or those occupations where
items are picked up from the customer at a location other than the property
where the home occupation is located, the work performed, and then returned to
the customer at the customer’s location.
         (b)   Home occupations requiring customer visits to the location of
the home occupation for the purpose of receiving the goods or services offered
may be permitted by the Board of Zoning Appeals as a special exception.
      (9)   Persons who are not residents of the dwelling where the home
occupation is being conducted, and who are engaged either as employees,
subcontractors, independent contractors, or otherwise in the home occupation,
shall not exceed one.
      (10)   Non-illuminated home occupation wall sign not exceeding two square
feet wall-mounted on the dwelling; and, if allowed with the special exception,
one non-illuminated yard sign not exceeding six square feet in size per face.
Other restrictions may apply.
   (B)   Home occupation permits. No building or structure or part thereof
shall hereafter be used for the purposes of a home occupation without first
having applied in writing to the Plan Commission’s designated Administrator for
a home occupation permit to do so, and the required permit is issued. Blank
forms shall be provided by the Administrator for the use of those who apply for
a home occupation permit as required by this chapter. In those instances where
a special exception is required, the home occupation permit shall not be issued
until after the special exception has been granted by the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
   (C)   Home occupations permits nontransferable. All home occupation permits
shall be approved for the originating applicant for a specific location, and
may not be transferred to any other location by that applicant. Should the
property upon which the home occupation is conducted be sold or conveyed to a
different ownership or resident, a renewal of the home occupation permit will
be required.
   (D)   Revocation of home occupation permit. Upon a finding that an approved
home occupation permit has become unsuitable or incompatible with the
residential nature of the property or neighborhood where it is located through
non-compliance with any of the requirements of this chapter, the Board of
Zoning Appeals reserves full authority to revoke the home occupation permit.
The Board or its designee shall notify the property owner that such an action
is imminent, that the property owner will have 35 days in which to prepare a
response to the violations specified in the letter-of-intent to revoke the home
occupation permit, and that the Board shall schedule the matter for a public
hearing at the next available regular meeting date following the 35-day notice
period, at which time, all interested citizens will be given the opportunity to
be heard. Said notice to the property owner of the intent to revoke the home
occupation permit shall be delivered by either the U.S. Mail or through
personal service. The public hearing shall be advertised in accordance with
state law and the rules and procedures of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
