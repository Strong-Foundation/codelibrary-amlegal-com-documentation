breath, a physician of the Town's choice will evaluate him. If the physician
cannot find a legitimate medical explanation for the inability to provide a
specimen (either breath or urine), it will be considered a refusal to test. In
that circumstance the employee has violated one of the prohibitions of the
regulations.
   e.   Types of Tests. The Town has implemented six (6) circumstances for drug
and alcohol testing;
      1.   Pre-employment;
      2.   Post-accident testing;
      3.   Random testing;
      4.   Reasonable suspicion testing;
      5.   Return-to-duty testing; and
      6.   Follow-up testing.
   f.   Pre-Employment Testing. All applicants for driving positions must
submit to urine drug tests and breath alcohol tests.
   g.   Random Testing.
      1.   The Town conducts random drug and alcohol testing. The Town or its
agents will submit all employees' names to random selection system. The random
selection system provides an equal chance for each employee to be selected each
time random selection occurs. Random selections will be reasonably spread
throughout the year. The Town will select, at a minimum, 25 percent (25%) of
the average number of employees in each calendar year for random testing.
Random selection, by its very nature, may result in employees being selected in
successive selections or more than once a calendar year. Alternatively, some
employees may not be selected in a calendar year.
      2.   If an employee is selected at random, for either drug or alcohol
testing, a Town official will notify the employee. Once notified, every action
the employee takes must lead to a collection. If the employee engages in
conduct that does not lead to a collection as soon as possible after
notification, such conduct may be considered refusal to test.
   h.   Post-Accident Testing.
      1.   The employee must submit to drug and alcohol testing any time he or
she is involved in an accident . Following any accident, the employee must
contact the Town Superintendent, Clerk- Treasurer or Town Council President as
soon as possible. The employee shall then follow the instructions of the Town
representative contacted.
      2.   Any time a post-accident drug or alcohol test is required, it must
be performed as soon as possible following the accident. If no alcohol test can
be made within eight (8) hours, attempts to perform an alcohol test shall
cease. If no urine collection can be obtained for purposes of post-accident
drug testing within thirty-two (32) hours, attempts to make such collection
shall cease.
      3.   In the event that federal, state, or local officials conduct breath
or blood tests for the use of alcohol and/or urine tests for the use of
controlled substances following an accident, these tests may meet the
requirements of this section, provided the tests conform to applicable federal,
state, or local requirements. The Town may request testing documentation from
such agencies, and may ask the employee to sign a release allowing the Town to
obtain such tests results.
      4.   In the event an employee is so seriously injured that the employee
cannot provide a sample of urine, breath or saliva at the time of the accident,
the employee must provide necessary authorization for the Town to obtain
hospital records or other documents that would indicate the presence of
controlled substances or alcohol in the employee's system at the time of the
accident.
   i.   Reasonable Suspicion Testing. Reasonable suspicion for requiring a
employee to submit to drug and/or alcohol testing shall be deemed to exist when
an employee manifests physical or behavioral symptoms or reactions commonly
attributed to the use of controlled substances or alcohol. Such employee
conduct must be witnessed by at least one (1) supervisor. Should a supervisor
observe such symptoms or reaction, the employee must submit to testing.
   j   Authorization for Previous Test Records. The Town may obtain certain
drug and alcohol testing records from employee's previous employers for the
previous two (2) years. The Town will verify that no prior employer of the
employee has records indicating a violation of any rule pertaining to
controlled substance or alcohol use within the previous two (2) years. As a
condition of employment, the employee shall provide the Town with a written
authorization for all previous employers within the past two (2) years to
release such drug and alcohol testing records as the regulations require.
   k.   Drug Urinalysis.
      1.   Drug testing will be performed through urinalysis. Urinalysis will
test for the presence of drugs and/or metabolites of the following controlled
substances, including but not limited to:
         (a)   Marijuana;
         (b)   Cocaine;
         (c)   Opiates;
         (d)   Amphetamines; and
         (e)   Phencyclidine (PCP).
      2.   The urinalysis procedure starts with the collection of a urine
specimen. Urine specimens will be submitted to a certified laboratory for
testing. The laboratory will report all laboratory results to the Town
Superintendent and the Town Clerk-Treasurer.
      3.   Individual test results for applicants and employees will be
released to the Town and will be kept strictly confidential unless consent for
the release of the test results has been obtained. Any individual who has
submitted to drug testing in compliance with this policy is entitled to receive
the results of such testing upon written request to the Town Clerk-Treasurer
within fifteen (15) days from the date of said results being delivered to the
Town.
   l.   Alcohol Tests. The Town will perform alcohol testing using a breath-
testing device or a saliva-based testing device, and may be provided through a
vendor or agent. A technician who is certified will operate the device and
trained on the specific device he or she will be operating. The employee shall
report to the alcohol-testing site as notified by the Town. The employee shall
follow all instructions given by the alcohol technician. Employees with tests
indicating a blood alcohol content (BAC) of .04 or greater are considered to
have engaged in prohibited conduct, which may result in disciplinary action up
to and including termination. (Ord. No. 2000-20, 21-21-00)

issue will be held, and a ruling by the Town Council will be made within
fifteen (15) calendar days after the close of the hearing of the issue.

   For the purposes of this article, the following definitions shall apply
unless the content clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   a.   Tangible Assets: Assets that can be observed by one or more of the
physical senses. They may be seen and touched and, in some environments, heard
and smelled.
   b.   Fixed Assets: Tangible assets of a durable nature employed in the
operating activities of the unit and that are relatively permanent and are
needed for the production or sale of goods or services are termed property,
plant and equipment or fixed assets. These assets are not held for sale in the
ordinary course of business. This broad group is usually separated into classes
according to the physical characteristics of the items (e.g. land, buildings,
improvements other than buildings, machinery and equipment, furniture and
fixtures).
   c.   Capital Outlays: Expenditures which benefit both the current and future
fiscal periods. This includes costs of acquiring land or structures;
construction or improvement of buildings, structures or other fixed assets; and
equipment purchases having an appreciable and calculable period of usefulness.
These are expenditures resulting in the acquisition of or addition to the
government's general fixed assets.
   d.   Land.
      1.   The Town will capitalize all land purchases, without regard to cost.
      2.   Exceptions to land capitalization are land purchased outright, as
easements, or rights-of-way for infrastructure. Examples of infrastructures are
roads and streets, street lighting systems, bridges, overpasses, sidewalks,
curbs, parking meters, street signs, viaducts, and storm water collection.
      3.   Original cost of land will include the full value given to the
seller, including relocation, legal services incidental to the purchase
(including title work and opinions), appraisal and negotiation fees, surveying
and costs for preparing the land for its intended purpose (including
contractors and/or Town workers salary and benefits), such as demolishing
buildings, excavation, clean-up, and/or inspection.
      4.   A department will record donated land at fair market value on the
date of transfer plus any associated costs.
      5.   Purchases made using Federal or State funding will follow the source
funding policies and above procedures.
   e.   Machinery and Equipment.
      1.   The definition of machinery and equipment is: an apparatus, tool, or
conglomeration of pieces to form a tool. The tool will stand alone and not
become a part of a basic structure or building.
      2.   The Town will capitalize and tag items with an individual value
equal to or greater than $750.00. Machinery combined with other machinery to
form one unit with a total value greater that the above-mentioned limit will be
one unit.
      3.   Shipping charges, consultant fees, and any other cost directly
associated with the purchase, delivery, or set-up, (including contractors and/
or Town Works salary and benefits), which makes such equipment operate for its
intended purpose will be capitalized.
      4.   Improvements or renovations to existing machinery and equipment will
be capitalized only if the result of the change meets all of the following
conditions:
         a)   Total costs exceeds $750.00
         b)   The useful life is extended two or more years, and
         c)   The total costs will be greater than the current book value and
less than the fair market value.
      5.   Examples include:
         a)   A work truck being equipped with screens, lights, or radios for
use as a single unit throughout its life expectancy is considered one unit.
         b)   If police cars are constantly changing light bars or radios to
other vehicles, the Town will capitalize each piece of equipment separately, if
it meets the required dollar amount.
         c)   A department computer (CPU, monitor, keyboard, and printer) is
considered one unit.
      6.   A department will record donated machinery and equipment at fair
market value on the date of transfer with any associated costs.
      7.   Purchases made using Federal or State funding will follow the source
funding policies and above-procedures.
   f.   Buildings.
      1.   A department will capitalize buildings at full cost with no
subcategories for tracking the costs of attachments. Examples of attachments
are roofs, heating, cooling, plumbing, lighting or sprinkler systems, or any
part of the basic building. The, department will include the cost of items
designated or purchased exclusively for the building.
      2.   A department's new building will be capitalized only if it meets the
following conditions:
         a)   The total costs exceeds $5,000.00
         b)   The useful life is greater than two (2) years
      3.   A department improving or renovating an existing building will
capitalize the cost only if the result meets all of the following conditions:
         a)   The total cost exceeds $5,000.00
         b)   The useful life is extended two or more years, and
         c)   The total cost will be greater than the current book value and
less than fair market value.
      4.   Capital building costs will include preparation of land for the
building, architectural and engineering fees, interest cost (while under
construction), accounting costs if material, and any costs directly
attributable to the construction of a building.
      5.   A department will record donated buildings at fair market value on
the date of transfer with any associated costs.
      6.   Purchases made using Federal or State funding will follow the source
funding policies and above procedures.
   g.   Improvements Other than Buildings.
      1.   The definition of this group is improvements to land for better
enjoyment, attached or not easily removed, that will have a life expectancy of
greater than two (2) years.
      2.   Examples are walks, parking areas and drives, golf care paths,
fencing, retaining walls, pools, outside fountains, underground sprinkler
systems, and other similar items.
      3.   Improvements do not include roads, streets, or streets that are of
value only to the public. Roads or drives upon Town-owned land that provide
support to our facilities are assets. A sidewalk down the' road for public
enjoyment is an infrastructure improvement and is not capitalized. However,
sidewalks installed upon Town-owned land for use by the public and of the
support of our facility are capital assets.
      4.   The Town's new improvements other than buildings will be capitalized
only if it meets the following conditions:
         a)   The total costs exceeds $5,000.00
         b)   The useful life is greater than two (2) years
      5.   A department will capitalize improvements or renovations to the
existing improvements other than buildings only if the result meet the
following conditions:
         a)   The total cost exceeds $5,000.00
         b)   The asset's useful life is extended two or more years, and
         c)   The total cost will be greater than the current book value and
less than fair market value.
      6.   A department will record donated buildings at fair market value on
the date of transfer with any associated costs.
      7.   Purchases made using Federal or State funding will follow the source
funding policies and above procedures.
   h.   Historical Cost. The cash equivalent price exchanged for goods or
services at the date of acquisition. Land, buildings, equipment and most
inventories are common examples of items recognized under the historical costs
attribute.
   i.   Enterprise Funds. Those funds used to account for operations (a) that
are financed and operated in a manner similar to private business enterprise -
where the intent of the governing body is that the costs (expenses, including
depreciation) of providing goods or services to the general public on a
continuing basis be financed or recovered primarily through user charges; or
(b) where the governing body has decided that periodic determination of
revenues earned, expenses incurred, and/or net income is appropriate for
capital maintenance, public policy, management control, accountability and
other purposes.
   The enterprise funds of the Town of Ashley, Indiana shall include the
municipally owned water and sewage utilities. Operation of these utilities
shall require enterprise fund accounting and reporting. (Ord. No. 96-12, § 1,
10-14-96)
Sec. 2-121   Recording and Accounting.
   a.   The Town and its various departments shall classify capital
expenditures as capital outlays within the fund from which the expenditure was
made in accordance with the Chart of Accounts of the Cities and Towns
Accounting manual. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes all
expenditures necessary to put the asset into position and ready for use. For
purposes of recording fixed assets of the Town and its various Departments, the
valuation of assets shall be based on historical cost or where the historical
cost is indeterminable, by estimation for those assets in existence.
   b.   The Town's municipally owned utilities shall record acquisition of
Fixed Assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. When
an asset is purchased for cash, the acquisition is simply recorded as the
amount of cash paid, including all outlays relating to its purchase and
preparation for intended use. Assets may be acquired under a number of other
arrangements including:
      1.   Assets acquired for lump-sum purchase price
      2.   Purchase on deferred payment contract
      3.   Acquisition under capital lease
      4.   Acquisition by exchange of nonmonetary assets
      5.   Acquisition by self-construction
      6.   Acquisition by donation or discovery
   c.   Some of these arrangements present special problems relating to the
cost to be recorded, for example in utility accounting, interest during a
period of construction has long been recognized as a part of the asset cost.
Reference to an intermediate accounting usually will illustrate the recording
of acquisitions of assets under the aforementioned acquisition arrangements.
For purposes of recording fixed assets of the utilities, the valuation of
assets shall be based on historical cost.
   d.   In addition, an asset register (prescribed form 211) shall be
maintained to provide a detailed recording of the capital assets of the
governmental unit. (Ord. No. 96-12, § 4, 10-14-96)
Sec. 2-122   Safeguarding of Assets.
   a.   Be it ordained that accounting controls be designed and implemented to
provide reasonable assurances that:
      1.   Capital expenditures made by the Town, its various Departments and
Utilities be in accordance with management's authorization as documented in the
minutes.
      2.   Transactions of the utilities be recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
principles.
      3.   Adequate detail records be maintained to assure accountability for
Town and Utility-owned assets.
      4.   Access to assets be permitted in accordance with management' s
authorization.
      5.    The recorded accountability for assets be compared with the
existing assets at least every two (2) years and appropriate action be taken
with respect to any differences. (Ord. No. 96-12, § 5, 10-14-96)
Sec. 2-123   Purchase Order and Claim Processing Procedure.
   a.   For each item to be purchased, the Department Head shall complete and
sign a purchase order and present the same to the Town Superintendent for
consideration. The Town Superintendent shall review the purchase order.
   b.   Among other considerations, the Town Superintendent shall confer with
the Clerk- Treasurer regarding availability of funds for such purchase. If the
Town Superintendent approves such purchase request, he or she shall authorize
the purchase order by signing the same and delivering the fully completed and
signed purchase order to the Clerk-Treasurer and distributing additional copies
of such purchase order as appropriate.
   c.   For purchases in amounts below three hundred dollars ($300.00), and if
the Town Superintendent has approved such purchase and funds are available, the
Clerk-Treasurer shall prepare a claim and pay the invoice, as received for the
items purchased.
   d.   For purchases in amounts more than three hundred dollars ($300.00), and
if the Town Superintendent has approved such purchase and funds are available,
the Clerk-Treasurer shall prepare a claim and submit the same to the Town
Council of the Town of Ashley, for consideration.
   e.   It shall hereafter be the procedure of the Town of Ashley that each
Department Superintendent, Department Head, or Fire Department Lieutenant, and
no other party, except in the case of an emergency, shall be responsible for
discussing each department's purchase orders or claims with the Clerk-
Treasurer.
   f.   All purchase orders shall be submitted to the Clerk-Treasurer by 4:00
p.m., at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting
of the Town Council of the Town of Ashley. Any purchase orders not timely
received may not be considered by the Town Council until the next regularly
scheduled meeting of the Town Council. (Res. No. 03-2002, §§ 1-6, 2-11-02)
Sec. 2-124   Capital Asset Policy.
GENERAL INFORMATION:
   (A)   The Fixed Asset Policy is being issued effective September, 2021. The
new policy will be referred to as the Capital Asset Policy. This policy is
being issued to document the minimum value of capital assets to be reported on
our financial reports and to include infrastructure assets. The issuance of a
policy document is related to the implementation of a new reporting model,
Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement 34. Statement 34 will require
the Town to depreciate capital assets. The capital asset threshold will be
$5,000.00. An asset with a value under $5,000.00 will be expensed in the year
purchased. The infrastructure portion of this policy is also effective
September, 2021.
   (B)   Town Water Utility will follow this same definition of capital assets
except any item with a unit cost of $500.00 or more shall be capitalized.
Assets that are not capitalized (items less then $500.00) are expensed in the
year of acquisition. Town Utilities will follow the capitalization guidelines
of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.
   (C)   The Town has established a capital asset policy in order to provide a
higher degree of control over its considerable investment in capital assets,
and to be able to demonstrate accountability to its various constituencies:
citizens, rate-payers, oversight bodies, and regulators.
   (D)   The purpose of establishing a capital policy is fivefold:
      (1)   To safeguard the investments of the citizens, to fix responsibility
for the custody of equipment;
      (2)   To fix responsibility for the custody of equipment;
      (3)   To provide a basis for formulating capital asset acquisition,
maintenance and retirement policies;
      (4)   To provide date for financial reporting;
      (5)   To demonstrate appropriate stewardship responsibility for public
assets.
   (E)   This policy will only serve to classify capita] assets, including
fixed and infrastructure, for accuracy in financial reporting through the
Indiana State Board Of Accounts. It does not include data processing,
programming requirements, or computer operations procedures.
DEFINITION OF CAPITAL ASSETS:
   (A)   Capital assets include: land, land improvements, including monuments,
buildings, building improvements, construction in progress, machinery and
equipment, vehicles and infrastructure. All land will be capitalized but not
depreciated. All items with a useful life of more than one year, having a unit
cost of $5,000.00 or more shall be capitalized (including acquisitions by
lease-purchase agreements and donated items). A capital asset meeting the
criteria will be reported and depreciated in the government wide financial
statements.
   (B)   Assets that are not capitalized (items less than $5,000.00) are
expensed in the year of acquisition. An inventory will be kept on all computers
and other equipment with a capitalized cost of less than $5,000.00.
Exceptions are:
      (1)   Items costing less than the above limits which are permanently
installed as a part of the cost of original construction or installation of a
larger building or equipment unit will be included in the cost of the larger
unit;
      (2)   Modular equipment added subsequent to original equipment
construction or a larger building or equipment unit which may be put together
to form larger units costing more than the prescribed limits will be charged to
capital assets though the cost of individual items is less than such units;
      (3)   Cabinets, shelving, bookcases, and similar items, added subsequent
to original construction, which are custom made for a specific place and
adaptable elsewhere, will be capitalized.
NOTE: Purchases made using grant funds must comply with grant requirements or
the above procedures, whichever are the most restrictive.
   (C)   Threshold levels for capital assets. The following schedule will be
followed for the different types of capital assets other than infrastructure
assets:
Capitalized/Depreciate                        
Land                                         All/Capitalize only
Land Improvements                            $5,000.00
Building                                     $5,000.00
Building Improvements                        $5,000.00
Construction in Progress All/Capitalize only  
Machinery and Equipment                      $5,000.00
Vehicle                                      $5,000.00
Utility Assets                               $5,000.00
 
   (D)   Infrastructure.
      (1)   At the network level, the asset will be classified as major if the
cost of the network item is at lease 10% of the cost of all capital assets in
fiscal year 2015. A network will be defined as a group of similar assets that
serve a particular function or purpose for the Town.
      (2)   At the subsystem level, the asset will be classified as major if
the cost of the subsystem item is at least 5% of the cost of all capital assets
in fiscal year 2016. A subsystem will be defined as a segment of a network of
assets that serve a similar function for the Town.
VALUATION OF CAPITAL ASSETS.
   (A)   Capital assets must be recorded at actual cost. Normally the cost
recorded is the purchase price or construction costs of the asset, but also
included is any other reasonable and necessary costs incurred to place the
asset in its intended location and intended use. Such costs could include the
following:
      (1)   Legal and title fees, closing costs;
      (2)   Appraisal and negotiation fees, surveying fees;
      (3)   Damage payments;
      (4)   Land preparation costs, demolition costs;
      (5)   Architect, engineering, and accounting fees;
      (6)   Insurance premiums during construction;
      (7)   Transportation charges;
      (8)   Interest costs during construction.
   (B)   Donated or contributed assets should be recorded at their fair market
value on the date donated.
ASSET DEFINITIONS BY MAJOR CATEGORY.
   It is important to the maintenance of accurate records that each asset
category be precisely defined and that all persons responsible for records
maintenance be fully aware of the categorization system. This section further
clarifies the asset definitions by major category.
   (A)   Land. Land is defined as specified land, lots, parcels or acreage
including rights-of-way and easements, owned by the Town, its various
departments, boards or authorities, regardless of the method or date of
acquisition. Easements will not be included as the Town does not own them, but
as an interest in land owned by another (i.e., property owner) that entitles
its holder to a specific limited use.
   (B)   Improvements other than buildings.
      (1)   Examples of Town assets in this category are walks, parking areas
and drives, fencing, retaining walls, pools, fountains, planters, underground
sprinkler systems, and other similar items.
      (2)   Examples of Town utilities assets in this category are water supply
mains, collection sewers, wells, dams, fences, intake pipes, manholes, and fire
hydrants.
   (C)   Buildings.
      (1)   All structures designed and erected to house equipment services, or
functions are included. This includes systems, services, and fixtures within
the buildings, and attachments such as porches, stairs, fire escapes, canopies,
areaways, lighting fixtures, flagpoles, and all other such units that serve the
building.
      (2)   Plumbing systems, lighting systems, heating, cooling, ventilating
and air handling systems, alarm systems, sound systems, surveillance systems,
passenger and freight elevators, escalators, built-in-casework, walk-in coolers
and freezers, fixed shelving, and other fixed equipment are included with
building, if owned. Communication antennas and/or towers are not included as
building. These are parts of the equipment units that they serve.
   (D)   Equipment. Equipment includes all other types of physical property
within the scope of the fixed asset management system not previously
classified. Included within this category are office mechanical equipment,
office furniture, appliances, furnishings, machinery items, maintenance
equipment, communication equipment, police, fire, sanitation and park
department, laboratory equipment, vehicles, road equipment, aircraft, emergency
equipment, earth moving equipment, text equipment, civil defense equipment, and
data processing equipment. All supplies are excluded.
   (E)   Infrastructure.
      (1)   Infrastructure assets are long-lived capital assets that normally
can be preserved for a significantly greater number of years than most capital
assets and that are normally stationary in nature. Examples include road,
streetlights, traffic signals, drainage systems and water systems.
Infrastructure assets do not include buildings, drives, parking lots or any
other examples given above that are incidental to property or access to the
property above.
      (2)   Additions and improvements to infrastructure, which increase the
capacity or efficiency of the asset, will be capitalized. Maintenance/repairs
will be considered as necessary to maintain the existing asset, and therefore
not capitalized. For example, patching, resurfacing, snow removal, etc., are
considered maintenance activities and will be expenses. Also, normal department
operating activities such as feasibility studies, and preliminary engineering
and design, will be expenses and not capitalized as an element of the
infrastructure asset.
      (3)   Alleys will not be included as part of infrastructure for the
following reason: Existing improved alleys will be maintained as gravel alleys,
and the Town is responsible only for the maintenance, such a patching and
repairing. Any investments to upgrade the alleys will be done by homeowner
participation. Therefore, the Town will not track and value alleys and the
patching/repairs will be expenses as they occur.
      (4)   The retroactive reporting requirements for infrastructure of GASB
34 requires the Town to report items put into service from 1980 forward, and
gives the Town the option to report items put into service prior to 1980. The
Town will report only on items put into service after 1980. Retroactive
reporting is not mandated until fiscal years beginning January 1, 2007, which
the Town will comply with.
DEPRECIATION METHODS.
   The Town will be depreciating capital assets by using either composite/group
method depreciation or the straight-line method. Salvage value will be
determined on an asset-by-asset basis. Depreciation will be calculated at year-
end. Land is not depreciated according to general accepted accounting
principles.
   (A)   Composite/group network.
      (1)   Composite depreciation refers to calculating depreciation for a
collection of similar assets. A single composite rate is applied annually to
the acquisition cost of the collection as a whole. At year-end an adjustment
will be made to the total cost to account for any additions/disposals
throughout the year. The accumulated depreciation associated with it will also
be adjusted. A gain or loss will never be reported on the asset when using the
composite method. A full year’s depreciation will be taken when the asset is
placed in service and no depreciation recorded in the year it is sold or
disposed of. To determine the appropriate depreciation rate for the composite
group, divided 1 by the number of years the assets are depreciated. For
instance, a group of assets with a 25-year life will be depreciated at 4% each
year (1/25).
         (2)   Following is the list of groups that will be used for
depreciation:
            Composite/Group Depreciation
            (a)   Street lights - 35 years
            (b)   Traffic signals - 25 years
            (c)   Roads
               i.   Cement - 10 years

               iii.   Concrete - 30 years
               iv.   Asphaltic Concrete - 20 years
               v.   Brick or Stone - 50 years
   (B)   Straight-line depreciation.
      (1)   All assets accounted for under the capital asset policy will be
depreciated using the straight-line method of depreciation. A gain or loss of
disposal will be recorded. Following is a list of the most common useful lives:
         (a)   Vehicles - 5 years
         (b)   Office equipment - 5 years
         (c)   Office furniture - 20 years
         (d)   Heavy equipment - 10 years
         (e)   Fire trucks - 15 years
         (f)   Buildings - 50 years
         (g)   Building equipment (HVAC systems, roofing) - 20 years

(whichever is shorter)
         (i)   Land improvements - structure (parking lots, athletic courts,
swimming pools) - 20 years
         (j)   Land improvements - ground walk (golf course, athletic fields,
landscaping, fencing) - 20 years
         (k)   Outdoor equipment (playground equipment, radio towers) - 15
years

CAPITAL ASSET ACQUISITIONS.
   (A)   The method of acquisition is not a determining factor. Each department
should report items acquired by:
      (1)   Regular purchases;
      (2)   Lease purchase - see below;
      (3)   Construction by Town personnel;
      (4)   Construction by an outside contractor;
      (5)   Resolution/condemnation;
      (6)   Donation/contribution;
      (7)   Addition to existing asset;
      (8)   Transfer from another department;
      (9)   Trade or barter;
      (10)   Annexation.
   (B)   Leased equipment should be capitalized if the lease agreement meets
any one of the following criteria:
      (1)   The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the
end of the lease term;
      (2)   The lease contains bargain purchase option;
      (3)   The lease tern is equal to 75% of the estimated economic life of
the leased property;
      (4)   The present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of
the lease, excluding executor costs, equals at least 90% of the fair market
value of the leased property.
   (C)   Leases that do not meet any of the above criteria should be recorded
as an operating lease and reported in the notes of the financial statements.
ASSET TRANSFERS AND DISPOSITIONS.
   (A)   Property should not be transferred, turned-in for auction, or disposed
of without prior approval of the department head. A vehicle/equipment out
processing checklist should be sent to the Clerk-Treasurer's office in all
cases. This form is a dual-purpose form for transfer (defined as any movement
of an asset by virtue of change in location, either by account, department,
building, floor, or room) or retirement (disposal) of property.
   (B)   The main points to be remembered when using this form are:
      (1)   Always provide sufficient detail to properly identify the asset,
most importantly the asset's tag number or town ID;
      (2)   Be accurate and do not overlook any of the needed entries;
      (3)   Write legibly;
      (4)   Complete each column for every asset listed on the form;
      (5)   Enter information in correct row, depending on whether you are
transferring or deleting an asset;
      (6)   Have department head sign at the bottom of the form;
      (7)   Return the form to the Clerk-Treasurer's Office.
   (C)   If an asset is stolen, the department should notify the Police
Department as well as the Clerk-Treasurer's Office.
PERIODIC INVENTORIES.
   A physical inventory of all capital assets (any item of $5,000.00) will be
conducted in each department on or about December 31 of every year. The Clerk-
Treasurer's Office will conduct spot checks on a random basis. Department heads
will be accountable for the capital asset inventory charged to their
departments by verifying a list of their capital assets at year end.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF CLERK-TREASURER'S OFFICE.
   The Fiscal Officer will ensure the accounting for capital assets is being
exercised by establishing a capital asset inventory, both initially and
periodically in subsequent years. The Fiscal Officer will further ensure that
the capital asset report will be updated annually to reflect additions,
retirements, and transfers and to reflect the new, annual capital asset balance
for financial reporting purposes and the annual and accumulated depreciation
calculation.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DEPARTMENT MANAGERS.
   (A)   It is the responsibility of the department head to act as or designate
a steward for each piece of property over $400.00. The steward will become the
focal point for questions regarding the availability, condition, and usage of
the asset, as well as the contact during the physical inventory.
   (B)   The department head or his or her designee, who shall be identified in
writing and forwarded to each Town Council member, shall be designated to
record the receipt of the asset, to examine the asset to make sure that no
damage was incurred during shipment and to make sure that the asset was
received in working order.
   (C)   The steward is also responsible for the necessary preventative
maintenance and any needed repairs to keep the asset in working condition. It
is necessary to have a responsible personal available for questions that arise
during a physical inventory or when someone wants to borrow the asset. The
steward ensures that the asset is used for the purpose for which it was
acquired and that there is no personal or unauthorized use. In addition, the
steward should report, in writing, to his or her department head, any property
damage or theft.
   (D)   Department heads shall be accountable for an inventory list for all
inventory above $500.00 charged to their departments and shall verify a list of

Sec. 9-30   Sanitary Sewage System Regulations.
   The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewage system and
obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the Town shall be
determined by the Town in such manner as the Town shall reasonably elect, and
the sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates; except as
hereinafter provided in this section, the Town may make proper allowances in
determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be
consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the Town that such
quantities do not enter the sanitary sewage system.
   (a)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the Town's
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the Town, and the water used thereon or
therein is not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not
acceptable to the Town, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise
measured or determined by the Town. In order to ascertain the rate or charge
provided in this ordinance, the owner or other interested party shall, at his
expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or
any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the Town for the
determination of sewage discharge
   (b)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the Town's
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the Town, and in addition, is a user of
water from another source which is not measured by a water meter or is measured
by a meter not acceptable to the Town, then the amount of water used shall be
otherwise measured or determined by the Town. In order to ascertain the rates
or charges, the owner or other interested parties shall, at his expense,
install and maintain meters, weir's, volumetric measuring devices or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the Town for the
determination of sewage discharge.
   (c)   In the event two (2) or more residential lots, parcels of real estate,
or buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the
Town's sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of
water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in
each such case the Town may require each lot, parcel or building to have its
own water meter installed for billing purposes.
   (d)   In the event two (2) or more dwelling units such as mobile home,
apartments or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water or other
liquids into the Town's sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly,
are users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water
meter, then in such case, billing shall be for a single service in the manner
set out elsewhere herein, except that a minimum charge shall be billed in the
amount of thirty-eight dollars and fifty-two cents ($38.52) per month per
dwelling unit served through the single water meter. In the case of mobile home
courts, the number of dwelling units shall be computed and interpreted as the
total number of mobile home spaces available for rent plus any other dwelling
units served through the meter. A dwelling unit shall be interpreted as a room
or rooms or any other space or spaces in which cooking facilities are provided.

satisfaction of the Town that a portion of water as measured by the water meter
or meters does not and can not enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner
or other interested party shall, at his expense, install and maintain meters,
webs, volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of
measurement acceptable to the Town for the determination of sewage discharge.

Sec. 9-31   Strength and Character - Rate Surcharges.
   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably adjusted to
the service rendered to the users, the Town shall base its charges not only on
the volume, but also on strength and character of the stronger-than-normal
domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose of. The
Town shall require the user to determine the strength and content of all sewage
and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly, into the sanitary sewage
system, in such manner, by such method and at such times as the Town may deem
practicable in light of the conditions and attending circumstances of the case,
in order to determine the proper charge. The user shall furnish a central
sampling point available to the Town at all times.

monthly. Annually, each user shall be notified of the rates charged for
operation, maintenance and replacement for that user during the next year in
conjunction with a regular bill.
      (b)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants
occupying the properties served, unless otherwise requested m writing by the
owner, but such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in
the event payment is not made as herein required.
      The owners or properties served, which are occupied by a tenant or
tenants, shall have the right to examine the collection records of the Town for
the purpose of determining whether bills have been paid by such tenant or
tenants, provided that such examination shall be made at the office at which
such records are kept and during the hours that such office is open for
business.

   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain in
proportion to the cost of providing services to the various users or user
classes, the Town shall cause a study to be made annually following the
effective date on which this ordinance goes into effect. Such study shall
include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the cost associated with the
treatment of excessive strength effluents from industrial users, volume and
delivery flow rate characteristics attributed to the various users or user
classes, the financial position of the sewage works and the adequacy of its
revenue to provide reasonable funds for the operation and maintenance,
replacements, debt service requirements and capital improvements to the
wastewater treatment systems.
   Thereafter, on an annual basis, within a reasonable period of time following
the normal accounting period, the Town shall cause a similar study to be made
for the purpose of reviewing the proportionality of the rates and charges for
sewage services on a continuing basis. Said studies shall be conducted by
officers or employees of the Town or by a firm of certified public accountants,
or a firm of consulting engineers which firms shall have experience in such
studies, or by such combination of officers, employees, certified public
accountants or engineers as the Town shall determine to be best under the
circumstances. The Town shall, upon completion of said study, revise and adjust
the rates and charges, as necessary, in accordance therewith in order to
maintain the proportionality and sufficiency of the rates. (Ord. No. 95-05,

in excess of 250 mg/l, an average total Ammonia-Nitrogen (NH3-N) contact in
excess of 40 mg/l, and/or an average of five (5) day BOD in excess of 250 mg/l,
the customer shall pay a surcharge based upon the excess strength of his or her
wastes.
   (b)   The costs of treatment for each pound of BOD, Ammonia-Nitrogen,
suspended solids, or grease removed by each treatment works shall be reviewed
by the Town at the end of each fiscal year. If a discrepancy exists between the
actual costs as found by the Town and the estimated costs, the Town Council
shall increase or decrease the surcharge rates sufficiently to cover only the
projected actual costs for the ensuing year.

limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations
above.
   (c)   Upon the promulgation of the National Categorical Pretreatment
Standard (NCPS) for a particular user, the said standard, if more stringent
then the limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that category,
shall, when effective, immediately supersede the limitations and conditions
imposed under this ordinance. The Utility Superintendent shall notify all known
affected users of the applicable permitting and reporting requirements under 40
CFR 403.12. As an alternative to the total oil and grease limitations
established by this section, the Town Council may establish in an IWP a
limitation of 50 mg/1 for non-polar grease. The alternative limitation is
subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   The user submits an application for the alternative limit;
      (2)   The user provides information regarding the user's products,
processes, and operations that shows to the Town Council's satisfaction that
the oil and grease discharged by the user is predominantly of animal or
vegetable origin;
      (3)   The user shows that the oil and grease in the user's discharges is
not visible, free, or floating at 50° F. at any time;
      (4)   The user has sampling facilities that allow for both visual
inspection of the user's discharge and using the equipment necessary for
collection samples for floatable oil and grease;
      (5)   The oil and grease in the user's discharge is not related to past
instances of obstruction, interference, or pass through;
      (6)   Users subject to the alternative limit shall continue to operate
and maintain grease traps and any other oil and grease separation and treatment
equipment and shall continue all existing practices that reduce discharges of
oil and grease;
      (7)   If the Town Council determines that a user subject to the
alternative limit has caused, alone or in conjunction with other discharges,
obstruction, interference, or pass through, then the user shall comply with the

changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature,
quality, or volume of its wastewater at least ninety (90) days before the
change.
   (a)   The Utility Superintendent may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under
Section 9-455 of this ordinance.
   (b)   The Utility Superintendent may issue a wastewater discharge permit
under Section
9-157 of this ordinance or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under
Section
9-169 of this ordinance in response to changed conditions or anticipated
changed conditions.
   (c)   For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are
not limited to, flow increases of twenty percent (20%) or greater, and the
discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
(Ord. No. 2003-04, 7-17-03)
Sec. 9-186   Reports of Potential Problems.
   (a)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems
for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the Utility
Superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include the location of
the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and
corrective actions taken by the user.
   (b)   Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the Utility Superintendent, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve
the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred
as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to
person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines,
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this ordinance.
   (c)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
discharge described in paragraph (a), above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
(Ord. No. 2003-04, 7-17-03)
Sec. 9-187   Reports from Unpermitted Users.
   All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the Utility Superintendent as the Utility Superintendent
may require.
(Ord. No. 2003-04, 7-17-03)
Sec. 9-188   Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting.
   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
the Utility Superintendent within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of
the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit
the results of the repeat analysis to the Utility Superintendent within thirty
(30) days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to
resample if the Utility Superintendent monitors at the user's facility at least
once a month, or if the Utility Superintendent samples between the user's
initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling.
(Ord. No. 2003-04, 7-17-03)
Sec. 9-189   Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste.
   (a)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State (IDEM)
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one
hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of
the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass
and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during
that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months.
All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180)
days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need
be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However,
notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under Section
9-185 of this ordinance. The notification requirement in this section does not
apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of Sections
9-181,
9-183, and
9-184 of this ordinance.
   (b)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a), above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15)
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any
quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33
(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
   (c)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Utility
Superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and
the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) of the discharge of
such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such
regulations.
   (d)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (e)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this ordinance, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law.
(Ord. No. 2003-04, 7-17-03)
Sec. 9-190   Analytical Requirements.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40
CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance
with procedures approved by EPA.
(Ord. No. 2003-04, 7-17-03)
Sec. 9-191   Sample Collection.
   (a)   Except as indicated in paragraph (b), below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In
the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the Utility Superintendent
may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4)
grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab
samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
   (b)   Samples for oil and grease (O & G), temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
(Ord. No. 2003-04, 7-17-03)
Sec. 9-192   Timing.
   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern. Facsimiles may be accepted on a case-by-case basis if
approved by the Utility Superintendent.
(Ord. No. 2003-04, 7-17-03)
Sec. 9-193   Record Keeping.
   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this ordinance shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this ordinance and
any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring
activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records
shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name
of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who
performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the
results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of
at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the
duration of any litigation concerning the user or the Town of Ashley, or where
the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the
Utility Superintendent.

Sec. 9-202   Search Warrants.
   If the Utility Superintendent has been refused access to a building,
structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this ordinance, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program of the Town designed to verify compliance with this
ordinance or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Utility
Superintendent may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Dekalb County
Circuit Court of Auburn, Indiana.

Division VIII. Confidential Information
Sec. 9-211   Confidential information.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring
programs, and from the Utility Superintendent's inspection and sampling
activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the
user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the Utility Superintendent, that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as
trade secrets under applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at
the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and
demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be
held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets
or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public,
but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies
for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in
enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR
2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available
to the public without restriction.

Division IX. Administrative Enforcement Remedies
Sec. 9-221   Notification of Violation.
   When the Utility Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Utility Superintendent may serve upon that user a written Notice of Violation.
Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to
include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the
Utility Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of
Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Utility
Superintendent or the Town of Ashley to take any action, including emergency
actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of
Violation.
(Ord. No. 2003-04, 7-17-03)
Sec. 9-222   Agreed Orders.
   The Utility Superintendent may enter into Agreed Orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with
any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time
period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and
effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections
9-224 and
9-225 of this ordinance and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Ord. No. 2003-04, 7-17-03)
Sec. 9-223   Show Cause Hearing.
   The Utility Superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to
appear before the Utility Superintendent and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action,
the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be
served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall
not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user.
(Ord. No. 2003-04, 7-17-03)
Sec. 9-224   Compliance Orders.
   When the Utility Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Utility Superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the
discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time.
If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer
service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment
standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of
liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
(Ord. No. 2003-04, 7-17-03)
Sec. 9-225   Cease and Desist Orders.
   (a)   When the Utility Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the
Utility Superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and
desist all such violations and directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   (b)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. No. 2003-04, 7-17-03)
Sec. 9-226   Administrative Fines.
   (a)   When the Utility Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Utility Superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to
exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) as provided by I.C. 36-1-
3-8. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the
case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be
assessed for each day during the period of violation.
   (b)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after sixty (60) calendar
days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid
balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 1.8 percent per
month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges,
fines, and penalties.
   (c)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the Utility Superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment of
the fine amount within thirty (30) days of being notified of the fine. Where a
request has merit, the Utility Superintendent may convene a hearing on the
matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together
with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The Utility
Superintendent may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement
actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   (d)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. No. 2003-04, 7-17-03)
Sec. 9-227   Emergency Suspensions.
   (a)   The Utility Superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge,
after formal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop
an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause
an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons.
The Utility Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge,
after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to
the environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Utility Superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Utility
Superintendent may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Utility Superintendent that the period
of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in Section
9-228 of this ordinance are initiated against the user.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Utility Superintendent prior to the date
of any show cause or termination hearing under Sections
9-223 or
9-228 of this ordinance.
   (b)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Ord. No. 2003-04, 7-17-03)
Sec. 9-228   Termination of Discharge.
   (a)   In addition to the provisions in Section
9-171 of this ordinance, any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
      (1)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in Section
9-121 through
9-126 of this ordinance.
   (b)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section
9-223 of this ordinance why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise
of this option by the Utility Superintendent shall not be a bar to, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Utility Superintendent may petition the Dekalb County Circuit Court through the
Town's Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
ordinance on activities of the user. The Utility Superintendent may also seek
such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief,
including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A
petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against a user.
(Ord. No. 2003-04, 7-17-03)
Sec. 9-237   Civil Penalties.
   (a)   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the Town for
a maximum civil penalty of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per
violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average
discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the
violation.
   (b)   The Utility Superintendent may recover reasonable attorneys' fees,
court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities,
including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages
incurred by the Town.
   (c)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
   (d)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.

Division XI. Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations
Sec. 9-246   Upset.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
   (b)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of paragraph (c), below, are met.
   (c)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the Utility
Superintendent within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset:
         a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (d)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (e)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (f)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
(Ord. No. 2003-04, 7-17-03)
Sec. 9-247   Prohibited Discharge Standards.
   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section
9-121(a) of this ordinance or the specific prohibitions in Sections
9-121(b)(3) through (16) of this ordinance if it can prove that it did not
know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
   (a)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (b)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the Town was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit (No. IN0022292), and in the case
of interference, was in compliance with applicable biosolids use or disposal
requirements pursuant to 327 IAC 6.1.

Sec. 9-248   Bypass.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section,
      (1)   "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a user's treatment facility.
      (2)   "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (b)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
   (c)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Utility Superintendent, at least ten (10) days
before the date of the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Utility Superintendent of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user
becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description
of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates
and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it
is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Utility Superintendent may waive the
written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received
within twenty-four (24) hours.
   (d)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Utility Superintendent may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         c)   The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (c) of
this section.
      (2)   The Utility Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Utility Superintendent determines that
it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

fail, or to become detached or dislodged or to collapse and thereby injure
persons or damage property.

of (i) dilapidation, deterioration or decay; (ii) faulty construction; (iii)
the removal, movement or instability of any portion of the ground necessary for

thereof, is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is being used.
      10.   Whenever the exterior walls or other vertical structural members

shows 33 percent or more damage or deterioration of its supporting member or
members, or 50 percent damage or deterioration of its non-supporting members,
enclosing or outside walls or coverings.
      12.   Whenever the building or structure has been so damaged by fire,
wind, earthquake or flood or has become so dilapidated or deteriorated as to
become (i) an attractive nuisance to children; (ii) a harbor for criminals; or

felony or misdemeanor under the laws of the state of Indiana or the United
States.
      13.   Whenever any building or structure has been constructed, exists or
is maintained in violation of any specific requirement or prohibition

characteristics required by law in the case of a newly constructed building of
like area, height and occupancy in the same location.

facilities, or otherwise, is determined by the health officer to be unsanitary,
unfit for human habitation or in such a condition that is likely to cause
sickness or disease.
      16.   Whenever any building or structure, because of obsolescence,
dilapidated condition, deterioration, damage, inadequate exits, lack of
sufficient fire-resistive construction, faulty electric wiring, gas connections

   b.   The zoning inspector shall issue a notice and order directed to the
record owner of the building. The notice and order shall contain:
      1.   The street address and a legal description sufficient for
identification of the premises upon which the building is located.

         a)   If the zoning inspector has determined that the building or
structure must be repaired, the order shall require that all required permits
be secured therefor and the work physically commenced within such time (not to
exceed 60 days from the date of the order) and completed within such time as
the building official shall determine is reasonable under all of the
circumstances.
         b)   If the zoning inspector has determined that the building or
structure must be vacated, the order shall require that the building or
structure shall be vacated within a certain time from the date of the order as
determined by the building official to be reasonable.

structure must be demolished, the order shall require that the building be
vacated within such time as the zoning inspector shall determine is reasonable
(not to exceed 60 days from the date of the order); that all required permits
be secured therefor within 60 days from the date of the order; and that the
demolition be completed within such time as the zoning inspector shall
determine is reasonable.
      4.   Statements advising that if any required repair or demolition work
(without vacation also being required) is not commenced within the time
specified, the zoning inspector (i) will order the building vacated and posted
to prevent further occupancy until the work is completed, and (ii) may proceed

or its owner.
      5.   Statements advising (i) that any person having any record title or
legal interest in the building may appeal from the notice and order or any
action of the zoning inspector to the Board of Appeals, provided the appeal is
made in writing as provided in this code and filed with the zoning inspector
within 30 days from the date of service of such notice and order; and (ii) that
failure to appeal will constitute a waiver of all right to an administrative
hearing and determination of the matter. (Ord. No. 2000-10, § 401, 8-14-00)
Sec. 10-129   Service of Notice and Order.

shall be served upon the record owner and posted on the property; and one copy
thereof shall be served on each of the following if known to the zoning

or deed of trust or other lien or encumbrance of record; the owner or holder of
any lease of record; and the holder of any other estate or legal interest of
record in or to the building or the land on which it is located. The failure of
the zoning inspector to serve any person required herein to be served shall not
invalidate any proceedings hereunder as to any other person duly served or
relieve any such person from any duty or obligation imposed by the provisions
of this section.
   b.   Service of the notice and order shall be made upon all persons entitled
thereto either personally or by mailing a copy of such notice and order by
certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to each such person
at their address as it appears on the last equalized assessment roll of the
county or as known to the zoning inspector. If no address or any such person so
appears or is known to the zoning inspector, then a copy of the notice and
order shall be so mailed, addressed to such person at the address of the
building involved in the proceedings. The failure of any such person to receive
such notice shall not affect the validity of any proceedings taken under this
section. Service by certified mail in the manner herein provided shall be
effective on the date of mailing.
   c.   Proof of service of the notice and order shall be certified to at the
time of service by a written declaration under penalty of perjury executed by
the persons effecting service, declaring the time, date and manner in which
service was made. The declaration, together with any receipt card returned in
acknowledgment of receipt by certified mail shall be affixed to the copy of the
notice and order retained by the zoning inspector.
   d.   If compliance is not had with the order within the time specified
therein, and no appeal has been properly and timely filed, the zoning inspector
shall file in the office of the county recorder a certificate describing the
property and certifying (i) that the building is a dangerous building and (ii)
that the owner has been notified. Whenever the corrections ordered shall
thereafter have been completed or the building demolished so that it no longer
exists as a dangerous building on the property described in the certificate,
the zoning inspector shall file a new certificate with the county recorder
certifying that the building has been demolished or all required corrections
have been made so that the building is no longer dangerous, whichever is
appropriate. (Ord. No. 2000-10, § 401 and 402, 8-14-00)
Sec. 10-130   Repair, Vacation and Demolition.

owner; or
         c)   If the building does not constitute an immediate danger to the
life, limb, property or safety of the public it may be vacated, secured and
maintained against entry.
      2.   If the building or structure is in such condition as to make it
immediately dangerous to the life, limb, property or safety of the public or
its occupants, it shall be ordered to be vacated. (Ord. No. 2000-10, § 403, 8-
14-00)

the posting. No person shall remain in or enter any building which has been so
posted, except that entry may be made to repair, demolish or remove such
