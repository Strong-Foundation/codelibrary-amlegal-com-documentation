the general policies and procedures that cover employment practices,
operations, and professional conduct. It is your responsibility to know and
practice them. As you study them, please refer any questions to Human
Resources.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.002 INTRODUCTORY PERIOD.
   As a new employee, you will be in an introductory period for 90 days from
your date of hire. This time allows you to become acquainted with the new
position. At the end of this three-month period your manager will evaluate your
performance and your training progress. However, the probationary period for a
firefighter is one year from your date of hire.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.003 STATEMENT OF CHANGE.
   The policies in this handbook are subject to change at any time at the sole
discretion of the city. From time to time, you may receive updated information
regarding any changes in policy. This handbook is for informational purposes
only. Because the city’s employees are employed at will, this is not intended
to be and does not create any contract of employment. An individual’s
employment can be terminated for any reason at any time, at the option of
either the employee or the city. Although, civil city employees are employed at
will, Police and Fire are exempt from this standard. Please direct any
questions about specific policies or procedures to Human Resources.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES
§ 33.015 EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY.
   The city offers equal employment opportunities to all without regard to
race, sex, age, color, religion, national origin, disability, or any other
legally protected characteristic. This policy applies to all employees and
applicants for employment and in all phases of employment, including
recruitment, hiring, placement, promotion, compensation, evaluation, training,
discipline, termination, and all other terms and conditions of employment. If
you have any questions about this policy or if you feel that you have been
discriminated against in any way, see a member of management immediately.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.016 HARASSMENT.
   (A)   (1)   The city affirms its commitment to the principle of equal
opportunity and equal treatment in employment regardless of a person’s race,
sex, age, color, religion, national origin, disability, or any other legally
protected characteristic. In accepting a position at the city, you agree to
share this commitment in the performance of your assigned responsibilities and
in your interactions.
      (2)   The city strives to provide all staff and vendors with an
environment that is free of harassment or other unreasonable interference with
the performance of their duties. We aspire to be a community in which mutual
respect guides our day-to-day interactions. In our work environment, there is
no place for conduct that demeans or belittles another person. For these
reasons, harassment of any kind is unacceptable.
   (B)   Sexual harassment. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual
favors, and other physical, verbal, or visual conduct based on sex constitutes
sexual harassment when (1) submission to the conduct is an explicit or implicit
term or condition of employment, (2) submission to or rejection of the conduct
is used as the basis for an employment decision, or (3) the conduct has the
purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work
performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working
environment. SEXUAL HARASSMENT is conduct based on sex, whether directed toward
a person of the opposite or same sex, and may include explicit sexual
propositions, sexual innuendo, suggestive comments, sexually oriented kidding
or teasing, practical jokes, jokes about obscene printed or visual material,
and physical contact such as patting, pinching, or brushing against another
person’s body.
   (C)   Employee’s responsibility. If you feel you are the subject of
harassment, you may want to first advise the offending person that the behavior
is unwanted. If you and the offending person are unable to satisfactorily
resolve the situation, or if you feel that discussing the behavior with the
offending person will present a physical danger or undue suffering, you should
notify a member of management as soon as possible. This immediacy will allow
for swift investigation, action, and resolution. If for any reason you are
unable to inform a member of management, you may also discuss the issue with
Human Resources.
   (D)   Investigation process.
      (1)   If you bring forth a harassment complaint, you should be as
specific as possible about the conditions and information surrounding the
issue. We will treat every complaint of harassment seriously and will
investigate each incident. We will make all due effort to maintain
confidentiality and the dignity of all parties involved. As we work to resolve
the issue, you are also responsible for maintaining the dignity and privacy of
the offending person.
      (2)   If an investigation confirms that a violation has occurred, we will
take corrective action. This may include disciplinary action against the
offending person, up to and including immediate termination, as determined to
be appropriate.
   (E)   Retaliation. The city’s policy prohibits retaliation against any
employee by another employee or by the city itself for using this complaint
procedure in good faith or for filing, testifying, assisting, or participating
in any manner in any investigation, proceeding, or hearing conducted by a
federal or state enforcement agency. Prohibited retaliation includes, but is
not limited to, demotion, suspension, failure to make employment
recommendations impartially, adversely affecting working conditions, or
otherwise denying any employment benefit. If you feel you are a victim of
retaliation, you should notify Human Resources immediately.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.017 EMPLOYMENT CLASSIFICATIONS.
   (A)   The city employees fall into one of the following classifications:
      (1)   FULL-TIME. Any employee who is assigned to work for the city on a
regular basis for 35 hours or more per week.
      (2)   PART-TIME. Any employee who is assigned to work for the city on a
regular basis for fewer than 35 hours per week.
      (3)   TEMPORARY. Any employee who is hired as a temporary replacement for
a full-time or part-time employee, or for a short period of time until a
specific task is performed. Seasonal employees, hired in periods such as summer
months, peak periods, and vacation, are considered temporary employees.
   (B)   Employees will be either exempt or nonexempt for the purposes of the
overtime requirements of state law and the federal Fair Labor Standards Act:
      (1)   EXEMPT. Exempt employees, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards
Act, are employed in certain administrative, executive, professional,
technical, or outside sales categories and are specifically exempted from
overtime payment considerations. The hours worked by exempt employees are often
irregular and may begin and end beyond the normal workday. Exempt employees do
not receive overtime pay.
      (2)   NONEXEMPT. Nonexempt employees, as defined by the Fair Labor
Standards Act, are expected to confine their work to the normal workday and
workweek unless a member of management authorizes overtime in advance. The city
will pay nonexempt employees overtime at one-and-one- half times their regular
hourly rate for all hours worked over 40 hours per week (refer to the overtime
section in this handbook).
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.018 DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE AND ALCOHOL POLICY.
   (A)   The city prohibits employees from unlawfully manufacturing,
distributing, dispensing, selling, transferring, using, or possessing any
illegal controlled substance on the city’s premises or while working. Any
employee who is found in violation of this policy will be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
   (B)   All employees are forbidden from using or possessing alcohol at any
time on the city’s premises. In addition, employees shall not report to work
while under the influence of alcohol. The only exception to the above policy is
that employees may from time to time consume alcohol at city-related functions,
including at receptions, dinners, and so on. In such cases, employees should
consume alcohol in moderation, behave in a responsible manner, and represent
the city well. Employees who abuse alcohol at work-related functions will be
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
   (C)   If a department head or supervisor has reasonable suspicion to believe
that an employee is under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs, that
supervisor has the authority to require the employee to submit to alcohol or
drug testing immediately. The employee may be required to submit to alcohol
testing via the data master machine or similar evidential breath testing device
(EBT). An employee may choose to submit to a blood test instead. If an employee
is believed to be under the influence of illegal drugs, the employee shall be
required to submit to a blood or urine screen administered by a laboratory
licensed and certified by the state of Indiana to do drug testing. For more
information on this policy, please see your department head, Human Resources,
or refer to the city’s “Policy Establishing Rules and Guidelines to Assure a
Drug and Alcohol-Free Workplace”.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.019 BACKGROUND CHECKS.
   (A)   The city reserves the right to require applicants for all full- and
part-time positions to submit to a background check upon the extension of a
conditional offer of employment. An employee’s first day of work must not be
prior to the satisfactory completion of the background check.
   (B)   If an applicant attempts to withhold information or falsify
information pertaining to his or her background, previous convictions, etc., he
or she will be disqualified from further employment consideration. If, after
hire, an employee is found to have withheld or falsified information regarding
his or her background, he or she may be subject to disciplinary action and/or
termination.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.020 PRIVACY; PERSONNEL FILES.
   (A)   We respect the privacy of our employees and keep our employee files
confidential to the extent possible. Employee files contain original
applications, forms relating to references received, forms pertaining to
benefits, and information regarding changes such as annual salary actions.
   (B)   It is important that you keep the city current on your address, phone
number, emergency contact information, insurance beneficiaries, payroll tax-
withholding allowances, direct-deposit account numbers, and other pertinent
information that is necessary to properly administer benefits or maintain up-
to-date records. Please submit any changes to Human Resources.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)

PERSONAL CONDUCT AND PERFORMANCE
§ 33.035 PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   The city is committed to providing you with a supportive environment
in which you feel challenged. Offering performance feedback/ evaluations is one
of the ways we acknowledge your strengths and highlight areas for future growth
and improvement.
   (B)   You will receive most feedback informally on an ongoing basis. This
type of feedback is important for two reasons:
      (1)   Immediate feedback is highly effective in enhancing your job
performance; and
      (2)   Working in our type of environment requires open communication
between you and management.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.036 PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT.
   (A)   From time to time, problems related to your job may develop. If so,
the city intends to have candid and open conversations with you in order to
resolve them. Such problems may include, but are not limited to, violation or
conflict with policy, performance on the job, or other job-related situations.
The following steps cover the typical pattern of progressive discipline.
      (1)   Step 1: Performance coaching. Management discusses with you the
specific performance problem, what improvements are needed, and a date by which
corrections should occur. Management will document the date and content of the
conversations.
      (2)   Step 2: Written warning. If the performance problem persists,
management will have another discussion with you and will issue a written
warning at this time. This warning will contain a statement of the problem,
what corrections are necessary, and a date by which corrections should occur.
Management will ask you to sign the form to indicate you have read it. You will
receive a copy, and another copy will be placed in your personnel file.
      (3)   Step 3: Disciplinary action. If the performance problem recurs
after the written warning(s), management may take other disciplinary action, up
to and including termination.
   (B)   NOTE: Depending on the nature and severity of the violation, the city
reserves the right to proceed with suspension or termination at any point in
the progressive-discipline process.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.037 PERSONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   Disciplinary action may range from a verbal warning to termination.
Acts of misconduct that are not permitted and that may subject an employee to
disciplinary action at the discretion of the city include:
      (1)   Unsatisfactory work performance;
      (2)   Failure to follow guidelines for attendance;
      (3)   Inappropriate attire or poor personal hygiene;
      (4)   Behavior that does not fit in with our values or that damages our
reputation; and
      (5)   Unauthorized use of telephones, computers, the electronic
communication systems, or other city-owned equipment.
   (B)   While we believe in giving a chance to improve, some actions are so
extreme that they may warrant immediate suspension or termination. Just a few
examples include:
      (1)   Willful misconduct/dishonesty or flagrant violation of the city’s
policy;
      (2)   Harassment of any employee, vendor, or any other individual, as
defined by the harassment policy;
      (3)   Violation of the city’s drug-free workplace policy;
      (4)   Theft, unauthorized use, abuse, or removal of the city’s property,
assets, or property of any city employee or vendor;
      (5)   Unauthorized disclosure of any confidential information pertaining
to the city or employees;
      (6)   Verbal and/or physical abuse of any person while on city property;
      (7)   Possession of illegal or unauthorized firearms or other dangerous
weapons on city property;
      (8)   Insubordination or refusal to complete duties as required by
management; and
      (9)   Illegal acts on the city’s premises or during working time.
   (C)   These lists are not all-inclusive, and we reserve the right to
terminate employees on an at-will basis unless otherwise prohibited by state or
local law. If during the course of your employment you are convicted of a
felony, you must disclose this to a member of management. We will evaluate the
nature of the conviction to determine appropriate action.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.038 PROBLEM RESOLUTION.
   The city encourages you to bring to our attention any issues or concerns you
have regarding your employment and working conditions. In order to minimize the
possibility of misunderstandings, we suggest that you talk to a member of
management as soon as possible. Management will investigate, evaluate, and
provide a solution or explanation to you. If you do not receive a satisfactory
answer from management within a reasonable amount of time, or if your problem
is particularly sensitive, you may contact Human Resources directly.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
GENERAL POLICIES

   (D)   Social media. The city endorses the use of secure use of social media
to enhance communication, collaboration, and information exchange to streamline
processes and foster productivity. This policy established the city’s position

management, administration, and oversight. This policy is not meant to address
one particular form of social media; rather social media in general, as
advances in technology will occur and new tools will emerge.
      (1)   Policy. Social media provides a new and potentially valuable means
of assisting departments and its personnel in meeting community outreach,
problem solving, investigative, crime prevention, and related objectives. This
policy identifies potential uses that may be explored or expanded upon as
deemed reasonable by administrative and supervisory personnel. The city also
recognizes the role that these tools play in the personal lives of some
department personnel. The personal use of social media can have bearing on
departmental personnel in some capacity. As such, this policy provides
information of a precautionary nature as well as prohibitions on the use of
social media by department personnel.
      (2)   On-the-job use.

            7.   Where possible, social media pages should state the opinions
expressed by visitors to the page(s) which do not reflect the opinions of the

submitted for posting is subject to public disclosure.

            1.   City personnel representing a city department via social media

            4.   Employees shall observe and abide by all copyright, trademark,
and service mark restrictions in posting materials to electronic media.
      (3)   Potential uses.
         (a)   Social media is a valuable investigative tool when seeking
evidence or information about:
            1.   Missing persons;
            2.   Wanted persons;
            3.   Gang participation;
            4.   Crimes perpetrated online (cyberbullying, cyberstalking); and
            5.   Photos or videos of a crime posted by a participant or

      (4)   Personal uses; precautions and prohibitions. Barring state law,
department personnel shall abide by the following when using social media.
         (a)    City personnel are free to express themselves as private
citizens on social media sites to the degree that their speech does not impair
working relationships of their department for which loyalty and confidentiality
are important, impede the performance of duties, impair discipline and harmony
among coworkers, or negatively affect the public perception of the department.
         (b)   As public employees, city personnel are cautioned that speech on
or off duty, made pursuant to their official duties – that is, that owes its
existence to the employee’s professional duties and responsibilities – is not
protected speech under the First Amendment and may form the basis for
discipline if deemed detrimental to the city. City personnel should assume that
their speech and related activity on social media sites will reflect upon their
office and their department.
         (c)   City personnel shall not post, transmit, or otherwise
disseminate any information to which they have access as a result of their
employment without written permission from the chief executive or his or her
designee.
         (d)   For safety and security reasons, city personnel are cautioned
not to disclose their employment with their departments nor shall they post
information pertaining to any other member of the city without their
permission. As such, city personnel are cautioned not to do the following:
            1.   Display city or department logos, uniforms, or similar
identifying items on personal web pages; or
            2.   Post personal photographs or provide similar means of personal
recognition that may cause them to be identified as a member of their
departments.
         (e)   When using social media, city personnel should be mindful that
their speech becomes of the worldwide electronic domain. Therefore, adherence
to the city’s or department’s code of conduct is required in the personal use
of social media. In particular, city personnel are prohibited from the
following:
            1.   Speech containing obscene or sexually explicit language,
images, or acts and statement or other forms of speech that ridicule, malign,
disparage, or otherwise express bias against any race, any religion, or any
protected class of individuals; and
            2.   Speech involving themselves or other city personnel reflecting
behavior that would reasonably be considered reckless or irresponsible.
         (f)   Engaging in prohibited speech noted herein, may provide grounds
for undermining or impeaching a police officer’s testimony in criminal
proceedings. Police department personnel thus sanctioned are subject to
discipline up to and including termination of office.
         (g)   City personnel may not divulge information gained by reason of
their authority; make any statements, speeches, appearances, and endorsements;
or public material that could reasonably be considered to represent the views
or positions of the city without express authorization.
         (h)   City personnel should be aware that they may be subject to civil
litigation for:
            1.   Publishing or posting false information that harms the
reputation of another person, group, or organization (defamation);
            2.   Publishing or posting private facts and personal information
about someone without their permission that has not been previously revealed to
the public, is not of legitimate public concern, and would be offensive to a
reasonable person;
            3.   Using someone else’s name, likeness, or other personal
attributes without that person’s permission for an exploitative purpose; or
            4.   Publishing the creative work of another, trademarks, or
certain confidential business information without the permission of the owner.

media sites are constantly in flux, and they should never assume that personal
information posted on such sites is protected
         (j)   City personnel should expect that any information created,
transmitted, downloaded, exchanged, or discussed in a public online forum may
be accessed by the city at any time without prior notice
         (k)   Reporting violations. Any employee becoming aware of or having
knowledge of a posting or any website or web page in violation of the provision
of this policy shall notify his or her supervisor immediately for follow up
action.

§ 33.051 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   Depending upon the nature of your duties, you may have access to information
that is confidential. This includes financial information, organizational
information, and information regarding other employees. To protect
confidentiality, you must limit the disclosure and discussion of this
information to only those individuals who need to know. You should never use
this information for personal benefit or for the benefit of others.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.052 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
   Employees have a responsibility to avoid any situation that might make it
difficult to act in the best interest of the city. In general, a conflict of
interest could exist when you or a member of your family has a financial
interest in a city dealing with the City of Peru. In addition, if you would
receive any personal gain from a business relationship, a conflict of interest
likely exists. If any business/vendor/supplier relationship could affect your
judgment or decisions exercised on behalf of the City of Peru, then there is a
conflict of interest. For clarity on whether any transaction or vendor
relationship is or might be appropriate, you should contact a member of
management.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.053 FRATERNIZATION.
   The city views romantic relationships between members of management and
subordinates as a conflict of interest; therefore, we discourage such
relationships. We do not otherwise discourage friendship or social activities
among city employees. If a member of management and a subordinate are involved
in or are contemplating a romantic relationship, the member of management
involved must notify Human Resources immediately.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.054 HIRING OF RELATIVES.
   Although we do not prohibit hiring of relatives, we are committed to
eliminating situations in which a conflict of interest may exist. Therefore, it
is unlikely that we would hire a person if he or she would perform under or
have supervisory authority over a relative, whether actual or perceived. We
define a relative as any person who is related by blood or marriage, or whose
relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related by
blood or marriage.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.055 OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT.
   Although we do not prohibit outside employment, you must ensure that any
outside employment does not present a conflict of interest or interfere with
your job performance. A conflict of interest could arise if the outside
employer does business with us, if the work adversely affects our image, or if
the work is for one of our customers or competitors. Please direct questions
regarding outside employment to your manager.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.056 SAFETY AND SECURITY.
   The city is committed to employee safety and to protecting employees from
accidents. The city and all employees have a responsibility to work safely at
all times. Safety concerns and accidents are to be reported to a member of
management.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.057 RIGHT TO SEARCH.
   The city’s right-to-search policy has been implemented to provide a safe and
productive work environment. Failure to submit, upon request, to a search of
any city property or personal property located in the city’s facilities may
lead to progressive discipline, up to and including immediate termination.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.058 WEAPONS AND VIOLENCE.
   (A)   The city supports an environment that is safe and free from violence
for all employees, clients, and vendors. To that end, employees are not allowed
to illegally or legally carry firearms, ammunition, knives (other than a small
blade used directly for work-related functions), or any other weapon on our
property or while conducting city business except as permitted by state law.
Any employee found to be violating this policy is subject to discipline, up to
and including termination. Any employee who displays a tendency to engage in
violent, abusive, or threatening behavior, or who otherwise engages in behavior
that the city, in its sole discretion, deems offensive or inappropriate will be
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
   (B)   Employees have a “duty to warn” their supervisors, security personnel,
or Human Resources of any suspicious workplace activity. This includes threats
or acts of violence, aggressive behavior, offensive acts, threatening remarks,
and the like. Employee reports will be held in confidence to the extent
possible as required by law, and the city will not condone any acts of
retaliation against an employee making a report.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.059 SOLICITATION AND DISTRIBUTION.
   (A)   People who are not employed by the city may not solicit or distribute
literature and goods on city property for any purpose at any time. Vendors
soliciting in the normal course of business who have established a business
relationship with the city are excluded from this restriction.
   (B)   We strive to clearly and accurately communicate with employees;
therefore, unless the city is involved in the activity, all notices, brochures,
and other forms of solicitation of or by outsiders are prohibited. You may not
solicit other employees during working time (either your own working time or
the working time of other employees). Working time includes that time for which
any employee is paid and is expected to be performing services for the city.
Working time does not include unpaid meal breaks, recognized unpaid break
periods, or unpaid time before or after the established workday. Managers may
authorize limited exceptions to this policy (e.g., for bona fide charitable
causes).
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.060 IMAGE AND DRESS CODE.
   It is very important that you be well groomed, neat, and dressed
appropriately for your job function, and while The city trusts each employee’s
common sense and good judgment, we must follow a dress code that is appropriate
to the work environment. We have therefore adopted a business casual dress
code. We want to stress that this business casual dress code is a privilege and
must be adhered to in order to be retained.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.061 SMOKING.
   Use of tobacco products is prohibited on all city-owned property and
vehicles.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.062 WEATHER CONDITIONS.
   (A)   The city will remain open during most periods of inclement weather;
however, where extraordinary circumstances warrant, the city reserves the right
to close the facility. Thus, employees are encouraged to monitor broadcasts
and/or websites during periods of adverse weather to find out if the facility
is open or closed on a given day. The city makes a decision by 7:00 a.m. during
periods of such inclement weather and communicates this to local media.
   (B)   If the facility remains open in inclement weather, you may decide
whether you will show up for work. If you elect not to work, you must call your
immediate supervisor to let us know.
   (C)   Facilities closed. If the facility is closed in inclement weather, all
emergency employees are required to report. For non-emergency employees, all
exempt-level staff will receive their regular pay for the day of closure. For
hourly employees on a day of closure, an employee will receive an amount
equivalent to their normal scheduled time for the day.
   (D)   Facilities open. If the facility remains open on an inclement weather
day, non-emergency employees who report to work will receive their normal pay
for the day (i.e., exempt staff will receive their regular salary and hourly
employees will be paid at their normal rate for all hours worked). If you elect
not to report to work on a day when the facility is open, you can elect to:
      (1)   Use any accrued paid time off for the missed day; or
      (2)   Receive no pay for the day.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
ATTENDANCE AND TIME OFF
§ 33.075 ATTENDANCE.
   (A)   Being at work on time every day is important. Your coworkers depend on
you. The city realizes that occasional absences are unavoidable. However,
excessive absenteeism or tardiness creates a hardship for your coworkers, who
must do your job as well as their own. Because of this, frequent and unapproved
absences and excessive tardiness can be cause for disciplinary action or
dismissal.
      (1)   In the event you are absent, it is critical that you provide as
much notice as possible.
      (2)   You must contact your immediate supervisor before the start of your
scheduled work time to report an absence or extended time away from the office.
This procedure holds for every day of absence, unless you are on an approved
leave of absence.
      (3)   If you are going to be late for work, you must contact your
immediate supervisor before the start of your scheduled work time.
      (4)   A no call or no show will be cause for disciplinary action, up to
and including termination of employment.
      (5)   If you are absent for three or more consecutive workdays, we may
require you to provide acceptable medical or other documentation to support
your absence.
   (B)   Within the Police and Fire departments, an employee’s immediate
supervisor is responsible for contacting the Chief of Police or Fire, or their
respective designees, to report absences within their team.
   (C)   We reserve the right to address the issue of chronic absenteeism or
tardiness by accelerating the disciplinary process, up to and including
termination.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.076 WORKING HOURS.
   Many city jobs require that employees work a nonstandard work schedule. Each
department head and/or supervisor is responsible for defining departmental
working hours, schedules and attendance to its employees.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.077 VACATION.
   (A)   The city believes that you should have opportunities to enjoy time
away from work to help balance your life. Therefore, we provide full-time
employees with vacation time; part-time and temporary employees are not
eligible for vacation time. Employees become eligible for vacation time after
completion of one year of employment. Vacation time accrues each year on the
employee’s anniversary date.
   (B)   Vacation time for city employees is accrued according to the following
schedule:
Vacation
Staff and Support
(excludes Fire Department employees)
1 to 4 years   10 days
5 to 10 years  15 days
11 to 15 years 20 days
16+ years      25 days
Fire Department only (due to shift scheduling)
1 to 4 years   5 days
5 to 10 years  8 days
11 to 15 years 11 days
16+ years      13 days
 
   (C)   Carryover and payment of unused vacation time.
      (1)   City employees, excluding Fire Department employees, may carry over
into the next calendar year up to five days of vacation time. If you have
unused vacation in excess of five days you must forfeit it. You will not be
compensated for unused vacation time if you resign or are terminated.
      (2)   Fire Department employees may carry over into the next calendar
year up to three days of vacation time. If you have unused vacation in excess
of three days you must forfeit it. You will not be compensated for unused
vacation time if you resign or are terminated.
   (D)   Scheduling and requesting vacation time.  As you would expect, time-
off schedules are dictated by workload demands; we must ensure that we are
appropriately staffed in order to meet business needs. We will make every
attempt to accommodate your time-off request, but your manager will determine
preference; generally, earlier requests will receive first consideration.
Employees may take vacation in half- or full-day increments.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.078 SICK TIME.
   (A)   The city realizes that on occasion employees will need to be away from
work due to personal or family illness. As a benefit, we provide regular, full-
time employees up to five days of paid sick leave per year. Sick days can be
carried over for a maximum accumulation of ten days Fire Department employees
will receive up to five days of paid sick leave per year. These employees can
carry over one sick day for a maximum accumulation of six days. These days will
not be paid to an employee upon termination. Temporary and part-time employees
do not receive sick leave. Employees must log sick leave on a half-day basis,
accounting only for full days away from work.
   (B)   Sick leave does apply to regularly scheduled doctor appointments and
should be used on days when either the employee is ill or an immediate family
member is ill. Employees may be required to present a doctor’s certificate to
have the absence approved. Due to shift scheduling of the City Fire Department,
a firefighter who uses a sick day will then be required to submit a doctor’s
excuse if unable to return to work on their next scheduled shift day.
   (C)   Short-term disability benefits are provided by the city for all full-
time employees regularly working 35 or more hours per week. This benefit pays
80% of weekly earnings, for a duration of up to 50 weeks, for qualified
individuals. All short-term disability benefits shall be governed by the city’s
Short-Term Disability Policy, which are hereby incorporated by reference. For
specific information on this policy please contact the Human Resources office.
   (D)   Employees are allowed up to three unexcused absences without leave
days within their career. A fourth unexcused absence without a leave day may
result in termination. Any absence without a leave day requires a doctor’s
excuse from the QuadMed contracted physician to substantiate the missed time.
If the clinic is not open, the city reserves the right to send you to its
contracted physician; if this is deemed necessary it will be your
responsibility to sign a release form to access these records.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15; Am. Ord. 12-2022, passed 5-2-22)
§ 33.079 HOLIDAYS.
   (A)   The holidays for the city will be designated by the Mayor for the
succeeding calendar year by each December 20. All full-time and seasonal full-
time civil city employees are eligible to receive holiday pay. Part-time and
temporary employees are not eligible.
   (B)   When it is necessary for a department to provide services on a
holiday, that employee will receive regular compensation for the hours worked
and will receive a substitute day off in lieu of the holiday during the same
pay period as the holiday.
   (C)   If a holiday falls on a Saturday, the city will typically observe the
holiday on the preceding Friday. If the holiday falls on a Sunday, the city
will typically observe the holiday on the following Monday. All time off for
holidays must be reported as “holiday” on the time report.
   (D)   The city Police and Fire departments follow a separate holiday policy
and procedure in accordance with city ordinances. Please review this policy for
additional information.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.080 BEREAVEMENT LEAVE.
   (A)   The city will provide employees with up to three paid days off upon
the death of an immediate family member (spouse, parents, domestic partner,
child, grandparent, sister, brother, grandchild, an immediate step-relative, an
immediate in-law, a domestic partner’s immediate relative, or any legal
dependent living with the employee). Due to their work schedule, the Fire
Department will receive one paid day upon the death of an immediate family
member.
   (B)   The city will provide one paid day off upon the death of non-immediate
family members (aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, or non-immediate step-relative) and
one-half day to attend a funeral of a fellow employee (normally departmental).
Due to their work schedule, the Fire Department will receive 12 hours of paid
bereavement leave.
   (C)   The bereavement leave policy is designed to reimburse employees for
work days lost. As such, it does not apply if the employee is on any other type
of leave. Employees should notify a member of management as soon as possible if
the need for bereavement leave arises.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.081 JURY DUTY.
   (A)   The city encourages employees to fulfill their obligation as citizens
when they are called to serve jury duty or as a witness in any federal, state,
or local court. To provide income protection while an employee carries out his/
her civic responsibility, the city provides the difference between jury duty
pay and your regular day’s pay for time spent serving on jury duty. Income
protection for time spent serving on jury duty will be provided for a maximum
of five work days.
      (1)   Before you begin jury duty leave, you must submit to your
department head and to the Office of the City Clerk Treasurer the subpoena or
court order for jury duty.
      (2)   At the beginning of the jury duty term, you should ask the court
clerk or bailiff to prepare a weekly work verification form. The court clerk
will typically provide the work verification form on each day you serve on the
jury.
      (3)   Please give the work verification form to your department head and
   (B)   Since jury calls sometimes arise at times that are inconvenient for
the individual or the city, we will use such means as are legitimate and
necessary to obtain postponements of service to a more convenient time.
(Ord. 19, 2015, passed 5-4-15)
§ 33.082 FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT (FMLA).
   (A)   The city will grant family and medical leaves of absence in accordance
with the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and applicable state or other
laws. The law is complex, so we encourage you to contact Human Resources if you
are anticipating a need to take a leave and/or if you have questions about the
law or this policy.
   (B)   Eligibility.
      (1)   You may be eligible for FMLA leave if you:
         (a)   Work at a city facility with at least 50 employees within a 75-
mile radius;
         (b)   Have worked for the city for at least 12 months; and
         (c)   Have worked for at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months
preceding your requested leave of absence.
      (2)   Note: Certain high-level salaried employees may be exempt from the
law if granting a leave would cause the city economic hardship.
   (C)   Reasons for FMLA leave.
      (1)   You may take FMLA leave for any of the following reasons:
         (a)   The birth or care of a newborn child;
         (b)   The placement of a child with you for adoption or foster care,
or the care of the newly placed child;
         (c)   The care of a spouse, child, or parent (but not in-law) with a
serious health condition;
         (d)   Your own serious health condition;
         (e)   Any qualifying exigency related to a spouse, child, or parent
who is a member of the National Guard or Reserves or of a regular component of
the Armed Forces when the covered military member is on covered active duty or
called to covered active duty; or
         (f)   The care of a spouse, child, parent, or nearest blood relative
recovering from an injury or illness sustained while on active duty in the
Armed Forces or a veteran who was a member of the Armed Forces at any time
during the period of five years preceding the date the FMLA leave is to begin.
      (2)   A SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION generally means an illness, injury, or
other medical condition that renders you unable to perform your job, such as a
period of hospitalization or a period of incapacity exceeding three days while
under the continuing care or treatment of a health-care provider.
   (D)   Leave time allowed.
      (1)   FMLA allows eligible employees to take up to 12 unpaid workweeks of
leave during a rolling 12-month period for the family and medical reasons
listed above.
      (2)   Eligible employees with a spouse, son, daughter, or parent who
either has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active
military duty or who is already on covered active duty may use their 12-week
leave entitlement for reasons related to or affected by the family member’s
call-up or service. The qualifying exigency must be one of the following: (1)
short-notice deployment, (2) military events and activities, (3) child care and
school activities, (4) financial and legal arrangements, (5) counseling, (6)
rest and recuperation, (7) post-deployment activities, (8) parental care leave
to provide care necessitated for the military member’s parent who is incapable
of self-care, and (9) additional activities that arise out of active duty,
provided that the employer and employee agree, including agreement on timing
and duration of the leave.
         (a)   COVERED ACTIVE DUTY means:
            1.   In the case of a member of a regular component of the Armed
Forces, duty during the deployment of the member with the Armed Forces to a
foreign country.
            2.   In the case of a member of a reserve component of the Armed
Forces, duty during the deployment of the member with the Armed Forces to a
foreign country under a call or order to active duty under a provision of law
referred to in section 101(a)(13)(B) of title 10, United States Code.
         (b)   The leave may commence as soon as the individual receives the
call-up notice. (Son or daughter for this type of FMLA leave is defined the
same as for child for other types of FMLA leave except that the person does not
have to be a minor.) This type of leave would be counted toward the employee’s
12-week maximum of FMLA leave in a 12-month period.
      (3)   FMLA also includes a special leave entitlement that permits
eligible employees to take up to 26 weeks of leave during a single 12-month
period to care for a covered servicemember. The eligible employee may be the
servicemember’s parent, child, spouse, or next of kin (defined as the closest
blood relative of the injured or recovering servicemember).
         (a)   The term COVERED SERVICE-MEMBER means:
            1.   A member of the Armed Forces (including a member of the
National Guard or Reserves) who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation,
or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary
disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness; or
            2.   A veteran who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation,
or therapy, for a serious injury or illness and who was a member of the Armed
Forces (including a member of the National Guard or Reserves) at any time
during the period of five years preceding the date on which the need for FMLA
leave begins.
         (b)   The term SERIOUS INJURY OR ILLNESS:
            1.   In the case of a member of the Armed Forces (including a
member of the National Guard or Reserves), means an injury or illness that was
incurred by the member in line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces (or
existed before the beginning of the member’s active duty and was aggravated by
service in line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces) and that may render
the member medically unfit to perform the duties of the member’s office, grade,
rank, or rating.
            2.   In the case of a veteran who was a member of the Armed Forces
(including a member of the National Guard or Reserves) at any time during a
period when the person was a covered servicemember, means a qualifying (as
defined by the Secretary of Labor) injury or illness that was incurred by the
member in line of duty on an active duty in the Armed Forces (or existed before
the beginning of the member’s active duty and was aggravated by service in line
of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces) and that manifested itself before
or after the member became a veteran.
      (4)   Husband and wife employed. If you and your spouse are both employed
by the city, each of you may take 12 workweeks’ leave for your own serious
illness or to take care of your sick child or each other. However, a married
couple is limited to a total of 12 workweeks for the birth, adoption, or foster
placement of a child; the care of a sick parent; or the care of a healthy
infant or adopted child.
      (5)   Intermittent or reduced-schedule leave. You may take intermittent
or reduced-schedule leave for the serious health conditions of yourself, your
spouse, your child, or your parent when medically necessary. If your need for
intermittent leave requires you to miss only part of the workday, we expect you
to work the remainder of your shift, whether before or after the requisite
period of intermittent leave. Under certain circumstances, if you are using
intermittent leave or reduced-schedule leave, we may temporarily transfer you
to an alternate position for which you are qualified and that better
accommodates your leave. You may not take intermittent leave for the birth or
placement of a child without approval by the city.
      (6)   If you use FMLA leave for any purpose other than its intended
purpose, we will consider it as grounds for disciplinary action, up to and
including termination.
      (7)   We will consider authorized absences for family or medical leave as
excused absences for purposes of our attendance policies. But whenever the need
for leave is for planned, periodic, or foreseeable medical treatments of a
serious health condition, please schedule the treatments to minimize any
absence from work and so as not to disrupt the operations of the city.
   (E)   Notice. Whenever the need for leave is foreseeable, you must request
the leave not less than 30 days before it is to begin. Failure to submit the
request at least 30 days in advance may result in the leave being delayed. In
this instance, any absences that occur prior to the beginning of the leave may
be counted as unexcused under the city’s attendance policy. If leave is
unforeseeable, you (or a family member if you are physically or mentally
incapable of notification) must notify Human Resources of your need for leave
as soon as possible, but generally not more than two days following the day
that the need for leave was required.
   (F)   Medical certification.
      (1)   The city may ask you to produce a satisfactory medical
certification in support of your leave request, or during the leave, or as a
condition of returning to work at the expiration of the leave. In addition, we
may require you to obtain a second opinion at our expense. In certain
circumstances, we also have the right to require follow-up medical
certifications during your leave.
      (2)   Human Resources will provide you with certification forms for your
specified type of leave. You must have your attending physician complete a
Certification of Health Care Provider form for all medically related leave
requests. You must return the leave of absence certification forms to Human
Resources within 30 days prior to your leave if the need for leave is
foreseeable, or as soon as practicable if the leave is not foreseeable (at
least within 15 days of the date you receive the request for certification). If
you fail to provide the required certifications in a timely manner, your leave
may be denied and the absences in question may therefore be considered
unexcused under the city’s attendance policy.
   (G)   Use of accumulated time off. The city reserves the right to require
you to use any accrued paid time off, such as accrued vacation or personal
days, during any part of the 12-week period. If the leave is for a work-related
injury for which you are receiving workers compensation benefits, the city may
require you to take FMLA leave concurrently with your workers compensation
leave.
   (H)   Benefits. The city will continue your existing health insurance
coverage under the same conditions applicable to active employees. You must
continue paying your portion of the health insurance premium during this time.
Failure to do so may result in your coverage being cancelled with 30 days’
notice. If you do not return to work after the leave, we may require you to
reimburse us for the health-care premiums/expenses we paid during your leave.
During periods of FMLA leave, you are not entitled to unemployment
compensation.
   (I)   Working while on leave. Some employees may hold other jobs in addition
to working for the city. If you are on FMLA leave, you may not work for another
employer unless you first seek approval from your direct supervisor. If you
have not received approval, working for another employer while on FMLA leave
may be grounds for disciplinary action, including termination of employment.
   (J)   Reinstatement.
      (1)   Upon the expiration of the leave, the city will return you to the
job that you held prior to the leave of absence or to an equivalent position,
unless your position has been affected by a reduction-in-force or
reorganization, or unless you qualify as a key employee under certain
circumstances.
      (2)   If you find that you do not require the amount of time originally
contemplated for your FMLA leave, it is your responsibility to notify Human
Resources in writing immediately. We require a minimum of two days’ notice of
your intention to return to work early.
      (3)   You must have your attending physician provide you with written
authorization prior to returning to work. If you fail to return to work at the
conclusion of an unpaid FMLA leave, we will proceed with the understanding that
you have voluntarily resigned your employment.

§ 33.083 MILITARY LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
   (A)   Military leave is provided on an unpaid basis. This policy is not
intended to conflict with state or federal military leave laws; therefore, to
the extent such laws require more generous treatment to individuals seeking
military leave, the city will follow those laws.
   (B)   If you request a military leave of absence, you may elect to use paid
time off in lieu of unpaid leave, and you may elect to continue health-care
benefits to the extent permitted by law during your leave of absence. You
should direct questions regarding military leave to Human Resources.

§ 33.100 OVERTIME.
   On occasion, the city may require overtime for nonexempt civil city
employees. Although situations may arise that will prevent someone from working
overtime, we do expect all of our nonexempt employees to be available to work
overtime and a flexible schedule when it is necessary.
   (A)   Civil city employees (nonexempt). Civil city nonexempt employees will
be paid overtime at one-and-one-half times their regular hourly rate for all
hours worked over 40 hours per week. Paid time off and holidays are not
included in the calculation of overtime pay.
   (B)   Firefighters (nonexempt). All nonexempt Firefighters shall be
compensated at the employee’s regular rate of pay until the total hours worked
in a designated 28-day period exceeds 212 hours. All hours worked in excess of
212 hours in a designated 28-day period shall be paid at one and one-half times
the employee’s regular rate. Only hours actually worked count toward the
calculation of overtime.
   (C)   Police (nonexempt).
      (1)   All nonexempt police officers shall be compensated at the
employee’s regular rate of pay until the total hours worked in a designated bi-
weekly pay period equals 80 hours. All hours worked in excess of 80 hours in a
designated bi-weekly pay period shall be paid at one and one-half times the
employee’s regular rate. Only hours actually worked count toward the
calculation of overtime.
      (2)   Non-exempt police officers will be allowed to accumulate 60 hours
of comp time. After the 60-hour limit is reached, cash compensation may be
ordered by the Chief of Police at his or her discretion. Each member shall
provide all necessary information and detail to verify their overtime claimed.

§ 33.103 COBRA.
   (A)   When you or your enrolled dependents are no longer eligible for
regular coverage under the city’s medical plan, you may be eligible for
continued coverage by paying the monthly premium for the coverage. This is
guaranteed under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) if:

MATERIALITY POLICY
§ 37.45 REPORTING ERRONEOUS OR IRREGULAR MATERIAL VARIANCES, LOSSES, SHORTAGES
OR THEFTS.
   (A)   Any public official, department head, or employee with actual
knowledge or reasonable cause to believe that there has been a misappropriation

   (B)   (1)   The city establishes the following Materiality Policy under IC
5-11-1-10, 5-11-1-21 and 5-11-1-27:
      (2)   Materiality, in City of Peru Government, is defined as $500 per
occurrence. That is, if one occurrence of a loss or shortage or other
irregularity is equal or greater than $500, it must be reported to the State
Board of Accounts. The materiality definition is not limited to defalcations,
or suspicious activity involving only cash or cash transactions. If supplies,
equipment or other fixed assets belonging to the city are suspected of being
misappropriated or stolen or used in a manner not authorized by city officials
and the value of those supplies, equipment or fixed assets are approximately
$500, that misuse or series of misuse should be reported. That is not to say
that if a loss or shortage is less than $500 it should be ignored. If there is
a series of events, within the same office or department that appears to be a
structuring event to defraud or misappropriate city funds or property, that
event or series of events should be reported.
   (C)   Ghost employment.
      (1)   IC 35-44.1-1-3 defines ghost employment as a public servant who
knowingly or intentionally: (1) hires an employee for the governmental entity
that he or she serves; and (2) fails to assign to the employee any duties, or
assigns to the employee any duties not related to the operation of the
governmental entity; or knowingly or intentionally assigns to an employee under
his or her supervision any duties not related to the operation of the
governmental entity that he or she serves; or a person employed by a
governmental entity who, knowing that he or she has not been assigned any
duties to perform for the entity, accepts property from the entity; or a person
employed by a governmental entity who knowingly or intentionally accepts
property from the entity for the performance of duties not related to the
operation of the entity; or any person who accepts property from a governmental
entity in violation of this section and any public servant who permits the
payment of property in violation of this section are jointly and severally
liable to the governmental entity for that property.
      (2)   Any occurrence of ghost employment, no matter how insignificant it
seems at the time, must be reported immediately to the Mayor who shall
determine the discipline to be administered.
   (D)   All items not reported to the State Board of Accounts shall be
resolved and discipline, if any, by the Mayor with appropriate documents
retained by the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (E)   When an irregular variance, loss, shortage, or theft is determined
material, pursuant to city policy on materiality, the Clerk-Treasurer shall
report the incident to the State Board of Accounts. On the State Board of
Accounts’ website there is a notification link, which allows public officials
to report, via e-mail, irregular variances, losses, shortages, or thefts.
Telephone and in-person reporting is also acceptable. Reports will be followed
up with a return e-mail or call to gather additional information as necessary.
All reports of irregular variances, losses, shortages, or thefts are maintained
by the State Board of Accounts.
(Ord. 18, 2016, passed 7-5-16)
INTERNAL CONTROL POLICY
§ 37.50 INTERNAL CONTROL POLICY.
   (A)   (1)   Overview.
         (a)   Effective July 1, 2015, Indiana enacted IC 5-11-1-27 which
requires each political subdivision in Indiana, including the City of Peru,
Indiana (the "city"), to establish and maintain a system of internal controls
to promote governmental accountability and transparency. The purpose of the
internal control process is to provide reasonable assurance that the mission
and objectives of the city will be achieved, and that public funds and property
are properly accounted for.
         (b)   Internal controls are not separate systems of the city or an
isolated activity; rather, internal controls are an integral part of each
activity used to guide the city. The purpose of internal control includes the
reduction of risk associated with fraud as well as the safeguarding of city
resources against loss due to waste, abuse, mismanagement or errors. Internal
control processes provide a check and balance system over operations, promoting
operational effectiveness and overall efficiency. A system of sufficient
internal control produces reliable financial and management data, ensures
accuracy and timeliness in reporting, and promotes compliance with applicable
laws. This internal control policy is intended to meet the compliance
requirements defined by the State Board of Accounts under IC 5-11-1-27(e) for
the city.
         (c)   Controls are put in place to detect or prevent errors and fraud.
An ERROR is an unintentional mistake that has the potential to affect the
financial statements and FRAUD is the intentional misuse or misappropriation of
city assets.
         (d)   Enforcement, maintenance and ongoing evaluation of the city's
internal control policy shall be the responsibility of the city's Internal
Control Oversight Committee (the "Oversight Committee") which shall consist of
the Mayor, the Clerk-Treasurer and one member of the City Council (the
"Council") selected by the Council. The Oversight Committee shall have the
duties and responsibilities set forth in this Policy including the ongoing
evaluation of the city's internal controls.
         (e)   The evaluation of internal controls includes identifying the
framework used by the Oversight Committee to determine the effectiveness of
internal controls.
      (2)   Objectives of internal control.
         (a)   The three objectives of internal controls are to ensure: (1) the
effectiveness and efficiency of operations, (2) the reliability of financial
reporting, and (3) compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The
safeguarding of city funds and assets is a subset of each of these objectives.
         (b)   Continuous monitoring and testing is needed to help identify
poorly designed or ineffective internal controls. The Oversight Committee shall
be responsible for communicating the objectives of internal control to all
personnel of the city with access to public funds, the training of such
personnel and ensuring that the city is committed to sustaining an effective
internal control environment.
      (3)   Components of internal controls. The five components of internal
controls include: (1) the control environment, (2) risk assessment, (3) control
activities, (4) information and communication, and (5) monitoring of the
controls. Each of these components is discussed further below.
      (4)   Control environment. The control environment includes the
organizational structure, the control framework, the city's policies and
procedures and internal and external influences. The tone set by the oversight
Committee and the Council determines the attitude toward the controls
implemented by the city.
         (a)   Organizational structure.
            1.   The Council, as the city's legislative body, is responsible
for adopting internal control policies.
            2.   The Oversight Committee has primary responsibility for
enforcement, maintenance and ongoing evaluation of the policies. The Clerk-
Treasurer, as the city's Fiscal Officer, shall have primary responsibility for
implementing the controls and certifying the training of all appropriate
personnel.
         (b)   Control framework. Elements of a control framework include the
following:
            1.   Segregation of duties to help ensure the reliability of the
city's internal controls, i.e., one person should not have access to all stages
of a process. If proper segregation is not in place, situations may arise where
errors, irregularities or fraud may occur and remain undetected.
            2.   Due to the small number of city employees, segregation is
difficult and compensating procedures should be explored.
            3.   Integrity and competence of personnel performing the duties
are key to achieving the desired controls. This includes hiring the proper
people and continually training personnel. It is important to ensure that
employees who perform financial tasks have the knowledge and skill to perform
their duties.
            4.    Communication by the Oversight Committee of the controls and
each employee's responsibilities are as important as ensuring employees know
how to communicate irregularities that may arise.
            5.   Proper supervision of employees is also needed to ensure
proper execution of control activities. This will be the primary responsibility
of the Mayor and the Clerk-Treasurer.
         (c)   City's policies and procedures. The city's internal control
policies set the overall direction of the city with respect to financial
integrity. Procedures for all areas of financial preparation, reporting,
operations, maintenance, personnel and payroll are required. These policies and
procedures will become the basis for the determination of compliance with
internal control policies.
      (5)   Oversight Committee’s risk assessment. The Oversight Committee
shall conduct an assessment of risks relevant to the city’s financial
statements and practices. This includes the identification of potential risks,
the analysis of the potential impact of those risks on the ability to property
report the city’s financial statements and the overall management of financial
loss risks. Items to consider in risk assessment include, but are not limited
to:
         (a)   The hiring of new personnel or the assignment of new duties to
existing personnel.
         (b)   How a change in accounting information system impacts existing
controls and how effectively the training of personnel on any new system is
conducted.
         (c)   Changes in regulations and laws that may affect the control
environment.
         (d)   Securing records appropriately.
         (e)   Limiting access to computer and data files.
         (f)   Segregation of duties relating to financial matters.
         (g)   Timely recordation of transactions.
         (h)   Assuring that cash is deposited timely.
         (i)   Physically safeguarding and accounting for valuable assets.
         (j)   Assuring financial transactions are performed only by authorized
personnel.
         (k)   Reconciliations are property and promptly completed.
         (l)   Occurrences of management override of established controls are
limited.
         (m)   Minimizing opportunities for fraud and unintentional error.
      (6)   Control activities. CONTROL ACTIVITIES include the policies and
procedures that are in place to achieve the controls desired. Documentation of
the control activities is vital to the overall control environment. These
activities include, but are not limited to:
         (a)   Segregation of duties where possible.
         (b)   Timely transaction recording.
         (c)   Timely cash deposits.
         (d)   Physically safeguarding valuable assets.
         (e)   Assuring financial transactions are performed by authorized
personnel only.
         (f)    Assuring reconciliations are properly and promptly completed.
         (g)   Documenting reported variances, actions taken in response
thereto, and recommended changes to internal controls.
      (7)   Information and communication.
         (a)   The Oversight Committee shall determine if the financial
communication and information systems utilized in the city are adequate and
relevant for their intended purpose and shall make any recommended changes to
the Council for action.
         (b)   The Oversight Committee is responsible for communicating the
controls of the city to city employees and also the responsibilities of each
employees in the control system.
         (c)   The Oversight Committee is also charged with reviewing
information, however generated, that may indicate a flaw in the controls that
may impede the detection of errors in a timely fashion.
      (8)   Monitoring. The Oversight Committee is also charged with reviewing
internal controls on an ongoing basis.Monitoring can include responding to the
recommendation of the State Board of Accounts in
changes in the controls and reviewing correspondence from outside sources such
as banks and vendors for unusual items. Employees should understand the control
activities and their responsibilities in those activities.
         (a)   Ongoing evaluation of controls.
            1.   City controls shall be evaluated at least annually by the
Oversight Committee and at any other time that circumstances dictate.
Evaluations shall be reported to the Council along with any recommended
revisions to control policies. Evaluation should also occur every time one of
the following conditions exist:
               A.    Change in personnel performing a control function.
               B.    Change in accounting or payroll systems.
               C.    Change in applicable law or regulations.
            2.   As controls are evaluated a determination should be made that
designates the control as either "effective" or "ineffective" at achieving the
proposed control. Controls are effective
when then would be no material weaknesses in internal controls involved in
financial reporting. Ineffective controls would be those where at least one
material weakness exists. If a control is determined to be ineffective, then
the control deficiency needs to be evaluated and revised.
         (b)   Control deficiencies. A control deficiency exists when the
design or operation of a control does not allow the Oversight Committee to
prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A design deficiency exists
when a necessary control is missing or is not designed to enable the control
objective to be met. An operational deficiency exists when a control is
designed properly, but does not operate as designed or the person performing
the control is not qualified to perform the control. A deficiency may exist
that is unavoidable (e.g., segregation of duties in a small office). For these
deficiencies, compensating procedures shall be put in place by the Council.
         (c)   Limitations on effectiveness of controls. The city should
understand that potential fraud could exist and not be detected timely in at
least the following circumstances: (1) when the city has poorly designed or
operated internal controls, (2) when there are too many management overrides of
established controls, and (3) when there is collusion between employees or
between an employee and a third party.
      (9)   Review of city processes.
         (a)   When reviewing control processes in the city, the Oversight
Committee should consider incorporating the "5 Ws".
            1.   Who performs each activity? Who receives the outcome of the
activities?
            2.   What activities are performed? What forms and reports are
used? What computer systems and files are used?
            3.   When are activities performed? What is the sequence of
activities? What is the timing of the activities? What is the frequency of the
activities?
            4.   Where are activities performed?
            5.   Why are activities performed (i.e., what risks are
controlled)?
         (b)   The Oversight Committee should also consider whether any changes
to the process will increase the efficiency of the process or firm up the
controls.
      (10)   Communicating staff members' roles. The Mayor and Clerk-Treasurer
will establish a procedure to ensure that all employees who are charged with a
control understand the importance of the control and their role in the control
environment. Controls that are not performed with an understanding of the
purpose of the control will not be effective. A review of the controls and the
staff members' role in the controls should be conducted at least annually and
anytime there is a change in the control, personnel, or the laws and
regulations affecting the control. Documentation of these reviews should be
maintained by the Clerk-Treasurer.
      (11)   Staff members' selection and training. With respect to internal
control monitoring delegated to an employee, the Clerk-Treasurer shall ensure
professional and educational reference checks are made prior to hiring a new
employee to verify the proposed employee is competent to implement the
delegated internal controls. The Clerk-Treasurer shall ensure that employees
responsible for implementing internal controls receive routine training on the
city's applicable internal control procedures and that certifications of
training are obtained and maintained for inspection.
      (12)   Known or suspected theft. In accordance with the provisions of IC
5-11-1-27(l), if any public official has actual knowledge of or reasonable
cause to believe that there has been a theft or misappropriation of public
funds, immediate notice of such known or suspected misappropriation shall be
given to the State Board of Accounts and the Marion County Prosecutor's office.
There is no minimum level of materiality for this reporting. Any city personnel
with knowledge or suspicion of such theft or misappropriation should
immediately notify any member of the city Oversight Committee to report such
activity so that it may be investigated, confirmed and reported. Reports of
suspected theft or misappropriation will be investigated confidentially. Any
confirmed or suspected theft or misappropriation will be reported to the
appropriate authorities by a designee of the Oversight Committee.
      (13)   Statement regarding ethical conduct. It is the policy of the city
that each city employee, each city elected official, and others affiliated with
the city conduct themselves in the highest ethical and honest manner when
handling, dispensing, or accounting for public funds and property. The funds
and property of the city are taxpayer generated and are entrusted to the city
for the purpose of providing public services in and near the city. The city
Oversight Committee expects each individual affiliated with the city to handle
city funds and property with the highest public interest in mind. Instances of
intentional violation of this expectation will be dealt with through the city's
disciplinary process and can result in discipline up to and including immediate
dismissal from employment.
   (B)   Cash and deposits internal controls.
      (1)   General. The city collects cash and checks for numerous purposes
including salvage titles, park shelter rentals, local ordinance fees and
permits. The purpose of this control is to assure accurate accounting and
deposit for all cash received by city personnel.
      (2)   Process.
         (a)   Only the-Clerk-Treasurer, or Deputy Clerk shall receive, deposit
and account for cash (including checks and money orders) received by the city.
For all funds received in the office of Clerk- Treasurer, and when funds are
required to be received by other city personnel (such as the Chief of Police
for salvage titles), the recipient shall immediately issue a numbered receipt
for all payments received and shall immediately enter the amount in a receipts
register. Receipts shall be sequentially pre-numbered and shall be issued for
all money collected. Receipts shall indicate the type of payment received
(e.g., cash, check, check number, etc.). Any such cash received should be
deposited with the office of the Clerk-Treasurer the same business day unless
received after hours, and in such event shall be deposited in the Clerk-
Treasurer's office no later than the next business day, along with a copy of
the receipt issued. All receipt books shall be in a form approved by the State
Board of Accounts and the Clerk-Treasurer shall maintain a log of all receipt
books issued which shall be retained for inspection and audit.
         (b)   All funds received shall be deposited in the city's depository
by the Clerk-Treasurer or Deputy Clerk-Treasurer no later than the next
business day as required by IC 5-13-6-1(d) unless such funds on hand do not
exceed $500. When funds on hand exceed $500, such funds shall be deposited the
next business day as required by IC 5-13-6-1(g). All amounts on-hand shall be
deposited on the last working day of a fiscal period regardless of any dollar
or time threshold. The deposit slip shall be completed by the Clerk-Treasurer
or Deputy Clerk-Treasurer and reviewed and initialed by the other. All deposit
slips and the cash receipts ledger shall be maintained in the office of Clerk-
Treasurer for audit purposes.
   (C)   Purchasing internal controls.
      (1)   General. The city purchases office products, services and
maintenance materials in the course of conducting its business. The purpose of
this control is to assure accurate accounting and payment for all purchases
made by city personnel and to limit the opportunity for personal use of city
resources.
      (2)   Process.
         (a)   The Council authorizes the following procedures for purchases by
the city. All purchasing for the city must be conducted only by the following
personnel:
            1.   The Mayor;
            2.   The Clerk-Treasurer;.
            3.   Any authorized city personnel, only with approvals as provided
herein.
         (b)   The Clerk-Treasurer shall have purchasing authority of up to
$5,000 per single item or service expenditure. All such purchase authorizations
shall be substantiated as set forth below. The Clerk-Treasurer shall
additionally be responsible for approving any requests for expenditures within
the Clerk-Treasurer's limits by the Mayor's office, the Maintenance Department,
the Police Department (except as provided below) and other departments prior to
such expenditure being made. The process is listed below:
            1.   Requested purchases under $500 shall be reasonably
investigated to assure the best product is selected with respect to quality,
necessity, and price and such recommendations shall be given to the Clerk-

         (c)   Connection. No other connection to the sewage works in the
Grissom Aeroplex Area shall be allowed until sewer availability fee has been
paid. Such fee shall be paid in full at the time application is made for a
sewer tap permit and is non- refundable.
         (d)   Sewer availability fee.
            1.   There is hereby established, as of October 3, 2011, a sewer
availability fee for the Grissom Aeroplex Service Area. For each new connection
to the Grissom Sewer Collection System, the availability fee shall be based
upon the size of the water line tap connected to the water distribution system
by the applying facility, as detailed below:
Tap Size Availability Fee
Tap Size Availability Fee
3/4"     $310.00
1"       $413.00
1 1/4"   $517.00
1 1/2"   $620.00
2"       $827.00
3"       $1,240.00
4"       $1,653.00
6"       $2,480.00
8"       $3,307.00
10"      $4,133.00
12"      $4,960.00
 
            2.   Availability fees are based on a ration of a 3/4" tap, the
normal size for residential installations, and the size tap used in any
particular connection. For connection sizes not shown above, the cost shall be
calculated using the ratio of the diameter of a 3/4" tap to the diameter of the
tap in any particular installation.
         (e)   Meters. A new connection to the wastewater system must also
install a meter to measure water flow into the facility, even in instances in
which the facility is not connected to the Peru Utilities Water Distribution
System, and the availability fee assessed under this chapter shall be
determined by the size of the tap to which the meter is connected. Such meters
must meet the specifications of Peru Utilities, and shall be installed at the
expense of the owner or developer.
         (f)   Deposit of fees. All sewer availability fees collected from the
Grissom Aeroplex Area shall be deposited into the Grissom Aeroplex Sewage Works
Improvement Fund.

   Provided, however, at the option of the city, the owner or other user, at
his expense, may install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring
devices, or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the
city for the determination of wastewater discharge and billings to such user
shall be based upon such measured discharge as provided in §
51.02 (B).
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water, or other liquids into the city's
Sanitary Sewage System, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of the
water supplied by the city's Water works, and the water used thereon is not
measured by a meter and such user is not defined and listed in (A) above, then
the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or determined by the city
in order to ascertain the rates of charge, or the owner or other interested
party, at his expense, shall, if requested by the city, install and maintain
meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any adequate approved method
acceptable to the city for the determination of the sewage discharge.
   (C)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water, or other liquids into the city's
Sanitary Sewage System, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water
supplied by the city's Water Works, and, in addition, uses water from another
source which is not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter
not acceptable to the city, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise
measured or determined by the city in order to ascertain the rates of charge,
or the owner or otherwise interested party, at his expense, may install and
maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any adequate and
approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the determination of
sewage discharge.
   (D)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water, or other liquids and uses water in
excess of 30,000 gallons per month, and if it can be shown to the satisfaction
of the city that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters
does not and cannot enter the Sanitary Sewage System, then the owner or other
interested party shall install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring
devices, or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the
city for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (E)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other liquids into the city's
Sanitary Sewage System, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and
the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each such
case, for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for
each user, and the minimum charge and the sewage rates and charges shall apply
to each of the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate, or buildings
served through the single water meter.
   (F)   In the event two or more dwelling units such as mobile homes,
apartments, or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other
liquids into the city's Sanitary Sewage System, either directly or indirectly,
are users of water, and the quantity of water is measured by a single water
meter, then in such case the charge and billing shall be for a single service
in the manner set out elsewhere herein, except that such charge and billing
shall be for a single service in the manner set out elsewhere herein, except
that such charge and billing shall not be less than a minimum charge computed
at $3.69 per month for each dwelling unit over one served through a single
meter 80% of the time as an average occupancy factor. A dwelling unit shall be
interpreted as a room or rooms or other living space or spaces in which cooking
facilities are provided. However, in the case of mobile home parks, dwelling
units shall be interpreted and the number of dwelling units shall be computed
as the total number of lots available for the location and installation of
mobile homes in said park, plus any other dwelling units served through the
meter.
   (G)   In order that domestic and residential users of sewage service shall
not be penalized for sprinkling lawns during the months of June, July, August,
and September, the billing for sewage service for residences or domestic users
for said months of June, July, August, and September shall be based on the
water usage for the previous months of, respectively, December, January,
February, and march. In the event the water usage for said previous months of,
respectively, December, January, February, and March is greater than the water
usage for said months of June, July, August, and September, then the billing
for sewage service shall be computed on the actual water used in the month for
which the sewage service bill is being rendered. Domestic or residential sewage
service, as applicable to the sprinkling rate, shall apply to each lot, parcel
of real estate, or building which is occupied and used as a residence. Said
sprinkling rate shall not apply to any premises which are partially or wholly
used for industrial or commercial purposes. In the event a portion of such
premises shall be used for commercial or industrial purposes, the owner shall
have the privilege of separating the water service so that the residential
portion of the premises is served through a separate meter, and in such case,
the water usage as registered by the water meter serving such portion of the
premises used for residential purpose would qualify under the sprinkling rate.
   (H)   For the service rendered to the city, the city shall be subject to the
same rates and charges hereinabove provided or to rates and charges established
in harmony therewith.

§ 51.04 DISCHARGING INDUSTRIAL WASTES.
   (A)   Each user who discharges industrial wastes into the Sewer System shall
be subject to surcharge, in addition to the regular sewerage service charge,
based on both the biochemical oxygen demand (or chemical oxygen demand where
B.O.D. cannot be determined) and the suspended solids content of the wastes, if
these wastes have a concentration greater than the following:
      (1)   A biochemical oxygen demand of 200 milligrams per liter; or where
B.O.D. cannot be determined, a chemical oxygen demand of 400 milligrams per
liter; and/or
      (2)   A suspended solids content of 250 milligrams per liter.
   (B)   The rate of surcharge shall be based on the following:
      (1)   For biochemical oxygen demand (B.O.D.), $.18 per pound.
      (2)   For chemical oxygen demand (C.O.D.), $.18 per pound.
      (3)   For suspended solids (SS), $.17 per pound.
   (C)   The surcharge for excessive strength shall be determined by
multiplying the difference between the average concentration computed in
milligrams per liter of the B.O.D (or C.O.D) or of the suspended solids in the
users' sewage and the allowed concentration defined in (A) above times 0.00834
times the appropriate surcharge rate specified in (B) above times the volume of
water used in thousands of gallons. Sample calculation: Computed average
strength of sewage = 300 mg/l B.O.D.5, 250 mg/l SS. volume of water used per
month = 650,000 gallons. Surcharge = (300 - 200) x (.00834) ($0.06) x 650 =
$32.50
   (D)   (1)   Any industrial wastes discharged into the public sewers shall be
subject to periodic inspection and determination of character and
concentration. The examination shall be made as often as the Superintendent
deems it necessary (but at least once a year), and may include the use of
suitable continuously monitoring instruments in appropriate cases. Samples
shall be collected either manually or by approved mechanical devices and in
such a manner as to be representative of the overall composition of the wastes.
Sampling period shall be for a period of seven consecutive days, but may be of
longer duration at the discretion of the city. In periods when the sampling
program extends for a greater number of consecutive days than seven, the city
shall have the prerogative of selecting the seven consecutive days of its
choice. Every care shall be exercised in collecting the samples to insure their
preservation, until analyzed, in a state comparable to that at the time the
samples were collected.
      (2)   The installation, operation, and maintenance of the sampling
facilities shall be the responsibility of the person discharging the wastes,
and shall be subject to the approval of the Utility Board. Access to sampling
facilities shall be granted at all times to the Superintendent or his duly
authorized representative.
   (E)   Laboratory procedures used in the examination of industrial wastes
shall be those set forth in “Standard Methods.” However, alternative methods
for certain analyses of industrial wastes may be used subject to mutual
agreement between the Superintendent and the customer. The city shall make,
without charge to the customer, the initial analysis and regular periodic check
analyses of the customer's wastes as well as other tests the Superintendent may
deem advisable. Analyses made by the city at the request of the customer shall
be charged to the customer according to the Board's standard work order billing
practices. All such analyses shall be binding in determining strength-of-
wastes surcharges and other matters dependent on the character and
concentration of wastes.
   (F)   Until an adequate analysis of a representative sample of customer's
wastes has been obtained, the city shall, for the purpose of this chapter, make
a determination of the character and concentration of the customer's wastes by
using data based on analyses of similar processes or data for his type of
business that are available for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or
from industry- recognized authoritative sources. This method, if selected by
the city, shall continue until an adequate analysis has been made.
   (G)   Review and acceptance by the Superintendent shall be obtained prior to
the discharge into the sewer system by any user whose wastewater has a B.O.D
greater than 200 milligrams per liter, a suspended solids content greater than
250 milligrams per liter, or has contaminants or characteristics which from the
nature or quantity might be harmful to the structures, processes, or operations
of the sewage works, or to health, whether by themselves or through interacting
with other wastes in public sewers. The city is authorized to require methods
of pretreatment of said wastes as may be determined to be necessary to render
the wastes acceptable to the sewer system.
   (H)   (1)   Plans, specifications, and other pertinent information relating
to proposed preliminary treatment or processing facilities shall be submitted
to the city for examination and approval, and no construction of such
facilities shall begin until the city, through its Utility Board, has given its
written approval. Such approval shall not exempt the person from the obligation
to make further reasonable adoptions of such facilities when such adaptations
prove necessary to secure the results desired.
      (2)   Where such preliminary treatment facilities are provided, they
shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operating
condition by the person at his own expense, and shall be subject to periodic
inspection by the city. The person shall maintain suitable operating records
and shall submit to the Superintendent such monthly summary reports of the
character of the influent and effluent as the latter may prescribe.

§ 51.05 BILLING.
   The rates and charges shall be prepared and billed by the city as determined
by the bylaws and regulations of the city as hereinafter provided for, and
shall be collected in the manner provided by law and ordinance. These rates and
charges will be billed to the tenant, occupant, or owner of the property served
in the same name as city water works utility meter billings are made for such
property, if any, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner; provided
such billing shall in no way relieve the owner for liability in the event
payment is not made as herein required. The owners of the property served,
which is occupied by tenants or interested parties, shall have the right to
examine the collection records of the city for the purpose of determining
whether such rates and charges have been paid by the tenants or interested
parties, provided such examination shall be made in the office in which these
records are kept and during the hours that such office is open for business.

particular connection. For connection sizes not shown above, the cost shall be
calculated using that ratio of the diameter of a 3/4-inch tap to the diameter
of the tap in any particular installation.
   (C)   Any new connection to the wastewater system must also install a meter
to measure water entering the facility, even in instances in which the facility
is not connected to the Peru Utilities water distribution system, and the
availability fee assessed under this chapter shall be determined by the size of
the tap to which the meter is connected. Such meters must meet the
specifications of Peru Utilities, and shall be installed at the expense of the
owner or developer.
   (D)   The following funds and the uses of same are hereby established:
      (1)   Sewer Collection System Improvement Fund - This fund shall be used

remain in each fund. If payment is not made, the fee constitutes a lien on the
property for which the connection is made. The lien may be enforced as
prescribed by I.C. 36-9-23-34.
   (G)   The availability and connection costs shall be due and payable to the
Peru utilities upon issuance of sewer tap permit for any new user and shall be
non-refundable.

STORMWATER RATES
§ 51.20 PURPOSE.
   It is necessary for public health and welfare of the citizens of Peru to
establish a stormwater fee for the purpose of funding necessary changes and
improvements in the stormwater system within the city to meet federal and state
clean water standards and to insure that both public and private property is
protected, to the greatest extent possible, from flooding as the result of
surface water.
(Ord. 24-2004, passed 6-7-04)
§ 51.21 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of establishing stormwater service fees pursuant to IC § 8-1.5-
5-7, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates
or requires a different meaning.
   AMOUNT BILLED. The ISA is divided by the ERU. The result is multiplied by
the user fee to arrive at the amount to be billed.
   EQUIVALENT RESIDENTIAL UNIT (ERU). The average impervious surface area of 50
residential properties selected at random. This number is 3.497 square feet.
   IMPERVIOUS SURFACE AREA (ISA). Square footage of a parcel of land that is
covered by concrete, asphalt, building(s), stone or other material that speed
up the runoff of stormwater from a developed site.
   TYPE A PROPERTY. Properties containing a single family residence, or an
apartment with an individual water meter, in which only the owner or renter,
the family of the owner or renter, or a single family resides, where no form of
agreement allows for two or more families to live there, and no business is
conducted there.
   TYPE B PROPERTY. All properties not categorized as Type A. This includes,
but is not limited to, all businesses, churches and other places of religious
affiliation, schools, colleges, mobile home or manufactured home parks,
condominium complexes that are part of private residential communities,
community centers, apartment complexes with common rather than individual water
meters, city owned buildings, parks, retirement complexes, duplexes with common
rather than single family residence.
(Ord. 24-2004, passed 6-7-04)
§ 51.22 PROCEDURES; RATES.
   For purposes of establishing stormwater service fees pursuant to IC § 8-1.5-
5-7, the following procedures and rates shall apply:
   (A)   An ERU of 1.0 is assigned to each Type A Property. The ERU for each
Type B Property shall be determined by the following formula:
 
ERU = ISA
      3,497
 
The minimum ERU for a property is 1.0.
   (B)   The user fee for one ERU shall be $4 per month. For ERU greater than
1.0, the user fee shall be multiplied by the ERU to determine the monthly user
fee. For billing purposes, the ERU will be rounded to the nearest 0.1 ERU.
   (C)   No landowner shall incur a user fee greater than $225 per month,
regardless of the number of ERUs computed for the landowner's property. A fee
of $235 per month is a fee generated as a result of 200,000 square feet of ISA.
Landowners with multiple locations likewise shall not incur a user fee greater
than $225 per month.
   (D)   The user fee for unoccupied buildings shall be billed to the landowner
if no other utilities are being actively billed. If, however, the building is
not presently receiving other utility services, no stormwater bill shall be
issued.
   (E)   In situations where a residence has separate service to a building on
the premises, only one user fee (one ERU) will be charged to the residence.
   (F)   Current Peru Utilities customers within the corporate boundaries of
the City of Peru shall be billed unless a building is known to rent commercial
space to more than one entity, such as a commercial strip mall. In this case
the property owner shall be billed for the entire parcel.
   (G)   Service rates shall be effective July 5, 2004 and shall be included in
the bill issued by Peru Utilities and shall be designated as the stormwater
fee, or wording to that effect. Peru Utilities is hereby authorized to include
the applicable stormwater fee on the monthly bill of each customer without the
necessity of the customer authorizing the charge. Peru Utilities is also
authorized to collect the fee in the same manner and with the same remedies,
including legal actions and liens, with which it is authorized to collect fees
for electric, water and sewer services.
   (H)   Peru Utilities shall remit collections to the City Clerk Treasurer in
a lump sum on a monthly basis. Peru Utilities shall deduct from the payment any
monies used for placement of liens, bad check recalls and returned deposits on
other utilities.
(Ord. 24-2004, passed 6-7-04)
§ 51.23 USE OF REVENUES.
   The cost of stormwater projects and the incidental expenses connected
therewith and the cost, if any, of financing for stormwater projects shall be
paid out of revenues generated by the stormwater user fee. The Stormwater
Utility Board shall have the authority to determine how those funds are used
and shall have the authority to issue bonds or borrow money if necessary to
carry out their responsibilities.
(Ord. 24-2004, passed 6-7-04)
§ 51.24 NON-RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS.
   Appended to Ordinance 24-2004 and incorporated into it is a document
entitled Determination of Impervious Areas for Non- Residential Customers,
which establishes rates which non-residential customers shall be charged.
Updates to this document shall be made from time to time and shall be filed
with the City Clerk Treasurer and Peru Utilities, subject to approval from the
Peru Common Council. The most current update shall be used by Peru Utilities in
charging a monthly fee to nonresidential customers.
(Ord. 24-2004, passed 6-7-04)
§ 51.25 CREDIT FOR STORMWATER RUNOFF MITIGATION.
   (A)   Owners of non-residential properties who are subject to the provisions
of this chapter shall be eligible for a stormwater billing credit as set forth
in Addendum A, attached to, made a part of Ordinance 26, 2012 and incorporated
herein by reference.
   (B)   The Peru Utility Service Board shall be responsible for the
implementation of this section and may formulate policies and procedures as

materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any
pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality
standards, other than stormwater. The commencement, conduct or continuance of
any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as
described as follows:
      (1)   The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this chapter: water line flushing or other potable water
sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising
ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped
ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater
dewatering systems), water from crawl space pumps, air conditioning
condensation, springs, non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian
habitat or wet-land flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated - less than one PPM
chlorine), fire fighting activities, and any other water source not containing
pollutants.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the city as being necessary to
protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal
notification to the city prior to the time of the test.
      (4)   The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
   (B)   Prohibition of illicit connections.
      (1)   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of
illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
      (2)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (3)   A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue.
(Ord. 33-2004, passed 9-7-04)
§ 53.09 SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
   (A)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations.  The
city may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when
such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or
to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United
States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an
emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize
danger to persons.
   (B)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
city will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The
violator may petition the Peru Board of Public Works & Safety for a
reconsideration and hearing.
   (C)   A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the
city.
(Ord. 33-2004, passed 9-7-04)
§ 53.10 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to
the city prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
(Ord. 33-2004, passed 9-7-04)
§ 53.11 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES; ACCESS TO FACILITIES.
   (A)   The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to
regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force
which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the city.
   (B)   Facility operators shall allow the city ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying
of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
   (C)   The city shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such
devices as are necessary in the opinion of the city to conduct monitoring and/
or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
   (D)   The city has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be installed and maintained by the discharger at its own expense. The
discharger shall maintain the monitoring equipment at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and
quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
   (E)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
facility's operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the facility's
operator.
   (F)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter. A
person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge
stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person
denies the city reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of
conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
   (G)   If the city has been refused access to any part of the premises from
which stormwater is discharged, and the city is able to demonstrate probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there
is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the
community, then the city may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court
of competent jurisdiction.

§ 53.12 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL AND REDUCE STORMWATER POLLUTANTS BY THE
USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The city shall adopt requirements identifying best management practices for
any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution
or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S.
The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge
of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system
or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. By
way of example these establishments could include: retail gasoline outlets; or
municipal, state, federal or institutional refueling areas. Further, any person
responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an
illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense,
additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge
of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliant with all
terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of
stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable,
shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs
shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for
compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 33-2004, passed 9-7-04)
§ 53.13 PROPER CREDENTIAL OR IDENTIFICATION REQUIRED.
   The city shall present proper credentials or identification before entering
upon property of the person.
(Ord. 33-2004, passed 9-7-04)
§ 53.14 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly impede the flow of water
through the watercourse. If herbicides are used for vegetation control, that
herbicide shall be compatible with and registered for use in and around
watercourses. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing
privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such
structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity
of the watercourse.
(Ord. 33-2004, passed 9-7-04)
§ 53.15 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation, has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or water of the U.S. said
person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and
cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials
or non-hazardous spills said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services (Central Dispatch).
In the event of any spill, said person shall notify the city in person or by
phone or facsimile no later than one business day. If the discharge of
prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment,
the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site
written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least seven years from date
of record.
(Ord. 33-2004, passed 9-7-04)

§ 54.08 CONTROL OF EROSION AND SEDIMENT DURING LAND-DISTURBING ACTIVITIES.
   (A)   General requirements. Control of erosion and sediment is the
responsibility of the applicant. Design criteria, details, and specifications
are located in the Stormwater Development Manual. Applicability and general
requirements are defined as follows.
   (B)   Applicability. This section applies to the following sites with land-
disturbing activities:
      (1)   Those requiring a subdivision plat approval or local improvement
location permit for the construction of commercial, residential or
institutional buildings on lots of approved subdivision plats;
      (2)   Those involving grading, removal of protective ground cover or
vegetation, excavation, land filling, or other land-disturbing activity
affecting a surface area of 10,000 square feet or more;
      (3)   Those involving excavation, filling, or a combination of excavation

enlargement, relocation, or reconstruction; and
      (5)   Those involving the laying, repairing, replacing, or enlarging of
an underground pipe or utility for a distance of 300 feet or more.
   (C)   Erosion and other sediment control requirements.  The following
requirements shall be met on all sites:
      (1)   Site dewatering: sediment-laden water from dewatering activities
flowing from the site shall be detained by temporary sediment basins or other
appropriate measures. Also, water shall not be discharged in a manner that
causes erosion in the receiving channel.
      (2)   Waste and material disposal: wastes or unused building materials
including, but not limited to, garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater,
toxic materials, and hazardous substances, shall not be carried by runoff from
a site. Proper disposal of all wastes and used building materials, in line with
the nature of the waste material, is required.
      (3)   Tracking: sediment being tracked from a site onto public or private
roadways shall be minimized. This can be accomplished initially by a well-
planned layout of roads, construction entrances, access drives, and parking
areas of sufficient width and length. However, protective covering also may be
necessary.
      (4)   Sediment removal: public or private roadways shall be kept cleared
of accumulated sediment. If appreciable sedimentation occurs after a storm
event, the sediment shall be deposited on the parcels of land, if in the site,
from where it likely originated so that the erosion and sedimentation does not
recur.
      (5)   Drain inlet protection: all storm drain inlets shall be protected
against sedimentation with straw bales, filter fabric, or equivalent barriers
meeting accepted design criteria, standards, and specifications. During winter
months other methods may be incorporated as approved by the city.
   (D)   Site erosion control. the following items apply only to the time
period when land-disturbing activities are taking place:
      (1)   Runoff passing through a site from adjacent area shall be
controlled by diverting it around disturbed areas.
      (2)   Runoff from a disturbed area shall be controlled by one or more of
the following measures:
         (a)   Unvegetated areas that are schedules or likely to be left
inactive for 15 days or more must be temporarily or permanently stabilized with
measures appropriate for the season to minimize erosion potential. Alternative
measures to site stabilization are acceptable if the project site owner or
their representative can demonstrate they have implemented erosion and sediment
control measures adequate to prevent sediment discharge. Vegetated areas with a
density of less than 70% shall be restabilized using appropriate methods to
minimize the erosion potential.
         (b)   With disturbed areas within a site of ten acres or more, where
drainage is in the same direction or where runoff will result in loss of soil,
an abatement or recovery program is required.
         (c)   With disturbed areas within a site of less than ten acres,
filter fences, straw bales, or equivalent erosion control measures placed along
all sideslope and downslope sides of the site shall be required.
      (3)   Erosion from all storage piles shall be controlled by placing straw
bales, filter fence or other appropriate barriers around the piles. Adjacent
storm drain inlets shall be protected using similar filter barriers.

§ 54.09 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR INDIVIDUAL LOTS WITHIN A PERMITTED PROJECT.
   Provisions for erosion and sediment control on individual building lots
regulated under the original permit of a project site owner must include the
following requirements:
   (A)   The individual lot operator, whether owning the property or acting as
the agent of the property owner, shall be responsible for erosion and sediment
control requirements associated with activities on individual lots.
   (B)   Installation and maintenance of a stable construction site access
road.
   (C)   Installation and maintenance of appropriate perimeter erosion and
sediment control measures prior to land disturbance.
   (D)   Sediment discharge and tracking from each lot must be minimized
throughout the land disturbing activities on the lot until permanent
stabilization has been achieved.
   (E)   Clean-up of sediment that is either tracked or washed onto roads. Bulk
clearing of sediment shall not include flushing the area with water. Cleared
sediment must be redistributed or disposed of in a manner that is in compliance
with all applicable statutes and rules.
   (F)   Adjacent lots disturbed by an individual lot operator must be repaired
and stabilized to pre-disturbed condition.
   (G)   For individual residential lots, final stabilization will be achieved
when the individual lot operator:
      (1)   Completes final stabilization; or
      (2)   Has installed appropriate erosion and sediment control measures for
an individual lot prior to occupation of the home by the homeowner and has
informed the homeowner of the requirement for, and benefits of, final
stabilization.

§ 55.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management
requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety,
and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction. The
objectives of this chapter are:
      (A)   Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in
order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and
streambank erosion and to maintain the integrity of stream channels;
      (B)   Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by
stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;
      (C)   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which
flows from any specific site during and following development not to exceed the
pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable; and
      (D)   Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and
nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management
controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained
and pose no threat to public safety.
(Ord. 35-2004, passed 10-4-04)
§ 55.02 AUTHORITY.
   This chapter is adopted under the authority granted by IC §§ 36-1-4-11, 36-
7-4, and all acts supplemental and amendatory thereto. This authority provides
for the administration, enforcement, and amendment of this chapter for control
of post construction stormwater runoff in the City of Peru.
(Ord. 35-2004, passed 10-4-04)
§ 55.03 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   This chapter shall be applicable to all subdivision or site plan
applications, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by the city
under §
55.08. The chapter also applies to land development activities that are smaller
than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of a larger
common plan of development that meets the following applicability criteria,
even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take
place at different times on different schedules. In addition, all plans shall
also be reviewed by local environmental protection officials to ensure that
established water quality standards will be maintained during and after
development of the site and that post construction runoff levels are consistent
with any local and regional watershed plans.
   (B)   To prevent the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff, the City of Peru
has developed a set of performance standards that shall be met at new
development sites. These standards apply to any construction activity
disturbing 10,000 or more square feet of land but shall not apply to
construction of single family residences. The following activities may be
exempt from these stormwater performance criteria:
      (1)   Any logging and agricultural activity which is consistent with an
approved soil conservation plan or a timber management plan prepared or
approved by the (appropriate agency), as applicable;
      (2)   Additions or modifications to existing single family structures;
      (3)   Developments that do not disturb more than 10,000 square feet,
provided they are not part of a larger common development plan;
      (4)   Repairs to any stormwater treatment practice deemed necessary by
the City of Peru.
   (C)   When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a
redevelopment project as defined in §
55.06, decisions on permitting and on-site stormwater requirements shall be
governed by criteria that is dependent on the amount of impervious area created
by the redevelopment and its impact on water quality. These criteria are
developed on a case by case basis. Final authorization of all redevelopment
projects will be determined after a review by the city.
(Ord. 35-2004, passed 10-4-04)
§ 55.04 RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMINISTRATION.

chapter. Any powers granted or duties imposed upon the city may be delegated in
writing by the city to persons or entities acting in the beneficial interest of
or in the employ of the city.
(Ord. 35-2004, passed 10-4-04)
§ 55.05 COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER PERMIT AND CHAPTER REQUIREMENTS.
   This chapter is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other
chapter, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The
requirements of this chapter should be considered minimum requirements, and
where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from those
imposed by any other chapter, rule or regulation, or other provision of law,
whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards
for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.

(Ord. 35-2004, passed 10-4-04)
§ 55.09 WAIVERS TO STORMWATER REQUIREMENT.
   (A)   Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required by
this chapter, unless a written request is filed to waive this requirement.
Requests to waive the stormwater management plan requirements shall be
submitted to the city for approval.
   (B)   The minimum requirements for stormwater management may be waived in
whole or in part upon written request of the applicant, provided that at least
one of the following conditions applies:
      (1)   It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely
to impair attainment of the objectives of this chapter.
      (2)   Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of
stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater management plan
that has been approved by the city and the implementation of the plan is
required by local chapter.
      (3)   Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility.
The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately
sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than
that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a legally
obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the
stormwater practice.

requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical
characteristics of a site.
      (5)   In instances where one of the conditions above applies, the city
may grant a waiver from strict compliance with these stormwater management
provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation measures are provided. However, to
be eligible for a variance, the applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the city that the variance will not result in the following impacts to
downstream waterways:
         (a)   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures;
         (b)   Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
         (c)   Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation; and
         (d)   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life,
property.
      (6)   Furthermore, where compliance with minimum requirements for
stormwater management is waived, the applicant will satisfy the minimum
requirements by meeting one of the mitigation measures selected by the
jurisdictional stormwater authority. Mitigation measures may include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         (a)   The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant
of an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation. These
lands should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to provide
permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat;
         (b)   The creation of a stormwater management facility or other
drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public or private,
that currently lack stormwater management facilities designed and constructed
in accordance with the purposes and standards of this chapter;
         (c)   Monetary contributions (Fee-in-Lieu) to fund stormwater
management activities such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland
delineation studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and
macroinvertebrates, stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species
studies, hydrologic studies, and monitoring of stormwater management

§ 55.10 GENERAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Unless judged by the city to be exempt or granted a waiver, the
following performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at
all sites:
      (1)   All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to
control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified
design storms and reduce the generation of stormwater. These practices should
seek to utilize swales and natural depressions as site conditions allow,
utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater
runoff generated from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and
landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both
water quality and quantity.
      (2)   All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not
discharge untreated stormwater directly into a jurisdictional wetland or local
water body without adequate treatment. Where such discharges are proposed, the
impact of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be assessed using a
method acceptable to the city. In no case shall the impact on functional values
be any less than allowed by the Army Corp of Engineers (ACE) or the appropriate
state agency (e.g. IDEM, IDNR, etc.) responsible for natural resources.
      (3)   All sites shall store, infiltrate, filter, vegetate or any
combination of these practices to reduce the impact of pollutants in storm
water run-off on receiving waters. In addition to these practices, the
following requirements shall be utilized:
         (a)   Infiltration practices will not be allowed in wellhead
protection areas.
         (b)   Discharges from an MS4 area will not be allowed directly into
sinkholes or fractured bedrock without treatment that results in the discharge
meeting Indiana ground water quality standards as referenced in 327 IAC 2-11.
         (c)   Any stormwater practice that is a Class V injection well must
ensure that the discharge from such practices meets Indiana ground water
quality standards as referenced in 327 IAC 2-11.
         (d)   As site conditions allow, the rate at which water flows through
the MS4 conveyances shall be regulated to reduce outfall scouring and stream
bank erosion.
         (e)   As site conditions allow, a vegetated filter strip of
appropriate width shall be maintained along unvegetated swales and ditches.
         (f)   New retail gasoline outlets, new municipal, state, federal, or
institutional refueling areas, or outlets and refueling areas that replace
their existing tank systems shall be required to design and install appropriate
practices to reduce lead, copper, zinc, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in
stormwater run-off.
      (4)   To protect stream channels from degradation, channel protection
shall be provided.
      (5)   Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources
(i.e., wellhead protection areas, cold water fisheries, shellfish beds,
swimming beaches, recreational waters, recharge areas, water supply reservoirs)
may be subject to additional performance criteria, or may need to utilize or
restrict certain stormwater management practices.
      (6)   Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a
stormwater pollution prevention plan, and shall file a notice of intent (NOI)
under the provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) general permit, commonly referred to as Rule 6. The stormwater
pollution prevention plan requirement applies to both existing and new
industrial sites.
      (7)    Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher
potential pollutant loadings, known as "hotspots", may require the use of
specific structural STPs and pollution prevention practices.
   (B)   Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the city to
determine if they are subject to additional stormwater design requirements.
These additional requirements may include:
      (1)   Buffer strip and riparian zone preservation;
      (2)   Filter strip creation;
      (3)   Minimization of land disturbance and surface imperviousness;
      (4)   Minimization of directly connected impervious areas;
      (5)   Maximization of open space; or
      (6)   Directing the community's physical growth away from sensitive areas
and toward areas that can support it without compromising water quality.
   (C)   The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the Stormwater
Development Manual shall be used for sizing all stormwater management
practices.
(Ord. 35-2004, passed 10-4-04)
§ 55.11 BASIC STORMWATER MANAGEMENT DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (A)   Minimum control requirements. All stormwater management practices will
be designed so that the specific storm frequency storage volumes (e.g.,
recharge, water quality, channel protection, 10-year, 100-year) as identified
in the current Stormwater Development Manual are met, unless the city grants
the applicant a waiver or the applicant is exempt from such requirements. In
addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control than
that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city reserves the right
to impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to control the
volume, timing, and rate of runoff.
   (B)   Site design feasibility. Stormwater management practices for a site
shall be chosen based on the physical conditions of the site. Among the factors
that should be considered:
      (1)   Topography;
      (2)   Maximum Drainage Area;
      (3)   Depth to Water Table;
      (4)   Soils;
      (5)   Slopes;
      (6)   Terrain;
      (7)   Location in relation to environmentally sensitive features or
ultra-urban areas; and
   (8)   Applicants shall consult the Stormwater Development Manual for
guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting a
stormwater management practice.
   (C)   Conveyance issues. All stormwater management practices shall be
designed to convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants
and reduction in flow velocities. This shall include, but not be limited to:
      (1)   Maximizing of flowpaths from inflow points to outflow points;
      (2)   Protection of inlet and outfall structures;
      (3)   Elimination of erosive flow velocities; and
      (4)   Providing of underdrain systems, where applicable.
   (D)   The Stormwater Development Manual shall provide detailed guidance on
the requirements for conveyance for each of the approved stormwater management
practices.
(Ord. 35-2004, passed 10-4-04)
§ 55.12 REQUIREMENTS FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN APPROVAL.
   (A)   The general requirements for the Stormwater Management Plan are
described below. Specific details for the requirements for a stormwater
management plan are presented in the Stormwater Development Manual.
   (B)   No application for development will be approved unless it includes a
stormwater management plan detailing how runoff and associated water quality
impacts resulting from the development will be controlled or managed. This plan
shall be prepared by a registered engineer or land surveyor and shall indicate
whether stormwater will be managed on-site or off-site. If stormwater is
managed on-site, the plan shall also identify the general location and type of
practices.
   (C)   For development or redevelopment occurring on a previously developed
site, an applicant shall be required to include within the stormwater concept
plan measures for controlling existing stormwater runoff discharges from the
site in accordance with the standards of this chapter to the maximum extent
practicable.
(Ord. 35-2004, passed 10-4-04)
§ 55.13 PERFORMANCE BOND/SECURITY.
   (A)   The city may, at its discretion, require the submittal of a
performance security or bond prior to issuance of a permit in order to insure
that the stormwater practices are installed by the permit holder as required by
the approved stormwater management plan. The amount of the installation
performance security shall be the total estimated construction cost of the
stormwater management practices approved under the permit, plus 25%.
   (B)   The performance security shall contain forfeiture provisions for
failure to complete work specified in the stormwater management plan.
   (C)   The installation performance security shall be released in full only
upon submission of "as built plans" and written certification by a registered
professional engineer that the stormwater practice has been installed in
accordance with the approved plan and other applicable provisions of this
chapter. The city will make a final inspection of the stormwater practice to
ensure that it is in compliance with the approved plan and the provisions of
this chapter. Provisions for a partial pro-rata release of the performance
security based on the completion of various development stages can be done at
the discretion of the city.
(Ord. 35-2004, passed 10-4-04)
§ 55.14 CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION.
   (A)   Notice of construction commencement. The applicant shall notify the
city in advance before the commencement of construction. Regular inspections of
the stormwater management system construction shall be conducted by the staff
of the city or their designee who has been approved by the jurisdictional
stormwater authority.
   (B)   Violations. If any violations are found, the property owner shall be
notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective
actions. No added work shall proceed until any violations are corrected and all
work previously completed has received approval by the city.
(Ord. 35-2004, passed 10-4-04)
§ 55.15 AS BUILT PLANS.
   All applicants are required to submit clean "as built" plans for any
stormwater management practices located on-site after final construction is

is (or may be) a discharge of pollutants, the construction of which commenced
after the publication of proposed pretreatment standards under Section 307(c)
of the Act which will be applicable to such source if such standards are
thereafter promulgated in accordance with that section, provided that:
         (a)   The building, structure, facility, or installation is
constructed at a site at which no other source is located; or

is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing source, should
be considered.
      (2)   Construction on a site at which an existing source is located
results in a modification rather than a new source if the construction does not
create a new building, structure, facility, or installation meeting the
criteria of subsection (1)(b) or (c) above but otherwise alters, replaces, or
adds to existing process or production equipment.

   * As an alternative to the total oil and grease limitations established by
this section, the Superintendent may establish in an IWP a limitation of 100
mg/l for non-polar grease. The alternative limitation is subject to the
following conditions:
      1.   The user submits an application for the alternative limit;
      2.   The user provides information regarding the user's products,
processes, and operations that shows to the Superintendent's satisfaction that
the oil and grease discharged by the user is predominantly of animal or
vegetable origin;
      3.   The user shows that the oil and grease in the user's discharges is
not visible, free, or floating at 50°F at any time;
      4.   The user has sampling facilities that allow for both visual
inspection of the user's discharge and using the equipment necessary for
collection of samples for floatable oil and grease;
      5.   The oil and grease in the user's discharge is not related to past
instances of obstruction, interference, or pass through;
      6.   Users subject to the alternative limit shall continue to operate and
maintain grease traps and any other oil and grease separation and treatment
equipment and shall continue all existing practices that reduce discharges of
oil and grease;
      7.   If the Superintendent determines that a user subject to the
alternative limit has caused, alone or in conjunction with other discharges,
obstruction, interference, or pass through, then the user shall comply with the
total oil and grease limitation or another appropriate limitation established
by the Utility in the user's IWP; and
      8.   Any other appropriate conditions set forth in the user's SIU.
   (B)   The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged
to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances for "total" metal
unless indicated otherwise. The Superintendent may impose mass limitations in
addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations above.
   (C)   Upon the promulgation of the National Categorical Pretreatment
Standard (NCPS) for a particular user, the said standard, if more stringent
than the limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that category,
shall, when effective, immediately supersede the limitations and conditions
imposed under this chapter. The Superintendent shall notify all known affected
users of the applicable permitting and reporting requirements under 40 CFR
403.12.

   The Utility Service Board reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or
in wastewater discharge permits, different or more stringent standards or
requirements on discharges to the POTWs. It is within the Utility's discretion
to negotiate specific prohibitions on a case-by-case basis for any limitations,
assuming that the POTW NPDES permit compliance is not jeopardized. It is
further understood that Peru Utilities and the Grissom Aeroplex Utilities may
have entered into contracts predating this chapter which may define limitations
and conditions which are different than those listed herein. In those specific
cases the original contract may govern given that NPDES compliance is not
jeopardized.

   No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly
authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The
Superintendent may impose mass limitation on users who are using dilution to
meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when
the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

   Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this
chapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in §
56.020 within the time limitation specified by EPA, the state, or the
Superintendent, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for
compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense.
Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the Superintendent for review, and shall be acceptable to the
Superintendent before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans
and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge
acceptable to the Utility under the provisions of this chapter.

§ 56.041 ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES.
   (A)   Whenever deemed necessary, the superintendent may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewer, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage wastestream from industrial wastestreams,
and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine
the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The Superintendent may require any person discharging into the POTW to
install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable

failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge.
   (C)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the Superintendent,
using the procedures prescribed in §
56.110, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
   (D)   All reports submitted to either state or federal agencies related to
the IWP and/or compliance must be furnished to the Superintendent.

§ 56.104 REPORTS OF CHANGED CONDITIONS.
   Each user must notify the Superintendent of any planned significant changes
to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or
volume of its wastewater at least 90 days before the change.
   (A)   The Superintendent may require the user to submit such information as
may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §
56.065.
   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the Superintendent, submit a detailed written report describing the
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
discharge described in division (A) above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees who may cause such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.

§ 56.105 REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.
   (A)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems
for the POTW, the user shall within two hours telephone and notify the
Superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include the location of
the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and
corrective actions taken by the user.
   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the Superintendent, submit a detailed written report describing the
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in division (A) above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees who may cause such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.

§ 56.107 NOTICE OF VIOLATION; REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING.
   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
the Superintendent within two hours of becoming aware of the violation. The
user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the Superintendent within 30 days after becoming aware of
the violation. The user is not required to resample if the Superintendent
monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the Superintendent
samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the
results of this sampling.

§ 56.108 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Region V Waste Management Division Director, and the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management Office of Solid and Hazardous Waste, in
writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise
disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such
notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40
CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge
(continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms
of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall
contain the following information to the extent such information is known and
readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents
contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such
constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an
estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be
discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no
later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this
division need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged.
However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under §
56.104. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
56.100,
56.102 and
56.103.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A) above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute
hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous
wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time
notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such
quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
Superintendent, the EPA Region V Waste Management Division Director, and the
Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) of the discharge of such
substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

§ 56.109 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40
CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance
with procedures approved by EPA.
(Ord. 25-2000, passed 9-5-00; Am. Ord. 10-2006, passed 3-6-06)
§ 56.110 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (A)   Except as indicated in division (B) below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In
the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the Superintendent may
authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab
samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative
sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease (O & G), temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
(Ord. 25-2000, passed 9-5-00; Am. Ord. 10-2006, passed 3-6-06)
§ 56.111 TIMING.
   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
(Ord. 25-2000, passed 9-5-00; Am. Ord. 10-2006, passed 3-6-06)
§ 56.112 RECORD KEEPING.
   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include
the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person
(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the
analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; the results of such
analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three
years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any
litigation concerning the user or the Peru Utility Service Board, or where the
user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the
Superintendent.

COMPLIANCE MONITORING
§ 56.120 RIGHT OF ENTRY; INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   The Superintendent shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to
determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this chapter
and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall
allow the Superintendent ready access to all parts of the premises for the
purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the
performance of any additional duties.
   (A)   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Superintendent or his or her agent will be
permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific
responsibilities.
   (B)   The Superintendent or his or her agent shall have the right to set up
on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
   (C)   The Superintendent may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user
at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated at a minimum of once per year to ensure their accuracy.
   (D)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the Superintendent and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
   (E)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Superintendent or his or her agent
access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 25-2000, passed 9-5-00; Am. Ord. 10-2006, passed 3-6-06)
§ 56.121 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the Superintendent has been refused access to a building, structure, or
property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need
to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, then the Superintendent may seek issuance of a search
warrant from the Miami Circuit or Superior Court to obtain samples or seize
other evidence which would show a violation of the terms of this chapter.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
§ 56.130 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring
programs, and from the Utilities Manager's inspection and sampling activities,
shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user
specifically requests otherwise and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the Superintendent that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as
trade secrets under applicable state or federal law. Any such request must be
asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested
and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should
be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade
secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the
public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental
agencies for uses related to the NDPES program or pretreatment program, and in
enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR
2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available
to the public without restriction.

   (B)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter
during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum
limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD,
TSS, FOG, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH).
   (C)   Any other discharge violation that the Superintendent believes has
caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass
through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general
public;
   (D)   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Superintendent's
exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   (E)   Failure to meet, within 90 days from the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement
order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final
compliance;
   (F)   Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with
categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports,
and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
   (G)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   (H)   Any other violation(s) which the Superintendent determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.

ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
§ 56.150 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   When the Board finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent shall serve upon that user a written Notice of Violation. Within
30 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a
plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the
Superintendent. Submission of this plan does not relieve the user of liability
for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of
Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Board to
take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a Notice of Violation.
(Ord. 25-2000, passed 9-5-00; Am. Ord. 10-2006, passed 3-6-06)
§ 56.151 AGREED ORDERS.
   The Board may enter into Agreed Orders, assurances of voluntary compliance,
or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible
for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by
the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the
document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the
administrative orders issued pursuant to §§
56.153 and
56.154 and shall be judicially enforceable.

hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before
the Board and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not
be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered
or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 15 days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the
user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.

§ 56.153 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the
user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may
be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or
that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Superintendent may
issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations
and directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   (B)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

order issued pursuant to this chapter, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed
$2,500 as provided by IC § 36-1-3-8. Such fines shall be assessed on a per
violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average
discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of
violation.
   (B)   Any person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation or
certification in any application, report, or other document required by this
chapter or other applicable regulation, or who tampers with or knowingly
renders inaccurate any monitoring device, will, upon conviction, be guilty of a
Class A infraction and may be fined by any sum not to exceed $10,000 pursuant
to IC § 34-28-5-4(a).
   (C)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 60 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance, and interest shall
accrue thereafter at a rate of 1.8% per month. A lien against the user's
property may be filed for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
   (D)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the Board to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount
within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request is granted, the
Board may convene a rehearing of the matter. In the event the user's appeal is
successful, any portion of the original fine abated shall be refunded to the
user, together with any interest accruing thereon. The Board may add the costs
of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to
the fine.
   (E)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

§ 56.156 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)   The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
formal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice
and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of
the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the
environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent
may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings in §
56.157 are initiated against the user.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Superintendent prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under §
56.152 or
56.157.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
§ 56.190 UPSET.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An UPSET does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (C) below are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence, that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
      (3)   The user has notified the Superintendent or his agents of the upset
immediately or within no more than two hours of discovery; and
      (4)   The user has submitted the following information to the
Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset:
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
(Ord. 25-2000, passed 9-5-00; Am. Ord. 10-2006, passed 3-6-06)
§ 56.191 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
56.020(A) or the specific prohibitions in §
56.020(B)(3) through (16) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason
to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the Utility was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit for the referenced facility, and
in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or
disposal requirements.
(Ord. 25-2000, passed 9-5-00; Am. Ord. 10-2006, passed 3-6-06)
§ 56.192 BYPASS.
   (A)   For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      BYPASS. The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a
user's treatment facility.
      SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property, damage
to  the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of divisions (C) and (D) of this section.
   (C)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Superintendent, at least ten days before the date of
the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Superintendent of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within two
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Superintendent may waive the written report on
a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within two hours.
   (D)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Superintendent may take an enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless:
      (1)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or
severe property damage;
      (2)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
      (3)   The Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Superintendent determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in this division (D).

§
72.99
§ 72.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Whoever violates any provision of §§
72.19 through
72.27 shall be punished by a fine of $10 for the first offense, $20 for the
second offense, and $30 for each subsequent offense; or in the event of a
violation by a juvenile under 16 years of age, by impounding of the person's
bicycle for a period not to exceed 30 days, or by any combination thereof.
   (B)   Whoever violates §
72.28 shall be fined as provided in division (A) above.
   (C)   Violation of §
72.29 (obstruction of riverfront walkway).
      The first violation in any calendar year shall be subject to the general
penalty provision for this Code in accordance with the provisions of PMC §
10.99. All second and subsequent violations in a calendar year are subject to
abatement procedures and the maximum penalties provided in PMC §
10.99. Each event shall constitute a separate offense. Each violator may have
their vehicle confiscated and impounded until such time as the fines assessed
above are paid in full together with all storage fees and towing costs for
which the owner and/or operator shall be jointly responsible.
   (D)   Violation of §
72.41.
      (1)   A police officer having probable cause to believe a person has
violated §
72.41 above may immediately confiscate the motorized vehicle or pocket bike and
remove it to a garage or other place of safety as designated by the Police
Department. Whenever an officer removes a motorized vehicle or pocket bike as
authorized under this section, he shall enter such fact on the records of the
Police Department maintained for such purpose, and the records shall be kept to
show the type of vehicle, name of the registered owner, license number, and the
name and address of the operator of the vehicle at the time it became
impounded, if that information is available to the officer. Thereafter, on the
request of the owner of any such vehicle for its return, the Police Department
shall issue its order directing the owner of the garage to which the vehicle
has been removed to return the vehicle to its owner or his agents or
representatives on payment of the charges incurred as a result of the vehicle
being towed to a place of safety.
      (2)   For purposes of this division (D), the Common Council hereby finds
that there is a compelling governmental interest in imposing the following
discretionary penalty section for minor children, in order to encourage
parental intervention and responsibility for the violations of the minor
children. The city further finds that impoundment is more likely to prevent
repeat offenses by minors than the imposition of monetary penalties. In lieu of
the penalty described in division (D)(1), any police officer may, in his or her
discretion, utilize the following penalty provision for violations by minor
children:
         (a)   First offense: On the child's first offense in a 365-day period,
the city shall issue a written warning and notification to the child's parent
or guardian of the violation.
         (b)   Second offense: On the child's second offense in a 365-day
period, the city shall issue a written notice of violation and the
investigating officer may take custody of the motorized vehicle or pocket bike
and hold for safekeeping for 60 days or until the child's parent or guardian
claims the motorized vehicle or pocket bike. The child's parent or guardian
shall be responsible for any charges incurred by the city for impounding the
motorized vehicle or pocket bike, including but not limited to towing and
storage.
         (c)   Third and subsequent offense(s): On the child's third offense in
a 365-day period, the city shall include a civil fine, not to exceed $100. The
arresting officer may take custody of the motorized vehicle or pocket bike and
hold it for safekeeping for 60 days. An officer or his or her superior may
waive the imposed civil fine and/or impoundment if the parent and child agree
to attendance and completion of a motorized vehicle safety course by the child.

   (A)   Whenever a property owner desires that certain real estate located in
the jurisdiction of the Common Council be designated as an Economic

application with the Clerk/Treasurer, any of the following actions have
occurred:
      (1)   An improvement location permit for the subject development for
which a deduction is being sought has been issued by the Miami County Zoning
Administrator, or

Council will receive and hear all comments from interested persons;

§ 98.03 STANDARDS TO BE CONSIDERED.
   (A)   In its deliberations on designating an economic revitalization area
the Council may, pursuant to IC 6-1.1-12.1-2(g), give consideration to the
following general standards to determine if:
      (1)   The designation will encourage the use of vacant or under-utilized
land designated as appropriate for industrial development in the Miami County
Comprehensive Plan or which is currently zoned for industrial use;
      (2)   The proposed use of the real estate for which designation is being
requested is consistent with the land use policies contained in the Miami
County Comprehensive Plan;
      (3)   The designation will encourage the improvement of a deteriorated
structure or the replacement of an obsolete structure;
      (4)   The designation will encourage the preservation of an historically
or architecturally significant structure;
      (5)   The designation will assist in the inducement of a project
providing substantial employment opportunities relative to the value of the
improvements to be made and/or the new manufacturing equipment to be installed.
      (6)   The designation will assist in the inducement of a project which
would provide long- term benefits to the tax base of Miami County warranting
the granting of the annually decreasing percentage of tax abatement as provided
in IC 6-1.1-12.1.
   (B)   In all instances the Council shall find that evidence has been
provided either in the application or during the public hearing that the real
estate proposed for designation is in an area which has become undesirable for,
or impossible of, normal development and occupancy because of a lack of
development, cessation of growth, deterioration of improvement or character of
occupancy, age, obsolescence, substandard buildings or other factors which have
impaired values or prevent a normal development of property or use of property.
(Res. 3B-1990, passed 3-19-90)

   (B)   In such cases where the subject real estate is utilized for purposes

OFFICIAL THOROUGHFARE PLAN
§ 150.01 MAPS AND DRAWINGS.
   The Official Thoroughfare Plan consists of a map entitled "Peru, Indiana,
Planning Area, Plan of Major Streets and Highways," dated 1968, and a drawing
entitled "Typical Thoroughfare Cross-sections, Peru, Indiana," dated 1968,
sheet 2 of 2, which shows recommended design plans for the proposed
thoroughfares. The Official Thoroughfare Plan is declared to be a part of this
chapter and notations, references, indications and other details shown therein
are as much a part of this chapter as if they were fully described in the text
of this chapter.
(Ord. 30-1968, passed 7-24-68)
§ 150.02 DESIGNATION OF THOROUGHFARES.
   The major streets and highways comprising the Official Thoroughfare Plan are
classified on the basis of width and type, in accordance with their proposed
function as major, collector, or local streets.
(Ord. 30-1968, passed 7-24-68)
§ 150.03 POLICIES AND DIRECTIVES.
   (A)   Opening or widening of streets. Whenever a street classified in the
Official Thoroughfare Plan is to be platted as a part of a subdivision, the
required right-of-way width for the street shall be as specified in the
Official Thoroughfare Plan. However, where a street borders a tract of land to
be subdivided, the owner of the land shall be required to plat only one-half of
the right-of-way designated for the street, measured at 90° to the center line
thereof.
   (B)   Location of streets.
      (1)   Wherever the location of a street is indicated in the Official
Thoroughfare Plan as following an existing road or street, or a section or
half-section or other established property line, the location of the street
shall conform to the location. However, a street lying wholly within a
subdivision, and not designated as following an existing road or established
property line, may be varied in its alignment when the variance promotes the
plan of a neighborhood development unit in accordance with good site planning
principles, and if the alignment provides for the continuity of traffic
movement.
      (2)   In the absence of any street being designated in each section of
land within the jurisdiction, on or approximately on the north-south and east-
west half-section lines of such section, it is the intent of the Official
Thoroughfare Plan and this chapter that collector streets be established on the
half-section lines where feasible.
      (3)   Wherever the location of a street is indicated in the Official
Thoroughfare Plan as following an irregular alignment or a revised alignment,
or is not referenced to an established line, it shall follow the alignment
shown in the Official Thoroughfare Plan. The alignment shall be subject to a
detailed survey which may be provided by the Commission or other public
agencies, or by the owners of land to be subdivided if required by the
Commission. The survey for the street shall be subject to the approval of the
Commission prior to the dedication of the street.
   (C)   Consideration by public agencies.
      (1)   The Council and the Board of Works shall be guided by and give
consideration to the general policy and pattern of street development set out
in the Official Thoroughfare Plan in the authorization, construction, widening,
alteration, relocation, or abandonment of the public streets, highways, and
related structures.
      (2)   No public way shall be abandoned or vacated until the Commission
shall have first given notice and held public hearing on vacation or
abandonment of the public way. The Commission shall forward its recommendation
to Council. The Council shall not override the recommendation of the Commission
except by a three-fourths vote.
   (D)   Issuance of permits. Any permits authorized by the city, including,
but not limited to, improvement location permits permitting the erection,
alteration, or relocation of structures and other improvements within the
jurisdiction of the Commission, shall be issued only if, in addition to
satisfying the requirements of other city ordinances, the proposed street
right-of-way as set forth by this chapter will be protected from encroachment.
In this instance, the proposed street right-of-way lines will be con- sidered
as the front line of lots and tracts bordering the street.
(Ord. 30-1968, passed 7-24-68)
§ 150.04 CONTINUING AUTHORITY OF COMMISSION.
   Subsequent to the passage of this chapter, the Commission may determine
lines for new, extended, widened, or narrowed thoroughfares in any portion of
the area within the jurisdiction of the Commission, and certify to Council the
amended or additional plan under the same procedure as established for the
certification and approval of the Official Thoroughfare Plan.
(Ord. 30-1968, passed 7-24-68)
PUBLIC FACILITIES PLAN
§ 150.20 MAP OF PUBLIC FACILITIES.
   The public facilities plan consists of a map entitled "Peru, Indiana,
Planning Area, Public Facilities Plan," dated 1968, which shows the location of
proposed fire station sites and existing and proposed school, park, or
recreation sites within the jurisdiction of the Commission. The public
facilities plan is declared to be a part of this chapter, and notation,
references, indication, and other details shown therein are as much a part of
this chapter as if they were fully described herein.
(Ord. 30-1968, passed 7-24-68)
§ 150.21 POLICY.
   Whenever sites for fire stations, schools, parks, or other recreational
areas are shown by the Public Facilities Plan to be located within an area
proposed to be subdivided, in accordance with §§ 150.10 through 150.15, the
Commission may request their dedication for such purposes, or their reservation
for a period of one year following the date of approval of the final plat, in
order to carry out the policies exhibited in the public facilities plan.
(Ord. 30-1968, passed 7-24-68)
§ 150.22 CONSIDERATION BY PUBLIC AGENCIES.
   The Council and Board of Works and all school corporations within the
jurisdiction of the Commission shall be guided by and give consideration to the

DISTRICT REGULATIONS
§ 151.040 ESTABLISHMENT OF CITY ZONING DISTRICTS.
   The following zoning districts are hereby established for the city. For the
interpretation of this chapter, the zoning districts have been formulated to
realize the general purposes of this chapter. In addition, the specific
districts shall be as stated below:
   (A)   A-1 Agriculture.  This District shall be classified as prime farmland.
The purpose of an A-1 District is to preserve and protect the decreasing supply
of prime farmland by controlling the indiscriminate infiltration of urban
development into agricultural areas. These areas are generally flat areas with
less than 2% to 5% slope, no wooded areas and where little to no urbanization
has occurred or is likely to occur in the future. These areas shall be
maintained as primary uses such as growth of crop and the raising of livestock.
No residential use shall be authorized except farm dwellings.
   (B)   A-2 Agriculture. This District shall be classified as farmland with a
general slope of more than 5% but less than 20%. These areas are mostly low
yield and are more suitable for grazing or pastures. A-2 Districts would be
suitable for low density housing, however residential uses should be
discouraged.
   (C)   A-3 Agriculture.  This District shall be classified as rough farmland
with overgrown vegetation, wood area, and wetland which may run from slight to
moderate ground slope. These areas are designated for agriculture use in rural
areas however, very small agriculture uses may occur. A-3 Districts may be more
suited for development of residential or commercial uses.
   (D)   R-1 Residential. An area that is designated for low density
residential housing comprised of single-family units with lots sufficient to
provide for individual water and sewage facilities, where centralized
facilities are not available. Only one dwelling per lot or parcel of land shall
be allowed in an R-1 District.
   (E)   R-3 Residential. An area that is designated for duplex or multi-family
housing; however, where public sewage is not available, there shall be no more
than 20 units per acre.
   (F)   B-1 Commercial. Commercial uses that have less than 50 customers per
day. These areas are normally located in or adjoining a residential area. The
uses shall not create any more traffic than the normal use of the area. There
shall be no noise, odor or other nuisance that would create an unnecessary
hardship on the surrounding property. Pick-up or delivery shall be limited to
less than one-ton vehicles. Off-street parking shall be provided for employees
and customers.
   (G)   B-2 Commercial. Commercial uses that are on a main artery or near a
residential district. These areas are mainly small retail businesses providing
a service for the convenience of the neighborhood. These businesses shall not
create noise, odor, or other nuisances that would create an unnecessary
hardship on the surrounding area. Off-street parking shall be provided for
employees and customers.
   (H)   B-3 Commercial. Commercial uses located away from residential uses
normally on a major highway that provides high volume merchandise, sales or
services. These areas are mainly major retail, repair or services of
merchandise. Small assembly businesses may be authorized in these areas but
should be discouraged. Parking will be in accordance with parking requirements
outlined in §
151.076.
   (I)   I-1 Industrial. Industrial area used for manufacturing, assembling,
wholesale or storage. These areas are normally located on the outskirts of the
city where little or no urban development has or will occur. These areas shall
be clean, quiet and free of hazardous or objectionable elements, operated
entirely within enclosed structures. Storage areas shall be enclosed with a
six-foot high wood or chain link fence.
   (J)   I-2 Industrial. Industrial areas used for major manufacturing,
processing, warehousing, mining, or major research and testing. These areas are
established for heavy industrial uses that require isolation from other
districts. These areas shall be screened or fenced from other districts or
shall have a minimum of 200 feet buffer from other districts.
   (K)   FP Flood Plain. Areas that are in the flood hazard areas outside
floodways that could cause damage to structures due to high water. These
Districts shall comply with the floodplain regulations adopted by Miami County.
These areas are designated as Zone A on the flood hazard zone maps.
   (L)   FF Flood Fringe. The area outside the floodway or flood plain that
could be subject to high water damage. These areas are designated as Zone X or
higher area on the flood hazard zone maps. No structure may be built in these
areas unless the first floor is two feet above the flood hazard area.
   (M)   PUD Planned Unit Development. An area of five acres or more under
single ownership, corporation, firm or partnership planned and developed as an
integral unit in a single development which consists of residential and
business, business and industrial, but shall not consist of industrial and
residential. All requirements shall be meet according to the guidelines set
forth in §§
151.090 through
151.094.
(Ord. 5-2002, passed 3-4-02)
§ 151.041 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   (A)   The boundaries of the districts established in §
151.040 are shown on the zoning map, which is part of this chapter. Districts
shall only be changed by amending this chapter.
   (B)   When the exact boundaries of a district are uncertain, they shall be
determined by use of the zone map.
   (C)   When a right-of-way is vacated, the districts adjoining each side are
respectively extended to the center of the area so vacated.
   (D)   If a district divides a lot frontage on a street, a restriction that
applies to the front of the lot shall apply to the entire lot.
(Ord. 5-2002, passed 3-4-02)
§ 151.042 PRIMARY USES.
   (A)   The following table shall be used to determine when a use is
authorized in a district. If the use is marked with an (X) this shall mean that
the use is authorized in that district. A use marked with (S) means that a
special exception is required from the Board of Zoning Appeals. A use that is
marked with (HO) shall be authorized as a home occupation provided all
requirements in §
151.075 are met. A use marked (SP) means there are special requirements that
must be met. A use marked with (*) means special requirements were set by DNR
and the flood plain ordinance. Whenever there are (**) special requirements

exception.
   (B)   The application for an improvement location permit shall be submitted
to the Plan Commission office and signed by the owner or applicant attesting to
the accuracy of all information. Each application shall clearly state that the

(Ord. 5-2002, passed 3-4-02) Penalty, see §
151.999
§ 151.044 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
   (A)   Generally. It shall be unlawful to use, occupy, or permit the use or
occupancy of any building or premises, or both, or part thereof, hereafter
created, erected, changed, converted, or wholly or partly altered or enlarged
in its use of structure until a certificate of occupancy has been issued by the
Zoning Administrator. The certificate of occupancy shall state that the
proposed use of the building or land conforms to the requirements of this
chapter and that the Zoning Administrator has inspected the property and
attested to that fact. Any person, firm or organization that occupies a
structure before a certificate of occupancy may be required to remove all
furniture or property within the structure before an inspection is made. A
certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until culverts have been installed
under driveways where needed.
   (B)   Temporary Certificate of Occupancy. A temporary certificate of
occupancy may be issued by the Zoning Administrator for a period not to exceed
six months pending completion of modifications in order to comply with this
chapter.
(Ord. 5-2002, passed 3-4-02) Penalty, see §
151.999
§ 151.045 SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   Generally. The Board of Zoning Appeals may permit special exceptions
after a public hearing in the specified districts indicated in Table of Primary
Uses set forth in §
151.042. No permit for a special exception shall be granted unless the Board
shall have first found that the public convenience and welfare will
substantially be served and that the proposed use will not be unduly
detrimental to the surrounding area. In the exercise of its approval, the Board
may impose such additional conditions regarding the location, character and
other features of the proposed building or structure or use as it may deem
advisable in the furtherance of the proposes of this chapter. A special
exception may be issued for any use in any district if the Board finds that the
use will substantially serve the general public and the use will not be unduly
detrimental to the surrounding area and does not set a precedent to that area.
Commercial uses should not be granted a special exception in a residential
area.
      (1)   Upon approval for the special exception, the Zoning Administrator
shall issue an improvement location permit.
      (2)   Upon a finding by the Board that the special exception with
additional special requirements may be issued, the Board shall order the Zoning
Administrator to issue an improvement location permit for the special
exception, provided the applicant agrees in writing to such additional special
requirements.
      (3)   Upon a finding by the Board that the special exception is not
consistent with the spirit, purpose or intent of this chapter, may
substantially or permanently injure the appropriate use of the neighboring
property, or will not serve the public convenience or welfare, the Board shall
disapprove the special exception.
      (4)   The Board may table the application for a special exception, and
refer it to the Zoning Administrator or committee with a request for further
information, review and recommendations to the Board.
   (B)   Special Exception - Existing Uses. An existing use which is listed
herein as a special exception and which is located in a district in which such
special exception may be permitted, is a conforming use; however, any expansion
of such special exception involving the enlargement of the building structure,
or the land area devoted to such use, shall be reviewed by the Zoning
Administrator for compliance and may be subject to Board procedure described in
this section.
   (C)   Special Exception - Time Limit. In the event that the applicant has
failed to commence construction within six months after such permit has been
issued, or failed to proceed with construction, once commenced, in accordance
with the construction timetable commonly prevailing in the construction
industry, and subject to the Board's discretion as to the reasonableness of
construction delays, or fails to conform to the provisions of the development
plan and supporting data finally approved by the Board, and upon the basis of
which such improvement location permit for the special exception was issued,
said Board may upon its motion or upon the written petition of any aggrieved
person at a public hearing, require the applicant to show cause why the Board's
order should not be withdrawn and the improvement location permit for the
special exception be revoked.
   (D)   Special Exceptions Approval. A special exception shall be an
authorized use in a district provided that all requirements can be met and the
Board of Zoning Appeals finds that the use will not create an unnecessary
hardship or nuisance on the surrounding property.
      (1)   All requirements shall be completed prior to any operation of that
use being started.
      (2)   The following uses may be permitted as a special exception in
districts as outlined in the Table of Primary Uses set forth in §
151.042. The restrictions set forth in
Table 2: Special Exceptions shall be considered minimum requirements and the
Board may make any other reasonable restrictions it feels are necessary to
protect that district. If a use is not listed in
Table 2, the Board must consider the use and the restriction. The Board may
place reasonable restrictions on property to ensure than an unnecessary
hardship or nuisance is not created on surrounding property.
      (3)   In granting a special exception the Board shall take into
consideration the restrictions outlined in
Table 2 along with other restrictions in a fair and unbiased decision.
         (a)   The special exception will not create an unnecessary hardship on
surrounding property.
         (b)   The special exception will not devaluate the surrounding
property.
         (c)   The special exception will not set a precedent for that
district.
   (E)   Special Exception Requirements. All parking requirements shall be in
accordance with the parking requirement outlined in §
151.076. All special exceptions shall conform to the following restrictions:
      (1)   Lights shall be placed in such a way that they do not infringe upon
the rights of adjacent property owners. At no time shall any light be placed
within ten feet from any property line.
      (2)   Parking areas shall be a minimum of ten feet away from any other
residential dwelling and shall be screened where light or noise will not
interfere with the comfort of the adjacent property owner.
      (3)   No unsafe, uncomfortable, or offensive vibrations, noise, visual
effects, odors or air pollutants that would cause unnecessary hazard to the
health or general welfare of the surrounding area shall be allowed to radiate
across lot lines.
      (4)   Any use listed as a special exception in Table of Primary Uses set
forth in §
151.042 shall meet the requirement for minimum lot size, setbacks, parking
requirements, entrances, exits, fencing and screening in
Table 2: Special Exceptions set forth below.
      (5)   No loading berth may be closer than 50 feet from any residential
dwelling.
      (6)   All areas which are used for outside storage shall be screened or
fenced with no less than six foot woven fence or screen,
      (7)   No more than one entrance or exit shall be authorized with a use
unless approved by the Board.
      (8)   Buildings within the following areas may be located no closer to
interior roads than the distance, in feet, respectively prescribed below:

§ 151.046 VARIANCES.
   (A)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize upon appeal in specific
cases such variances from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to
the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement
of the provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship. No non
conforming use on neighboring land, structures, or buildings in the same
district and no permitted or nonconforming use of land, structure or buildings
in other districts shall be grounds for issuance of a variance. Variances shall
not be granted on the grounds of convenience or profit, but only where strict
application of the provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary
hardship.
   (B)   A variance from the terms of this chapter shall not be granted by the
Board of Zoning Appeals unless and until a written application for the variance
is submitted to the Zoning Administrator and the Board of Zoning Appeals
containing:
      (1)   Name, address, and phone number of applicant(s);
      (2)   Legal description of the property;
      (3)   Description of nature of variance requested;
      (4)   Public notice is given in accordance with subsection (D) below.
   (C)   A use variance in accordance with IC 36-7-4-918.4 shall not be granted
unless the Board makes specific findings of facts based directly on the
particular evidence presented to it, which supports the conclusion that all of
the standards and conditions imposed by the following have been met by the
applicant(s):
      (1)   The approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety,
morals, and general welfare of the community;
      (2)   The use and value of the area adjacent to the property included in
the variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse manner;
      (3)   The need for the variance arises from some condition peculiar to
the property involved;
      (4)   The strict application of the terms of the chapter will constitute
an unnecessary hardship if applied to the property for which the variance is
sought; and
      (5)   The approval does not interfere substantially with the
comprehensive plan adopted under this chapter.
      (6)   An area variance needs only to meet the requirements of subsections
(C)(1), (2) and (5) above.
   (D)   Before holding the public hearing, notice of such hearing shall be
given in the local newspaper of general circulation of the city at least ten
days before the date of said hearing. The notice shall set forth the date, time
and location of the public hearing, and the nature of the proposed appeal or
variance.
   (E)   The applicant shall pay the cost for all publication for an appeal or
variance.
   (F)   Before holding the public hearing, written notice of such hearing
shall be mailed to all adjoining property owners by first-class mail at least
five days before the hearing. This notice shall contain the same information as
required of the notice published in the local newspaper.
   (G)   Within ten days after the public hearing, written notice shall be sent
to the applicant stating that the variance or appeal has been approved,
approved with supplementary conditions, or disapproved. If the appeal or
variance is disapproved, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall state the reason for
the denial.
   (H)   No variance shall be granted in an R-1 or R-3 District allowing
alcoholic beverages to be sold or served on any premise.

   (A)   A lawful use of a building or premises existing at the time of passage
of this chapter, may continue although such use does not conform to all the
provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   A nonconforming use may be changed to any other use of the same or
greater restrictions, provided no structural changes are made in the building.
Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, that use shall not
thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use.
   (C)   Any nonconforming use that is destroyed by fire or act of God of less
than 50% of the value of the structure, the structure shall not be restored
except in accordance with this chapter. Whenever a nonconforming structure is
destroyed by fire or act of God of more than 50% of the value, the structure
shall be removed and the use discontinued. The insurance adjustment statement
shall determine the value of the structure.
   (D)   No building shall be erected upon any premise devoted to a
nonconforming use, unless the use can conform to the regulation of this
chapter.
   (E)   A nonconforming structure may be repaired or altered provided no
structural changes are made or unless the structural changes would bring the
structure into conformance with this chapter.
   (F)   No conforming use may be changed to a nonconforming use. This action
shall be considered a violation of this chapter and shall be subject to any
corrective action required to put the structure back in conformance with this
chapter.
   (G)   Amortization of Nonconforming Uses or Buildings.
      (1)   Whenever a nonconforming use has been discontinued for a period of
six months, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished and used thereafter
unless it shall be in conformance with this chapter.
      (2)   Any nonconforming billboard or advertising structure not attached
to a building, lawfully existing upon the effective date of this chapter, shall
be discontinued on or before five years after the effective date of this
chapter.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 155.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-1-4-11 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Common Council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management
regulations.
(Ord. 3-2024, passed 3-4-24)
§ 155.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which
results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. Additionally, structures
that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of
such damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these
regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 3-2024, passed 3-4-24)
§ 155.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in
floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
area;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazards assume
responsiblity for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 3-2024, passed 3-4-24)
§ 155.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities.
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters.
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage.
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters, or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 3- 2024, passed 3-4-24)
§ 155.05 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE . A structure with a floor area of 400 square feet or
less that is on the same parcel of property as a principal structure and the
use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure; an accessory
structure specifically excludes structures used for human habitation.
      (1)   Accessory structures are considered walled and roofed where the
structure includes at least two outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof.

whether as a permanent residence or as temporary or seasonal living quarters,
such as a detached garage or carriage house that includes an apartment or guest
quarters, or a detached guest house on the same parcel as a principal
residence.
         (b)   Structures used by the public, such as a place of employment or
entertainment.
         (c)   Development that does not meet the NFIP definition of a
structure for floodplain management purposes. Examples include, but are not
necessarily limited to, a gazebo, pavilion, picnic shelter, or carport that is
open on all sides (roofed but not walled).
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.

   FLOOD or FLOODING.
      (1)   General and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from:
         (a)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters;
         (b)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source; and
         (c)   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by
flooding and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of
normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and
deposited along the path of the current.
      (2)   FLOOD or FLOODING also includes the collapse or subsidence of land
along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion or
undermining caused by waves or current of water exceeding anticipated cyclical
levels that result in a FLOOD as defined above.
   FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Areas subject to the 1% annual chance flood. (See
“special flood hazard area.”)
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available
digitally is called a digital flood insurance rate map (DFIRM).
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM and
the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA.  Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See “floodplain.”)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The BFE plus two feet at any given location in

where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. Zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances
(such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control
ordinance), and other applications of police power which control development in
flood prone areas. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS describes such state or
local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the
purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the PPG.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulative increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE or FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the floodplain lying outside the
floodway.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. FUNCTIONALLY
DEPENDENT USE includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are
necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship
building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long term storage or
related manufacturing facilities.
   HARDSHIP (AS RELATED TO VARIANCES OF THIS CHAPTER).  The exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
city requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the
property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURES. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by:
         (a)   An approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of Interior in states without approved
programs.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. Analyses performed by a
professional engineer licensed by the State of Indiana, in accordance with
standard engineering practices that are accepted by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and FEMA, used to determine the base flood, other frequency
floods, flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries, and flood
programs.
   INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL-EVALUATION SERVICE (ICC- ES) REPORT. A document
that presents the findings, conclusions, and recommendations from a particular
evaluation. ICC-ES REPORTS provide information about what code requirements or
acceptance criteria were used to evaluate a product, and how the product should
be identified, installed.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). General term used to refer to the several types
of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by letter.
They are broken down into the following categories:
      CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). FEMA’s comment on a proposed
project that would, upon construction, result in modification of the SFHA
through the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
      CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (CLOMR- F). A letter
from FEMA stating that a proposed structure that will be elevated by fill would
not be inundated by the base flood.
      LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the currently
effective FEMA map that establishes that a building or area of land is not
located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A
LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
      LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT OUT AS SHOWN (LOMA- OAS). An official
determination by FEMA that states the property or building is correctly shown
outside the SFHA as shown on an effective NFIP map. Therefore, the mandatory
flood insurance requirement does not apply. An out-as-shown determination does
not require elevations.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the currently
effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations,
and elevations.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest elevation described among the following:
      (1)   The lowest floor of a building.
      (2)   The basement floor.
      (3)   The garage floor if the garage is connected to the building.
      (4)   The first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or pillars.
      (5)   The floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement, below an
elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any resistance to
the flow of floodwaters. Designs for meeting the flood opening requirement must
either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet
or exceed the following criteria:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters;
and
         (b)   At least two openings are designed and maintained for the entry
and exit of floodwater; and these openings provide a total net area of at least
one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of all
such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher. Doorways
and windows do not qualify as openings.
      (6)   The first floor of a building elevated on pilings or columns in a
coastal high hazard area (as that term is defined in 44 CFR § 59.1), as long as
it meets the requirements of 44 CFR § 60.3.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a “recreational vehicle”.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.
   NATURAL GRADE. The elevation of the undisturbed natural surface of the
ground. Fill placed prior to the date of the initial identification of the
flood hazard on a FEMA map is also considered NATURAL GRADE.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulations
adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the  construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88). As adopted in 1993, it is a
vertical control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations
within the floodplain.
   OBSTRUCTION. Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization,
bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.

a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the

dated September 28, 2012 shall be determined from the 1% annual chance flood
profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Miami County, Indiana and Incorporated
Areas and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) dated September
28, 2012 as well as any subsequent updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. Should
the floodway limits not be delineated on the flood insurance rate map for a
studied SFHA designated as an “AE Zone”, the limits of the floodway will be
according to the best available flood layer as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.
   (B)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each
of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the city, delineated as an "A Zone" on
the Miami County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map,
dated September 28, 2012, as well as any subsequent updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best available flood layer provided by
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage
area from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available flood layer data, the party needs to replace
existing data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and subsequently approved.
   (C)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification
on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of
any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas shall be according
to the best available flood layer as provided by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is
greater than one square mile.
   (D)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.

§ 155.09 COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or
structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of
this chapter and other applicable regulations.
   (B)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple flood elevations, or both, the
development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter applicable
to the most restrictive flood zone and the most conservative (highest) base
flood elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or
for other developments, affecting any part of the area of development.
   (C)   No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without
full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations.
(Ord. 03-2024, passed 3-4-24)
§ 155.10 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions
shall prevail.
(Ord. 03-2024, passed 3-4-24)
§ 155.11 DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND ELEVATIONS.
   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) with base flood elevations provided (riverine or lacustrine Zone AE) on
the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the
profiles or table of still water elevations shall govern.
   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
   (C)   If the natural grade elevation of the site in question is at or above
the base flood elevation and a LOMA or LOMR-FW is obtained, the floodplain
regulations will not be applied provided the LOMA or LOMR-FW is not
subsequently superseded or invalidated.
(Ord. 03-2024, passed 3-4-24)
§ 155.12 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall
be:
   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements.
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body.
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
(Ord. 03-2024, passed 3-4-24)
§ 155.13 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this chapter does not create any
liability on the part of the city, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
this chapter, or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.

(Ord. 3-2024, passed 3-4-24)
PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 155.30 FLOODPLAIN STATUS STANDARDS.
   (A)   Floodways (riverine). Located within SFHAs, established in §
155.07 , are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. Under the provisions of the
Flood Control Act (IC 14-28-1) a permit for construction in a floodway from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a
local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction
activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities
such as filling, grading, clearing, and paving undertaken before the actual
start of construction of the structure. General licenses and exemptions to the
requirements of the Flood Control Act (IC 14-28-1 and 312 IAC 10) may apply to
qualified additions/improvements to existing lawful residential structures,
rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland restoration, utility line crossings,
outfall projects, creek rock removal, and prospecting.
      (1)   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in §
155.07, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources and apply for approval for construction in a
floodway, provided the activity does not qualify for a general license or
exemption.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. The floodplain
development permit shall meet the provisions contained in this subchapter.
      (3)   The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than
an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to qualify for
a general license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site/
project. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
      (4)   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development shall cause
no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge
without first obtaining a conditional letter of map revision and meeting
requirements of §
155.24(A). A conditional letter of map revision cannot be issued for
development that would cause an increase in flood levels affecting a structure
and such development should not be permitted.
      (5)   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet identified on the
effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity
of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation
of the regulatory flood of at least fifteen-hundredths of a foot as determined
by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that
under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
      (6)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
   (B)   Fringe (riverine). If the site is in the fringe (either identified on
the FIRM or identified by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources through
detailed or approximate studies and not identified on a FIRM), the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in this subchapter have been met.
   (C)   SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/
fringes (riverine).
      (1)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade
has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/ regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be
issued, provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
      (2)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
         (b)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this
subchapter have been met.
   (D)   SFHAs not identified on a map.
      (1)   If a proposed development site is near a waterway with no SFHA
identified on a map, the Floodplain Administrator shall verify the drainage
area upstream of the site. If the drainage area upstream of the site is
verified as being greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade
has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper written
approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain analysis/
regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be issued,
provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not less
restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and the provisions contained in this subchapter have been met.

subject to the official comprehensive plan and related policies for the orderly
and efficient development of the city.
   (B)   Land to be subdivided shall be of such a character that it can be
developed without peril to health or peril from flood, fire or other menace,
and land shall not be subdivided until having access to available existing
public facilities and until improvements and proper provision have been made
for drainage, water, sewerage, other necessary new public improvements such as
schools, parks, recreation facilities, and transportation facilities adequate

water and sewer facilities are allowable where permitted under the Zoning
Ordinance of the city,
Chapter 151 of this code, and approved by the Miami County Health Department.
   (C)   Both existing and proposed public facilities serving the subdivision
shall be properly related and conform to the official Comprehensive Land Use
Plan of the city, related policies and implementation programs including the
Capital Budget, Official Map, Thoroughfare Plan, Zoning Ordinance and Housing
and Building Codes.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02)
§ 156.003 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter shall be:
   (A)   To protect and provide for the public health, safety, and general
welfare of the city.
   (B)   To guide the future development and renewal of the city in accordance
with the Comprehensive Plan and related policies.
   (C)   To provide for the safety, comfort, and soundness of the built
environment and related open spaces.
   (D)   To protect the compatibility, character, economic stability and
orderliness of all development through reasonable design standards.
   (E)   To guide public and private policy and action to provide adequate and
efficient public and private facilities, the most aesthetically pleasing and
beneficial interrelationship between land uses, conserve natural resources such
as natural beauty, woodlands, open spaces, and energy both during and after
development.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02)
§ 156.004 AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION.
   (A)   This chapter, which was enacted pursuant to Indiana home rule and
planning enabling legislation (IC 36-1-3-4 and the 36-7-4-700 series, as
amended), authorizes the Plan Commission to review and approve or disapprove
plats for subdivision throughout the city, and its jurisdiction, which show
lots, blocks, or sites with or without new streets or highways. This authority
extends to the development or resubdivision of undeveloped portions of already
recorded plats.
   (B)   No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any
parcel or plat of land which was created by subdivision after the effective
date of, and not in conformity with, the provisions of these subdivision
regulations, and no excavation of land or construction of any public or private
improvements shall take place or be commenced except in conformity with the
regulations contained herein and in conformity with construction standards
adopted by the city.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02)
§ 156.005 ENACTMENT.
   In order that land may be subdivided in accordance with these purposes and
policies, these subdivision regulations are hereby adopted.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02)
§ 156.006 INTERPRETATION, CONFLICT AND SEPARABILITY.
   (A)   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of these regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements
for the promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   Conflict with Public and Private Provisions.
      (1)   Public Provisions. The regulations are not intended to interfere
with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or
other provision of law. Where any provision of these regulations imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by any other provision of these
regulations or any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of
law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall
control.
      (2)   Private Provisions. These regulations are not intended to abrogate
any easement, covenant or any other private agreement or restriction, provided
that where the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or impose
higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant, or other private
agreement or restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall govern.
Where the provisions of the easement, covenant, or private agreement or
restriction impose duties and obligations more restrictive, or higher standards
than the requirements of these regulations, or the determinations of the
Commission in approving a subdivision or in enforcing these regulations, and
such private provisions are not inconsistent with these regulations or
determinations thereunder, then such private provisions shall be operative and
supplemental to these regulations and determinations made thereunder. (Note:
Private provisions can only be enforced privately unless a public agency has
been made party to such agreements.)
   (C)   Separability. If any part or provision of these regulations or
application thereof to any person or circumstances is adjudged invalid by any
court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall be confined in its
operation to the part, provision, or application directly involved in all
controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered and shall not
affect or impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations or the
application thereof to other persons or circumstances. The city hereby declares
that it would have enacted the remainder of these regulations even without any
such part, provision or application.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02)
§ 156.007 SAVING PROVISION.
   These regulations shall not be construed as abating any action now pending
under, or by virtue of prior existing subdivision regulations, or as
discontinuing, abating, modifying, or altering any penalty accruing or about to
accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm, or corporation, or
as waiving any right of the city under any section or provision existing at the
time of adoption of these regulations, or as vacating or annulling any rights
obtained by any person, firm, or corporation, by lawful action of the city
except as shall be expressly provided for in these regulations.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02)
§ 156.008 PREVIOUS SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE REPEALED.
   Upon the adoption of this chapter according to law, the Subdivision
Ordinance adopted November 2, 1996 as amended is hereby repealed, except for
such sections expressly retained herein.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02)
§ 156.009 AMENDMENTS.
   For the purpose of providing for the public health, safety, and general
welfare, the city, on recommendation of the Commission, may from time to time
amend the provisions imposed by these subdivision regulations. The Commission
and/or the city in the manner prescribed by law shall hold public hearings on
all proposed amendments.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02)
§ 156.010 CONDITIONS.
   Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable
conditions to land subdivision is an exercise of valid police power delegated
by the state to this city. The developer has the duty of compliance with
reasonable conditions laid down by the Commission for design, dedication,
improvement, and restrictive use of the land in order to conform to the
physical and economical development of the city and to the safety and general
welfare of the future plot owners in the subdivision and of the city at large.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02)
§ 156.011 RESUBDIVISION OF LAND.
   (A)   Procedure for Resubdivision. For any change in a map of an approved or
recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on
such map, or area reserved thereon for public use, or any lot line, or if it
affects any map or plan legally reached prior to the adoption of any
regulations controlling subdivisions, such parcel shall be approved by the
Commission by the same procedure, rules, and regulations as for a subdivision.
   (B)   Procedure for Subdivisions Where Future Resubdivision is Indicated.
Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or
more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are indications that
such lots will eventually be resubdivided into smaller building sites, the
Commission may require that such parcel of land allow for the future opening of
streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. Easements providing for
the future opening and extension of such streets may be made a requirement of
the plat.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02)
§ 156.012 VACATION OF PLATS.
   Any recorded plat or part of any recorded plat may be vacated only in
accordance with IC 36-7-3-11 or 36-7-3-12 as amended.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02)
§ 156.013 VARIANCES.
   (A)   General. Where the Commission finds that extraordinary hardships or
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations
and/or the purposes of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by
an alternative proposal, it may approve a variance to these subdivision
regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest
secured, provided that such variances shall not have the effect of nullifying
the intent and purpose of these regulations; and further provided the
Commission shall not approve variances unless it shall make findings based upon
the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
      (1)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other nearby property.
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property.
      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these regulations are carried out.
      (4)   The variance will not in any manner contravene the provisions of
the Zoning Ordinance, Comprehensive Plan, or Official Map as interpreted by the
Commission.
   (B)   Conditions. In approving variances, the Commission may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements of these regulations.
   (C)   Procedures. A petition for any such variance shall be submitted in
writing by the subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat is filed for
the consideration of the Commission. The petition shall state fully the grounds
for the application and all of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.

subdivision plat, the Commission may permit the plat to be divided into two or
more sections and may impose such conditions upon the filing of the sections as
it may deem necessary to assure the orderly development of the plat. The
Commission may require that the performance bond be in such amount as will be
commensurate with the section or sections of the plat to be filed and may defer
the remaining required performance bond principal amount until the remaining
sections of the plat are offered for filing. Such sections must contain at
least 15 lots or 10% of the total number of lots contained in the approved
plat, whichever is less. The approval of all remaining sections not filed with

secondary approval which shall be part of the tracing cloth or reproducible
mylar of the subdivision plat, plus two mylar prints of the subdivision plat.
The mylar prints shall be returned to the applicant and his engineer or
surveyor.
      (2)   It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider in the presence of
the Commission's Administrator or his designee to file the plat with the County
Recorder within 30 days of the date of signature. Failure of the subdivider to
file the plat as herein provided within 30 days shall constitute a violation of
this chapter.

§ 156.042 GENERAL PROCEDURE: EXEMPT II DIVISION.
   In order for a land division to be considered an Exempt II Division and thus
be exempted from all other provisions of this chapter except the definitional
requirements in §
156.021 under SUBDIVISIONS,  and the requirements of this chapter, certain
conditions shall be met and certified to the appropriate agency by the
Administrator after his determination of qualification for this status has been
made necessary for Exempt II Divisions. Exempt II Division shall be shown as
meeting the following conditions.
   (A)   Exempt II Divisions are divisions of land into not more than three
parcels 30,000 square feet or more in size but less than 20 acres. Such
divisions shall conform to §§
156.040 through 156.043 but shall be exempt from other provisions of this
chapter not specified or referred to in those sections.
   (B)   Necessary Conditions for Exempt II Divisions. In addition to
definitional requirement, a land division qualifying as an Exempt II Division
shall show as meeting the following conditions:
      (1)   If a parcel created by such an exempt division does not have
sanitary sewer service available to it, that tract shall contain within its
boundaries sufficient soil of a kind defined by Indiana State Board of Health
Bulletin HSEI3 (1988) or its successor to allow for the proper installation of
an on-site sewage disposal system.
      (2)   If a parcel created by such an exempt division has frontage on a
public road, the land divider shall dedicate to the public real property of a
width sufficient to meet one-half of the required right-of-way width for that
specific public road as indicated on the County Thoroughfare Plan or the
Official Map and of a length along that public road equal to the length of that
parcel along that roadway.
      (3)   If a parcel created by such an exempt division has a 50 foot
frontage off a public road, there shall be a minimum of 150 feet by 150 feet
width and depth and 30,000 square feet at the end of the road frontage in order
to be a building site. The 50 feet width leading to the property shall be part
of the building site and shall not be an easement and shall not count as part
of the building site.
   (C)   Certification of Exempt II Divisions. As the conditions in §
156.033(C) apply, the land divider shall provide to the Administrator:
      (1)   Written evidence that the County Board of Health has been satisfied
by a duly authorized representative of a qualified soil testing service as to
the presence within the parcel of sufficient soil of a kind defined by Indiana
State Board of Health Bulletin HSE 25-R or its successor to allow for the
proper installation of an on-site septic sewage disposal system;
      (2)   Official documentation indicating the dedication of right-of-way to
the appropriate jurisdiction.
   (D)   Exempt Division Review Process. Within three working days of the land
divider's complete submission of the required information, the Administrator
shall review the submission and notify the land divider that his proposed land
division either qualifies as an exempt division and is thus exempt from all
other provisions of this chapter, or does not qualify as an exempt division and
is thus subject to the relevant subdivision processes described in this
chapter. NOTE: A division of land may not be filed with the Auditor, and the
Recorder may not record it, unless the land owner has filed with the Zoning
Administrator that the parcel shall be exempt from subdivision under Exemption
I or II.
      (1)    Any exemption or division which have been divided after 1986 shall
be counted as part of the exempt division and shall meet all of the
requirements of this chapter. Any exemption prior to 1986 shall not be counted
as part of exempt division however all division shall meet the guidelines of
this chapter.
      (2)    Once a subdivision has been filed on a parcel of land no exemption
shall be authorized. All division shall become a part of the subdivision and
filed as an extension of that subdivision.

IMPROVEMENTS AND DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 156.050 CONFORMANCE TO APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   In addition to the requirements established herein, all subdivision plats
shall comply with the following laws, rules, and regulations:
   (A)   All applicable state and local statutory provisions.
   (B)   The Zoning Ordinance, Building and Housing Codes, and all other
applicable laws and ordinances of the appropriate jurisdictions.
   (C)   The Comprehensive Plan, Official Map or Thoroughfare Plan, Public
Utilities Plan, and Capital Improvements Program of the city including all
streets, drainage systems, and parks shown on the Official Map or Comprehensive
Plan as adopted.
   (D)   The provision of adequate potable water for human consumption,
sanitary sewerage and sewage treatment facilities must be adequate to prevent
water pollution and other health problems. Requiring separate storm and
wastewater sewerage systems is important for long-run water pollution
prevention even if the rest of the urbanized area still has combined sewers
because, in all probability, the regulations and any rules of the Health
Department and/or appropriate state agencies.
   (E)   The rules and regulations of the Indiana Department of Highways if the
subdivision or any lot contained therein abut a state highway or state frontage
road.
   (F)   The highway and drainage standards and regulations adopted by the
County Engineer and all boards, commissions, agencies, and officials of the
county.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02) Penalty, see §
156.999
§ 156.051 PLAT APPROVAL.
   Plat approval may be withheld if a subdivision is not in conformity with the
guides and requirements stated in §
156.050 or with the policies and purposes of regulations established in this
chapter.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02)
§ 156.052 SELF-IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS.
   If the owner places restrictions on any of the land contained in the
subdivision greater than those required by the Zoning Ordinance or these
regulations, such restrictions or reference thereto may be required to be
indicated on the subdivision plat, or the Commission may require that
restrictive covenants be recorded with the County Recorder in a form to be
approved by the Commission Attorney. The En- forcement Officer may not enforce
the covenants of a subdivision unless the Plan Commission is made a part of the
covenants as an enforcement agency. The form for such designation is set forth
in Appendix §
4.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02) Penalty, see §
156.999
§ 156.053 BOUNDARY IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Plats Straddling Municipal Boundaries. Whenever access to the
subdivision is required across land in another jurisdiction, the Commission may
request assurance from the City Attorney that such access is legally
established and from the County Engineer that the access road is adequately
improved, or that a performance bond has been duly executed and is sufficient
in the amount to assure the construction of the access road. Lot lines shall be
laid out so as not to cross municipal boundary lines.
   (B)   Boundary Improvements.
      (1)   The subdivider shall have placed, under the supervision of a
Registered Land Surveyor, concrete monuments 4 inches square or 4 inches in
diameter and 40 inches long with an iron pipe cast in the center, at each
corner or angle of the ultimate outside boundary. They shall be set following
grading of each phase of the subdivision.
      (2)   The subdivider shall have placed, under the supervision of a
registered land surveyor, pipes or steel rods, ¾-inch in diameter by 30 inches
in length at the corners of each lot. They shall be set prior to the issuance
of any building permit.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02) Penalty, see §
156.999
§ 156.054 CHARACTER OF LAND.
   Land which the Commission finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or
development because of flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock
formations, adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements, or other
features which might reasonably be harmful to the safety, health, and general
welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its
surrounding areas, shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods
are formulated by the developer and approved by the Commission, upon
recommendation of the County Engineer, to solve the problems created by the
unsuitable land conditions. Such land shall be set aside for such uses
permitted by the Zoning Ordinance as shall not involve any such danger.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02) Penalty, see §
156.999
§ 156.055 SUBDIVISION NAME.
   The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too closely
approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the area covered
by these regulations. The Plan Commission shall have final authority to
designate the name of the subdivision which shall be determined at the time of
primary approval.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02) Penalty, see §
156.999
§ 156.056 LOT IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Lot Arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulties for reasons of topography or other conditions in
securing building permits to build on each of the created lots in compliance
with the Zoning Ordinance and health regulations and in providing driveway
access to buildings on such lots from the appropriate approved street.
   (B)   Lot Dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards
in the Zoning Ordinance. Where lots are more than double the minimum required
area for the zoning district the Commission may require that such lots be
arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets
where they would be necessary to serve all such potential lots in compliance
with the Zoning Ordinance and these regulations. In general, side lot lines
shall be at right angles to the street lines (or radial to curving street
lines) unless a variation from this rule will give a better street or lot plan.
Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for erection of
buildings, observing the minimum front yard setback from both streets. Depth
and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial, or
industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for all of the off-street
parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and development
contemplated, as established in the Zoning Ordinance.
   (C)   Double Frontage Lots and Access to Lots.
      (1)   Double Frontage Lots. Double frontage and reversed frontage lots
shall be avoided except where necessary to provide for the separation of
residential development from the traffic on bordering arterials or to overcome
specific disadvantages of topography and orientation affecting the subdivided
lots.
      (2)   Access from Primary and Secondary Arterials. Lots shall not, in
general, derive access from a primary or secondary arterial street. Where
driveway access from a primary or secondary arterial street may be the only
possible access for several adjoining lots, the Commission may require that
such lots be served by a combined access drive in order to limit possible
traffic hazards from multiple access to such streets. Where possible, driveways
should be designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back into
traffic on primary or secondary arterials.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02) Penalty, see §
156.999
§ 156.057 BLOCKS.
   (A)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of
appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be
permitted in blocks adjacent to arterial streets, railroads and waterways.
   (B)   The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated, but
block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed 2,600 feet nor be less than
400 feet in length. Blocks along arterials and collector streets shall not be
less then 1,000 feet in length.
   (C)   In long blocks the Commission may require the reservation of easements
through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, or pedestrian
traffic. Pedestrian ways or crosswalks not less than ten feet wide may be
required by the Commission through the center of blocks more than 800 feet long
or at other appropriate locations and at the ends of the cul-de-sacs where
deemed essential to provide for circulation or access to schools, playgrounds,
shopping centers, transportation, or other community facilities. Blocks
designed for industrial uses shall be of such length and width as may be
determined to be suitable by the Commission for the intended use.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02) Penalty, see §
156.999
§ 156.058 SOIL PRESERVATION, GRADING AND SEEDING.
   (A)   Final Grading. Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots or
used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to provide at least six inches
of cover and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting.
   (B)   Lot Drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive
drainage away from all buildings and individual lot drainage shall be
coordinated with the general storm water drainage pattern for the area.
Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid the accumulation of storm water on
any one or more lots from adjacent lots. It shall be the responsibility of the
lot owner to maintain the lot grade, as it applies to drainage, as provided for
in the approved construction plans.
   (C)   Lawn-grass Seed. All lots shall be seeded from the roadside edge of
the unpaved right-of-way back to a distance of 25 feet behind the principal
residence on the lot.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02) Penalty, see §
156.999
§ 156.059 DEBRIS AND WASTE.
   No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones, soil, junk, rubbish, or
other waste material of any kind shall be buried in any land, or left or
deposited on any lot or street at the time of occupancy within a subdivision,
nor shall any be left or deposited in any area of the subdivision at the time
of expiration of the performance bond or dedication of public improvements,
whichever is sooner.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02) Penalty, see §
156.999
§ 156.060 FENCING.
   Each subdivider and/or developer shall be required to furnish and install
fences wherever the Commission determines that a hazardous condition may exist.
The fences shall be constructed according to standards established in the
Zoning Ordinance and shall be noted as to height and material on the final
plat. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until said fence improvements
have been duly installed.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02) Penalty, see §
156.999
§ 156.061 WATERBODIES AND WATERCOURSES.
   If a tract being subdivided contains a water body, or portion thereof, lot
lines shall be so drawn as to distribute the entire ownership of the water body
among the fees of adjacent lots. The Commission may approve an alternative
allocation of interests whereby the ownership of and responsibility for safe
maintenance of the water body is so placed that it will not become a local
government responsibility. No part of the minimum area of a lot required under
the Zoning Ordinance may be satisfied by land which is under water. Where a
watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from the street from which it
has access, provisions shall be made for installation of a culvert or other
structure, of a design approved by the County Engineer.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02) Penalty, see §
156.999
§ 156.062 STREETS.
   (A)   General Requirements.
      (1)   Frontage on Improved Streets. No subdivision shall be approved
unless the area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and access from an
existing street on the Official Map, or if there is not an Official Map, unless
such a street is an existing state, county, or township highway; or
         (a)   A street shown upon a plat approved by the Commission and
recorded in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds. Such street or highway
must be suitably improved as required by the highway rules, regulation
specifications, or orders, or be secured by a performance bond required under
these regulations, with the width and right-of-way required by these
regulations or as indicated on the Official Map or Thoroughfare Plan. Whenever
the area to be subdivided is to use an existing street frontage, such street
shall be suitably improved as provided herein above.
         (b)   Whenever a subdivision of more than five lots along a state or
county road is developed the Commission may require a turn lane or access road
to be constructed to minimize the risk or traffic hazard.
   (B)   Grading and Improvement Plan. Streets shall be graded and improved and
conform to the city construction standards and specifications and shall be
approved as to design and specifications by the County Engineer, in accordance
with the construction plans required to be submitted prior to secondary
approval.
   (C)   Topography and Arrangement.
      (1)   Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. All
streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building
sites at, or above, the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform
as closely as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep
grades and sharp curves shall be avoided. Specific standards are contained in
the design standards of these regulations.
      (2)   All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights-of-way as established on
the Official Map or Thoroughfare Plan, and/or Comprehensive Plan.
         (a)   Widths of streets and highways shall conform to the width
specified by the City Street Superintendent standards cross-section.
         (b)   All cul-de-sacs shall terminate in a circular right-of-way with
a minimum diameter of 100 feet and shall not exceed 600 feet in length.
         (c)   Alleys shall be discouraged in residential district but should
be included in commercial and industrial areas where needed for loading and
unloading, or access purposes. Where alleys are platted they shall be 14 feet
in width.
      (3)   All local and collector streets shall be properly related to
special traffic generators such as industries, business districts, schools,
churches, and shopping centers, to population densities, and to the pattern of
existing and proposed land uses.
      (4)   Local streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to
the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient
drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of streets
necessary to provide convenient and safe access to the property.
      (5)   Rigid, rectangular "gridiron" street patterns are generally to be
avoided, and the use of casually curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, or loop
streets shall be encouraged where such use will result in a more desirable lay-
out and relate better to the existing topography. On flat land, innovative,
varying geometrical street patterns shall be encouraged where they are likely
to enhance visual interest and a sense of order for those using them (e.g.,
non-grid rectilinear, trapezoidal, polygonal, or other geometric patterns).
      (6)   Proposed streets shall, where appropriate, be extended to the
boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided unless this is prevented by
topography or other physical conditions, or unless in the opinion of the Plan
Commission such extension(s) is/are not necessary or desirable for the
coordination of the layout of the subdivision under consideration with the
existing street layout or for the most advantageous future development of
adjacent tracts.
      (7)   In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
access ways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, walkways, bikeways, and parking areas so as to minimize
conflict of movement between the various types of vehicular and pedestrian
traffic.
   (D)   Streets Design.
      (1)   Street (and alley when provided) shall be completed to grades shown
on plans, profiles, and cross-sections, provided by the subdivider, and
prepared by a registered professional engineer and approved by the Commission.
      (2)   The street shall be graded, surfaced and improved to the dimensions
required by such plans, profiles and cross-sections and the work shall be
performed in the manner prescribed in "Standard Specifications for Road and
Bridge Construction and Maintenance" (current issue) of the Department of
Transportation.
      (3)   The street pavement shall be of Portland cement concrete of a
flexible pavement of a width as provided in this chapter and shall be
constructed in accordance with design characteristics at least equal to those
given below.
Design Characteristics of Street and Alley Pavement

      (4)   Prior to placing the street and alley surfaces, adequate subsurface
drainage for the street shall be provided by the subdivider. Subsurface
drainage pipe, when required, shall be coated corrugated pipe or similar type
not less than 12 inches in diameter approved by the Commission. Plans and
profiles as built shall be filed with the Commission.
      (5)   Street Names. The sketch plan, as submitted, shall indicate names
of proposed streets regarding the duplication of names and possible confusion.
After reviewing them, the Administrator shall inform the subdivider of his
recommendations for possible revision during the sketch plan review. Names
shall be sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other street
names in the county or other nearby area so as to avoid confusion. A street,
which is, or is planned as a continuation of an existing street, shall bear the
same name.
   (E)   Access to Collector Streets. Where possible, lots in single family
residential subdivisions fronting on collector streets shall be avoided and
lots at the corners of intersections between local and collector streets shall
front on the local street and have driveway access to it only and not to the
collector street. In multiple family residential areas entrances to group
parking lots shall have access only to collector streets (where possible) and
such entrances shall be widely spaced.
   (F)   Access to Primary Arterials. Where a subdivision borders on or
contains an existing or proposed primary arterial, the Commission may require
that access to it be limited by one of the following means:
      (1)   The subdivision of the lots so as to back onto the primary arterial
and front onto a parallel local street, no access shall be provided from the
primary arterial and screening shall be provided within a strip of land along
the rear property line of such lots;
      (2)   A series of cul-de-sacs, or loop streets entered from, and designed
generally to be at right angles to an access street that is at some distance
from and parallel to the arterial street, with the rear lines of their terminal
lots backing onto the arterial.
   (G)   Street Regulatory Signs. The applicant shall provide and install a
street sign at every street intersection within his subdivision as required by
the Street Department. The city shall inspect and approve all street signs
before issuance of certificates of occupancy for any residence on the approved
streets.
   (H)   Street Lights. If installed will be in accordance with the
specification set by the County Engineer.
   (I)   Reserve Strips. The creation of reserve strips shall not be permitted
adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as to deny access to it from
adjacent property if such street is a local service street rather than a
collector or arterial street. (See divisions (E) and (F) of this section.)
   (J)   Construction of Streets.
      (1)   Construction of Streets other than Cul-de-sacs. The arrangement of
streets shall provide for the continuation of streets between adjacent
subdivisions or other properties when such continuation is necessary for the
convenient movement of traffic, for effective fire protection, for efficient
provision of utilities, and where such continuation is in accordance with the
Comprehensive Plan. If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must
be a dead-end (stub) street temporarily, the right-of-way shall be provided for
all such temporary dead-end streets, with the notation on the subdivision plat
that land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abuttors
whenever the street is continued. Temporary turnarounds must be provided at the
ends of such stub streets. The Commission may limit the length of temporary
dead-end streets in accordance with the design standards in these regulations.
      (2)   Cul-de-sacs (Permanent Dead-end Streets). Where a street does not
extend beyond the boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not
required by the Commission for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall
normally not be nearer to such boundary than 50 feet. However, the Commission
may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage
facilities, pedestrian traffic, or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be
provided at the end of a permanent dead-end street in accordance with county
construction standards and specifications available from the County Engineer's
office. For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire
protection, permanent dead-end streets shall be limited in length in accordance
with the design standards in these regulations.
   (K)   Design Standards.
      (1)   General. In order to provide for streets of suitable location,
width, and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford
satisfactory access for police, fire-fighting, snow removal, sanitation, and
street maintenance equipment, and to coordinate street location in order to
achieve a convenient system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties,
the following design standards for streets are hereby required. (Street
classifications may be indicated in the Comprehensive Plan, Thoroughfare Plan,
or on the Official Map; otherwise, they shall be determined by the Commission.)
      (2)   Street Surfacing and Improvements. After the developer has
installed sewer and water utilities, the applicant may be required to construct
curbs and gutters and shall surface or cause the roadways to be surfaced to the
widths prescribed in these regulations. Said surfacing shall be of such
character as is suitable for the expected traffic and in harmony with similar
improvements in the surrounding areas. Types of pavement shall be as determined
by the County Engineer. Adequate provision shall be made for culverts, drains,
and bridges. All street pavement, shoulders, drainage improvements and
structures, curbs, turn-arounds, and sidewalks shall conform to all
construction standards and specifications adopted by the Commission, City
Engineer, or the county and shall be incorporated into the construction plans
required to be submitted by the developer for plat approval.
      (3)   Excess Right-of-way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards
designed in these regulations shall be required whenever, due to topography,
additional width is necessary to provide for adequate and stable earth slopes.
Such slopes shall not be in excess of three to one.
      (4)   Railroads and Limited Access Highways. Railroad rights-of-way and
limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of
adjoining lands shall be treated as follows.
         (a)   In residential districts a buffer strip at least 25 feet in
depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall
be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway.
This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the
plat: "This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of structures hereon
other than earth berms, walls, fences and other landscape screening devices
approved by the Commission is prohibited."
         (b)   In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses,
the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to a railroad
shall, wherever practical, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure a
suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
         (c)   Streets parallel to a railroad when intersecting a street, which
crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance
shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for
future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
      (5)   Intersections.
         (a)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an
angle of less than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should
be approximately at right angles for at least 100 feet therefrom. Not more than
two streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by
the Commission.
         (b)   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street
shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersection on the
opposite side of such street. Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than
150 feet shall not be permitted except where the intersected street has
separated, dual drives, without median breaks at either such intersection.
Where local streets intersect with arterials, their alignment shall be
continuous. Intersections of arterials shall be at least 800 feet apart.
         (c)   Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two local streets
shall be at least 20 feet, and minimum curb radius at an intersection involving
a collector street shall be at least 25 feet. Alley intersections and abrupt
changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in
accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular
movement.
         (d)   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever
practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection a
leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a 2% grade at a
distance of 60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the
intersecting street.
         (e)   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or
existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by
limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation
(including trimming trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-
of-way to the extent deemed necessary by the County Engineer to provide an
adequate sight distance.
         (f)   The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall
be 3% or less.
      (6)   Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by the
Commission, shall be constructed at the full expense of the applicant without
reimbursement from the county. The sharing of expense for the construction of
bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant as determined by the
Commission, will be fixed by special agreement between the county and the
applicant. Said cost shall be charged to the applicant pro-rata as the
percentage of his land developed and so served.
   (L)   Street Dedications and Reservations.
      (1)   New Perimeter Streets. Street systems in new subdivisions shall be
laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets. Where an
existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the
street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider. The Commission may
authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves and dedicates
the entire required right-of-way width within his own subdivision's boundaries.
      (2)   Widening and Realignment of Existing Streets. Where a subdivision
borders an existing narrow street or when the Comprehensive Plan, Official Map,
Thoroughfare Plan, or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment
or widening of a street that would require use of some of the land in the
subdivision, the applicant shall be required to improve and dedicate such
streets at his own expense. Such frontage streets and other streets on which
subdivision lots front shall be improved and dedicated by the applicant at his
own expense to the full width required by these subdivision regulations. Land
reserved for any street purposes may not be counted in satisfying the yard or
area requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.

156.999
§ 156.063 DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS.
   (A)   General Requirements. The Commission shall not recommend for approval
any subdivision plat which does not make adequate provision for storm or flood
water runoff channels or basins. The storm water drainage system shall be
separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where
required, shall be designed as approved by the Commission and the County
Drainage Board, and a copy of the design computations shall be submitted along
with the plans. Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried
across or around any intersection, nor for a distance of more than 600 feet in
the gutter or when the encroachment of storm water into the street disrupts
traffic. When calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a
point, no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point and catch
basins or inlets shall be used to intercept flow at that point. Surface water
drainage patterns shall be shown for each and every lot and block.
   (B)   Nature of Storm Water Facilities. The applicant may be required by the
Commission to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that
may exist, either previously to, or as result of the subdivision. Such drainage
facilities shall be located in the street right-of-way where feasible, or in
perpetual, unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be
constructed in accordance with the county's construction standards and
specifications.
   (C)   Accessibility to Public Storm Sewers.
      (1)   Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall
install storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable
distance adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm water,
subject to the specifications of the Utilities Engineer. However, in
subdivisions containing lots of less than 15,000 square feet in area and in
business and industrial districts, underground storm sewer systems shall be
constructed throughout the subdivision and be conducted to an approved outfall.
Inspection of facilities shall be conducted by the Utilities Engineer.
      (2)   If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided
eventually, as determined by the Utilities Engineer (see comment above) and the
Commission, the developer shall make arrangements for future storm water
disposal by the public utility system at the time the plat receives final
approval. Cost provision(s) for such connection(s) shall be incorporated by
inclusion in the amount of the performance bond or equivalent required for the
subdivision plat.
   (D)   Accommodation of Upstream Drainage Areas. A culvert or other drainage
facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential runoff
from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
subdivision. The County Engineer shall determine the necessary size of the
facility, based on the provisions of the required construction standards and
specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed development
permitted by the Zoning Ordinance.
   (E)   Effect on Downstream Drainage Areas. The County Engineer shall
determine the effect of each proposed subdivision on existing drainage
facilities outside the area of the subdivision. County drainage studies
together with such other studies as may be available and appropriate, shall
serve as a guide to needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that the
additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload
an existing downstream drainage facility, the Commission may withhold secondary
approval of the subdivision until provision (such as a storage facility) has
been made for the improvement of said potential condition in such sum as the
Commission shall determine. No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate
drainage from it will be provided to an adequate drainage water course or
facility.
   (F)   Areas of Poor Drainage. Areas which are not in the flood plain but
contain soils which are subject to flooding may be approved for subdivision by
the Commission, provided that the subdivider fills the affected areas of said
subdivision to an elevation sufficient to place building sites and streets two
feet above ponding levels.
   (G)   Areas of High Seasonal Water Tables. In areas characterized by soils
having a high seasonal water table as determined by the Miami County Soil and
Water Conservation District, lots shall be limited to slab type construction
unless the Commission determines that appropriate engineering techniques will
be applied to alleviate the subsurface problem.
   (H)   Floodway Areas. If a subdivision of land is proposed within the flood
plain, floodways shall be preserved and not diminished in capacity by filling
or obstruction, except as approved by the Natural Resources Commission in
writing. No residential building site may be located within the floodway.
   (I)   Floodway Fringe Areas. Where a subdivision is proposed within an area
of the flood plain designated as a floodway fringe, the Commission may approve
such subdivision provided that: all streets are elevated sufficiently to be
above the regulatory flood elevation; all lots for residential usage have a
flood protection grade two feet above the regulatory flood elevation; where
provided, water and sanitary sewer facilities are constructed to eliminate
contamination of or by, flood water; and, approval to fill the area from the
Natural Resources Commission has been obtained in writing. Lands below the
regulatory flood elevation shall not be used for computing the area requirement
for any lot.
   (J)   Flood Plain Areas. Where a subdivision is proposed within an area of
the flood plain for which floodway and floodway fringe designations have not
been made, the Commission shall not approve such a subdivision unless all
streets are raised sufficiently to be above the regulatory flood elevation; all
lots for residential usage have a flood protection grade of two feet above the
regulatory flood elevation; where provided, public water and sanitary sewer
facilities are constructed to eliminate contamination of or by flood water;
and, filling to achieve the above will not raise the level of the regulatory
flood elevation more than one-tenth of one foot for that reach of the stream.
All filling in the flood plain must be approved in writing by the Indiana
Natural Resources Commission. Lands below the regulatory flood elevation shall
not be used for computing the area requirement for any lot.
   (K)   Recording of Plats in the Flood Plain and Floodway Fringe. All final
plats having within their boundaries areas whose elevation is below that of the
regulatory flood elevation shall show and label the regulatory flood boundary
and elevation, as of the date the final plat is drawn, on the final plat for
recording.

156.999
§ 156.064 DEDICATION OF DRAINAGE EASEMENTS.
   (A)   General Requirements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a drainage
course, drainage way, channel, or stream, a storm water easement or drainage
right-of-way shall be provided, granted or dedicated to the county conforming
substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of such width and
construction or both as will be adequate for the purpose of both drainage and
maintenance of the right-of-way. Wherever possible, it is desirable that the
drainage be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate
width for maximum potential volume of flow.
   (B)   Drainage Easements.
      (1)   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within street rights-of-way,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for such drainage
facilities shall be provided across property outside the right-of-way lines and
with satisfactory access to the street. Easements shall be indicated on the
plat. Drainage easements shall be carried from the street to a natural
watercourse or to other drainage facilities.
      (2)   The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or
conservation, easement land on both sides of existing watercourses of a width
to be determined by the Commission and, in the case of legal drains, the County
Drainage Board.
      (3)   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the plat.
      (4)   Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as drainage
ways. Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be included in
the computations for determining the number of lots allowable under average
density procedures nor for computing the area requirement for any individual
lot.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02) Penalty, see §
156.999
§ 156.065 WATER FACILITIES.
   (A)   The applicant shall take all actions necessary to extend or create a
water-supply district for the purpose of providing a water-supply system
capable of providing for domestic water use and fire protection.
   (B)   Where a public water main is accessible the subdivider shall install
adequate water facilities (including fire hydrants) conforming to the
requirements and specifications of the state or local authorities. All water
mains shall be at least six inches in diameter.
   (C)   Water main extensions shall be approved by the officially designated
agency of the state, county or municipality concerned.
   (D)   To facilitate the above, the location of all fire hydrants, water
supply improvements, and the boundary lines of proposed districts indicating
all improvements proposed to be served, shall be shown on the preliminary plat,
and the cost of installing same shall be included in the performance bond to be
furnished by the subdivider.
   (E)   The design of all water facilities shall conform to or exceed the
standards described County Board of Health and the State Board of Health.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02) Penalty, see §
156.999
§ 156.066 INDIVIDUAL WELLS AND CENTRAL WATER SYSTEMS.
   (A)   In low-density zoning districts, if a public water system is not
available, at the discretion of the Commission, individual wells may be used or
a central water system provided in such a manner that an adequate supply of
potable water will be available to every lot in the subdivision. Water sample
test results shall be submitted to the Health Department for its approval, and
individual wells and central water systems shall be approved by the appropriate
health authorities. These approvals shall be submitted to the Commission.
   (B)   If the Commission requires that a connection to a public water main be
eventually provided as a condition for approval of an individual well or
central water system, the applicant shall make arrangements for future water
service at the time the plat receives secondary approval. Performance or cash
bonds may be required to insure compliance.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02) Penalty, see §
156.999
COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS
§ 156.080 IMPROVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (A)   Completion of Improvements. Before the plat is signed by the
designated officials all applicants shall be required to complete, in
accordance with the Commission's decision and to the satisfaction of the County
Engineer, all the streets, sanitary, and other public improvements including
lot improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision as required in this
chapter, specified in the approved construction plans and on the final
subdivision plat, and as approved by the Commission and to dedicate the public
improvements to the county, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the
property and public improvements thus dedicated.
   (B)   Performance Bond.
      (1)   The Commission in its sole discretion may waive the requirement
that the applicant complete all public improvements prior to the approval of
the final subdivision plat or section thereof, and that, in lieu thereof, the
applicant shall post bond securable to the city, hereinafter referred to as
performance bond, in an amount equivalent to 100% of the estimated cost of
completion of the required public improvements. This amount of bond shall be
sufficient to secure to the participating jurisdiction the satisfactory
construction and installation of the uncompleted portion of required public
improvements, as provided for in this chapter.
      (2)   In lieu of such a bond the subdivider may submit a certified check
made payable to the city in an amount equivalent to 100% of the estimated cost
of completion of the uncompleted portion of required public improvements as
provided for in this chapter. Such check shall be held by the City Clerk-
Treasurer.
      (3)   In lieu of such a bond the subdivider may submit irrevocable
letters of credit in behalf of the subdivider and securable by the city in an
amount equivalent to 100% of the estimated cost of completion of the
uncompleted portion of required public improvements as provided in this
chapter. In the event an irrevocable letter of credit is used it shall be
written for a maximum length of two years. The Commission, two months prior to
the expiration of the letter of credit, shall determine if the public
improvements have been accepted for maintenance by the city or other units of
government having jurisdiction over them, and if they have not been accepted
shall so notify the subdivider of the county's intent to secure the funds
pledged by such letter of credit or, at the discretion of the Commission, to
grant an extension of the original period fixed by the Commission. No extension
shall exceed one year, and the subdivider filing with the Commission a new
letter of credit for the period so extended.
      (4)   In lieu of such a bond the subdivider may submit a certificate of
deposit made out to either the city and the subdivider to be held by the City
Clerk-Treasurer in an amount equivalent to 100% of the cost of completion of
the uncompleted portion of required public improvements as provided for in this
chapter. The subdivider must endorse the certificate of deposit before
submitting it to the Commission so that the city may secure the funds.
      (5)   A performance bond furnished pursuant to this chapter shall comply
with all statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to the Commission
Attorney as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution as set forth in this
chapter. (See Appendix §
2) The period within which required public improvements must be completed shall
be specified by the Commission in the primary approval of the preliminary plat
and shall be incorporated into the bond and shall not in any event exceed two
years from date of secondary approval. Such bond shall be approved by the
participating jurisdiction as to amount. The Commission may, upon proof of
difficulty, grant an extension of the completion date set forth in such bond
for a maximum period of one additional year, provided that the bond submitted
for this extension period meets all other requirements herein. The Commission
may, at any time during the term of such bond, accept a substitution of
principal or sureties on the bond.
   (C)   Temporary Public Improvements. The applicant shall build and pay for
all costs of temporary public improvements required by the Commission and shall
maintain same for the period specified by the Commission. Prior to construction
of any temporary public facility or improvement, the subdivider shall file with
the Commission a separate suitable bond for temporary facilities. This bond
shall insure that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed,
maintained, and removed (except for turnaround at ends of the peripheral stub
streets intended for connection into adjacent future subdivisions).
   (D)   Cost of Public Improvements. All required public improvements shall be
made by the applicant at his expense without reimbursement by the participating
jurisdiction or any public improvement district therein, unless sharing of
expenses is agreed upon by the city.
   (E)   Governmental Units. Governmental units to which these bond provisions
apply may file a certified resolution or ordinance from officers or agencies
authorized to act in their behalf, agreeing to comply with the provisions of
this section in lieu of said bond.
   (F)   Failure to Complete Public Improvements. For subdivisions for which no
performance bond has been posted, if the public improvements are not completed
within the period specified by the Commission in the primary approval of the
preliminary plat, or the sketch plan in the case of a minor subdivision, the
approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where a performance
bond has been posted and the required public improvements have not been
installed within the terms of such performance bond, the participating
jurisdiction may thereupon request the city to declare the bond to be in
default and cause all public improvements to be installed according to
secondary approval regardless of the extent of the building development at the
time the bond is declared to be in default.
   (G)   Acceptance of Dedication Offers. The approval by the Commission of a
subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by
the city of any street, easement, or park shown on said plat. The Commission
may require said plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. The
approval relates only to the real property itself.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02) Penalty, see §
156.999
§ 156.081 INSPECTION OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   General Procedure. If the participating jurisdiction finds upon
inspection that any of the improvements have not been constructed in accordance
with the approved construction plans, the applicant shall be responsible for
completing the public improvements according to such plans. Where the cost of
the public improvements is covered by a performance bond, the applicant and the
bonding company shall be severally and jointly liable for completing the public
improvements according to specifications.
   (B)   Release or Reduction of Performance Bond.
      (1)   Certificate of Satisfactory Completion. The city (or other
participating jurisdiction) shall not accept required public improvements, nor
the Commission release nor reduce a performance bond, until the city has
submitted to it a certificate stating that all required public improvements or
a pro rata part in the case of a reduction have been satisfactorily completed.
The applicant's engineer or surveyor shall provide the participating
jurisdiction with detailed "as built" construction plans of the public
improvements, indicating location, dimensions, materials, and other information
required by the Commission or participating jurisdiction. Upon such
certification, the city shall thereafter accept the public improvements for
maintenance in accordance with the established procedures unless the city has
reliable information as to noncompliance with the plans and specifications.
      (2)   Reduction of Performance Bond. A performance bond shall be reduced
upon actual acceptance of public improvements, but only by the amount
originally estimated for the completion of said public improvements.

156.999
§ 156.082 MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   The applicant shall be required to maintain all public improvements on
the individual subdivided lots and provide for snow removal on streets and
sidewalks (where required) until acceptance of said public improvements by the
city (or other participating jurisdiction).
   (B)   The applicant shall be required to file a maintenance bond with the
Commission, prior to acceptance, in an amount not to exceed 10% of the cost of
all public improvements, and in a form satisfactory to the Commission Attorney.
The maintenance bond is provided to assure the satisfactory condition of the
required public improvements for a period of three years after the date of
their acceptance by the city.
(Ord. 6-2002, passed 3-4-02) Penalty, see §
156.999
§ 156.083 ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS.
   No building permit shall be issued for the last 10% of lots in a final
subdivision plat or section thereof, or if 10% be less than two, for the last
two lots of a subdivision or section thereof, until all public improvements
required by the Commission for the plat with the exception of sidewalks have
been fully completed and accepted for maintenance by the participating
jurisdiction.

Appendix:    Petition for Annexation
ANNEXATION POLICIES AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
§ 157.001 PREAMBLE.
   (A)   The research undertaken in the formal development of annexation
policies for the City of Peru has clearly demonstrated that the city has
engaged in extensive efforts to prepare for controlled, methodical, organized
growth of the city over the very long term.
   (B)   The city has invested and re-invested in comprehensive planning,
zoning and development standards which control the development within the Plan
Commission jurisdiction, including both the incorporated and unincorporated
areas surrounding Peru. These planning efforts set forth the parameters for the
development of the unincorporated areas in a manner that would have been
impossible without the active direction of the city, and this planning and
development control has led to orderly growth and high-quality development in
the areas under the municipal planning jurisdiction.
   (C)   The city has also invested extensively in utility service capacity,
especially in sewer and water utilities, to serve these unincorporated areas,
as another method of assuring high-quality new development and growth around
the existing municipal boundaries. The Peru sewage treatment facility is
currently designed to handle more sewage than is generated by the incorporated
community, which is a clear indication of the financial support and municipal
investment which the city has demonstrated for new and high-quality growth in
the service area.
   (D)   Since virtually 100% of the land within the incorporated boundaries of
Peru is already developed, it is irrefutable that the incorporated city has no
need for additional sewage treatment or water service capacity. Therefore, the
reserve utility capacity was constructed purely for the benefit of providing
services to serve the growth of the community. This is especially true with
regard to the northwest sewer and water interceptor corridor. The municipality
is entitled to reap the benefits of this speculative investment through growth
and annexation.
   (E)   The city is also initiating the implementation of a requirement that
developers seeking development approvals in the unincorporated areas provide
the city with an annexation agreement (or an agreement not to remonstrate) that
prohibits future property owners within their developments from opposing future
annexation actions by the city. These "annexation agreements" are to be
formally recorded with the County Recorder, and will clearly demonstrate the
intent of both the city and the developer to annex these new developments as
the city grows. It is important to note, however, that often times, the
purchasers of homes and businesses in these unincorporated areas become
comfortable in receiving the city's utility and other municipal services
without the municipal property tax burden which comes with annexation. They
enjoy having the cost of their services effectively subsidized by the municipal
taxpayers and they sometimes attempt to legally sidestep their previous
agreements with regard to annexation. Therefore, it is imperative that the
municipality categorically state that it is the intent of the municipality to
grow and that annexation will be pursued, especially for those areas in which
annexation agreements have been signed with the developers.
   (F)   However, the city has made a far more concrete investment in the long
term growth of the municipality which becomes an indisputable fact in any
annexation question. During the 2000-2002 period, Peru Utilities planned,
designed and constructed major new interceptor sewer and water facilities to
serve the unincorporated areas northwest of the incorporated city, as far as
the intersection of US31 and US24 (and potentially beyond). These investments
are not disputable in any fashion. The capital investment in new facilities was
made for the purpose of generating growth, and that growth will become a part
of the incorporated municipality on a long term basis. When expensive public
services such as these are subsidized by municipal taxpayers, it must be
understood that the failure to annex such territories and the new development
which is generated, can have no other outcome than to cause excessively high
taxes or excessively high utility rates inside the municipal boundaries.
   (G)   The combined impact of these actions is indisputable. The city has
been planning for a growing community, with the intent of providing a high
quality environment for its residents. From the beginning, the area considered
for Peru's long term growth included the entirety of the jurisdiction of the
Plan Commission, including its (unincorporated) fringe areas, as well as the
utility service area of Peru Utilities. Those plans were initiated under a set
of annexation and growth statutes which have since been changed, however, those
statutory changes do not alter the original and continuous intent of the City
of Peru with respect to defining and implementing a bright future - and lower
taxes - for its citizens by providing uniform municipal services (and uniform
tax rates to pay for those services) throughout the township. Therefore, this
preamble stands as a means of summarizing the evidentiary nature of these
previous actions.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.002 FISCAL POLICY OF THE CITY.
   (A)   It is appropriate to state categorically that the annexation policies
of the city are expected to correspond with the fiscal policies of the city. In
the vernacular, "no free lunch." Therefore, it is the policy of the City of
Peru that annexation will only be undertaken under circumstances which are not
adverse to the fiscal interests of the current residents and taxpayers of the
city. Conversely, the city will pursue annexation in areas where city services
are already afforded or which can be extended with minimal cost.
   (B)   At the same time, it should be understood that Peru is a relatively
small city and does not seek large infusions of revenue to support increasing
costs of services. Instead, it is the long-term intent of the municipality to
use the growth in assessed value for the primary purpose of reducing the
property tax burden which has accumulated on the municipal taxpayers. As such,
a portion of the new assessed value resulting from annexation can be used to
generate the revenues necessary to extend services, and the remainder can then
be used to reduce the property tax rate.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.003 IMPACT OF THE “SPEEDWAY” SUPREME COURT DECISION.
   (A)   On April 3, 2002, the Indiana Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision
written by the Chief Justice, found that it was permissible for the Town of
Speedway to charge differential utility rates to the customers inside of the
corporate limits, versus those outside of the corporate limits. Although the
"differential" between the inside rate and the outside rate for Speedway was
50% (50% more for the outside customers), the Supreme Court noted that rate
differentials of 250% or more are possible, in accordance with the guidelines
for setting these utility rates.
   (B)   Until this decision was rendered by the Supreme Court, communities
were reluctant to differentiate rates between inside and outside the corporate
limits. This reluctance then directly caused the customers outside the
corporate limits to receive utility services at the same rate as those inside
the corporate limits. Once municipal utility services are received by
unincorporated parcels, the incentives and motivation for annexation are
severely reduced, therefore, in those cases where a municipality extended
utility service without annexation, the municipality effectively makes their
own job of annexation and growth more difficult.
   (C)   At the recommendation of Wabash Scientific, inc., that the city will
consider implementing a system of differentiated utility rates, in accordance
with the "Speedway" decision, charging higher utility rates to customers
outside the corporate limits of the city. This differentiation would be removed
at such time as the customer is annexed to the city. This action is expected to
reduce the propensity for remonstrance against annexation.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.004 PREFERENCE TOWARD VOLUNTARY OR AMENABLE ANNEXATIONS.
   The city seeks to implement annexation action under the most amenable
conditions possible. Therefore, in cases where it is practical to achieve
consensus in favor of annexation, the city would expect to demonstrate a
preference toward such consensus in those cases where an annexation action can
be implemented under the "voluntary" provisions of IC 36-4-3-5.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.005 ANNEXATION AGREEMENTS.
   The city will attempt to implement a comprehensive system of "annexation
agreements" with developers and land owners stating that the city intends to
take formal annexation actions at a future date, after the property becomes
contiguous to the city. The annexation agreements clearly demonstrate the
"policy intent" of the city with regard to annexation, however, the city is
cognizant of the importance of community consensus as a building block of good
government. The city will develop its policies and practices with regard to
annexation agreements to make them practical and informative for the residents
of these new areas in the future, including the requirement that annexation
agreements be recorded with the County Recorder. It is the city's long term
intent to require new development in the unincorporated areas to waive the
right to remonstrate against future annexation actions, with additional
requirements on the developer related to connection to utility systems.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.006 CITY BOUNDARIES TO APPROXIMATELY COINCIDE WITH SEWER/WATER UTILITY
SERVICE AREA.
   The original and current intent of the cumulative actions of the city with
regard to growth is that the ultimate boundaries of the city could ultimately
coincide with the boundaries of the utility service area of Peru Utilities,
especially that portion of the utility service area which offers water and
sewer utility service. Therefore, it is the official policy of the city that
the ongoing effort to plan for and implement municipal growth, through the
extension of municipal services will ultimately result in the incorporation of
virtually all areas within the service area of Peru Utilities.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.007 ANNEXATION OF NEW/PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT.
   The statute clearly anticipates the annexation of new development by a city.
The simple fact is that it is much simpler to annex an area while the parcels
are under the control of the developer, and before its ownership is scattered
to the individual parcels/owners. If a person buys a parcel within a
development with the full knowledge of it being brought within the corporate
limits of the city, the amount of confusion regarding municipal services and
property tax rates is greatly reduced. Therefore, the annexation policies of
the city make the annexation of new development the cornerstone of its
annexation policies.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.008 ANNEXATION OF EXISTING/OCCUPIED DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Once a residential development (which is the dominant form of
development in the rural areas surrounding Peru) is marketed and occupied, the
prospect for annexation becomes much less clear. The annexation of existing
development, therefore, deserves separate consideration, with accommodation of
the reality of its occupancy. It is expected that the annexation of existing
residential development will require special provisions with regard to
education/information as a means of developing and maintaining an appropriate
level of public consensus in support of the city.
   (B)   It is therefore the policy of the city that the city will extend a
good faith effort in educating and informing the property owners within a
proposed annexation territory of the intent to annex the area and the possible
consequences thereto. The city will share the draft Fiscal Plan developed in
accordance with the provisions of the statute through public presentations of
the information contained therein, as well as fact sheets summarizing major
issues with respect to the annexation. However, for obvious cost reasons, the
city reserves the right to recover reasonable printing/ copying costs for such
documents.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.009 ANNEXATION OF COMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.
   The statute makes special accommodation of commercial/industrial development
under IC 36-4-3-13. Since commercial/industrial areas are a major part of the
growth of the city, all industrial and commercial areas are to be considered
for immediate annexation action.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.010 UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF PUBLIC REMONSTRANCE AND PROTEST.
   (A)   The nature of public remonstrance and protest is fairly well known to
public officials as being a potentially vitriolic process where the public
enthusiastically exercises its right to free speech, often accompanied with
derision toward public officials. Such meetings often become confrontational,
despite the best efforts of the community to avoid such outcomes. During
vitriolic exchanges, it often becomes difficult to maintain a clear message.
Therefore, it is important for the municipality to clearly state its intent in
writing, in order to accurately convey the municipal intent, for better or
worse.
   (B)   Unfortunately, remonstrators and protesters will often engage any
practice to defer, delay or obfuscate the municipality's proposed action. Such
tactics therefore require simple clarity on the part of the municipality with
regard to its intent, in order to combat the efforts at obfuscation. It is not
uncommon, especially in public discussion of annexation, for remonstrators/
protesters to make facetious demands on the municipality in order to force the
public officials to delay the process for the purpose of responding to demands.
   (C)   The statutory phrase, "providing services in the same manner", does
not mandate the city to place certain capital improvements in the annexed area
unless that is the way it would provide the capital improvements in other
comparable parts of the city. The purpose of this statement of municipal
services is to state, with as much clarity as possible, the municipal services
which are provided by the city. In addition, this document also attempts to
address the issues of "developmental amenities" and "development standards" in
order that these other terms not be confused with actual "municipal services. "
This effort is expended specifically to clarify the municipality's response to
the requirements of IC 36-4-3.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
MUNICIPAL SERVICES
§ 157.025 CITY SERVICES VERSUS DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   In any annexation action, the city will extend municipal services to
the annexed area, in accordance with the requirements of state law. The city
hereby also sets forth a clear and specific distinction between "municipal
services" and "development standards." For purposes of annexation, "development
standards" are specifically identified as those improvements which are required
as a result of the requirements of the subdivision regulations and/or the
zoning ordinance as administered by the City Plan Commission. As such, the
improvements which would be considered to fall under the "development
standards" of the city, and not under the "municipal services" of the city
would include, but not be limited to, such things as sidewalks, curbs/gutters,
development greenspace, surface water management/ retention, walking/hiking
trails, street lighting, and other similar improvements which are required as
part of the development.
   (B)   Conversely, "municipal services" shall include the services directly
offered by city departments such as street maintenance/repair, police
protection, fire protection, sewer service, water service, city court, city
administration, municipal parks, and street maintenance and snow removal. In
cases where a development was undertaken with a direct preference for on-site
utilities (such as septic tanks and/or private wells), the city will respect
the original decision of the developer and property owners who purchased such
properties, and will allow such properties to continue use of these private
systems, unless otherwise negotiated.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.026 UTILITY SERVICE: SEWER AND WATER.
   (A)   The city defines “utility service” and “utility systems” to include
both the distribution/ collection system as well as the capacity to treat and
operate the utility systems. Water lines are useless without water supply and
storage which generates water pressure. Sewers are useless without the capacity
to treat the wastewater and a permit to discharge treated wastes to the surface
waters of the State of Indiana. People are often confused about "sewer service"
because of the entity that owns the collection/distribution system or the
entity which sends them a bill for service. Since the city owns and controls
the water supply and the capacity to treat and discharge sewage to the surface
waters of the State of Indiana, the City of Peru therefore is considered to
provide this utility service, even in cases where another legal entity might
own the collection sewers or the water lines. This policy is therefore based on
the holistic issue of utility service. Any property receiving utility service,
as defined herein, will be considered eligible for annexation.
   (B)   In cases where a developed property connects to the “utility systems”
of the city, as defined above, that property becomes immediately subject to
annexation by the city, as a condition of receipt of sewer service. If said
property cannot be configured in a manner that meets the annexation parameters
of state law, then the city will consider developing an annexation agreement or
a special contract under IC 36-4-3-8 or IC 36-4-3-21 or such other provisions
as might be appropriate to the situation in question.
   (C)   In any and all cases, this statement of annexation and growth policies
hereby categorically states that utility services are not to be offered to any
area on a "free" basis. Provision of such utility services is to be paid by the
property owner in all cases, and in full accordance with the system of rates,
fees and charges approved by Peru Utilities. In cases where a developer creates
a subdivision, the developer pays such rates, fees and charges and such costs
are passed through in the cost of the subdivision lot/parcel. In cases where
rural property is annexed, that rural property will be subject to similar
rates, fees, and charges as were levied against the developer.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.027 ITEMIZATION AND DEFINITION OF PERU MUNICIPAL SERVICES.
   (A)   The following itemization of municipal services is intended to specify
and clarify the municipal services which are offered to those properties which
are located within the corporate limits of the city. The provision of these
municipal services is altered from time to time due to the budget constraints
of the city, especially with regard to fluctuations in municipal revenue,
however, the municipal services specified herein are intended to clarify to
public officials, policy makers and the general public, precisely what services
are offered by the municipal corporation for purposes of day-to-day policy
making, as well as for purposes of considering annexation and growth of the
municipal corporation, in accordance with the requirements of IC 36-4-3.
   (B)   Any service which is not itemized herein is not to be considered a
part of the package of municipal services offered by the city, especially as it
pertains to the requirements of IC 36-4-3. The legislative and executive
branches of municipal government are responsible for remaining vigilant in
reviewing and improving the means of delivery of municipal services and the
charges/revenues and costs related thereto. As such, the delivery of municipal
services is altered from time to time, and the charges/revenues and costs
related thereto are also adjusted to reflect statutory, budgetary, regulatory
and other changes. In the case of the city, the primary funding source for the
municipal budget is property taxes, however, other local taxes and fees are
levied in the form of both taxes and specific user charges related to various
services. The services itemized below are considered a part of the municipal
service package, however, the funding for such services can be adjusted by the
municipal authorities as a part of the normal conduct of municipal business
under the constitution of the State of Indiana.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.028 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS, AMENITIES AND OTHER PROVISIONS.
   (A)   The term "municipal services" is to be considered separate and
distinct from other terms such as "development standards", "developmental
amenities", and other development/design provisions which are designed to
improve the quality of life within a particular development. The term,
"development standards" is to mean development provisions which result from the
implementation of requirements under the zoning and subdivision control
ordinances which govern development in the city and its planning/zoning
jurisdiction. Zoning and subdivision control ordinances are changed from time
to time by the Plan Commission and the City Council, thereby altering the
standards under which subdivisions are developed. When these subdivision/
development standards are altered, the subdivisions developed under the new
requirements are different from those developed under previous development
standards. Such changes in "development standards" might include such
alterations as changes in the width of streets, in the provision of alleys,
sidewalks/pathways, building setbacks, developmental densities, etc. These
differences in development standards are separate from and are not to be
confused with the provision of municipal services. The municipality will not be
providing any form of "development standards" adjustment in cases of
annexation.
   (B)   Similarly, various subdivision developments offer a range of
"developmental amenities" which are included by the developer to increase the
market desirability of their developments. These "developmental amenities" are
not dictated by the requirements of the zoning or subdivision control
ordinances, as is the case in "development standards." Rather, "developmental
amenities" are features which are voluntarily offered by the developer to
enhance sales. For example, some developments might offer a clubhouse, pool,
and park facilities for the use of those who purchase property in the
development. The operating cost of such facilities is sometimes paid through
assessments solicited from the property owners in the development, and despite
the fact that these types of facilities closely resemble the facilities of a
municipal park, these developmental amenities are not to be considered
municipal services in any manner. As such, the municipality will not be
providing any form of "developmental amenities" in cases of annexation.
   (C)   In addition, developers sometimes provide other developmental
provisions which enhance the quality of life or the marketability of these
developments. These other provisions might resemble municipal services in some
manner, but they are not.
   (D)   The reason that these distinctions between "municipal services" and
other forms of developmental enhancements must be made is due to recently
legislated provisions of IC 36-4-3, which attempted to make it more difficult
for municipalities to grow through annexation. The new provisions require that
municipalities must offer all municipal services that are offered anywhere in
the municipality, regardless of location. As a result of these legislative
changes, the public is often confused about what services it is entitled to
expect from the municipal corporation.
   (E)   To further exacerbate the problem, those opposed to annexation often
attempt to confuse and obfuscate the situation by demanding that the
municipality provide "municipal services" to the annexation area which are in
reality not "municipal services" but instead, are "development standards" and/
or "developmental amenities. " Remonstrators against an annexation have often
engaged in various forms of hyperbole and heated rhetoric in an attempt to
defeat an annexation by demanding that the municipality provide expensive
amenities under the "equal municipal services" requirement of the statute.
Therefore, the provisions of this statement of municipal services is designed
specifically to counteract such arguments and make the municipal annexation
policies clear to everyone.
   (F)   The municipality will, in all cases, provide a full range of municipal
services to any annexed area, in a manner substantially equivalent to the
services provided to the other portions of the municipality. However, the
municipality will not attempt to treat any "development standards" or
"developmental amenities" as municipal services and no development standard or
developmental amenity will be provided to any property by the municipality as a
result of annexation.

   All property within the corporate limits is served by the municipal police
department. As such, the municipal police department will respond to all police
calls within the corporate limits of the municipality. In addition, the Peru
Police Department makes routine patrols throughout the community 24 hours per
day, seven days per week, as well as other, less central, programs of the
Police Department. In certain cases, based entirely upon the idiosyncracies of
the specific situation, the municipal police may call for assistance from other
agencies in order to protect the public from harm. The Police Department is
funded primarily through local property taxes and other local revenues,
however, supplemental funding of various types is sometimes sought.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.030 PUBLIC SAFETY: FIRE PROTECTION.
   (A)   All property within the corporate limits is served by the municipal
fire department. As such, the municipal fire department will respond to all
fire protection calls within the corporate limits of the municipality. In
addition, the Fire Department provides other secondary programs in addition to
the core service of fire protection. In certain cases, based entirely upon the
idiosyncracies of the specific situation, the municipal fire department may
call for assistance from other agencies, including the fire departments of
neighboring communities, in order to protect the public from harm. The Fire
Department is funded primarily through local property taxes and other local
revenues, however, supplemental funding of various types is sometimes sought.
   (B)   From time to time, the Fire Department may, with the approval of the
legislative and executive branches of the city government, set service goals
for the department. In most cases, these service goals relate to objective
performance standards, facilities and resource capabilities which affect the
cost of insurance to properties within the service area. Generally, these
parameters are measured by an "ISO" accreditation system, with higher ISO
ratings resulting in lower insurance costs.
   (C)   There is no statewide statutory standard for fire protection services
provided by municipalities in Indiana. Instead, each municipality must
determine the level of service which represents a reasonable balance between
cost and benefit when each annual municipal budget is crafted. The performance
goals of the Fire Department are determined in a general manner and the public
can be informed about these performance standards by calling the Fire
Department.
   (D)   The Fire Department also maintains funding at the municipal level for
the addition and replacement of fire protection facilities and equipment. As
the city grows, it is expected that fire protection facilities will necessarily
be reconfigured to provide the most efficient and responsive fire protection
network for the citizens of the municipality, and a portion of the facilities
necessary to meet such needs will be paid through these cumulative funds.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.031 PUBLIC SAFETY: EMERGENCY SERVICES.
   The municipal emergency services includes a number of specific functions
which are not directly related to police and fire protection, but include
responses to traffic accidents, personal injuries, and other human emergency
situations, through the city's EMS network. The Peru EMS resources have a
working contract with Peru Township where municipal EMS services are afforded
the unincorporated township through a service contract. The emergency services
are primarily funded through property taxes and other local revenues,
therefore, any area being annexed to the incorporate municipality would result
in a revenue reduction from the Township for EMS services, along with a
simultaneous increase in property tax revenue to the municipality as a result
of the annexation.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.032 MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   The municipal administration services include the services within the
executive (mayor), legislative (city council), legal (city attorney) and fiscal
(clerk/controller) branches of municipal government, as well as the Board of
Public Works, which assists in managing the capital intensive infrastructure
systems of the municipality. These administrative services cover a broad range
of topics related to the operation of municipal service functions of the
municipality under the local, state and federal statutory and regulatory
structure, with the most singularly important function being that of managing
and overseeing the operation of municipal services within the municipality.
   (B)   In essence, the functions and services of all other municipal
departments are managed by the municipal administration, and are therefore
treated as “overhead” to the other departments for which specific municipal
services are more easily defined. It should also be noted that these municipal
departments and agencies often handle complaints from, and otherwise interact
with, individuals and entities which are not within the corporate limits of the
municipality. As such, the services of the municipal administration cannot be
easily confined solely to the owners of property within the corporate limits of
the municipality. At the same time, the municipal administration has no
authority outside of the corporate limits of the municipality. Municipal
administrative services are primarily funded through property taxes and other
local revenues, however, the administration also seeks special funding of
various types from time to time.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.033 PLANNING, ZONING, BUILDING INSPECTION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW.
   The municipality also provides services related to the maintenance,
development and improvement of property within the corporate limits, as well as
property within the jurisdictional limits of the Plan Commission, as defined
under Indiana statute. These services relate directly to the management and
maintenance of existing development (such as health and code inspections), as
well as the review, approval and management of new development (to protect
public health, safety and welfare, and protect local property values). Planning
and zoning services are primarily funded through property taxes, various forms
of service and permit fees, and other local revenues as part of the general
fund.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.034 MUNICIPAL STREET DEPARTMENT.
   The Municipal Street Department is responsible for protecting the integrity
of that portion of the local thoroughfare system which is not a part of the
state or federal highway systems. This would include all local thoroughfares,
collectors and streets, as designated by the Indiana Department of
Transportation. Specific services within this general responsibility would
include such services as: street improvements (capital), non-capital street
maintenance/re-paving (including small- and large-scale repairs), snow removal,
right of way mowing, and street sweeping. Municipal capital and non-capital
street services are performed on an as-needed basis and are managed by the
Board of Public Works, which assists in defining street project scope(s),
setting priorities between projects and managing the available funds to the
best advantage and best interests of the municipality as a whole.
Irregularities in weather or other environmental conditions have a significant
impact on the provision of, and demand for, municipal street services, which
the Board of Public Works assists in managing. The Street Department is funded
through a combination of funding sources, including property taxes and other
local revenues, as well as other state and local funds.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.035 STREET REPAIRS AND RECONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   The Street Department provides minor street repairs on a routine, as-
needed basis. Pot holes are a normal consequence of winter weather and the
Street Department makes an attempt to patch all streets regularly, within the
constraints of the budget. In addition, the Street Department periodically
plans and contracts for major street reconstruction projects. Due to the high
cost of major reconstruction projects, it is necessary for the Street
Department to plan such improvements well in advance, and generally in
conjunction with obtaining outside funding (from source other than property
taxes) for such projects. Approximately 30% of the total street re-paving for
the municipality annually is handled by city Street Department personnel, with
the remaining 70% being offered for public bid.
   (B)   To make the situation more complicated, the State Legislature and the
Administration often experience budget problems such as those that have
occurred in 2001-2002, and in some cases the state's solution to the state
budget problem is to withhold money from municipalities in some fashion. In
those cases, anticipated state revenues are not available for municipal
expenditure, which has a direct effect on the municipality's ability to perform
the obligated municipal services. These economic realities must be made a part
of the working pro forma of municipal officials in providing municipal
services.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.036 STREET SWEEPING.
   The Street Department is also responsible for sweeping streets to remove
debris of various types. The effort is made to sweep municipal streets during
non-winter months, with an anticipated annual goal of sweeping each street
approximately once per month within the constraints of the budget, personnel
and equipment available. The Street Department contracts with INDOT to sweep
the urban segments of state highways, such as SR19, in the incorporated area.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.037 SNOW REMOVAL.
   The Street Department provides snow removal services during winter months,
using a system of thoroughfare priorities where the major thoroughfares are
cleared first, and local streets cleared thereafter. Snow removal services
include both plowing and salt distribution. The Street Department attempts to
clear every street of any major snowfall, within the constraints of the budget,
personnel and equipment available.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.038 STREET LIGHTS.
   Street lights are not offered as a municipal service. Street lights have
been made available by the municipality on a limited basis in various locations
within the municipal limits, generally in the older developed areas, however,
modern development standards and policies of the municipality require the
developer to install lighting for all new developments. Street lights are,
therefore, not offered as a municipal service and are considered to be a
"developmental amenity" (the developer is required to install and the
homeowners' association maintains street lighting suitable to the development).
The municipality will, under certain limited circumstances, consider the
installation of street lights on a limited basis and in special situations
through a process administered by the Board of Public Works.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.039 STREET SIGNS.
   The municipality also provides and maintains street signs throughout the
incorporated area. The street signs provided by the municipality are
standardized signs which are consistent with state and federal guidelines
related to placement, visibility and safety. The municipal street signs are not
to be considered decorative signs and the municipality will not replace
decorative signs which are offered as developmental amenities. Maintenance and
replacement of street signs is undertaken on a planned, programmed basis under
the jurisdiction of the Board of Works and the municipal administration.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.040 TRASH REMOVAL.
   The municipality provides residential trash removal as a municipal service
of the Street Department. This municipal service is offered to residential
customers only. Retail business and industrial clients are not afforded trash
removal service. Trash service is generally paid through property taxes,
however, the municipality retains the right to levy additional user charges
directly to the residential users to supplement property tax funds used to
provide this service. The supplemental charges may be adjusted periodically to
reflect market/cost conditions. In addition, the municipality may alter the
trash collection policy from time to time by action of the City Council for the
purpose of addressing the parameters and costs of trash removal. In some cases,
municipalities levy additional charges for such services as heavy trash
removal, leaf composting, recycling, landfill fees or other special services,
which may be considered by the municipal authorities from time to time as part
of the normal course of business. It is understood by the city and its
leadership that trash removal is a municipal service which can easily be
isolated and converted from a "property tax revenue-based service" to a "user
charge" based service, if the public demand for such a change grew to a
sufficient level.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.041 SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL.
   (A)   Miami County has a solid waste service board which is mandated by
state law and which is responsible for services such as recycling, hazardous
waste removal, large item removal and other such solid waste services. The
functions of the solid waste board are funded entirely by service fees and are
not a part of the municipal services of the city. City and county residents all
pay solid waste user fees, which pays for these services.
   (B)   The city also pays for the services of a landfill as a municipal
service for disposal of collected trash. The landfill accepts the trash
collected from local households, but the landfill is not owned by the city. The
fees for this landfill service are paid through the property tax system of the
city, therefore, this municipal service is affected by annexation. The fees
associated with the operation of the landfill are outside of the authority of
the municipality and may be adjusted from time to time by the landfill owner.
The municipality retains the right to adjust any and all charges and fees
associated with such operations and/or services related hereto, however, at
this time the city uses property tax revenue streams to pay for these landfill
services.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.042 MUNICIPAL WATER UTILITY.
   (A)   The municipal wastewater utility provides access to water treatment,
distribution and disposal service to all properties within the corporate limits
of the municipality. In some cases, the property owners have elected not to
seek connection to the utility systems, and at this time, the municipality's
policy is to permit these customers to remain disconnected, so long as there is
no health or environmental violation.
   (B)   The policy of providing access to the water utility means that the
city has the necessary interceptor and trunk lines available to distribute
water to the developed property in the area, however, in some cases, the
individual service laterals to serve an individual parcel of land might not be
installed. There can be several reasons that the individual service lateral is
not installed, including a lack of interest in service on the part of the
larger neighborhood, a lack of sufficient developmental density necessary to
make the service lateral economically feasible, or a simple satisfaction on the
part of the property owner with the function of the current well on site.
   (C)   The policy of providing access to water utility service is completely
commensurate with the construction of the northwest water and sewer interceptor
project in 2001. In that project, Peru Utilities constructed major water and
sewer interceptor facilities with the design capacity sufficient to serve the
entire unincorporated area south of US24 and east of US31, and areas beyond.
Now that the interceptor is installed, Peru Utilities will extend sewer and
water service to any property owner or proposed development in the service area
which has access to these facilities, at the expense of the property owner.
Again, as stated above, there is no free lunch. While individual property
owners may have difficulty with this concept, it is standard practice on a
statewide basis for developers to pay for the cost of utility extensions to
their developments.
   (D)   The municipal water utility provides potable water service to
properties within the service area of the water utility, in many cases outside
of the corporate limits of the municipality. This policy states that the water
utility meets the parameters of providing water service to a property when a
municipal water distribution line is located within 300 lineal feet of the
nearest property line. The municipal water utility technically provides the
service of pumping water from the water source, treating the water to some
level, distributing the water into the system of municipal water lines, storing
the water for peak demand and fire protection purposes, and maintenance of the
production/distribution system, in its entirety. In some cases, property owners
have not connected their property to the municipal water system and use private
water sources (primarily shallow, private wells), instead. This decision was/is
made by the property owner, generally in accordance with the development
standards of the property at the time of the original development.
   (E)   The municipal water system extends beyond the corporate limits of the
municipality and water service is provided to property in unincorporated areas.
The water utility is administered by a Utility Service Board which is
responsible for recommending user charges to the legislative body of the
municipality for implementation. The legislative body of the municipality may
consider changes to the user charge system to reflect special situations, as
well as changes in policy with regard to the type of customer and/or the
location (inside or outside of the corporate limits of the municipality).
   (F)   The policy of providing municipal water service to any property -
either inside or outside the corporate limits of the municipality - is not to
be construed as being "free" in any respect, and is certainly not covered by
property taxes. The water utility is supported by a system of user charges
which is administered by the Utility Board, in cooperation with the
municipality. In addition, the current development policies and standards of
the municipality require the developer to pay any capital costs associated with
the extension of water distribution facilities into any proposed development.
The only major capital expenditures covered by the water utility (outside of
the service extensions afforded by the developers) is the capital cost of
constructing and maintaining water pumping, treatment and storage facilities,
which are paid either directly or indirectly through the utility's user charge
system. The cost of extending distribution lines and of connecting to the water
system is to be borne by the property owner/developer.
   (G)   Property tax revenues are not a part of the water utility budget. The
water utility sets a system of user charges which are generally paid on a
monthly basis. Those user charges cover both the capital and operating costs of
the water utility. In addition to monthly service charges, the water utility
may consider and/or establish a system of fees for other services such as
various connection fees, and/or supplemental fees for special facilities
installed to meet the needs/demands of various customers. The water utility is
also subject to regulatory requirements which are administered at the state
and/or federal level. As such, the system of fees and charges must be adjusted
from time to time to remain current with regulatory and other requirements.
   (H)   With regard to annexation, there are several t issues related to the
availability of water utility service. First, the only way in which residents
of the unincorporated area can enjoy municipal water service is through the
population and development densities afforded by the city. Therefore, it is the
position of the city that there is no legitimate argument that citizens in the
unincorporated area are somehow entitled to selectively choose which municipal
services they want and which they do not want, especially since such selections
are not afforded the citizens of Peru.
   (I)   Second, the water utility service is made available outside of the
corporate limits, but that service is not "free." The capital and operating
costs/fees are charged to every property owner connecting to the water system,
through the utility's user charge systems.
   (J)   Finally, the city has the option to revise its utility system to
reflect customers inside and outside the corporate limits of the municipality.
These differential charges must be “fair and equitable” in accordance with
applicable laws and regulations, but there is no systemic prohibition against
charging customers outside the corporate limits higher rates than those inside
the corporate limits for a number of valid reasons. The Utility Board and the
city will determine when and if such adjustments are made to the revenue
structure of the water utility.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.043 MUNICIPAL WASTEWATER UTILITY.
   (A)   The municipal wastewater utility provides access to wastewater
collection, treatment and disposal service to all properties within the
corporate limits of the municipality. In some cases, the property owners have
elected not to seek connection to the utility systems, and at this time, the
municipality's policy is to permit these customers to remain disconnected, so
long as there is no health or environmental violation.
   (B)   The policy of providing access to the wastewater utility means that
the city has the necessary interceptor and trunk lines available to collect and
transport wastewater to the sewage treatment plant, however, in some cases, the
individual collector sewer to serve an individual parcel of land might not be
installed. There can be several reasons that the individual collector sewer is
not installed, including a lack of interest in service on the part of the
larger neighborhood, a lack of sufficient developmental density necessary to
make the collector sewer economically feasible, or a simple satisfaction on the
part of the property owner with the function of the current wastewater facility
on site.
   (C)   The policy of providing access to wastewater utility service is
completely commensurate with the construction of the northwest water and sewer
interceptor project in 2001. In that project, Peru Utilities constructed major
water and sewer interceptor facilities with the design capacity sufficient to
serve the entire unincorporated area south of US24 and east of US31, and areas
beyond. Now that the interceptor is installed, Peru Utilities will extend sewer
and water service to any property owner or proposed development in the service
area which has access to these facilities, at the expense of the property
owner. Again, as stated above, there is no free lunch. While individual
property owners may have difficulty with this concept, it is standard practice
on a statewide basis for developers to pay for the cost of utility extensions
to their developments.
   (D)   This policy further states that the municipality meets the parameters
of providing complete municipal wastewater service to a property when a
municipal sewer is located within 300 lineal feet of the nearest property line.
In some cases, where property owners have not connected their property to the
municipal sewer system and use private wastewater disposal facilities
(primarily septic tanks), instead, the owner may suddenly choose to have
municipal utility service. In that case, if a line currently exists within 300
lineal feet of the property, the service is deemed to exist for purposes of
these policies. This decision is based purely upon the owner's election and the
development standards of the original property development. The municipal
wastewater system extends beyond the corporate limits of the municipality and
municipal wastewater service is provided to property in unincorporated areas.
   (E)   The wastewater utility is administered by a Utility Service Board
which is responsible for developing and recommending a system of user charges
to the legislative body of the municipality for implementation. These user
charges must cover the cost of both capital and operations of the wastewater
utility. According to the “Speedway” decision, the Utility Board is allowed to
set charges for unincorporated area customers differently from those inside the
corporate limits of the city. The legislative body of the municipality may
consider changes to the user charge system to reflect special situations, as
well as changes in policy with regard to the type of customer and/or the
location (inside or outside of the corporate limits of the municipality).
   (F)   The policy of providing municipal wastewater service is also not to be
construed as being "free" in any respect, and the costs of such services are
certainly not covered by property taxes. The wastewater utility is supported by
a system of user charges which is administered by the Utility Board to cover
both capital and operating expenses, in cooperation with the municipality.
Property tax revenues are not a part of the wastewater utility budget. The
development standards of the municipality are such that the capital cost of
wastewater utility services is afforded by the property owner/developer as part
of the development of the property. In addition to monthly service charges, the
wastewater utility may consider and/or establish a system of fees for other
services such as various connection fees, and/or supplemental fees for special
facilities installed to meet the needs/demands of various customers. The
wastewater utility is also subject to regulatory requirements which are
administered at the state and/or federal level. As such, the system of fees and
charges must be adjusted from time to time to remain current with regulatory
and other requirements.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.044 STORMWATER UTILITY.
   The city is in the process of developing a stormwater utility in accordance
with state and federal regulatory requirements. The purpose of this stormwater
utility is to manage combined sewer overflows which occur during wet weather,
generating pollutant discharge into rivers and streams into the area. The
stormwater utility services are confined solely to the area of combined sewers
in the older, urbanized areas of Peru. Therefore, services of the stormwater
utility will not be extended into any annexation area because no combined
sewers will be allowed in any further development.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.045 MUNICIPAL ELECTRIC UTILITY.
   The municipal electric utility provides electrical service to all developed
properties within its service territory, both inside and outside the city
limits and as such is not affected by annexation.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.046 DRAINAGE.
   (A)   The municipality does not offer drainage services, except through
development standards, and/or developmental amenities. In cases of recent
subdivisions, zoning and development standards require the developer to provide
on-site stormwater collection and retention for the subdivision/ development in
order to provide drainage services.
   (B)   Generally, county authorities are responsible for maintaining the
county's system of drains and ditches (with such services being paid through
specific levies by the county).
   (C)   In those portions of the municipality which were developed under
historic development standards, there is a system of storm sewers which the
municipality maintains, however, this storm sewer system was developed under
the development parameters operative at the time of original construction and
the storm sewer system is not extended into newer developments. Recent changes
in the state regulatory structure at IDEM have begun to require that
municipalities create a separate stormwater utility to manage stormwater issues
and policies for the municipality. The stormwater utility for the city has only
recently been initiated, however, the preliminary role of the stormwater
utility is to manage the discharge of collected urban stormwater to the surface
waters of Indiana, rather than to expand the stormwater collection system. Due
to the heavy burden of state and federal regulations, the basic initiative for
the stormwater utility would be categorized as a policy of reducing stormwater
discharge, rather than expanding the storm sewer system. This goal is
accomplished by requiring new subdivisions to retain stormwater onsite, as
stated above.
(Ord. 24-2002, passed 8-5-02)
§ 157.047 ITEMS WHICH ARE NOT MUNICIPAL SERVICES.
   (A)   This section of the municipal services statement is offered for
illustrative purposes only and is not to be considered a formal part of the
description of municipal services. Instead, this section of the document is
offered solely in an attempt to answer frequently asked questions in this
regard.
   (B)   The municipality does not offer sidewalks as a municipal service.
Sidewalks are a part of the development standards of the individual
developments and are reviewed as part of the zoning and development process.
Large-tract residential parcels generally are not required to install
sidewalks, for example, while small tract residential subdivisions are
generally required to install sidewalks and/or other pathways for walking. The
growth policy of the municipality is that sidewalks are offered as a
development amenity and not a municipal service.
   (C)   The municipality also does not offer street lights as a municipal
service. Street lighting is a developmental amenity which is considered part of
the planning, zoning and development review process. Different types of
developments independently choose to install vastly different types of
lighting, based on the land use and other parameters, and the municipality has
no intentions of standardizing the lighting requirements of various forms of
development as a result of growth and/or annexation. For example, some
developments install decorative lighting as a developmental amenity, which is
beautiful but terribly expensive to repair/replace. Some other developments
place the burden of street lighting on the property owners by requiring the
property owners to install yard lights on their private property, which would
be extremely difficult for the city to access for repair/replacement purposes.
Commercial subdivisions provide an entirely different form of street lighting,
for entirely different purposes. It is not reasonable for the city to interfere
in these private decisions by superimposing additional standards for street
lighting.
   (D)   The municipality also does not offer curbs and gutters or other
roadway amenities as a municipal service. The primary focus of the city is to
assure that the street facility itself is properly constructed to withstand the
pounding of traffic. In some cases, (i.e., commercial subdivisions) curbs and
gutters are not appropriate to support the development, for drainage purposes.
As above, items such as curbs and gutters are development amenities which vary
on the basis of the development and are reviewed within the planning/zoning
review process and/or negotiated with the developer.
   (E)   There are other items which fall into this classification. Generally
speaking, the municipality acknowledges that various developments are
undertaken to address various markets and the idiosyncracies of consumers
within those markets. In order to address these idiosyncracies, the developer
offers differing developmental amenities to attract customers. In addition,
from time to time, the city changes its regulatory standards with respect to
development standards, based on new land use problems, issues and findings, and
new policies by the plan commission. As these development standards evolve over
time, the result is that subdivisions which were developed during that period
have slightly different development standards, which are not to be mistaken for
some form of municipal service. With that understanding, it is not the policy
of the municipality to undertake the task of standardizing all of these
development standards and amenities as a result of annexation or municipal
growth.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 158.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   In order to promote the educational, cultural and general welfare of
the citizens of Peru and to ensure the harmonious and orderly growth and
development of the municipality; to maintain established residential
neighborhoods in danger of having their distinctiveness destroyed; to enhance
property values and attract new residents; to ensure the viability of the
traditional downtown area and to enhance tourism within the City of Peru; it is
deemed essential by the City of Peru that qualities relating to its history and
harmonious outward appearance of its structures be preserved. This purpose is
advanced through the restoration and preservation of historic areas and
buildings, the construction of compatible new buildings where appropriate, and
the maintenance and insurance of compatibility in regards to style, form,
proportion, texture, and material between historic buildings and those of
contemporary design.
   (B)   It is the intention of the City of Peru through this chapter to
preserve and protect historic and architecturally worthy buildings, structures,
sites, monuments, streetscapes, and neighborhoods which impart a distinct
aesthetic quality to the city and serve as visible reminders of its historic
heritage.

      CLASSIFICATIONS.
         (a)   OUTSTANDING. An “O” classification means that the property has
sufficient historic or architectural significance that is listed, or is
eligible for individual listing, in the National Register of Historic Places.
OUTSTANDING resources can be of local, state, or national importance.
         (b)   NOTABLE. An “N” classification means that the property does not
merit the outstanding rating, but it is still above average in its importance.
A NOTABLE structure may be eligible for the National Register.
         (c)   CONTRIBUTING. A “C” classification means the property is at
least 40 years old, but does not meet the criteria for an “O” or “N”
classification. Such resources are important to the density or continuity of
the area’s historic fabric. CONTRIBUTING structures can be listed in the
National Register only as part of a historic district.
         (d)   NON-CONTRIBUTING. Property classified as “NC” is not included in
an inventory unless it is located within the boundaries of a historic district.
Such properties may be less than 50 years old, or they may be older structures

§ 158.03 HISTORIC DISTRICTS; CONSERVATION DISTRICTS; GUIDELINES.
   (A)   (1)   All recommendations for the establishment of a historic district
shall be in the form of a written report and must be based on the criteria
outlined in this section. A recommendation for establishing a historic district
may be initiated from either of the following two sources:
         (a)   Based on its survey, the Commission may draw and submit historic
district maps for Common Council approval.
         (b)   Owners of property in fee simple wishing to establish a historic
district which includes their property may petition the Commission to consider
drawing and submitting a map or maps of the property to the Common Council for
its approval.
      (2)   The Commission may establish in its rules criteria to be met before
it considers a petition.
   (B)   Conservation districts. The Commission may recommend, and the Common
Council may provide that the establishment of a historic district shall occur
in two phases. During the first phase, which continues for a period of three
years from the date the ordinance is adopted, a certificate of appropriateness
is required for the following activities: the demolition of any building; the
moving of any building; and any new construction of a principal building or
accessory building or structure subject to view from a public way.
      (1)   At the expiration of the initial three-year period, the first phase
of a conservation district continues and the second phase does not become
effective if a majority of the property owners in the district object to the
Commission, in writing, to the requirement that certificates of appropriateness
be issued for the following activities:
         (a)   A conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of historic
buildings by additions, construction, alteration, or maintenance involving
exterior color changes;
         (b)   A change in walls and fences or construction of walls and
fences, if along public ways;
         (c)   A conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of non-historic
buildings subject to view from a public way by additions, reconstruction,
alteration, or maintenance involving exterior color change.
      (2)   The objections of a majority of the property owners must be
received by the Commission not earlier than 180 days or later than 60 days
before the third anniversary of the adoption of the ordinance.
   (C)   Commission preparation of historic district maps. In order to
establish a historic district, the Commission shall first prepare a map
describing the district in accordance with the following:
      (1)   The map shall be based on a survey conducted by the Commission
which identifies historic buildings, structures, and sites located within the
city.
      (2)   A district may be limited to the boundaries of a property
containing a single building, structure, or site.
      (3)   The map may divide the district into primary and secondary areas as
follows:
         (a)   Primary area. The principal area of historic and architectural
significance.
         (b)   Secondary area. An area adjacent to a primary area which has a
visual relationship to the primary area and could affect the preservation of
the primary area. The purpose of designating a secondary area is to assure its
compatibility and harmony with an adjacent primary area.
   (D)   (1)   The Commission shall classify and designate on the map all
buildings, structures, and sites within each historic district described on the
map. Buildings, structures, and sites shall be classified as historic or non-
historic. Historic buildings, structures, and sites must possess identified
historic or architectural merit of a degree warranting their preservation. The
Commission shall further classify and designate all buildings and structures
within a proposed historic district as follows:
         (a)   Outstanding;
         (b)   Notable; or
         (c)   Contributing.
      (2)   Non-historic buildings, structures, and sites are those not
classified on the map as historic. In lieu of other classifications, the
Commission may devise its own system of further classification of historic
buildings, structures, and sites.
   (E)   Common Council approval of maps of historic districts. Before a
historic district is established and the building classifications take effect,
the map setting forth the district’s boundaries and building classifications
must be submitted to, and approved in an ordinance by, the Common Council.
   (F)   Recording the fact of designation. The map establishing boundaries of
a historic district may be recorded in the Office of the Miami County Recorder.
(Ord. 2, 2009, passed 2-2-09)
§ 158.04 INTERIM PROTECTION.
   (A)   When submitting a map to the Common Council under §
158.03, the Commission may declare one or more buildings or structures that are
classified and designated as historic on the map to be under interim
protection.
   (B)   Not more than two working days after declaring a building, structure,
or site to be under interim protection under this section, the Commission
shall, by personal delivery or first class mail, provide the owner or occupant
of the building, structure or site with a written notice of the declaration.
The written notice must:
      (1)   Cite the authority of the Commission to put the building,
structure, or site under interim protection under this section;
      (2)   Explain the effect of putting the building, structure, or site
under interim protection; and
      (3)   Indicate that the interim protection is temporary.
   (C)   A building or structure put under interim protection under division
(A) above remains under interim protection until the map is:
      (1)   Submitted to; and

this section:
      (1)   The building, structure, or site may not be demolished or moved;
and
      (2)   The exterior appearance of the building, structure, or site may not
be conspicuously changed by:
         (a)   Addition;
         (b)   Reconstruction; or
         (c)   Alteration.
   (E)   The Commission may approve a certificate of appropriateness at any
time during the period of interim protection, provided the proposed change
meets the criteria for considering effect of actions on historic buildings in §
158.33 and any proposed preservation guidelines prepared for the building,
structure, or site, but the certificate of appropriateness shall have no
effect, and no action may be taken pursuant thereto, unless the map including
the building, structure or site is approved by the Common Council.
(Ord. 2, 2009, passed 2-2-09)
§ 158.05 VISUAL COMPATIBILITY.
   (A)   For new construction, contemporary design, and non-historic buildings.
To preserve and encourage the integrity of historic buildings, structures,
sites, monuments, streetscapes, and neighborhoods and to ensure their
compatibility with any new work, the construction of a new building or
structure, and the moving, reconstruction, alteration, color change, major
maintenance, or repair conspicuously affecting the external appearance of any
non-historic building, structure, or appurtenance within the primary area must
be generally of a design, form, proportion, mass, configuration, building
material, texture, color, and location on a lot compatible with other buildings
in the historic district and with places to which it is visually related.
   (B)   Criteria for considering visual compatibility within historic primary
areas. Within the primary area of a historic district, new buildings,
structures, as well as buildings, structures, and appurtenances that are moved,
reconstructed, materially altered, repaired, or changed in color, must be
visually compatible with buildings and places to which they are visually
related generally in terms of the following visual compatibility factors:
      (1)   Height. The height of proposed buildings must be visually
compatible with adjacent buildings.
      (2)   Proportion of building’s front facade. The relationship of the
width of a building to the height of the front elevation must be visually
compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related.
      (3)   Proportion of openings within the facility. The relationship of the
width of the windows to the height of windows in a building must be visually
compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related.
      (4)   Relationship of solids to voids in front facades. The relationship
of solids to voids in the front facade of a building must be visually
compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related.
      (5)   Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The relationship of a
building to the open space between it and adjoining buildings must be visually
compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related.
      (6)   Rhythm of entrances and porch projections. The relationship of
entrances and porch projections of a building to sidewalks must be visually
compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related.
      (7)   Relationship of materials, texture, and color. The relationship of
the materials, texture, and color of the facade of a building must be visually
compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related.
      (8)   Roof shapes. The roof shape of a building must be visually
compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related.
      (9)   Wall of continuity. Appurtenances of a building or site, such as
walls, wrought iron fences, evergreen landscape masses, and building facades,
must form cohesive walls of enclosure along the street, if necessary to ensure
visual compatibility of the building to the buildings and places to which it is
visually related.
      (10)   Scale of the building. The size of a building, and the building
mass of a building in relation to open spaces, windows, door openings, porches,
and balconies must be visually compatible with the buildings and places to
which it is visually related.

such a building or structure, including stone walls, fences, light fixtures,
steps, paving, and signs may be moved, reconstructed, altered, or maintained
only in a manner that will preserve the historical and architectural character
of the building, structure, or appurtenance.
   (B)   A historic building may be relocated to another site only if it is
shown that preservation on its current site is inconsistent with division (A)
above.
(Ord. 2, 2009, passed 2-2-09)
§ 158.07 APPEAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   The purpose of this section is to preserve historic buildings that are
important to the education, culture, traditions, and economic values of the
city and to afford the city, historical organizations, property owners, and
other interested persons the opportunity to acquire or to arrange for the
preservation of these buildings.
   (B)   If the Commission denies the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness for the demolition of a building, structure, or site, a
demolition permit may be issued by other agencies and a building, structure, or
site may be demolished, but only after the property owner has demonstrated to
the Commission that the historic building, structure, or site is incapable of
earning an economic return on its value, as appraised by a licensed real estate
appraiser.
   (C)   Notice of the proposed demolition must be given for a period fixed by
the Commission, based on the Commission’s classification on the approved map,
but not less than 60 days nor more than one year. Notice must be posted on the
premises of the building or structure proposed for demolition in a location
clearly visible from the street. In addition, notice must be published in a
newspaper of general local circulation at least three times before demolition,
with the first publication not more than 15 days after the application for a
permit to demolish is filed, and the final publication at least 15 days before
the date of the permit.
   (D)   The Commission may approve a certificate of appropriateness at any
time during the notice period under division (C) above. If the certificate of

the applicable requirements established under state statute for buildings
generally so as to prevent the loss of historic material and the deterioration
of important character defining details and features.
   (B)   Ordinary repairs and maintenance. Nothing in this section shall be
construed so as to prevent the ordinary repairs and maintenance of any
building, structure, or site, provided that such repairs or maintenance do not
result in a conspicuous change in the design, form, proportion, mass,
configuration, building material, texture, color, location, or external visual
appearance of any structure, or part thereof.
(Ord. 2, 2009, passed 2-2-09)
§ 158.09 RELATIONSHIP WITH ZONING DISTRICTS.
   Zoning districts lying within the boundaries of the historic district are
subject to regulations for both the zoning district and the historic district.

construction date than the original;
   (D)   The texture, material, color, style, and detailing of the building,
structure, site or appurtenance;
   (E)   The continued preservation and protection of original or otherwise
significant structure, material, and ornamentation;
   (F)   The relationship of buildings, structures, appurtenances, or
architectural features similar to one within the same historic district,
including for primary areas, visual compatibility as defined in
158.05(B); and

DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR THE DOWNTOWN HISTORIC DISTRICT
§ 158.40 INTRODUCTION AND MISSION STATEMENT.
   (A)   Introduction. These guidelines were created by Historic Preservation
Committee, which is a body of five people, appointed by the Mayor, to protect
the historic architecture in the City of Peru.
      (1)   The Historic Preservation Committee meets this goal in several
ways:
         (a)   Educates the public about the importance of historic buildings
and preserving them.
         (b)   Acts as a resource to building owners who would like to make
improvements to their buildings.
         (c)   Creates local historic districts with attached design guidelines
to preserve the historic character of the downtown and residential areas.
      (2)   When the city’s historic buildings were built, basic design
principles (such as texture, color, rhythm, and pattern) were used to make the
commercial areas and residential neighborhoods a cohesive, yet unique, place to
live, work and play.
      (3)   These Design Guidelines will follow the same design principles, and
aid those rehabilitating historic buildings and constructing new buildings by
identifying desirable aesthetic qualities for Downtown Peru.
   (B)   Mission Statement of the Peru Historic Preservation Committee.
      (1)   Preserve historic structures, architecture, streetscapes and
neighborhoods.
      (2)   Promote the adaptive reuse of the surrounding environment through
planning, preservation and education.
      (3)   To recognize preservation efforts to encourage community support in
ongoing historic preservation endeavors.

§ 158.41 HISTORIC REHABILITATION TAX CREDIT.
   The federal government has created an incentive program to assist owners of
historic properties located in National Register Districts. Called the Federal
Rehabilitation Tax Credit, the program provides a 20% federal income tax credit
to the owners of historic properties that undertake a substantial
rehabilitation of their property. Generally speaking, the property must
contribute to the National Register District, and the rehabilitation must cost
more than $5,000 or more than that adjusted valuation of the property
assessment. For more information visit: http://www.in.Rov/dnr/historic/368Q.htm
(Ord. 14, 2011, passed 10-3-11)
§ 158.42 DESIGN REVIEW PROCESS: HOW IT WORKS.
   (A)   Building owners need to obtain and complete a Certificate of
Appropriateness (COA) application prior to making exterior changes to buildings
in the Downtown Peru Local Historic District.
   (B)   Before planning a project to the exterior of a building, the owner
should contact the Building and Zoning Department. It is beneficial to contact
the Building and Zoning Department before an owner begins project planning for
several reasons:
      (1)   The Building and Zoning Department can help assess if a Certificate
of Appropriateness (COA) is necessary for the project.
      (2)   If a COA is needed, the Building and Zoning Department can provide
the application.
      (3)   The Building and Zoning Department can assist in the planning phase
to make sure the project is appropriate to the historic character of the
building.
   (C)   The COA application is simple to complete, and the Building and Zoning
Department is available to help.

(Ord. 14, 2011, passed 10-3-11)
§ 158.45 AWNINGS AND CANOPIES.
   An awning is a sloped projection from a building facade, historically metal
with a cloth covering, while a canopy is a flat projection.
   (A)   Design guidelines.
      (1)   Awnings shall be made of canvas or other durable fabric.
      (2)   Unless deteriorated beyond repair, metal awnings that have
historical significance shall be retained.
      (3)   The color of the awning shall complement the color of the building,
and patterns shall be simple. Themed designs and backlights are prohibited.
      (4)   The positioning of awnings shall be designed to complement other
facade elements, such as windows and doors, and shall not detract from the
integrity of such elements.
   (B)   Helpful tips.
      (1)   Use awnings to prevent harmful UV rays from entering a storefront
or upper floors.
      (2)   Awnings help protect customers and pedestrians from the elements.
      (3)   Awnings provide a great place for signage for a business.
      (4)   Use awnings to add color to the building.
(Ord. 14, 2011, passed 10-3-11)
§ 158.46 CORNICES.
   (A)   Cornices are an important element to historic commercial buildings
because they form a visual “cap” on a building, can give a building a unique
identity, and contribute to the horizontal alignment of a streetscape.
Generally, cornices are made of brick, metal or wood.
   (B)   Design guidelines.
      (1)   Retain and repair existing original cornices.
      (2)   When a cornice is deteriorated beyond repair, or has been removed,
the new cornice shall match the original size proportion.
      (3)   When it is cost-prohibitive to replicate the missing or irreparable
original cornice, a paint job or simpler design will be considered.
(Ord. 14, 2011, passed 10-3-11)
§ 158.47 DOORS.
   (A)   The door or entrance to a historic building can be an important
character-defining feature. For commercial buildings, a door is also essential
to the image for attracting customers into the store. The removal of an
original door, the relocation of a recessed central or side entry, or a change
in the glass and wood proportions could destroy a vital design aspect of the
building.
   (B)   Design guidelines.
      (1)   Retain the size, proportion and detailing of the original doorway
opening.
      (2)   Retain and repair original doors.
      (3)   If a door is missing, has deteriorated beyond repair, or is not
energy efficient the replacement door shall match the original in size and
design as much as possible. If documentation is not found, new doors and storm
doors shall be appropriate to the style and period of the building.
      (4)   Choose storm doors that complement, reveal and visually enhance the
historic door of the building.
      (5)   Doors that are generally used for residential buildings shall not
be considered.
(Ord. 14, 2011, passed 10-3-11)
§ 158.48 WINDOWS.
   (A)   Windows, besides providing ventilation and light, are crucial visual
elements to the facade of a building. They are often linked to certain
architectural styles, time periods, building practices, and craftsmanship.
Window materials, size, configuration, shape and detailing all contribute to
the appearance of a building. In addition, the alignment, pattern, and spacing
of windows is an important unifying element in the historic district.
   (B)   If the original windows are retained and retrofitted, it may be
cheaper than purchasing and installing new windows. Original sash can be routed
and new glass installed. Window companies now routinely make custom sizes for
preservation purposes. An owner may want to consider traditional storm windows
to improve thermal efficiency.
   (C)   Display windows, transoms and upper story windows all add to the
streetscape’s rhythm and patterns. Even horizontal elements such as lintels and
sills tie a block of buildings together. An important idea to remember is that
upper story windows can create an appearance of vitality and use, even if a
second floor is not being used.
   (D)   Design guidelines.
      (1)   Original windows, hardware, hoods, lintels, pediments, sash,
shutters, and sills shall be preserved. If damaged beyond repair, a
reproduction of the original design shall be allowed.
      (2)   Retain original window openings, pattern and size.
      (3)   Transom windows may be of clear, tinted, beveled, etched, or
stained glass.
      (4)   Decorative windows and windows made of stained, prism, beveled,
cut, or other art glass shall be retained.
      (5)   Display windows shall be transparent. Blinds and interior shutters
may be installed for office use.
      (6)   Shutters will be considered on a case by case basis. Shutters shall
be the exact size of window opening.
      (7)   Storm windows shall have minimal visual impact on the historic
windows. This can be achieved by painting the window, matching the location of
the rails, and not covering detail.
      (8)   If a window has deteriorated beyond repair, window replacements
shall match the original or the style of the building in proportion, pane
configuration, profile, texture and color.
      (9)   True divided lights are encouraged.
(Ord. 14, 2011, passed 10-3-11)
§ 158.49 FOUNDATIONS.
   (A)   Foundations found above ground level are often of rough or cut stone
or brick. Some have windows or grills to provide light in the basement or crawl
space or to create circulation.
   (B)   Design guidelines.
      (1)   New concrete block/concrete foundations shall be faced to blend
with surrounding buildings.
      (2)   Painting and stuccoing historic foundation walls is prohibited.
(Ord. 14, 2011, passed 10-3-11)
§ 158.50 GUTTERS AND DOWNSPOUTS.
   (A)   Gutters and downspouts serve the important purpose of collecting and
channeling water away from a building and preventing moisture damage. Besides
serving an essential function, gutter systems also add to the aesthetics of a
historic building. Gutter systems may be constructed of historic building
materials, a part of a unique design, or have their own design characteristics.
Gutters usually fall into two categories, including hung or built-in. Often,
gutters were built in, and some even formed the crown molding of a building. It
is very important to remove debris from the gutters on a regular basis. Make
sure that the downspouts are secure and that the water is running away from the
building and into a street or alley.
   (B)   Design guidelines.
      (1)   Repair gutters and downspouts. If gutters and/or downspouts have
deteriorated beyond repair, the new materials shall match the appearance of the
original as closely as possible.
      (2)   New gutters and downspouts shall not cover important architectural
features.
(Ord. 14, 2011, passed 10-3-11)
§ 158.51 MASONRY; CLEANING.
   (A)   Abrasive cleaning methods, although a quick way to achieve results,
will cause severe damage by eroding the protective surface of a masonry
building. Once the protective surface is removed, the exposed material will be
highly susceptible to rapid deterioration. It is suggested that professionals
be consulted if building materials need to be cleaned.
   (B)   Design guidelines.
      (1)   Use the gentlest means possible cleaning a building. A test patch
will determine the cleaner’s effects on the material.
      (2)   Never sandblast or use other strong chemicals on masonry or wood
buildings.
      (3)   Protect surrounding buildings that are not being cleaned.
(Ord. 14, 2011, passed 10-3-11)
§ 158.52 MASONRY; TUCK POINTING.
   (A)   Lime-based mortars are found in historic masonry buildings. Portland
cement, although commonly used today, is destructive to historic masonry
because Portland cement mortar is much harder than the masonry brick or stone.
Therefore, when the wall expands and contracts with changes in temperature, the
bricks “give” rather than the mortar. The visual impact is also an important
consideration as Portland cement mortars take on a different color than
masonry. Another consideration is the fine craftsmanship that is found in the
joint profiles of historic masonry buildings.
   (B)   Design guideline. Materials used in re-pointing shall match the
appearance and properties of the original as closely as possible. This includes
the color of the mortar and the joint type.
(Ord. 14, 2011, passed 10-3-11)
§ 158.53 PAINTING.
   (A)   The Building and Zoning Department has an approved paint pallet from
which owners can work when selecting a paint scheme for their property.
   (B)   Design guideline. Unless it has been painted before or it is necessary
to protect the historic materials from further deterioration, painting a
masonry building is not permitted. Painting unpainted masonry adds a long-term
maintenance item.
(Ord. 14, 2011, passed 10-3-11)
§ 158.54 ROOFING.
   (A)   Roofing is an important character- defining feature of a historic
building. Any change in the patterns, forms, color and texture of a roof can
dramatically alter the look and feel of a historic building. Unfortunately,
roofing systems, by design wear, out and require replacement. Failure to remedy
leaks can cause deterioration of other building materials and even cause the
loss of a building. For this reason, the importance of a weather-tight roof
shall not be underestimated. A weather-tight roof, however, does not have to
compromise historic integrity.
   (B)   Because most of the roofs in downtown Peru are flat roofs, and cannot
be seen from the ground, modern materials, such as a rubber roofing system, may
be permissible. However, if roofing can be seen from the ground, such as a
mansard roof, then great care shall be taken to protect the size, scale, form,
pattern, texture and colors of the historic materials.
   (C)   Design guidelines.
      (1)   Keep the original roof pitch, form and shape.
      (2)   Retain features and details that give a roof its historic character
such as chimneys, cupolas/towers, and dormer windows.
      (3)   Before undertaking a wholesale replacement of a slate or tile roof,
fix or replace flashings or valleys.
      (4)   If a historic roof system must be replaced, retain character by
matching the size, scale, form, patterns, texture and color of the historic
materials.
      (5)   Temporary stabilization materials shall be applied without damaging
historic materials.
(Ord. 14, 2011, passed 10-3-11)
§ 158.55 SIDING.
   (A)   The materials used in the construction of buildings in the historic
district reflect the time period and local availability of materials. For this
reason, these historic building materials contribute greatly to the historic
character of the buildings and the entire district and shall be retained. The
primary historic building materials found in downtown Peru include brick,
glazed brick and limestone.
   (B)   A good general rule when choosing wall materials is that nothing will
be more appropriate than the original materials. Adding aluminum or vinyl
generally requires covering up or removing decorative molding or trim and makes
projecting details like doors and windows become flush or inset. This takes
away the dimension of the building and makes it look flat, which causes a
negative impact to not only the building, but also to the historic district.
   (C)   Design guidelines.
      (1)   Original materials and historic siding shall be preserved and
repaired.
      (2)   If the existing historic materials or siding is irreparable,
deteriorated or missing, the substitute materials shall match the original in
properties, proportion and appearance.
      (3)   The use of artificial siding is prohibited in the district.
      (4)   Siding shall be installed only without irreversibly damaging,
removing or obscuring the architectural features and historic materials of a
building and shall cover only areas that were originally covered by siding.
(Ord. 14, 2011, passed 10-3-11)
§ 158.56 MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   Historic buildings, structures, and sites shall be maintained to meet
the applicable requirements established under state statute for buildings
generally so as to prevent the loss of historic material and the deterioration
of important character defining details and features.
   (B)   Maintenance tips.
      (1)   Periodically inspect the building or structure for water and other
problems.
      (2)   Try to correct the source of any problem right away, not just the
symptoms. This will save time, money and effort in the long run.
      (3)   Keep property in good repair.
(Ord. 14, 2011, passed 10-3-11)
§ 158.57 NEGLECT.
   (A)   If a building in the Historic District suffers from any neglect from
the owner, such as broken windows, doors or canopies, the responsible party
will be notified in writing that repairs must be made in a timely manner.
   (B)   The city will follow adopted building code guidelines when dealing
with this section.
(Ord. 14, 2011, passed 10-3-11)
§ 158.58 DEMOLITION.
   Demolition refers to the substantial deterioration or complete or
substantial removal or destruction of any structure. The loss of a historic
building that contributes to the district will negatively impact the visual
quality and cohesiveness of the area. All demolition within the Historic
District must be reviewed by the City Building Department.
(Ord. 14, 2011, passed 10-3-11)
§ 158.59 NEW CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   When new construction occurs in historic districts, the impact of the
new building or structure can be positive or detrimental to the visual
cohesiveness of the area. A new building or structure that does not fit into
the district can be conspicuous, intrusive, and detrimental to the visual
harmony of the historic district. The importance of compatibility and context,
including the concepts of massing (building shape), scale (building size),
materials and architectural features, shall not be underestimated. The common
linkages between buildings and settings that give a historic district its
character are very important. A wide range of compatible forms and materials
that do not destroy the cohesiveness of a district are available.
   (B)   New buildings may have individual character. There may also come a
time when additional space is necessary in a historic building. Additions to
historic buildings are not discouraged; however, they shall be constructed in a
manner that does not damage or destroy historic materials or features, nor
shall it affect the historic character of the original building. For example,
one can minimize the effects on the historic materials and features of a
building by constructing the addition on a secondary or rear facade, reducing
the size of the addition, or linking the addition via a connector.
   (C)   Design guidelines.
      (1)   Incorporate into the new design similar elements and materials
across building facades, building heights, building widths (no wider or
narrower than surrounding buildings), roof forms and pitch, orientation, spaces
between buildings, and lot setbacks found in surrounding buildings and their
environment.
      (2)   The new design shall incorporate the horizontal and vertical
alignment and patterns of the surrounding buildings.
      (3)   The proportions of glass, sizes of openings, and location of
entrances shall be consistent with existing buildings nearby.
      (4)   Ornamentation that contributes to the rhythm and alignment of the
surrounding range of buildings shall be considered.
      (5)   In commercial buildings, maintain the distinction between first and
other floors.
      (6)   New buildings shall be of the same quality as the surrounding
buildings. New buildings shall be faced with traditional building materials
found in the district, such as brick or limestone.
      (7)   Preserve historic views.
      (8)   Additions shall be constructed so as to minimize the damage,
destruction or effects on the historic materials and elements of the original
building and its site.
      (9)   Distinctions shall be apparent between an addition and the original
building.
      (10)   The addition shall be related in form, height and proportion to
the original building. It shall also be compatible with the original building
in materials and scale.
   (D)   Tips for filling out a COA application for new construction:
      (1)   Include site plan, indicating existing structures.
      (2)   Include photographs showing a view of the street with the building
site and adjacent properties.
      (3)   Include elevations of the proposed new building or addition.
      (4)   Include descriptions and/or samples of building materials.
(Ord. 14, 2011, passed 10-3-11)
§ 158.60 PERMANENT SIGNAGE.
   (A)   A pleasing physical appearance and image is beneficial when attracting
potential customers and business. In historic areas, people are attracted to
the variety of architectural styles, materials and well-crafted details. For
this reason, there is no need to have large, unsightly signs to lure customers;
instead use well-placed and well-designed signs.
   (B)   Historically, buildings from the late 1800s and early 1900s featured
signs that were located on flat, continuous surfaces of a building. Spaces for
signs typically included glass windows and doors, between the ground and second
floors of a building, portions of the cornice and side walls. After the 1920s,
signage often projected perpendicularly from the wall to attract passing
automobiles.
   (C)   The following are some typical design types:
      (1)   Projecting-leading edge extends perpendicularly from a building
wall.
      (2)   Suspended-hung from underneath an awning or canopy
      (3)   Flush-mounted wall - attached directly to the face of an exterior
wall, parallel to the building.
      (4)   Wall painted - usually painted directly on a side wall, often faded
with age.
      (5)   Masonry relief - carved into stone or cast into molded brick or
terra cotta.
      (6)   Painted glass - painted directly onto storefront display windows or
glass doors.
      (7)   Transom - painted on, colored or stained glass, spelling out a
store’s name above the display windows.
      (8)   Freestanding ground - not attached to a building, and sits low to
the ground.
   (D)   Design guidelines.
      (1)   Historically significant signs shall be retained and repaired.
      (2)   Acceptable signs include projecting, flush-mounted wall, painted
glass, transom or masonry relief signs.
      (3)   Projecting signs shall not exceed 18 inches in height.
      (4)   The length of flush-mounted wall signs shall be no more than two-
thirds of the width of the building, and the height shall not exceed 20% of the
sign’s length.
      (5)   Signs shall complement and fit in with existing facade in color,
composition and materials. Plywood, barn wood or other homemade signs are
prohibited.
      (6)   Signs shall not cover architectural elements or obscure the display
area.
      (7)   A letter style shall be chosen that is easy to read. Because the
contrast between lettering and background greatly influences legibility, light-
colored letters on a dark background are preferred. Letter sizes shall be
between eight and 18 inches.
      (8)   Illuminated signs shall use an indirect lighting method, such as
overhead or gooseneck lights. Internally lit signs, fluorescent lighting or
spotlights are prohibited in the historic district. Neon lighting is
discouraged.
   (E)   Tips for filling out a COA application for signage:
      (1)   Include exact location, dimensions and area of the sign.
      (2)   Include exact message of the sign (lettering and graphics).
      (3)   Include sign colors and materials, and method of illumination (if
applicable).
      (4)   Include the method that will be used to fasten or support the sign.

§ 158.61 STOREFRONTS.
   Design guidelines.
   (A)   Ornamentation shall be retained and repaired. If missing or
deteriorated beyond repair, replacement materials shall match the original in
appearance and properties as closely as possible.
   (B)   The storefront’s configuration and proportion shall be based on
historic documentation or appropriate historic designs relating to the building
facade.

§ 158.62 LIGHTING.
   Lighting, sidewalks and public utilities shall follow the streetscape plan
for the city.
(Ord. 14, 2011, passed 10-3-11)
§ 158.63 PARKING AREAS.
   Parking areas and empty lots shall be screened with landscaping or
decorative fencing if appropriate. Large areas of the parking lot shall be
broken up with islands of plantings. Parking lot edges, where the lot meets the
sidewalk, shall contain at least a three-foot planting and screening area.
Parking lots shall be located behind buildings whenever possible. Period
lighting is appropriate for most parking areas. An empty lot or parking area
interrupts the visual cohesiveness of the historic district, often producing a
negative visual impact.
(Ord. 14, 2011, passed 10-3-11)
§ 158.64 ENERGY CONSERVATION.
   (A)   Historic structures were built to take advantage of natural heating
and cooling with high ceilings for summer heat and large windows to let in
natural light. Many times a simple fine tuning of existing systems and
components is all that is needed to make a historic building energy efficient
at a fraction of the cost of an entire retrofit.
   (B)   Listed below are some hints on making the building environmentally
friendly and saving money in the long and short term.
      (1)   Use awnings and canopies. Historically, these were used to provide
shade during the summer months. Used in conjunction with open windows and high
ceilings, interiors will stay cooler during the summer months. With central
air, these items will keep the cooling costs down.
      (2)   Use caulking and weather-stripping. These will improve efficiency
of the doors and the windows. Air will enter through cracks in trim,
windowsills and door jambs. Be sure to use materials that will not detract from
the appearance of the building.
      (3)   Use storm windows. Storm windows also help reduce air infiltration
at a fraction of the cost of replacing the entire window. Mount the storm
window on the interior to preserve the original appearance of the exterior. Add
weep holes in order to prevent any moisture condensation. Exterior mounting of
storms is another option. When this is done, match the existing size and
configuration of the window itself.
      (4)   Use insulation. Insulate the attic area of the building. Heat loss
through the roof is a major cost and can be prevented with a minimal
