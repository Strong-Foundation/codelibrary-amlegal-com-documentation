§ 33.22 SOURCES OF FUND.
   (A)   The Pension Board shall have full charge and control of the Police
Pension Fund, and the Fund shall be derived from the following sources:
      (1)   All moneys that may be given to the Board for the use of the Fund
by any person. The Board may take by gift, grant, devise, or bequest any money,
chose in action, personal property, real estate, or any interest therein. The
Board shall be authorized to take such gift, grant, devise, or bequest under
and by the style of the "Board of Trustees of the Police Pension Fund of the
Town of Cicero" and to hold the same, or assign, transfer, or sell the same,
whenever proper and necessary under and by that name.
      (2)   All moneys, fees, and awards of every nature which may be paid or
given to the Police Department or to any member of the Department, because of
any service or duty performed by the Department or its members; all fines
imposed by the Chief of Police or other proper authority against any member of
the Department; and the proceeds from the sale of all lost, stolen, strayed, or
confiscated property recovered or taken into possession by members of the
Department in the performance of their duties and sold at public sale in
accordance with the law.
      (3)   Every member of the Police Department who has been accepted and
designated as a beneficiary of the Police Pension Fund by the Pension Board
shall be assessed a part of his salary, to be fixed by the by-laws of the Fund,
as follows:
         (a)   On and before December 31, 1977, 3%;
         (b)   On and after January 1, 1978, 3.5%;
         (c)   On and after January 1, 1979, 4%;
         (d)   On and after January 1, 1980, 4.5%;
         (e)   On and after January 1, 1981, 5%;
         (f)   On and after January 1, 1982, 5.5%; and
         (g)   On and after January 1, 1983, 6%;
of the salary paid a first-class patrol officer. The assessment shall be
deducted each month from the pay of each member of the Police Department. The
Secretary of the Pension Board shall prepare a roll of each assessment, and
shall place opposite the name of every member of the Police Department the
amount of the assessment against him. The Treasurer of the Board shall deduct
and retain out of the salary paid to the member the amount of the assessment,
and shall place the assessment to the credit of the Fund. Every person who
becomes a member of the Police Department shall from that time be liable for
the payment of the assessment and, in becoming a member of the Department,
shall be conclusively deemed to have undertaken and agreed to pay the
assessment and have it deducted from his salary as required by this section.
   (B)   If in the judgment of the Pension Board the amount of money which will
be available for any year, from whatsoever source derived, will be insufficient
to pay the benefits, pensions, and retirement allowances which, by the
provisions of this subchapter the Board is obligated to pay, the Board shall at
any time prior to the date on which the budget of the town is adopted prepare
an itemized estimate, in such form as shall be prescribed by the State Board of
Accounts, of the amount of money which will be receipted into and disbursed
from the Police Pension Fund during the fiscal year next ensuing.
      (1)   The estimated receipts so set forth shall consist of the several
items enumerated in division (A) of this section.
      (2)   The estimated disbursements as prepared and submitted by the Board
shall consist of an estimate of the amount of money which will be needed by the
Board during the fiscal year next ensuing to defray the expenses and
obligations incurred and which will be incurred by the Board in making the
payments prescribed in this subchapter to retired members, to members who are
eligible to and expect to retire during the ensuing fiscal year, and to the
dependents of deceased members.
      (3)   At the time when the estimates are prepared and submitted, the
Board shall likewise prepare and submit a certified statement showing the name,
age, and the date of retirement of each retired member, and the monthly and
yearly amount of the payment to which the retired member is entitled; the name
and the age of each member who is eligible to and expects to retire during the
fiscal year next ensuing, the date on which the member expects to retire, and
the monthly and yearly amount of the payment which the member will be entitled
to receive; and the name and the age of each dependent, the date on which the
dependent became a dependent, the date on which the dependent will cease to be
a dependent by reason of his attaining the age at which dependents cease to be
dependents, and the monthly and yearly amount of the payment to which the
dependent is entitled.
      (4)   The total receipts shall be deducted from the total expenditures as
set forth in the itemized estimate, and the amount of the excess of the
estimated expenditures over the estimated receipts shall be paid by the town in
the same manner as other lawful expenses of the town are paid, and a tax levy
shall be made annually for that purpose as hereinafter provided.
      (5)   Except as herein otherwise provided, the estimates so submitted
shall be prepared and filed in the same manner and form and at the same time
that the estimates of other offices and departments of the town are prepared
and filed, as provided by law.
      (6)   In the year 1980 and annually thereafter, at the time provided by
law, the Town Council shall levy a tax in such amount and at such a rate as
will be necessary to produce the revenue to pay that proportion of the police
pensions which the town is obligated to pay. All money derived from the levy is
hereby appropriated to the Pension Board of the Police Pension Fund for the
exclusive use of police pensions and disbursements, if found to be correct and
in conformity with the data submitted in the certified statement, shall be a
binding obligation upon the town, and the Town Council shall make a levy
therefor which will yield an amount equal to the estimated disbursements less
the amount of the estimated receipts.
('84 Code, § 33.15) (Ord. 6-12-79, passed 6-12-79)
§ 33.23 INVESTMENT OF FUND.
   The Pension Board shall determine how much of the Fund may be safely
invested, and how much shall be retained for the needs, demands, and exigencies
of the Fund. Investments shall be made in interest-bearing bonds of the United
States or of the State of Indiana; any bond lawfully issued by any county,
township, or municipal corporation of this state; or any street, sewer, or
other improvement bond of any city or town of this state. Bonds shall be
deposited with and remain in the custody of the Treasurer of the Board, who
shall collect the interest due thereon as it becomes due and payable. The Board
may also invest funds in securities which are fully guaranteed by the United
States government both as to principal and interest, and in any other
securities or deposits permitted by law.
('84 Code, § 33.16) (Ord. 6-12-79, passed 6-12-79)
§ 33.24 USES OF FUND.
   The fund shall be used for and devoted to the following purposes:
   (A)   For the payment of such temporary benefits as the Pension Board may
determine, in an amount not less than $25 per month and not greater than $75
per month, to members of the active Police Department who have suffered any
physical or mental disability.
   (B)   For the payment of a pension in such sum, not in excess of 50% of the
salary received by a first-class patrol officer, as may be decided by the
Pension Board to any member of the Police Department who is retired from active
service where, upon physical examination by the Police Surgeon or other surgeon
appointed by the Pension Board, it is found that the member has suffered or
contracted any disease (mental or physical) or any disability. The existence of
disease or disability shall be determined solely by the Pension Board after
examination and hearing, and after due notice to the member, as provided in
this division for reinstatement in the service of the Police Department of any
such retired member, and such members shall be retained on active duty with
full pay until retired by the Pension Board because of the disability. However,
after any such member has been so retired with pension, the Pension Board shall
have the right, at any time, to cause the retired member to be brought before
it again and examined by the Police Surgeon or other surgeon appointed by the
Board and thereupon to determine whether the disability still exists and
whether the retired member shall remain on the pension roll. The retired member
shall be retained on the pension roll until reinstated in the service of the
Police Department except in case of resignation.
      (1)   If upon examination and hearing the retired member shall be found
to have recovered from the disability and to be again fit for active duty, the
member shall again be put on active duty with full pay and from that time he
shall cease to be entitled to any payments out of the Pension Fund.
      (2)   At the hearing the Pension Board shall have the right to examine
witnesses, and if necessary to subpoena witnesses, and the retired member shall
be entitled to due notice of the time and place of the hearing, to be present
at the hearing, to propound any question pertinent or relevant to the question
of his disability, to introduce evidence upon his own behalf as to such
question, and for that purpose to subpoena witnesses in the same manner as the
Pension Board may subpoena witnesses. All witnesses shall be examined under
oath and any member of the Pension Board shall be authorized to administer the
oath. If, upon the hearing, the Pension Board shall decide that the retired
member is then fit for active duty and shall order the member to return to
active duty, and if the member fails or refuses to do so, he shall thereupon
waive any and all right to any further benefits of the Fund.
   (C)   (1)   To any member of the Police Department who retires from active
service after 20 or more years of active service, an annual pension equal to
50% of the salary of a first-class patrol officer in such Police Department,
plus 2% of a first-class patrol officer's salary for each year of service of
such retired member over 20 years, provided that the pension shall not exceed
in any year an amount greater than 74% of the salary of a first-class patrol
officer. Pensions shall be computed on an annual basis, but shall be paid in 12
equal monthly installments. At any time that the salary of a first-class patrol
officer is increased or decreased, the pension payable under this section shall
be proportionately increased or decreased.
      (2)   In case of voluntary retirement, upon application, after 20 or more
years of service, the member shall be entitled to the retirement and the
pension provided in this section without reference to physical condition at the
time of application, but the member shall thereupon relinquish all right to any
other benefits or pensions for temporary disability upon being so retired.
After such retirement the member shall not be required to render further
service on the Police Department, nor shall the member be subject to the rules
of the Department or be deprived of the other benefits provided by this
subchapter which may thereafter accrue to the member or the member's
dependents. To entitle any member to be retired on account of length of
service, only the time served by the member upon the regularly constituted
Police Department shall be computed, and no time served by any member as a
special police officer, a merchant police officer, or a private police officer
shall be considered in computing the length of service.
   (D)   (1)   For the payment of the sum of $600 funeral benefits to the heirs
or estate of any active or retired member of the Police Department who has died
from any cause.
      (2)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (2), for the
payment to the widow of any police officer, who may die under the circumstances
set out above, a sum equal to 30% of the monthly pay of a first-class patrol
officer per month to continue during her life while unmarried, and for the
payment to each child of a deceased police officer under the age of 18 years, a
sum equal to 10% of the monthly pay of a first-class patrol officer per month
to each such child, such payments to a minor child or children under the age of
18 years to continue only for as long as the child or children remain under the
age of 18 years. If a police officer remarries after his retirement from the
Police Department and subsequently dies, the woman to whom he is married
subsequent to his retirement shall not be deemed to be a widow under the
provisions of this subchapter, and shall not be entitled to receive a pension
under the provisions of this subchapter, unless the woman to whom he is
remarried is his former wife.
         (b)   In the event that a deceased officer leaves no widow and no
child under the age of 18 years, but does leave a dependent father, mother, or
both, a sum equal to 20% of the monthly pay of a first-class patrol officer
shall be paid from the time of his death to the dependent father, mother, or
both during their dependency, but in the event both father and mother survive
and are dependent, the sum equal to 20% of the monthly pay of a first-class
patrol officer shall be paid to them jointly and not to each.
         (c)   In each of the situations where payment is made to a dependent
relative of a deceased officer, the Pension Board shall be the final judges of
the question of necessity and dependency and of the amount within the stated
limits to be paid in any case. The Pension Board shall also have the power to
reduce or terminate temporarily or permanently any payment to any dependent
relative of a deceased officer, when in its judgment the condition of the
Pension Fund or any other circumstances may warrant or render it necessary.
   (E)   For the payment of an amount equal to the pensions provided by law in
case of voluntary retirement after 20 years of service to any member of the
Police Department who is dismissed therefrom for any reason after having been
in actual service for 20 years, and for the payment of an additional 2% per
month for each full year of service in excess of 20 years of service to any
member of the police force who is dismissed therefrom after having been in
active service with the Police Department for more than 20 years. However, no
pension provided for in this division shall be based or paid upon any service
in excess of 32 years with the Department.
('84 Code, § 33.17) (Ord. 6-12-79, passed 6-12-79)
§ 33.25 PAYMENT OF PENSIONS.
   All pensions provided for in this subchapter shall be paid by the Treasurer
of the Pension Board at his office at the same time and in such installments as
the members of the Police Department are paid. All pensions granted and payable
out of the Police Pension Fund shall be exempt from seizure or levy upon
attachment, execution, supplemental process, and all other process, whether
intermediate or final, and shall not be subject to sale, assignment, or
transfer by any beneficiary.
('84 Code, § 33.18) (Ord. 6-12-79, passed 6-12-79)
§ 33.26 ORDER OF CLAIMS PAYMENT.
   If at any time there is not sufficient money to the credit of the Police
Pension Fund to pay all claims against it in full, claims on account of the
death of members of the Police Department, if any, shall be first paid in full
with as little delay as possible, after which an equal percentage shall be paid
upon all other claims to the full extent of the funds on hand, until the funds
are replenished so as to pay them in full.
('84 Code, § 33.19) (Ord. 6-12-79, passed 6-12-79)
§ 33.27 MEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Eligibility for membership.
      (1)   In no event shall a pension be paid to an employee of the Police
Department who, at the time of appointment, was over 35 years of age or who
failed to pass the medical examination required and provided by the Pension
Board. The Pension Board shall have the power to require and provide for a
medical examination for employees of the Police Department, and to accept or
reject them as members of the Pension Fund. However, any person who is over the
age of 35 years at the time of appointment, or who has failed to pass the
required medical examination, shall be exempt from paying or contributing any
money to the Fund. Further, every member of the Police Department who is in
active service at the time the Fund is established shall, regardless of their
age at the time they became members of the Department, become members of the
Fund and shall pay the assessment herein provided, if they successfully pass
the physical examination required by the Pension Board.
      (2)   Police officers who are in active service at the time of passage of
this subchapter and who become members of the Pension Fund shall be entitled to
have all their prior years of active service of such police officer on the town
police force counted in determining eligibility for retirement, only if they
pay the same amount into the Pension Fund as they would have paid as dues
during all the years of service with the Police Department prior to the passage
of this subchapter.
('84 Code, § 33.25)
   (B)   Physical. It shall be the duty of the Police Surgeon to make all
examinations of the members of the Police Department whenever requested by the
Pension Board; whenever any member requests him to do so for the purpose of
certifying his physical or mental condition to the Board; or whenever he deems
it proper to do so; and the Police Surgeon shall thereupon certify to the Board
the true physical or mental condition of the member. ('84 Code, § 33.26)
(Ord. 6-12-79, passed 6-12-79)
§ 33.28 RETIRED MEMBERS.
   Any member of the Police Department who is placed on the retired list,
except those who have served with the Department for 20 years or more and who
have been retired for that reason, shall report for duty to the Chief of Police
from time to time as may be provided for in the by-laws of the Pension Board;
shall be subject to the orders and discipline of the Chief; and shall perform
such duties as may be required of him, and for which, in the opinion of the
Police Surgeon, he may be fit, and for which he shall be allowed full pay. For
any refusal to obey orders and for any breach of discipline, the Chief shall
take such action as may be deemed proper for the good of the service, and
members shall be subject to punishment and dismissal in the same manner as
officers in active service. Any pension a retired member may have received
shall cease in case of his expulsion, and the pension, for any refusal to obey
orders or other breach of discipline, shall be subject to whatever orders may
be deemed proper by the Chief.
('84 Code, § 33.27) (Ord. 6-12-79, passed 6-12-79)
§ 33.29 FORFEITURE OF PENSION.
   Whenever any person who has received any benefit from the Police Pension
Fund is convicted of a felony; becomes an habitual drunkard; fails to report
for duty or for examination; or otherwise fails to comply with any legal
requirements imposed by the Pension Board, the Board may upon notice to that
person discontinue or reduce in its discretion any payments that might
otherwise accrue thereafter. However, nothing contained in this subchapter
shall be construed to entitle the Board to recall into service any member who
has previously been retired from active service on account of having served 20
years or more, nor shall anything in this subchapter be construed to entitle a
retired member to a pension after he has been convicted of a felony or has
become an habitual drunkard.
('84 Code, § 33.28) (Ord. 6-12-79, passed 6-12-79)
§ 33.30 ADOPTION OF STATE LAW BY REFERENCE.
   Any member of the Police Department hired after April 30, 1977 shall be
governed by I.C. 36-8- 8-1 et. seq. adopted by reference and incorporated as

Plan for the voluntary participation of all eligible employees.
   (B)   The Town of Cicero will utilize the state's plan document, its Service

(Res. 03-06-2001, passed 3-6-01)
§ 35.03 NEPOTISM; CONTRACTING WITH A UNIT.
   (A)   The Town Nepotism Policy is hereby established effective July 1, 2012
by adopting the minimum requirements provisions of I.C. 36-1-20.2, and
including all future supplements and amendments thereto which become law from

   (B)   The Town Contracting with Relatives of Elected Officials, etc. Policy
is hereby established effective July 1, 2012 by adopting the minimum
requirements provisions of I.C. 36-1-21, and including all future supplements
and amendments thereto which become law from time to time, and making them a
part hereof as if fully set out herein.
   (C)   The town finds that both I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21 specifically
allow a unit to adopt requirements that are "more stringent or detailed" and
that more detailed are necessary.
   (D)   The town further finds that a single member of the legislative body
cannot act for the body to make work assignments, compensation, grievances,
advancement or a performance evaluation without prior authority of a majority
of the body and therefore without such authority by the majority he or she will
not be in the direct line of supervision.
   (E)   The town finds that a single member of governing bodies with authority
over employees in the town cannot act for the governing body to make work
assignments, compensation, grievances, advancement or a performance evaluation
without prior authority of a majority of the body, when a statute provides that
a majority is needed to act, and therefore, without such authority by the
majority the single member will not be in the direct line of supervision.
   (F)   All elected and appointed officials and employees of the town are
hereby directed to cooperate fully in the implementation of the policies
created by this section and demonstrating compliance with these same policies.
   (G)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, compliance
and certifications connected with the Nepotism Policy is a violation and may
result in the discipline, including termination, of an employee or a transfer
from the direct line of supervision or other curative action. An elected or
appointed official of the town who fails to abide by or cooperate with the
implementation, with the compliance and with mandated certifications of either
the Nepotism Policy may be subject to action allowed by law.
   (H)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, compliance
and certifications connected with the Contracting with Relatives of Elected
Officials, etc. Policy is a violation and may result in the discipline,
including termination, of an employee or a curative action. An elected or
appointed official of the town who fails to abide by or cooperate with the
implementation, with the compliance and with mandated certifications of either
the Nepotism Policy or the Contracting with Relatives of Elected Officials,
etc. Policy may be subject to action allowed by law.
(Ord. 06-05-2012-1, passed 6-19-12)
§ 35.04 DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE.
   (A)   Overview. The town makes a commitment to provide employees a safe
working environment, to ensure that employees, equipment and operating
practices comply with health and safety standards, and to maintain public
confidence in the town and its employees. Since the town values each employee,
the town offers employees assistance in dealing with alcohol and drug abuse
problems.
   (B)   Policy.
      (1)   The town requires all employees to report for work in a condition
that allows them to perform their duties in a safe and efficient manner.
Employees will not be permitted to work under the influence of alcohol or with
prohibited drugs in their systems thereby affecting job performance.
      (2)   Violation of any provision of this section will be considered just
cause for disciplinary action, up to and including discharge, even for a first
offense. In addition, refusal to adhere to any part of the policy may be
considered an act of insubordination and also may lead to disciplinary action,
up to and including discharge.
      (3)   This section and related procedures may be modified by the town at
any time in order to comply with any applicable federal, state or local laws,
or to better serve the needs of the town.
   (C)   Prohibited drugs.
      (1)   PROHIBITED DRUGS are defined as illegal substances, including
controlled substances as defined in the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. §
8120) and the Code of Federal Regulations (21 C.F.R. 1308.11-1308.15), and
prescription controlled substances that have not been prescribed by a licensed
physician or dentist for specific treatment purposes for the employee. Abuse of
prescription or over-the-counter drugs will also be treated as a substance
abuse problem under this section.
      (2)   This section prohibits the illegal use, sale, transfer,
distribution, possession or unlawful manufacture of narcotics, drugs or other
controlled substances while on the job or on town premises (including vehicles
used for town business). These include, but are not limited to, marijuana,
cocaine, crack, PCP, heroin, LSD, amphetamines, hallucinogens and barbiturates.
Any illegal substances found on such premises will be turned over to the state
police and may lead to criminal prosecution.
   (D)   Alcohol.
      (1)   The use of alcohol on the job or on town premises is prohibited,
unless its use is non-abusive and is part of an authorized official event held
off town premises. The use of alcohol in vehicles used for town business is
strictly prohibited.
      (2)   Alcohol possession applies to all open or unsealed alcoholic
beverage containers. Such containers are not allowed on the job or on town
premises, unless their possession is part of an authorized official event.
Possession of such containers in vehicles used for town business is never
authorized.
   (E)   Reporting violations.
      (1)   As a condition of employment, employees must abide by the terms of
this section and report to the town any conviction under a criminal drug
statute for violations occurring on or off town premises when conducting town
business. Report of a conviction must be made to the town within five business
days after the conviction. The town will then notify the appropriate
contracting officer within ten days after receiving notice from either the
employee or from another source. (These requirements are mandated by the Drug-
Free Workplace Act of 1988.)
      (2)   An employee who is involved with off-the-job illegal drug activity
may be considered in violation of this section. In determining whether
disciplinary action will be imposed for this activity, the town will consider
the circumstance of each incident, including but not limited to, any adverse
effect the employee’s actions may have on its customers, other employees, the
public, or the town's reputation and image.
      (3)   Any questions regarding the reporting of violations should be
directed to the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (F)   Employee rehabilitation.
      (1)   Health maintenance is primarily a personal responsibility and it is
the individual's responsibility to correct unsatisfactory job performance or
behavioral problems caused by alcohol or drug abuse. In an effort to assist
employees, the town will provide various means for employees and their family
members to remain aware of the dangers of substance abuse in the workplace, and
to overcome drug- and alcohol-related problems.
      (2)   Employees with a personal, alcohol- or drug-related problem are
encouraged to volunteer to participate in a approved rehabilitation program,
upon referral from the Employee and Family Assistance Program, before work
performance becomes affected.
      (3)   Participation in a rehabilitation program will not be considered a
barrier to employment nor a cause for disciplinary action. Employees will not
be disciplined merely because of participation in a rehabilitation program, or
excused from the disciplinary consequences of conduct in violation of this
section or any other town policies or job requirements.
      (4)   Any employee identified through a town investigation as having a
substance abuse problem also may not avoid disciplinary action by requesting to
participate in an approved rehabilitation program.
      (5)   Circumstances in each case will be evaluated to determine the
course of action to be taken (i.e., whether the employee will be offered the
opportunity to participate in a rehabilitation program and/or will be subject
to discipline).
   (G)   Testing.
      (1)   The town will not ask employees to submit to random alcohol or drug
tests.

(Ord. 02-07-2017-1, passed 2-7-17)
INVESTMENT POLICY
§ 36.95 INVESTMENT POLICY.
   (A)   Objectives. The following are the objectives of the Town of Cicero
investment policy:
      (1)   The primary objectives of the Town of Cicero's (the town's)
investments are in order of priority: safety, liquidity, and yield;
      (2)   To link long-term financial planning with short-term daily
operations;
      (3)   To maintain the town's stable financial position;
      (4)   To ensure that the Council's adopted policies are implemented in an
efficient and effective manner;
      (5)   To protect the town from emergency fiscal crisis by ensuring the
continuance of service even in the event of an unforeseen occurrence; and
      (6)   To secure the highest possible credit and bond ratings by meeting
or exceeding the requirements of the rating agencies through sound,
conservative financial decision making.
   (B)   Policy.
      (1)   It is the policy of the town to preserve capital and invest public
funds in a manner which provide the highest investment return with maximum
security while meeting the daily cash flow demands of the town and conforming
to all state statues governing the investment of public funds.
      (2)   The standard of prudence to be used by the Clerk-Treasurer will be
the "prudent person" rule. The "prudent person" concept discourages speculative
transactions. It attaches primary significance to the preservation of capital
and secondary importance to the generation of income through interest. The
Clerk-Treasurer, if acting in accordance with the written procedures and state
statutes and exercising due diligence, shall be relieved of personal
responsibility for individual security credit risk or market price changes,
provided that these deviations are reported immediately, and action is taken to
control adverse developments.
      (3)   Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment
program. Investments of the town will be undertaken in a manner that seeks to
ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To attain this
objective, diversification is required in order that potential losses on
individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the remainder of
the portfolio.
      (4)   The town's investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to
enable the town to meet all operating requirements which might be reasonably
anticipated using structured maturities and marketable securities.
      (5)   The town's investment portfolio will be designed with the objective
of attaining a market rate of return while minimizing risk and retaining
liquidity.
      (6)   The State of Indiana Statutes delegate management responsibilities
for the investment program to the Clerk-Treasurer. The Clerk-Treasurer will
establish and maintain written procedures for the operation of the investment
program consistent with the investment policy. Such procedures will include
explicit delegation of authority to persons responsible for investment
transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as
provided under the terms of this policy and the procedures established by the
Clerk-Treasurer and approved by the Town Council. The Clerk-Treasurer will be
responsible for all transactions undertaken and will establish a system of
controls to regulate the activities of deputy clerks.
      (7)   The Clerk-Treasurer, deputy clerks, and employees involved in the
investment process will refrain from personal business activity that could
conflict with the proper execution of the investment program, or which could
impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees and
investment officials will disclose to the Clerk-Treasurer any material
financial interests in financial institutions that conduct business within this
jurisdiction, and they will further disclose any large personal financial/
investment positions that could be related to the performance of the town's
portfolio. Employees and officers will subordinate their personal investment
transactions to those of the town, particularly regarding the time of purchase
and sales.
      (8)   The Clerk-Treasurer will maintain a list of financial institutions
authorized to provide investment services. Authorized financial institutions
include banks maintaining an office in the State of Indiana and securities
brokers/dealers classified by the New York Federal Reserve as primary dealers.
      (9)   The town will invest only in securities authorized by the State of
Indiana Statutes pertaining to local government and restricts the purchase of
securities to the highest possible ratings whenever particular types of
securities are rated. The Clerk-Treasurer may elect to further limit the town's
investment security authority.
      (10)   All transactions entered into by the town will be conducted on a
delivery-versus-payment basis. All transactions shall be in the town's name.
All recording keeping procedures will be conducted in the Clerk-Treasurer's
office. Certificated securities shall be in the custody of the Clerk-Treasurer
or their designee.
      (11)   The town will make every effort to maintain a diversified
investment portfolio according to security type and institution.
      (12)   To the extent possible, the town will attempt to match its
investments with the anticipated cash flow requirements. Beyond identified cash
flow needs, investments will be purchased so the maturities are staggered to
avoid undue concentration of assets in a single maturity range; however, the
town will not directly invest in securities maturing more than three years from
date of purchase.
      (13)   It is the town's full intent, at the time of purchase, to hold all
investments until maturity to ensure the return of all invested principal
dollars. However, economic or market conditions may change which may make it in
the town's best interest to sell or trade a security prior to maturity.
      (14)   All moneys earned and collected from investments of the general
accounts other than bond proceed earning will be invested in the General Fund.
Enterprise and Impact Funds with earnings will be allocated to the Fund with
the earnings. Earnings on bond proceeds will be directly allocated to the same
proceeds.
      (15)   The Clerk-Treasurer or their designee is charged with the
responsibility of preparing a monthly investment inventory report that includes
investment types, cost, market value, maturity date, yield and average
portfolio yield.
      (16)   The Clerk-Treasurer is responsible for establishing and
maintaining a system of internal controls designed to ensure that the assets of
the town are protected from loss, theft or misuse.
      (17)   This investment policy applies to all financial assets in the
town's investment portfolio, including debt proceeds.

Utility unless such service shall be measured by an approved water meter
system, which system shall separately measure service only to such dwelling.
   (C)   The Maintenance Superintendent of the Municipal Water Utility shall
establish standards for the installation of meter pit, yoke, and related piping
and shall cause these standards to be reduced to writing and maintained for
public inspection at the office of the Municipal Water Utility. The Maintenance

   (D)   The Secretary of the Municipal Water Utility shall notify the owner of
record of any dwelling which is believed not to have a separate water meter by
registered or certified United States postage, return receipt requested, that
the dwelling fails to conform to this section. The Secretary shall further
notify the residents of each such dwelling by a notice prominently and securely
attached to the door or other prominent location at the dwelling that the
dwelling fails to conform to this section. In each case the notice shall inform
the owner or resident that 30 days after service of such notice upon them,
water service to the dwelling will be terminated until the dwelling is brought

Water Utility, the physical construction of the plumbing which serves an
apartment house, business building, or similar multi-unit facility is such that
an individual meter system cannot be installed to measure water service to each
dwelling unit or other user within such multi-unit facility, the multi-unit
facility may continue to be served by one water meter. The monthly charge for
such service shall be the greater of the product of the multiplication of the
minimum charge for service to a residence as set forth in

      (3)   For the service rendered to the town, the town shall be subject to
the same rates and charges hereinabove provided, or to charges and rates
established in harmony therewith.
   (B)   The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewerage system and
obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the town shall be
determined by the town in such manner as the town shall reasonably elect, and
the sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates; except, as
is hereinafter provided in this section. The town may make proper allowances in
determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be
consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the town that such
quantities do not enter the sanitary sewerage system.
      (1)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the town
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the town and the water used thereon or
therein is not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not
acceptable to the town then the amount of water used shall be otherwise
measured or determined by the town. In order to ascertain the rate or charge
provided in this chapter, the owner or other interested party shall at his
expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or
any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the town for
determining sewage discharge.
      (2)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids in the town’s
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the town, and in addition, is a user of
water from another source which is not measured by a water meter or is measured
by a meter not acceptable to the town, then the amount of water used shall be
otherwise measured or determined by the town. In order to ascertain the rates
or charges, the owner or other interested parties shall, at his expense,
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the town for the
determination of sewage discharge.
      (3)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate
or buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the
town’s sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of
water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in
each such case, for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be
averaged for each user and the minimum charge and the sewage rates and charges
shall apply to each of the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate
or buildings served through the single water meter.
      (4)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in
excess of 5,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of
the town that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does
not and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other
interested party shall, at his or her expense, install and maintain meters,
weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of
measurement acceptable to the town for the determination of sewage discharge.
      (5)   In the event two or more dwelling units such as mobile homes,
apartments or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water or other
liquids into the town’s sanitary sewerage system, either directly or
indirectly, are users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a
single water meter, then in such case, billing shall be for a single service in
the manner set out elsewhere herein. In the case of trailer parks, the number
of dwelling units shall be computed and interpreted as the total number of
trailers located and installed in said park, plus any other dwelling units
served through the meter. A dwelling unit shall be interpreted as a room or
rooms or any other space or spaces in which cooking facilities are provided.
      (6)   Where a metered water supply is used for fire protection as well as
for other uses, the town may, in its discretion, make adjustments in the
minimum charge and in the use charge as may be equitable.

§ 51.27 BASIS OF CHARGES.
   In order that the rates and charges may reflect the costs of providing
service rendered to users, the town shall base its charges not only on the
volume, but also the strength and character of the stronger-than-normal
domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose of. The
town shall require the user to determine the strength and content of all sewage
and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly into the sanitary sewage
system, in such manner and by such method as the town may deem practicable in
order to determine the proper charge. The user shall furnish a central sampling
point available to the town at all times.
   (A)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a biochemical
oxygen demand of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid or suspended solids in
excess of 230 milligrams per liter of fluid. Additional charges for treating
stronger-than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis:
      (1)   Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids. There shall be an
additional charge of $.31 per pound of suspended solids for suspended solids
received in excess of 230 milligrams per liter of fluid.
      (2)   Rate surcharge based upon BOD. There shall be an additional charge
of $.27 per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for BOD received in excess of
250 milligrams per liter of fluid.
   (B)   The determination of suspended solids and five-day biochemical oxygen
demand contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the latest copy of
"Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage and Industrial Wastes,"
as written by the American Public Health Association, the American Water Works
Association and the Water Pollution Control Federation, and in conformance with
"Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants,"
Regulation CFR Part 136, published in the Federal Register on October 16, 1973.
(Ord. 3-20-90B, passed 4-3-90)
§ 51.28 BILLING AND COLLECTION PROCEDURES.
   Such rates and charges shall be prepared, billed and collected by the town
in the manner provided by law and ordinance.
   (A)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed
monthly.
   (B)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying
the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but
such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in the event
payment is not made as herein required. The owners of properties served, which
are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to examine the
collection records of the town for the purpose of determining whether bills
have been paid by such tenant or tenants, provided that such examination shall
be made at the office at which said records are kept and during the hours that
such office is open for business.
   (C)   As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when due are
hereby declared to be delinquent and a penalty of 10% of the amount of the
rates or charges shall thereupon attach thereto. The time at which such rates
or charges shall be paid is now fixed at 15 days after the date of mailing of
the bill.

information relating to pretreatment control facilities and accidental
discharge procedures.
      (2)   These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this subchapter
and are separate from all other fees chargeable by ordinance. A schedule of
applicable charges and fees are available from the utility office.
   (I)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of water
and wastes to which reference is made in this subchapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater”, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at that control manhole, except for application for NPDES permits and
report thereof which shall be conducted in accordance with rules and
regulations adopted by the USEPA, 40 CFR Part 136 and any subsequent revisions
subject to approval by the town. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by the customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, health and property. (The particular analysis
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. suspended solids analyses are obtained from
24-hour composites of all out falls whereas pHs are determined from periodic
grab samples.)
   (J)   Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided
for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
   (K)   Industrial cooling water, which may be polluted with insoluble oils or

equipment which is a part of the municipal sewage works. Any person violating
this provision shall be subject to immediate arrest.
   (B)   The town may immediately and without prior notice suspend the
wastewater treatment service of a discharger if it appears to the town, based
upon factors addressed in this subchapter, that an actual or threatened
discharge presents an imminent danger to the welfare of persons, to the
environment, to the operation of the town's wastewater treatment plant, or
contaminates the resultant sludge and jeopardizes the opportunity for its
disposal through land application, or violates any discharge limits. Any
discharger notified of the suspension of wastewater treatment service must
immediately cease all discharges. If the discharger fails to comply voluntarily
with a suspension order, the town may immediately commence judicial proceeding
to compel the discharger's compliance with the order. The town can reinstate
the wastewater treatment service and terminate judicial proceeding provided the
discharger can prove the elimination of the noncomplying discharge or
conditions as outlined above.
   (C)   Whenever the town finds that any discharger has engaged in conduct
other than that set forth in division (B) of this section, which justifies
revocation of a permit or suspension of service, the town will serve the
discharger with a written notice, either personally or by certified or
registered mail, stating the nature of the alleged violation. With ten days of
the date of receipt of this notice, the discharger must respond personally or
in writing to the town, advising of its position with respect to the
allegations. Thereafter, the parties must meet to determine the seriousness of
the allegations and where necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory
correction of the violation.
   (D)   Where a violation of the town's ordinance or if applicable
pretreatment regulations occurs and is not corrected by timely compliance, the
town may order any discharger to show cause before them and state why the
proposed permit revocation action should not be taken. A written notice must be
served on the discharger by personal service, certified or registered,
specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the town. The hearing
will consider the violations, the proposed enforcement action, reasons why the
enforcement action is to be taken and directing the discharger to show cause
before the town as to why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
The notice of the hearing must be served no less than ten days before the
hearing. Service may be made on any agent, officer or authorized representative
of a discharger. The proceedings at the hearing will be considered by the city
and appropriate orders with respect to the alleged improper activities of the
discharger will be issued.
   (E)   Any user affected by any decision, action or determination made by the
town, interpreting or implementing the provisions of this subchapter or in any
permit issued herein, may file with the town a written request for
reconsideration within ten days of such decision, action or determination,
setting forth in detail the facts supporting the user's request for
reconsideration.
   (F)   If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes
into a town's wastewater disposal system contrary to the municipal ordinance,
federal or state pretreatment requirements or any order of the town, the Town
Attorney may commence a judicial action for appropriate legal and/or equitable
relief.

Water User Fees for the Town of Cicero's storm water system.
   IMPERVIOUS AREA. Those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of
storm water into the soil as it enters natural conditions prior to development.
Common impervious areas include, but are not limited to, roof tops, sidewalks,

area in an amount based upon the assigned ERU as determined below. Such storm
water user fees shall be calculated and assessed on a tax parcel basis by Town
of Cicero's Clerk-Treasurer's Office.
   (B)   All real estate having Impervious Area within the corporate boundaries
of the Town of Cicero, Indiana will be assigned an ERU in accordance with the
following provisions:
      (1)   Residential real estate. A tax parcel containing only a single-
family dwelling or one residential lot shall be one ERU. A tax parcel
containing multiple single-family dwellings or units shall be equal to the
total number of units on the parcel. For example, a tax parcel containing two-
family dwellings shall be considered two ERUs.
      (2)   Non-residential real estate. The minimum ERU for a parcel of non-
residential real estate shall be one ERU. Each tax parcel of non-residential
real estate shall be assigned an ERU based upon the parcel's individually
measured or calculated impervious area in acres divided by one tenth (0.10) of
an acre. This division will be calculated and rounded to the second decimal
place. If the ERU determined by this method is greater than one ERU, the tax
parcel's ERU shall be assigned per this calculation. Any non-residential real
estate with an ERU of less than one shall be considered to have one ERU.
      (3)   The identification of real estate tax parcels, the classification
of primary use, the determination of whether a tax parcel contains a dwelling,
the number of dwellings a tax parcel contains, the classification of the type
of dwelling and type of real estate, and the calculation of the Impervious Area
on the tax parcel shall be based upon existing data in the Hamilton County mass
appraisal system database for the respective determination date used for making
the storm water user fee assessments.
      (4)   For each current storm water user fee assessment, the determination
date shall be March 1 of the prior year.
   (C)   There shall be no exceptions or exemptions from the assignment of
ERU’s and the assessment of storm water user fees for a particular type of
classification of real estate tax parcel within the corporate boundaries of the
Town of Cicero, Indiana.

§ 53.07 STORM WATER CREDITS ON COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES.
   Commercial properties shall be eligible for a credit toward their storm
water assessments based upon their implementation of storm water handling
methods that reduce the impact of their storm water runoff from their
impervious area via one of the following means:
   (A)   The establishment of a properly engineered and designed rain garden or
pond shall result in a 10% reduction in the assessment of a commercial parcel.
   (B)   The establishment of an approved Best Management Practice program
shall result in a 15% reduction in the assessment of a commercial parcel.
Eligibility shall be subject to yearly inspections and the completion of all
required yearly maintenance.

§ 53.08 APPEAL OF ERU DETERMINATION.

estate tax parcel is inaccurate in light of the number of dwellings or amount
of impervious area on the property, the user shall have the right to contest
the ERU determination and thus the storm water user fees assessed in accordance
with the provisions contained in this section.
   (B)   The user shall obtain and complete a petition to appeal storm water
assessment form which shall be filed with the Town of Cicero's Clerk-Treasurer

Board.
   (C)   The Board shall investigate the user's claim and, upon review thereof,
shall render a written determination that either the original ERU determination
and assessment should be affirmed or that the user's rate should be adjusted
and how much the adjustment should be.
   (D)   The determination made by the Board shall be forwarded to the user by
certified mail, return receipt requested. The user shall have 15 days from the
date of receipt to request reconsideration if dissatisfied with the decision
from the Board. Any additional facts concerning the dispute shall be reduced to
writing and submitted with a copy of the original petition and supporting
documents, to the Clerk-Treasurer. The Clerk-Treasurer shall submit a written
report of the determination in the case, along with any documents used, in
denying the User's claim or in recommending an adjustment.
   (E)   Thereafter, the Cicero Town Council shall review all documentation and
conduct an informal hearing to determine and resolve the dispute based upon the
documentation submitted and any oral testimony. The Cicero Town Council shall
issue a determination which shall be binding upon the Town of Cicero's
Department of Storm Water Management and the user. The hearing shall be
recorded and the minutes of the hearing provided upon request at a cost per
page as determined by the Clerk-Treasurer which rate shall be amended from time
to time.
   (F)   Any user aggrieved by the final Cicero Town Council determination
shall have the right to judicial review of such determination in accordance
with Indiana law at their expense.

accordingly for any overpayment made from the earlier of the date of the storm
water user fee assessment was paid or was due and payable.
   (H)   A dispute or appeal of an ERU determination for storm water assessment
shall not be a valid reason for non-payment of the originally assessed storm
water user fee.

minimizing the impacts of development and human activities on water quality.
Traditional STRUCTURAL BMPS , including extended detention dry ponds, wet
ponds, infiltration trenches, and sand filtration systems, are now common
elements of most new development projects. STRUCTURAL BMPS rely heavily on
gravitational settling and/or the infiltration of soluble nutrients through a
porous medium for pollutant removal. NONSTRUCTURAL BMPS , which may be used
independently or in conjunction with structural BMPs, rely on a much wider
breadth of mechanisms to prevent or control NPS pollution. NONSTRUCTURAL BMPS
range from programs that increase public awareness to prevent pollution, to the
implementation of control-oriented techniques (such as bioretention and storm
water wetlands) that utilize vegetation to enhance pollutant removal and
restore the infiltrative capacity of the landscape.
   CLEAN WATER ACT(CWA).  The federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. §§
1251 et seq.), any subsequent amendments thereto; and all rules and regulations
promulgated pursuant to the act.
   CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY.  Activities subject to NPDES construction permits.
These include construction projects resulting in land disturbance of one acre
or more, as defined in the Indiana Annotated Code (IAC) by 327 IAC 15-5-1:12
(Rule 5). Such activities include, but are not limited to, clearing and
grubbing, grading, excavating and demolition.
   FACILITY. Any FACILITY , including construction sites, required by the
Federal Clean Water Act to have a permit to discharge storm water associated
with industrial activity.
   HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.  Any material, including any substance, waste, or
combination thereof, that, because of its quantity, concentration, or physical,
chemical or infectious characteristics, may cause, or significantly contribute
to, a substantial present or potential hazard to human health, safety, property
or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, disposed of,
or otherwise managed.
   ILLICIT DISCHARGE.  Any direct or indirect non-storm water discharge to the
storm drainage system, except as exempted in §
53.25 of this subchapter.
   ILLICIT CONNECTION.  Either of the following:
      (1)   Any drain or conveyance, whether on the surface or subsurface, that
allows an illicit discharge to enter the storm drainage system, including but
not limited to, any conveyances that allow any non-storm water discharge,
including sewage, process wastewater, and waste water, to enter the storm
drainage system, and any connection to the storm drainage system from indoor
drains and sinks, regardless of whether the drain or connection had been
previously allowed, permitted or approved by the town; or
      (2)   Any drain or conveyance connected from a commercial or industrial
land use to the storm drainage system that has not been documented in plans,
maps or equivalent records and approved by the town.
   INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY. Activities subject to NPDES industrial permits as
defined by 327 1AC 15-6-1:12 (Rule 6).
   MAXIMUM EXTENT PRACTICABLE (MEP).  The statutory standard that establishes
the level of pollutant reductions that operators of regulated MS4s must
achieve. The CWA requires that NPDES permits for discharges from MS4s “shall
require controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent
practicable, including management practices, control techniques and system,
design and engineering methods.” This standard applies to all MS4s regulated
under the Phase I and Phase II (Rule 13) storm water rules. Compliance with the
conditions of Rule 13, and the series of steps associated with implementation
of the required six minimum control measures, will satisfy the MEP standard.
Compliance with the six minimum control measures requires the development and
implementation of BMPs. Implementation of the BMPs includes not only the
actions necessary to initiate and continue the use of specific control
measures, but also the enforcement actions, as applicable, to ensure that the
implementation of the control measures occurs.
   MUNICIPAL SEPARATE STORM SEWER SYSTEM (MS4). A conveyance or system of
conveyances (including roads with drainage systems, municipal streets, catch
basins, curbs, gutters, ditches, man-made channels, or storm drains) owned or
operated by a state, town, county, tribe, district, association or other public
body, or a designated and approved management agency under Section 208 of the

for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation, has information of any known or suspected release of
materials resulting in, or that may result in, illicit discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drainage system, or waters of the
United States, that person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment and cleanup of the release. In the event of a release of
hazardous materials, the person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of an illicit discharge, the person shall immediately notify the
Utility Department. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a
commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of the
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for
at least three years.
(Ord. 06-18-2013-2, passed 6-18-13)
§ 53.33 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Notice of violation. Whenever it finds that a person has violated a

different colored lights or colored lighted arrows successively, one at a time
or in combination, only the colors green, red, or yellow may be used, except
for special pedestrian signals under IC 9-9-21-18, and the lights indicate and
apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
   (A)   Green indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left, unless a sign at such place prohibits
either turn;
      (2)   Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall
yield right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection or an adjacent sidewalk at the time such signal is exhibited;
      (3)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time;
      (4)   Vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians
lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the
intersection; and
      (5)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a
turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked
crosswalk.
   (B)   Steady yellow indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow
signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated
and that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter; and
      (2)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal,
unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, are thereby advised
that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is
shown, and no pedestrian may start to cross the roadway at that time.
   (C)   Steady red indication:
      (1)   Except as provided in divisions (C)(2) and (C)(4), vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red or red arrow signal shall stop at a
clearly marked stop line. However, if there is no clearly marked stop line,
vehicular traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection. If there is no crosswalk, vehicular traffic shall stop before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to
proceed is shown.
      (2)   Except when a sign is in place prohibiting such a turn described in
this division, vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal, after coming to a
complete stop, may cautiously enter the intersection to do the following:
         (a)   Make a right turn; or
         (b)   Make a left turn if turning from the left lane or a designated
left-turn lane of a one-way street into another one-way street with the flow of
traffic. Vehicular traffic making a turn described in this division (C)(2)
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic using the intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal,
pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red arrow signal shall not enter
the roadway.
      (4)   If the operator of a motorcycle, motorized bicycle, motor scooter,
or bicycle approaches an intersection that is controlled by a traffic control
signal, the operator may proceed through the intersection on a steady red
signal only if the operator:
         (a)   Comes to a complete stop at the intersection for at least 120
seconds; and
         (b)   Exercises due caution as provided by law, otherwise treats the
traffic control signal as a stop sign, and determines that it is safe to
proceed.
   (D)   No indication or conflicting indications:
      (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(3), vehicular traffic facing an
intersection having a signal that displays no indication or conflicting
indications, where no other control is present, shall stop before entering the
intersection; and
      (2)   After stopping, vehicular traffic may proceed with caution through
the intersection and shall yield the right-of-way to traffic within the
intersection, or approaching so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard.
      (3)   Vehicular traffic entering an intersection or crosswalk facing a
pedestrian hybrid beacon may proceed without stopping if no indication is
displayed on the pedestrian hybrid beacon.
   (E)   This section applies to traffic-control signals located at a place
other than an intersection. A stop required under this division must be made at

device or railroad sign or signal which attempts or purports to direct the
movement of traffic, or which conceals or hides from view or interferes with
the effectiveness of any official control device or any railroad sign or
signal. No person shall place or maintain, nor shall any public authority
permit on any street, any traffic sign or signal bearing any commercial
advertising. Nothing in this section shall be construed as restricting any
public department or public utility of the town in any emergency or temporarily
from marking or erecting any traffic barrier or sign whose placing has been
approved by the Chief of Police.

particular section of this traffic code does not state that signs are required,
such section shall be effective without signs being placed to give notice

('84 Code, § 71.01) Penalty, see

specific places or at specified times.
   (B)   When signs are erected in compliance with the provisions of division
(E) below giving notice thereof, no person shall park a vehicle at any time on

thereof stopping or parking shall be restricted or prohibited. Whenever under
authority of or by this traffic code or any other ordinance any parking limit
is imposed or parking is prohibited on designated streets, or parking areas are
restricted to handicapped parking, it shall be the duty of the Chief of Police
to erect appropriate signs giving notice thereof. However, in lieu of erecting
such signs or in conjunction therewith, the Chief of Police may cause the face
and top of a curb or curbs at or adjacent to which parking is prohibited at all
times to be painted a solid yellow color.
      (2)   No such regulations or restrictions shall be effective unless the
signs have been erected and are in place or the curbs are painted yellow at the
time of any alleged offense, except in the case of those parking restrictions
which by their very nature would not require such signs and markings.

SNOW EMERGENCY
§ 72.20 ANNOUNCEMENT OF SNOW EMERGENCY.
   (A)   Whenever the Chief of Police finds that falling snow, sleet, or
freezing rain will create a condition which makes it necessary that the parking
of motor vehicles on snow emergency routes be prohibited, or whenever he finds
on the basis of a firm forecast of snow, sleet, or freezing rain that the
weather conditions so forecasted may create a condition making it necessary
that such parking be prohibited, he is authorized to announce such prohibition,
to become effective at a time specified by him, but not less than one hour
after such announcement. After the effective time of such prohibition no person
shall park any vehicle or permit any vehicle to remain parked on a snow
emergency route. However, if a fall of snow, sleet, or freezing rain occurs
after 11:00 p.m. and prior to 6:00 a.m., and the Chief of Police has not
announced prior to 11:00 p.m. that parking on snow emergency routes is to be
prohibited after a specified time, a vehicle parked on a snow emergency route
may remain so parked until 7:00 a.m. following such fall. The prohibition of
parking announced by the Chief of Police under the authority of this section

emergency, in part or in whole, after which the prohibition of parking

state the time these snow emergency parking regulations become effective.

date and time when the announcement of a snow emergency parking regulation is
first made to the public, and the date, time, and conditions of any
announcements made to the public of the termination of each snow emergency
parking regulation, either in part or in whole, in accordance with §
72.21.
('84 Code, § 72.30) Penalty, see §
72.99
§ 72.21 TERMINATION OF EMERGENCY.
   Whenever the Chief of Police shall find that some or all of the conditions
which gave rise to the snow emergency prohibition no longer exist, he is

effective immediately on announcement. If such announcement is made other than
between 6:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m., it shall be repeated between those hours.

cut from a public street, alley or other public way shall be deemed necessary

satisfaction of the Street Commissioner, and the entire expense of constructing
such private entrances, driveways and approaches shall be borne by the person
to whom a permit is given. Furthermore, the applicant must satisfy the town
that all safety precautions such as the placement of barricades and flashing
warning lights, if required, will be installed to protect the residents and
other users who travel the public roads, streets, alleys or other public ways
located within the town.
   (D)   The Street Commissioner, may require, before granting a permit, that a
sufficient bond be given or cash deposit be made with the Clerk-Treasurer’s
office to insure the carrying out of terms of the permit, which bond or deposit
shall be returned when requirements of the permit have been met.
   (E)   In addition to the posting of a sufficient bond or cash deposit as
required in the preceding paragraph (Paragraph D) of this Section, the
applicant shall pay a non-refundable permit fee of $50.00 to the Clerk-
Treasurer, and said permit fee shall be paid before the issuance or allowance
of such permit. The permit fee shall be placed in the general fund of the town.
   (F)   If the proposed improvement and/or curb-cut has been approved and
providing all other terms and conditions of this section have been met by the
applicant, the Clerk-Treasurer of the town shall issue a permit which shall,
among other things, contain the following:
      (1)   The location of such proposed improvement and/or curb-cut.
      (2)   The estimated width of the curb-cut and/or entrance onto a public
street, alley or other public way.

improvement and curb-cut.
   (G)   When the proposed improvement and curb-cut is completed to the
satisfaction of the Street Department of the town and if the same has been made
in accordance with this section and with the terms and provisions of the
permit, the bond or cash deposit which may have been required pursuant to
Paragraph (D) of this section shall be released and/or returned by the town to
the applicant.
   (H)   If the applicant does not complete the work in the manner and within
the time period stated in the application and on the permit, as the same
applies to the public right-of-way, sidewalk, drainage ditch, drain, swale,
culvert or tile, then the town may, at its option, have its employees or a
competent contractor complete and/or modify the work and any and all expenses
incurred by the town shall be borne and paid by the applicant and/or the
occupant and/or owner of the real estate upon which the proposed improvement is
located. Any and all expenses incurred by the town hereunder may be made a lien
against the real estate upon which the proposed improvement is located.
      (1)   Prior to doing and/or modifying the work and prior to filing a lien
against the real estate, the town shall, by certified mail, inform the
applicant and/or owner and/or occupant of the real estate of the defective
conditions of the work, set out the corrective measures to be taken, and the

section.
   (I)   The owners or occupants of the real estate shall maintain and keep in
repair all private entrances, driveways, and approaches thereto, but no private
entrances, driveways and approaches may be constructed or maintained in such a

or occupant of the real estate shall remove or relocate private entrances,
driveways and approaches at his own expense, when requested to do so by the

   (J)   For the purpose of enforcing the terms and provisions of this section,
the Street Commissioner or his designated agent or a contractor employed by the

MAILBOXES AND MAILBOX POSTS
§ 94.40 POLICY.
   (A)   Findings of fact. 
      (1)   It is necessary for town residents to install mailboxes on posts in
public right-of-way to receive mail;
      (2)   The Town Street Department has the responsibility for maintaining
these rights-of-way, including removal of snow and ice from the traveled
portion of the roadway; and
      (3)   Occasional damage to these mailbox-mailbox post installations is
unavoidable.
   (B)   Policy. Therefore, the following policy is in effect. It requires
that, under certain conditions, the Street Department will replace mailboxes
and/or mailbox posts, or pay an amount of up to $75 for damages resulting from
maintenance activities by the town pursuant to the following conditions:
      (1)   The Street Department employee who knows that damage was done to an
installation during a maintenance activity and reports same to the office.
      (2)   The owner of the installation reports the damage in writing within
seven calendar days of when the damage occurred, and completes and signs a
mailbox and post damage notification form. This form is available at the Clerk-
Treasurer’s office, 150 West Jackson Street, Cicero, Indiana, or online at
www.ciceroin.org.
      (3)   In order to be eligible for replacement or a cash payment, the
mailbox and post damage notification form must be returned to the Clerk-
Treasurer’s office within 30 days of when the damage occurred.
      (4)   The claim form will permit the owner to request that the town:
         (a)   Replace the mailbox; or
         (b)   Provide a one-time cash payment of up to $75 as compensation in
full.
      (5)   All claims will be made on the form and may be investigated by the
town. In questionable circumstances, the claimant will be given the benefit of
the doubt.
      (6)   In the event the owner requests that the town replace the mailbox
and/or mailbox post, the replacement by the town, unless an investigation is
required or the claim is denied, will be made within three work days, weather
permitting, from the time that the signed form is received.
      (7)   Replacement components provided by the town will be a black mailbox
(with a length of 21½ inches, a width of 8 1/8 inches, and a height of 10¾
inches), with four four-inch, white house numbers, and/or, depending on the
extent of the damage, a standard, 4" x 4", treated timber mailbox post. Cash
payment, if requested, will be made within 30 days of claim, unless
investigation is required or the claim is denied.
      (8)   In the event the owner requests the cash payment option, payment
shall be made within 30 days by the town, unless the claim requires
investigation or is denied.
      (9)   Only one claim per household for cash payment, or the replacement
by the town of the standard, 4" x 4", treated timber mailbox post will be
permitted.
   (C)   Nature of policy. Compensation given under this policy does not
constitute a fault or admission of guilt by the town. The act of replacing or
compensating funds due to damages during maintenance in winter months is the
result of the probability factor, and the town's willingness to maintain good-
will relations with the town residents.
   (D)   Appeals. The town, as owners and governing body of all town rights-of-
ways, shall accept, reject or determine any appropriate action for compensation
of claims received under this policy. When claims are denied, appeals will be
heard by the Town Council.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 156.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Town Council of the Town of Cicero does hereby adopt the following floodplain
management regulations.
(Ord. 10-21-2014-2, passed 11-4-14)
§ 156.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-proofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 10-21-2014-2, passed 11-4-14)
§ 156.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
   (F)   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and
their contents in the Town by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 10-21-2014-2, passed 11-4-14)
§ 156.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains; and
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
(Ord. 10-21-2014-2, passed 11-4-14)
§ 156.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A ZONES,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
      ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood event.
Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood
elevation or depths are shown.
      ZONE AE and A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance
flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown
within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-
A30).
      ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow flooding
(usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one
and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses
are shown within this zone.
      ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow flooding
(usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and three feet.
Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within
this zone.
      ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community’s
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.

ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
the Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular
program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate
including but not limited to:
      (1)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any
addition to a structure;
      (2)   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home or installing a recreational vehicle on a site for more than
180 days;
      (3)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction of

dams, channel improvements, and the like;
      (5)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling
operations;
      (6)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
      (7)   Storage of materials; or
      (8)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
   DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the maintenance of existing
structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing roads; or
gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not involve
filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent structures.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter
walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or
columns (posts and piers).
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. A certified statement that verifies a structure’s
elevation information.
   EMERGENCY PROGRAM. The first phase under which a community participates in
the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOOD).
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA. (see FREEBOARD).
   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The FLOODPLAIN includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to
as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention
ordinance, and floodplain management requirements.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP (as related to variances of this chapter). The exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Board of
Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar
to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is NOT
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURES. Any structures individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
      LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the currently
effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA
through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is only
issued by FEMA.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the currently
effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations,
and elevations.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision by
letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA’s determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest elevation described among the following:
      (1)   The top of the lowest level of the structure.
      (2)   The top of the basement floor.
      (3)   The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of
the structure.
      (4)   The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or
pillars.
      (5)   The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement,
below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and
         (c)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a “recreational vehicle”.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE. The building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. MARKET VALUE can be  established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or
adjusted assessed values.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of MITIGATION
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the Federal Government and the
private insurance industry.

vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within
the floodplain.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for which the “start of construction”
commenced after the effective date of the community’s first floodplain
ordinance.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
   NON-BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of any river or stream other than
a boundary river.

any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the
letter A is subject to the 1% annual chance flood. See REGULATORY FLOOD.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community’s FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain
boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These
changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements,
annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base
flood elevations or SFHAs.
   PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE. Anything which is injurious to the safety or
health of an entire community, neighborhood or any considerable number of
persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary
manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projections;

quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGULAR PROGRAM. The phase of the community’s participation in the NFIP
where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and
higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations
determined in a FIS.
   REGULATORY FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable
to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is
as defined in §
156.07. The REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the term BASE FLOOD, 1% ANNUAL
CHANCE FLOOD, and 100-YEAR FLOOD.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeds 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SECTION 1316. That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided
for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly
constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to
be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that
intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood-prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdiction of the
town subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the town are
generally identified as such on the Hamilton County, Indiana and Incorporated
Area Flood Insurance Rate Map dated November 19, 2014 as well as any future
updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as Zone A,
AE, A1- A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial  improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes
recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to it’s before damaged condition would
equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration
of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structures continued designation as a historic structure.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type
of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. See definition for A ZONE.
   ZONE B, C, AND X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded  by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C).
(Ord. 10-21-2014-2, passed 11-4-14)
§ 156.06 LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all SFHAs and known flood prone areas within the
jurisdiction of the Town of Cicero.
(Ord. 10-21-2014-2, passed 11-4-14)
§ 156.07 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING REGULATORY FLOOD DATA.
   This chapter’s protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best
available regulatory flood data is listed below.
   (A)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the Town of Cicero shall be as
delineated on the 1% annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study
of Hamilton County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas dated November 19, 2014 and
the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map dated November 19, 2014 as well as
any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency with the most recent date.
   (B)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each
of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the town, delineated as an “A Zone” on
the Hamilton County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map
dated November 19, 2014 as well as any future updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area
from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace existing
data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review, subsequently approved.
   (C)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification
on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of
any watercourse in the community’s known flood prone areas shall be according
to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural

(Ord. 10-21-2014-2, passed 11-4-14)
§ 156.44 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
156.07, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/ improvement to a residence
in a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources).
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in this subchapter have been met. The
floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit for
construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory
flood elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-
floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
(Ord. 10-21-2014-2, passed 11-4-14)
§ 156.45 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in this subchapter have been met. The key provision is
that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure
shall be at or above the FPG.
(Ord. 10-21-2014-2, passed 11-4-14)
§ 156.46 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway permit (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway permit (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in this subchapter have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this
subchapter have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and will not increase flood damages
or potential flood damages.

      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship; and

§ 157.02 ESTABLISHMENT OF IMPACT ZONE.
   (A)   There is hereby established one Infrastructure Impact Zone, the
boundaries of which are co-terminus with the existing corporate boundaries of
the Town of Cicero, Indiana, and, as they may be extended from time to time
through annexation, and over which the Town of Cicero exercises planning and
zoning jurisdiction. In this regard, the Town Council specifically finds that
there is a functional relationship between the components of the Plan and that
such Park and Recreational Plan provides a reasonably uniform benefit to all
citizens throughout the Impact Zone as of the adoption of this chapter. The
Town Council further finds that all areas within the Impact Zone are contiguous
as required by I.C. 36-7-4-1316. Except as provided herein, this chapter shall
apply uniformly to all residential developments within the Impact Zone hereby
established for which the town may require a structural building permit and
which creates a need for new and additional park and recreational
infrastructure.
   (B)   This chapter shall not apply to:
      (1)   Developments meeting the requirements set forth in I.C. 36-7-4-1322
(g);
      (2)   Improvements which do not require a structural building permit;
      (3)   Improvements which do not create a need for new and additional
infrastructure, including the erection of a sign, construction of accessory
buildings, structures, or fences or the alteration, interior and/or exterior
renovation, or expansion of an improvement where the use, or intensity thereof,
has not changed;
      (4)   The replacement of a destroyed or partially destroyed improvement,
provided that the replacement improvement does not create a need for new and
additional infrastructure over and above the infrastructure needed by the
original improvement prior to the destruction or partial destruction thereof;
or
      (5)   Nonresidential development.

§ 157.03 ZONE IMPROVEMENT PLAN.
   (A)   As a precondition to the adoption of this chapter, the Town Council
undertook a comprehensive and detailed park and recreational impact analysis
through the employment for that purpose of Lehman. The Town Council now finds
that the resulting study and data base constitute a sufficient study to
constitute a “Zone Improvement Plan” as contemplated by I.C. 36-7-4-1318.
   (B)   The Town Council does hereby adopt the Plan prepared by Lehman, dated
March 2022, as its Zone Improvement Plan and specifically finds that said Zone
Improvement Plan contains the following elements:
      (1)   Reasonable estimates relating to the nature and location of
development that is expected within the Impact Zone during the planning period,
which, for purposes of this chapter, is defined to be a period of ten years
commencing with the date of adoption hereof;
      (2)   A reasonable determination of the community level of service for
the Impact Zone;
      (3)   A reasonable determination of the current level of service provided
within the Impact Zone;
      (4)   A reasonable estimate of the nature, location, sequencing, and
timing of the park and recreational requirements and costs necessary to provide
the community level of service for the developments contemplated in division
(B)(1) of this section;
      (5)   A reasonable estimate of the share of the park and recreational
costs identified in division (B)(4) above that will be used to:
         (a)   Raise the current level of service for existing development; or
         (b)   Provide service to new development.
      (6)   A reasonable estimate of revenues that:
         (a)   Are from sources other than impact fees; and
         (b)   Will be used to finance the cost identified in division (B)(5)
(a) above.
      (7)   A description of the nature and location of existing infrastructure
in the Impact Zone; and
      (8)   A general description of the sources and amounts of money used to
pay for infrastructure during the previous five years. Additionally, the Town
Council hereby specifically adopts the Zone Improvement Plan as an official
part of the Comprehensive Plan of the Town of Cicero, pursuant to I.C. 36-7-4-
500 et seq.

§ 157.04 ESTABLISHMENT OF PARK AND RECREATIONAL IMPACT FEE.
   (A)   Based upon the Plan previously referred to and which is made a part of
this chapter, the Town Council determines that the cost per equivalent single-
family dwelling unit is $604. Based on the equivalent dwelling unit
calculations used by the town, the Town Council hereby establishes the Park and
Recreation Impact Fee in the following amounts for single-family units,
duplexes, apartments, condominiums, and mobile homes:
 
Type of Unit                         Fee Per Dwelling Unit Full Equivalent
Detached single family housing units $1,205                100%
Multi-family housing units           $1,024                85%
 
   (B)   The Town Council hereby makes as a part of the record of these
proceedings all of the data collected, the calculations made, and the
conclusions reached by Umbaugh in the process of developing the Zone
Improvement Plan, and specifically instructs the employees of the town to make
such data and other information inclusively available to anyone for review
during regular business hours.
   (C)   In the event that any parcel of real estate considered in the creation
of the Zone Improvement Plan undergoes a change in use, redevelopment, or a
modification which requires a structural building permit, and creates a need
for new infrastructure, an impact fee will only be assessed for the increase in
the burden on infrastructure.

§ 157.05 CREDIT IN LIEU OF PAYMENT; EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   I.C. 36-7-4-1335 authorizes a fee payer to receive a credit against
the fee under certain circumstances. Any person or entity obligated to pay a
fee pursuant to the terms of this chapter may have the option of financing,
constructing, and dedicating park and recreational infrastructure to be owned
and operated by the town for the public benefit, all as described and defined
in the Plan, instead of making all or part of any impact fee payment which may
be due, so long as such financing, construction, and dedication are
accomplished pursuant to the Plan of the town, and in accordance with the park
and recreational specifications for such park and recreational infrastructure
to be improved in force within the town's jurisdiction at the time. Such fee
payer, or other person or entity providing the infrastructure or improvement,
shall be given credit for the actual costs of planning, financing, and
constructing such park and recreational infrastructure or improvement dedicated
to the town. Such request for credit shall be presented prior to the issuance
of the structural building permit. In the event the actual cost of such
planning, financing, and construction do not equal the amount of the impact fee
pursuant to the calculation provided for in the schedule set forth in §
157.04, the remaining balance shall be due in accordance with the provisions
stated hereafter.
   (B)   Credits against impact fees otherwise due shall be allowed pursuant to
this section for all infrastructure improvements constructed or furnished in
accordance with I.C. 36-7-4-1313 and I.C. 36-7-4-1335 since January 1, 2007. In
addition, a fee payer or other person or entity responsible for installing
infrastructure or improvements may designate in writing a method of allocating
its credits to future fee payers who may be successors in interest to the
credits earned by the fee payer or others, as part of the certification
provided for above. Any person or entity otherwise obligated to pay the fee
established by this chapter whose property was totally or partially destroyed
by fire, storm, or other casualty beyond his, her or its control, shall be
exempt from said fee if he, she or it repairs or replaces the destroyed
structure without creating a burden on infrastructure greater than the burden
imposed by the destroyed infrastructure. In the event of such additional
burden, the fee shall be calculated based only on the increased burden created
by the structure.

§ 157.06 IMPACT FEE DUE UPON ISSUANCE OF STRUCTURAL BUILDING PERMIT.
   (A)   The impact fee imposed pursuant to the terms of this chapter shall be
due and payable upon the issuance of a structural building permit by the Town
of Cicero. It is understood that the structural permit is synonymous with the
term "structural building permit" as that term is used in I.C. 36-7-4-1323, in
that the issuance of a structural building permit authorizes the applicant to
commence construction activities, structural and otherwise. The entire fee
which is calculated pursuant to the terms of this chapter shall be due at said
time unless the amount of the fee upon calculation is greater than $5,000, in
which case an installment plan may be requested by the applicant in accordance
with the terms set forth in I.C. 36-7-4-1324(a) through (d). The Cicero Impact
Fee Review Board shall establish specific rules consistent with said code
provisions for installment payments. The interest rate on any installment plan
or deferred payment shall be at the rate allowed on judgments established by
Indiana Code, as from time to time amended. The penalty for late payments, if
any, shall be established at the discretion of the Impact Fee Review Board.
   (B)   If a fee payer requests, the amount of the impact fee shall be
assessed upon the voluntary submission of a development plan or upon the
issuance of the structural building permit, whichever is earlier. For purposes
of this section, "assessment" means the act of calculating the amount of the
impact fee which shall be due. The town shall make such assessment within 30
days of the date of such voluntary request or at the issuance of the structural
building permit with or without a request.

§ 157.07 LIEN RIGHTS ESTABLISHED.
   Pursuant to I.C. 36-7-4-1325, the Town of Cicero acquires a lien against the
real estate which is the subject of the impact fee. Upon adoption, this chapter
shall be recorded, and, thereafter, it shall constitute constructive notice of
the lien rights of the Town of Cicero with respect to a parcel of real estate
which is the subject of an installment payment of an impact fee. The town may,
in its discretion, file a specific instrument setting forth its lien rights
with respect to a parcel of real estate which is the subject of an installment
payment of an impact fee, and such instrument shall constitute actual notice in
addition to the constructive notice provided for by the recording of this
chapter.

§ 157.08 FORM OF RECEIPT.
   The Cicero Clerk-Treasurer shall issue a receipt for any and all impact fees
collected, and the form of such receipt shall be as follows:
   “Received of               (fee payer)                       , this
              day of                            the sum of $              in
(full) (partial) satisfaction of Park and Recreation Impact Fees due pursuant
to Cicero Town Council Ordinance No.               relating to improvements to
be constructed on the real estate described on Exhibit A, attached hereto, made
part hereof, and subject to lien rights in favor of the Town of Cicero in the
event of partial payment with payments remaining due. The remaining balance due
(if any) is in the following amount: $               . This impact fee is
dedicated to the creation of the following infrastructure element in accordance
with the Zone Improvement Plan:

§ 157.09 APPEALS.
   (A)   Any fee payer who believes itself to be aggrieved by the calculation
of the impact fee may appeal from such calculation to the Cicero Impact Fee
Review Board, and the Cicero Impact Fee Review Board shall conduct a hearing
with regard thereto. At such hearing, the fee payer shall bear the burden of
going forward with the evidence and shall present evidence addressing either of
the following propositions:
      (1)   A fact assumption used in determining the amount of the impact fee
is incorrect; or
      (2)   The amount of the impact fee is greater than the amount allowed
under I.C. 36-7-4-1320, 36-7-4-1321 and 36-7-4-1322.
   (B)   Upon conclusion of the hearing at which the matter is first presented,
or at the conclusion of the hearing if the matter is continued, the Town Impact
Fee Review Board shall make a determination based upon the facts presented and
may reverse, affirm, modify, or make such adjustments in the impact fee as it
believes are appropriate under the circumstances, if any, including
establishing the amount of an impact fee, a credit, a refund, or any
combination of fees, credits, or refunds.
   (C)   The Cicero Impact Fee Review Board shall provide a copy of its
decision to the town, the Infrastructure Agency and the fee payer involved in
the appeal within five days after making its decision, and shall make written
findings of fact to support its decision.
   (D)   An appeal under this section must be filed not later than 30 days
after the issuance of the structural building permit. The appeal shall be
initiated with the filing of a Petition for Review with the Cicero Clerk-
Treasurer's office, together with a filing fee in the amount of $100. The
filing fee shall be refunded in full if:
      (1)   The Petition for Review is granted and the impact fee is
eliminated, reduced, or adjusted by the Cicero Impact Fee Review Board, by
independent action of the Town of Cicero, or by a court having jurisdiction;
and
      (2)   The reviewing body determines that the amount of the fees,
reductions, or credits were arbitrary or capricious.
   (E)   The Petition for Review shall be in a form calculated to inform the
Cicero Impact Fee Review Board of the nature of the complaint, the parties to
the action, and the relief requested. In addition, the Petition shall describe
the new development on which the impact fee has been assessed, all facts
related to the assessment of the impact fee, and the reasons the petitioner
believes that the amount of the impact fee assessed is erroneous or is greater
than the amount allowed by the fee limitations set forth in the enabling
statute.
   (F)   The town shall not deny the issuance of a structural building permit
on the basis that the impact fee has not been paid, or condition issuance of
the permit on the payment of the impact fee. If the impact fee totals $1,000 or
less, the town may require the fee payer to pay the impact fee or initiate an
appeal under this section before the structural building permit is issued.

§ 157.13 HOUSE ENROLLED ACT 1467.
   The Cicero Town Council specifically acknowledges the existence of a law
adopted by the General Assembly of the State of Indiana which regulates the
imposition of impact fee ordinances by municipal corporations within the State
of Indiana. It is the intent of the Town of Cicero to comply with such
legislation, and this chapter shall be construed in all respects to be
consistent with the Act. The substantive and procedural requirements of I.C.
36-7-4-1300 et seq. shall control in the event of conflicts, which are
unintended by the Town Council.

§ 157.14 AMENDMENT AND REVIEW.
   The impact fee provided for herein is based upon data which, in large part,
is subject to inflation and other economic and market forces over which the
Town of Cicero has no control. The Town Council may, not less than once each
year, cause a review to be made by town staff or consultants as may be required
to determine the continuing validity of the impact fee, the Impact Fee Zone,
and the Zone Improvement Plan. The Town Council shall consider and adopt such
amendments as are necessary to cause a substantive compliance with the rational
nexus test to continue, to ensure that procedural due process is maintained or
enhanced, and to ensure that this chapter meets the requirements of the I.C.
36-7-4-1300 series. To the extent required by the facts and circumstances, this
process shall include the steps necessary to update the Zone Improvement Plan
and the Comprehensive Plan.
(Ord. 10-16-2007-3, passed 12-18-07; Am. Ord. 12-18-2012-3, passed 12-18-12)

approval and publication according to law.
