§ 10.01 TITLE OF CODE.
   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the town, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered, and consolidated into component codes,
titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the “New
Harmony Town Code,” for which designation “code of ordinances,” “codified
ordinances,” or “code” may be substituted. Code title, chapter, and section
headings do not constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.
§ 10.02 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.03 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.04 CONSTRUCTION OF CODE.
   (A)   This code is a codification of previously existing laws, amendments
thereto, and newly enacted laws. Any previously existing law or amendment
thereto reenacted by this code shall continue in operation and effect, as if it
had not been repealed by this code. All rules and regulations adopted under
laws reenacted in this code shall remain in full force and effect unless
repealed or amended subsequent to the enactment of this code.
   (B)   Any appropriation repealed and reenacted by this code is continued
only for the period designated in the original enactment of that appropriation.
   (C)   The numerical order and position of sections in this code does not
resolve a conflict between two or more sections.
   (D)   Any irreconcilable conflict between sections shall be resolved by
reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or division.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters, or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)
§ 10.05 RULES OF INTERPRETATION; DEFINITIONS.

usual sense. Technical words and phrases having a peculiar and appropriate

      (2)   Words imputing joint authority to three or more persons shall be
construed as imputing authority to a majority of the persons unless otherwise
declared in the section giving the authority.
      (3)   Where a section requires an act to be done which, by law, an agent
or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.
      (4)   Words denoting the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the
feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,
and words in the plural shall include the singular; the use of a verb in the
present tense shall include the future, if applicable.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this code of ordinances, the following

§ 10.06 SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   If any section of this code now enacted or subsequently amended or its
application to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid section
or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is severable.
If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of
whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a section or amendment stating that the provisions of a
chapter, subchapter, or section are severable as provided in division (B) above
does not affect the operation of division (B) above with respect to that
chapter, subchapter, or section.
(I.C. 1-1-1-8)
§ 10.07 REFERENCE TO OTHER SECTIONS.
   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof, the

amended, revised, recodified, or renumbered unless the subject matter is
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OFFICES; NAME DESIGNATIONS.
   (A)   Reference to offices. Reference to a public office or officer shall be
deemed to apply to any office, officer, or employee of this municipality
exercising the powers, duties, or functions contemplated in the provision,
irrespective of any transfer of functions or change in the official title of
the functionary.
   (B)   Name designations. Whenever any ordinance or resolution of the Council
refers to any board, bureau, commission, division, department, officer, agency,
authority, or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; on the effective date of that ordinance or following the
effective date, the rights, powers, duties, or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority, or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date
or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which the duties,
liabilities, powers, and rights were transferred.
(I.C. 1-1-6-1)
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
the error.
§ 10.10 REASONABLE TIME.
   (A)   In all cases where an ordinance requires an act to be done in a
reasonable time or requires reasonable notice to be given, REASONABLE TIME OR
NOTICE shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of the act or the giving of the notice.
   (B)   The time within which an act is to be done, as herein provided, shall
be computed by excluding the first day and including the last. If the last day
be a Saturday, Sunday, or a state holiday, it shall be excluded.
§ 10.11 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under
the section unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture, or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected
by the repeal and reenactment; but all suits, proceedings, and prosecutions for
causes arising or acts committed prior to the effective date of this code may
be commenced and prosecuted with the same effect as if this code had not been
enacted.

section of this code, the chapter or section shall be specifically repealed and
a new chapter or section, containing the desired amendment, substituted in its
place.
   (B)   Any ordinance which is proposed to add to the existing code a new
chapter or section shall indicate, with reference to the arrangement of this
code, the proper number of the chapter or section. In addition to an indication
thereof as may appear in the text of the proposed ordinance, a caption or title
shall be shown in concise form above the ordinance.
§ 10.15 SECTION HISTORIES; STATUTORY REFERENCES.
   (A)   As histories for the code sections, the specific number and passage

this code shall be prosecuted and remain punishable as provided by those laws.

days after the date of the action appealed from. A copy of the notice shall
promptly be served upon the official from whom the appeal is taken who shall
forthwith transmit to the Board all records upon which the action appealed from
was taken. An appeal shall stay all proceedings, decisions, or orders unless

variances:
   (A)   Where it is alleged that there is error or misinterpretation in any
order, requirement, decision, or refusal made by the Zoning Administrator or
other administrative agency or official of the municipality in the carrying out
of the provisions of the zoning ordinance;
   (B)   Where it is alleged that by reason of the exceptional narrowness,
shallowness, or shape of a specific piece of property or by reason of
exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation of the land
or building or of the use of property immediately adjoining the property in
question, the literal enforcement of the zoning ordinance would involve
practical difficulties or would cause undue hardship; provided, that the Board
shall not grant a variance on a lot if the owner or member of his or her family
owns or owned adjacent land which could, without undue hardship, be included as
part of the lot; or
   (C)   Where it is alleged that there is practical difficulty or unnecessary
hardship in carrying out of the strict letter of the zoning ordinance and a
request made to vary such regulations, so that the spirit of the zoning
ordinance shall be observed, public safety secured, and substantial justice
done.
(Prior Code, § 2.28.060) (Ord. 1973-2, passed - -)
§ 32.076 VARIANCES PROHIBITED.
   No variance in the provision or requirements of the zoning ordinance shall
be authorized by the Board unless the Board finds from reasonable evidence that
such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property and
will not materially impair the intent and purposes of the zoning ordinance or
of the public health, safety, and welfare, and further, that two of the
following facts and conditions exist.
   (A)   There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions
applying to the specific property that do not apply generally to other
properties in the same zone.
   (B)   Such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right similar to that possessed by other properties in the
zone, provided that increased financial return shall not be deemed sufficient
to warrant a variance.
   (C)   The condition or situation of the specific property or the intended
use is not of so general or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably practical
a general regulation as part of the zoning ordinance.
(Prior Code, § 2.28.070) (Ord. 1973-2, passed - -)

Historic Preservation Commission (Plan Commission) is received; provided, such
report shall be made within 30 days of the next regularly scheduled Town Plan
and Historic Preservation Commission (Plan Commission) meeting.

Before authorizing a use, the Board shall determine whether the proposal would
be hazardous, harmful, or a nuisance to the surrounding neighborhood by reason
of noise, atmospheric pollution, vibration, glare fire potential, parking,
traffic aesthetic effect, devaluation of property values, or psychological
effects. For such purpose, the Board may enlist experts, technicians, and
consultants. The Board may impose such additional requirements and conditions
necessary to preserve the intent of the zoning ordinance.

cause for the failure to act or complete within such periods and if the Board
further finds that conditions have altered or changed in the interval since the
action was granted, the Board shall revoke or rescind its approval.
      (2)   Should the applicant fail to obtain the necessary permit or fail to
commence work within such three-month period, it shall be conclusively presumed

(Prior Code, § 3.04.050) (Ord. 2017-3, passed 2-21-2017)
FIXED CAPITALIZATION POLICY
§ 33.20 DEFINITIONS AND PROVISIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   CAPITAL OUTLAYS. Expenditures which benefit both the current and future
fiscal periods. This includes costs of acquiring land or structures;
construction or improvement of buildings, structures, or other fixed assets;
and equipment purchases having an appreciable and calculable period of
usefulness. These are expenditures resulting in the acquisition of or addition
to the government’s general fixed assets.
   ENTERPRISE FUNDS. 
      (1)   Those funds used to account for operations:
         (a)   That are financed and operated in a manner similar to private
business enterprise where the intent of the governing body is that the costs of
providing goods or services to the general public on a continuing basis be
financed or recovered primarily through user charges; or
         (b)   Where the governing body has decided that periodic determination
of revenues earned, expenses incurred, and/or net income is appropriate for
capital maintenance, public policy, management control, accountability, and
other purposes.
      (2)   The ENTERPRISE FUNDS of the town shall include the municipally
owned gas, water, and sewage utilities. Operation of these utilities shall
require ENTERPRISE FUND accounting and reporting.
   FIXED ASSET. Tangible assets of a durable nature employed in the operating
activities of the unit and that are relatively permanent and are needed for the
production or sale of goods or services. These assets are not held for sale in
the ordinary course of business. This broad group is separated into the
following five classes according to the physical characteristics of the items.
      (1)   Land. The town will capitalize all land purchases, regardless of
cost. In the case of donated land, fair market value on the date of transfer
shall be used. Exceptions to land capitalization are land purchased outright,
as easements, or rights-of-way for infrastructure. Examples of infrastructures
are roads and streets, street lighting systems, bridges, overpasses, sidewalks,
curbs, street signs, viaducts, wharfs, and storm water collection. Original
cost of land will include the full value given to the seller, including
relocation, legal services incident to the purchase, appraisal and negotiation
fees, surveying, and costs for preparing the land for its intended purpose,
such as demolishing buildings, excavating, clean-up, and/or inspection.
      (2)   Buildings. 
         (a)   The town will capitalize buildings of full cost with no
subcategories for tracking the cost of attachments. Examples of attachments are
roofs, heating, cooling, plumbing, lighting, or sprinkler systems, or any part
of the basic building. The town will include the cost of items designed or
purchased exclusively for the building. If a building is acquired by gift,
appraised value at the time of acquisition shall be used.
         (b)   A new building will be capitalized only if it meets the
following conditions:
            1.   The total cost exceeds an amount as set by the Town Council
from time to time; and
            2.   The useful life is greater than two years.
         (c)   Improvements or renovations to an existing building will be
capitalized only if the result meets all of the following conditions:
            1.   The total cost exceeds an amount as set by the Town Council
from time to time;
            2.   The useful life is extended two or more years; and
            3.   The total cost will be greater than the current book value and
less than the fair market value.
         (d)   Capital building costs will include preparation of land for the
building, architectural and engineering fees, bond issuance fees, interest cost
(while under construction), accounting costs if material, and any costs
directly attributable to the construction of a building.
      (3)   Improvements other than buildings. 
         (a)   The town will capitalize the acquisition value of permanent
improvements, other than buildings, which have been added to the land. Examples
are walks, parking areas and drives, fencing, retaining walls, gutters,
tunnels, and bridges. Donated improvements other than buildings will be
recorded at fair market value on the date of transfer with any associated
costs. Improvements do not include roads, streets, or assets that are of value
only to the public.
         (b)   The town will capitalize new improvements other than buildings
only if the following conditions are met:
            1.   The total cost exceeds an amount as set by the Town Council
from time to time; and
            2.   The useful life is greater than two years.
      (4)   Equipment. The town will capitalize items with an individual value
equal to or greater than an amount as set by the Town Council from time to
time. EQUIPMENT is defined as an apparatus, tool, or conglomeration of pieces
to form a tool. The tool will stand alone and not become a part of a basic
structure or building. Donated equipment will be recorded at fair market value
on the date of transfer with any associated costs. Equipment combined with
other equipment to form one unit with a total value equal to or greater than an
amount as set by the Town Council from time to time will be one unit. For
example, a department’s computer (CPU, monitor, keyboard, and printer) shall be
considered one unit. Shipping charges, consultant fees, and any other cost
directly associated with the purchase, delivery, or set up, which makes such
equipment operable for its intended purpose, will be capitalized.
      (5)   Construction work in progress.
         (a)   Where construction work has not been completed in the current
calendar year, the cost of the project shall be carried as “construction work
in progress.” When the project is completed, the total cost shall be
capitalized as part of the inventory of the department authorizing the project.
         (b)   Any purchases made using federal or state funding will follow
the source funding policies and above procedures.
   HISTORICAL COST. The cash equivalent price exchanged for goods or services
at the date of acquisition. Land, buildings, equipment, and most inventories
are common examples of items recognized under the HISTORICAL COST attribute.
   TANGIBLE ASSETS. Assets that can be observed by one or more of the physical
senses. They may be seen and touched and, in some environments, heard and
smelled.
(Prior Code, § 3.16.010) (Ord. 1997-1, passed - -)
§ 33.21 RECORDING AND ACCOUNTING.
   (A)   The town and its various departments shall classify capital
expenditures as capital outlays within the fund from which the expenditure was
made in accordance with the chart of accounts of the cities and towns
accounting manual. The cost of property, plant, and equipment includes all
expenditures necessary to put the asset into position and ready for use. For
purposes of recording fixed assets of the town and its departments, the
valuation of assets shall be based on historical cost or where historical cost
is indeterminable, by estimation for those assets in existence.
   (B)   The town’s municipally-owned utilities shall record acquisition of
fixed assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The
acquisition shall be recorded at the amount paid, plus all outlays relating to
its purchase and preparation for intended use. The valuation of assets of
municipally-owned utilities shall be based on historical cost. An asset
register (State Board of Accounts prescribed Form 211) shall be maintained to
provide a detailed record of the capital assets of the governmental unit.
(Prior Code, § 3.16.020) (Ord. 1997-1, passed - -)
§ 33.22 SAFEGUARDING OF ASSETS.
   Accounting controls shall be designed and implemented to provide reasonable
assurances that:
   (A)   Capital expenditures. Capital expenditures made by the town and its
various departments and utilities be in accordance with management’s
authorization as documented in the minutes;
   (B)   Transactions of the utilities. Transactions of the utilities be
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted principles;
   (C)   Adequate detail records. Adequate detail records be maintained to
assure accountability for town and utility owned assets;
   (D)   Access to assets. Access to assets be permitted in accordance with

§ 51.11 LIMITATION OF USERS.
   (A)   In order to ensure correct and sufficient water pressure flow to all
users, the Town Council reserves the right to limit the number of users on
water lines that presently extend, or will in the future extend, beyond the
town limits of the town. Users outside the town limits shall bear all expenses
of procuring easements for water lines. The lines and the easements for said
lines shall become the property of the town. The maintenance and repair of said
water mains and easements shall be the responsibility of the town. The town
shall bear the expense of maintaining and repairing said service lines, mains,
and easements up to the meter outlet. Each user shall continue to be
responsible for the maintenance, repair, and replacement of water lines on his
or her own property beyond the meter. After all tap-in and water lines have
been installed, but prior to being covered with earth, all tap-ins and water
lines must be inspected and approved by the town’s Water Department, and no
tap-ins or water lines shall be covered with earth until said inspection is
completed and written approval furnished to the owner.
   (B)   Each user outside the town limits, by becoming a user of the town’s
water utility, grants the water utility the right to enter onto the user’s

Treasurer or the Water Works Supervisor immediately upon a meter becoming
inoperative or upon suspicion that a meter is inoperative.
(Prior Code, § 13.08.100) (Ord. 2000-6, passed - -)
§ 51.13 CROSS-CONNECTION.
   (A)    Intent. It is the intent of this section to comply with the rules
pertaining to operation of a public water supply as outlined in 327 I.A.C. 8-10
et seq.
   (B)   Definition. For the purpose of this section, the following definition
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      CROSS-CONNECTION. Any physical connection or arrangement between two
otherwise separate systems, one of which contains potable water from the town
water system, and the other, water from a private source, water of unknown or
questionable safety, or steam, gases, or chemicals, whereby there may be a flow
from one system to the other, the direction of flow depending on the pressure
differential between the two systems.
   (C)   Cross-connection prohibited. No person, firm, or corporation shall
establish or permit to be established or maintain or permit to be maintained
any cross-connection. No interconnection shall be established whereby potable
water from a private, auxiliary, or emergency water supply other than the
regular public water supply of the town may enter the supply or distribution
system of the municipality, unless such private, auxiliary, or emergency water
supply and the method of connection and use of such supply shall have been
approved by the town water utility and by the Environmental Management Board.
   (D)   Inspection. It shall be the duty of either the Water Utility
Supervisor or the County Department of Health to cause inspections to be made
of all properties served by the public water system where cross-connections
with the public water system is deemed possible. The frequency of inspections
and the reinspections based on potential health involved shall be as
established by either entity and based upon the exigency of any known
circumstances.
   (E)   Entry of premises. Upon presentation of credentials, the
representative of either the water utility system or the County Department of
Health shall have the right to request entry at any reasonable time to examine
any property served by a connection to the public water system of the town for
cross-connections. On request, the owner, lessee, or occupant of any property
so served shall furnish to the inspection agency any pertinent information
regarding the piping system or systems on such property. The refusal of access
or refusal of requested pertinent information shall be deemed evidence of the
presence of cross-connections.
   (F)   Discontinuance of water service. The town water utility is authorized
and directed to discontinue water service to any property wherein any
connection violation of this chapter exists, and to take such other
precautionary measures deemed necessary to eliminate any danger of
contamination of the public water system. Water service shall be discontinued
only after reasonable notice is served on the owner, lessee, or occupants of
the property or premises where a violation is found or suspected to exist.
Water service to such property shall not be restored until the cross-connection
has been eliminated in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. If it is
deemed by the town water utility that a cross-connection or an emergency
endangers public health, safety, or welfare and requires immediate action, and
a written finding to that effect is filed with the Town Clerk-Treasurer and
delivered to the consumer’s premises, service may be immediately discontinued.
The consumer shall have an opportunity for hearing within ten days of such
emergency discontinuance.
   (G)   Backflow preventer required. 
      (1)   All consumers using toxic or hazardous liquids, all mortuaries,
wastewater treatment plants, laboratories, and all other hazardous users shall
install and maintain a reduced-pressure-principle backflow preventer in the
main water line serving each building on the premises. The backflow preventer
must be installed in an easily accessible location not subject to flooding or
freezing.
      (2)   It shall be the duty of any customer-user at any premises where
backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have certified inspections and
operational tests made upon installation and at least once per year. In those
instances where the Town Municipal Utilities Superintendent deems the hazard to
be great enough, the Superintendent may require inspection at more frequent
intervals. The inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the water user
and shall be performed by a certified tester registered and approved by the
state and town municipal utilities. It shall be the duty of the customer to see
that these tests are made in a timely manner. If a customer-user does not have
its backflow prevention assembly tested within 30 days of the testing due date,
the town municipal utilities may discontinue water service to the premises to
maintain the safety of the public water system. These assemblies shall be
repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the expense of the customer-user whenever
said assemblies are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs, and
overhaul shall be kept by the customer-user and a copy furnished to the town
municipal utilities.
   (H)   Supplementing other legislature. This section does not supersede the
State Uniform Plumbing Code or the town Construction Standards for Potable
Water, but is supplemental to them.
   (I)   Violations. Any person found to be violating any provision of this
section shall be served by the town with written notice stating the nature of
the violation and providing a reasonable time limit for the satisfactory
correction thereof. The offender shall, within the period of time stated in
such notice, permanently cease all violations.
(Prior Code, § 13.08.110) (Ord. 2000-6, passed - -; Ord. 2016-9, passed 6-21-
2016)
§ 51.14 LIMITS OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE TOWN WATER UTILITY.
   The town water works shall have the responsibility of operating and
maintaining all mains, service lines, and curb stop valves having the following
definitions.
   CURB STOP VALVE. A valve suitably connected to the service line. This valve
is of sufficient design to be long lived and operable only by personnel of the
Water Department. Every residential, municipal, industrial user connected to
the Town Water Department shall have a locatable and operable curb stop valve
for use by the Water Department personnel in cases of emergency or termination
of service. The CURB STOP VALVE is the piece of equipment which separates the
Water Department responsibility from the user’s responsibility. It is the
responsibility of the Water Department to maintain all piping and valves up to
and including the curb stop valve. Maintenance of any piping or plumbing
devices connected to the CURB STOP VALVE is the responsibility of the
residential, industrial, or municipal user. In cases where a leak is noted, the
CURB STOP VALVE should be turned off. If the leak stops upon closing the curb
stop valve, the leak is beyond the meter outlet and therefore the
responsibility of the user. If however, the leak persists after closing the
CURB STOP VALVE, the leak is between the meter and the CURB STOP VALVE and is
the responsibility of the Water Department.
   TAP/SERVICE LINE. A valve or “T” installed in or on a water main for the
purpose of supplying water to residential, industrial, or municipal users. The
SERVICE LINE, regardless of size or length is defined as a pipe (plastic,
copper, steel, and the like) connected to the tapping valve for the purpose of
supplying water to a residential, industrial, or municipal user.
   WATER MAIN. A pipe of any size or material of construction (cast iron,
steel, plastic) which transports water from a water tank or well pump to
another main or to a residential, industrial, commercial or municipal service
line. A MAIN may in some instances be truncated (dead ended) with a valve on
the end. If another pipe (regardless of size) is connected to the valve and the
line extended for the purpose of transporting water to other service lines, the
extended portion of the pipe becomes a part of the MAIN system.
(Prior Code, § 13.08.120) (Ord. 2000-6, passed - -)
§ 51.15 RIGHT OF ENTRY.
   The Superintendent, inspector, and other duly authorized employees of the
town bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter
upon all properties for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement,
sampling, testing, and repairs, in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
(Prior Code, § 13.08.130) (Ord. 2000-2, passed - -)
§ 51.16 LANDSCAPE HYDRANTS.
   (A)   Application for exemption. 
      (1)   Any residential and/or commercial customer of the town sewage
treatment facilities who has a metered water line used exclusively for
irrigation purposes may apply to the Town Clerk-Treasurer on an application
form approved by the Clerk-Treasurer, for an exemption from any sewer billing
associated with the use of such line. Upon the presentation of such application
by such residential and/or commercial customer, and following review by the
Clerk-Treasurer, the Clerk-Treasurer may issue such exemption in writing to the
applicant. Any exemption so issued shall be reviewed on an annual basis.
      (2)   At any time the Clerk-Treasurer is unable or unwilling to issue
such an exemption, the application shall be subject to automatic review by the
Town Council for final determination.
   (B)   Termination of exemption. In the event that a residential and/or
commercial customer granted an exemption discontinues the use of a metered
water line for irrigation purposes only, it shall be the responsibility of such
customer to notify the town Clerk-Treasurer immediately, whereupon the
exemption granted by the Clerk-Treasurer shall be terminated in writing to the
customer.
   (C)   Commencement of exemption. No exemption from the existing policies and
procedures of the town regarding the calculation of sewage bills shall commence
until the exemption letter is issued by either the Clerk-Treasurer or the Town
Council. It is the intent of this chapter that any exemptions granted shall act
prospectively and not retroactively.
(Prior Code, § 13.08.140) (Ord. 2000-2, passed - -)
§ 51.17 FIRE HYDRANTS.
   (A)   Generally. The town water works shall have the responsibility of
maintaining all fire hydrants. The health and safety of the customers require
the fire hydrants to be in adequate working condition and that water be readily
accessible for the use for which the hydrants were intended.
   (B)   Use allowed; exceptions. Excepting the normal course of business for
which the fire hydrants were intended or upon notice and special permission
granted by the Town Council and under the supervision of the Water
Superintendent, no person or entity, commercial or otherwise, shall in any way
tamper with, open, obstruct, utilize, drain or consume the contents of the
town’s fire hydrants.
(Prior Code, § 13.08.145) (Ord. 2001-9, passed - -)
§ 51.18 WATER CONSERVATION MEASURES.
   (A)   Application. This section shall apply to all persons, firms,
partnerships, corporations, company, or organizations connected to the town
public water system or using water therefrom (hereafter, users).
   (B)   Declaration of need. Upon determining that the town’s public water
system is in a condition of water shortage, the town shall declare a water
conservation emergency and establish the appropriate measures and duration
thereof.
   (C)   Conservation measures. Practices that conserve water should be used at
all times. Examples of conservation measures include:
      (1)   Judiciously sprinkling, watering, or irrigating shrubbery, trees,
grass, ground covers, plants, vines, gardens, vegetables, or any other
vegetation; eliminating wasteful sprinkling of impervious surfaces, such as
streets and sidewalks;
      (2)   Limiting water use while washing trucks, trailers, mobile homes,
railroad cars, or any other type of mobile equipment;
      (3)   Limiting water use while cleaning sidewalks, driveways, paved

      (4)   Repairing or replacing leaking water fixtures and service lines;
      (5)   Using appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers only when
they are full;
      (6)   Turning off water while brushing teeth or shaving;
      (7)   Using a higher lawnmower setting to provide natural ground shade
and promote the soil’s water retention;
      (8)   Washing cars with a bucket of soapy water and using a nozzle to
stop the flow of water from the hose between rinsing; and
      (9)   Covering swimming pools when not in use to reduce evaporation.
   (D)   Voluntary conservation. During moderate water shortages users shall be
requested to reduce water consumption by practicing voluntary conservation. The
town shall identify reasonable and meaningful conservation techniques and
provide such information to users. The town may also implement conservation
pricing and prohibitions to encourage water conservation.
   (E)   Mandatory conservation. During severe water shortages users shall be
prohibited from selected water uses subject to reasonable terms, times, and
conditions as the governing body shall adopt and append to this document.
   (F)   Rationing. In addition to mandatory conservation measures, users shall
be limited during extreme water shortage to water use by the following
schedule.
      (1)   Residential use shall be limited to 200 gallons per residential
unit per day.

   (B)   (1)   The owner or agent of a landowner wishing to connect to the town
sewer system shall make an application for a permit on a special form provided
at the Clerk-Treasurer’s office. The permit application shall be supplemented
by any plans, specifications, or other information considered pertinent or
required in the judgment of the sewer inspector. A permit and inspection fee of
an amount as set by the Town Council from time to time for each sewer permit
for connecting to the sewer line shall be paid to the Clerk-Treasurer at the
time the application is filed. All costs and expenses incident to the
installation and connection of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner
of the property desiring the connection. The costs and expenses shall include
all costs of repairs to property disturbed by the connection and the repavement
of all streets and sidewalks and alleys that are disturbed as a result of such
connection. The owner or the person installing the building sewer for such
owner shall indemnify the town from any loss or damage that may directly or
indirectly be occasioned by such installation. The requirement of
indemnification will be set out in the application for the installation of the
sewer line by the owner of the property seeking the permit. This section and
its terms and conditions is only applicable to the procedures and construction
involved in the initial tap-in of a private sewer to the municipally-owned
sewer line.
      (2)   The property owner or applicant seeking the building sewer permit
shall notify the sewer inspector when the building sewer is ready for final
inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall not be made
unless it is under the supervision of the sewer inspector for the town.
      (3)   In order to ensure correct and sufficient sewer flow and capacity
to all users, the Town Council reserves the right to limit the number of users
on sewer lines that presently extend, or will in the future extend, within and
beyond the town limits. Users outside the town limits shall bear all expenses
of procuring easements for sewer lines. The lines and the easements for such
lines shall become the property of the town. The maintenance and repair of the
sewer pipes, clean-outs, manholes, lift stations, and force mains shall be the
responsibility of the property owner up to the property line. The property
owner is required to maintain an open sewage way from the residence to the
property line or clean-out. The town shall be responsible for maintaining an
open sewage way from the property line or clean-out to the main sewer line. In
the event it is not clearly evident where the individual property line is, it
shall be the responsibility of the property owner to provide proof to the town
of the location of the property line. If maintenance is required on a sewer
service line that does not currently have a clean-out, a clean-out shall be
installed at the property line, at the property owner’s expense.
      (4)   The town shall have the power to compel any user, at the expense of
the user, to repair his or her sewer lateral if, in the opinion of the sewer
inspector, the sewer lateral is broken, collapsed, stopped-up, or is causing
surface subsidence.
   (C)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or driveway, the
building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and
the whole considered as one building sewer.
   (D)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found on examination and test by the inspector to meet all
requirements of this chapter.
   (E)   The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, ASTM specification,
or equal; vitrified clay sewer pipe, ASTM specification, or equal; or other
suitable material approved by the inspector. Joints shall be tight and
waterproof. Any part of the building sewer that is located within ten feet of a
water service pipe shall be constructed of cast iron soil pipe with leaded
joints. Cast iron pipes with leaded joints may be required by the inspector
where the building sewer is exposed to damage by tree roots. If installed in
filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall be of cast iron soil pipe;
except, that nonmetallic material may be accepted if laid on a suitable
concrete bed or cradle as approved by the said inspector.
   (F)   The size and slope of the building sewers shall be subject to the
approval of the inspector, but in no event shall the diameter be less than six
inches. The slope of such six-inch pipe shall not be less than one-eighth inch
per foot.
   (G)   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid
parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby be
weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. The
building sewer shall be laid at a uniform grade and in straight alignment in so
far as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved
pipes and fittings.
   (H)   In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drains shall
be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer. No
water-operated sewage ejector shall be used.
   (I)   All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer
shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the inspector. Pipe
laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM specifications;
except, that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected by
the inspector, or his or her representative.
   (J)   (1)   All joints and connections shall be made gastight and
watertight. Cast iron pipe joints shall be firmly packed with oakum or hemp and
filled with molten lead, Federal Specification QQ-L-156, not less than one-inch
deep. Lead shall be run in one pouring and calked tight. No paint, varnish, or
other coatings shall be permitted on the jointing material until after the
joint has been tested and approved.
      (2)   All joints in vitrified clay pipe or between such pipe and metals
shall be made with approved jointing material in accordance with the latest
edition of Volume III, Plumbing Rules and Regulations of the Administrative
Building Council of the state.
      (3)   Other jointing materials and methods may be used only by approval
of the inspector.
   (K)   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be
made at the “Y” branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If
the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less and no properly located “Y”
branch is available, the owner shall, at his or her expense, install a “Y” in
the public sewer at the location specified by the inspector. Where the public
sewer is greater than 12 inches in diameter, and no properly located “Y” branch
is available, a neat hole may be cut in the public sewer to receive the
building sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about 45
degrees. A 45 degree ell may be used to make such connection, with the spigot
end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The
invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at the same or
at a higher elevation than the invert of the public sewer. A smooth, neat joint
shall be made, and the connection made secure and water tight by encasement in
concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by
the inspector.
   (L)   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the inspector
when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public
sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the inspector, or
his or her representative.
   (M)   All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard.
Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course
of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the town.
   (N)   The town shall have the right to prohibit new connections when the
capacity of the town’s wastewater treatment system is deemed insufficient by
the Town Council to accommodate the expected flow, BOD and/or suspended solid
loading from the prospective wastewater treatment service user.

May 1 through May 31, June 1 through June 30, July 1 through July 31, August 1
through August 31, September 1 through September 30, and October 1 through
October 31, the billing for the wastewater treatment services for residential
and domestic users for said consumption periods shall be based on 100% of the
average water usage for the immediately preceding three-month consecutive off
season consumption periods of December 1 through December 31, January 1 through
January 31, and February 1 through February 28. In the event the average water
usage for the said off season periods is greater than the water usage for said
billing period of either May 1 through May 31, June 1 through June 30, July 1
through July 31, August 1 through August 31, September 1 through September 31,

the wastewater treatment bill is being reduced. Domestic or residential sewage
service as applicable to the sprinkling rates shall apply to each lot, parcel
of real estate, or building which is occupied and used as a single family
residence. The sprinkling rate shall not apply to any premises which are
partially or wholly used for commercial or industrial purposes, or to
residential rental property. However, church facilities which are used for
worship and similar events are eligible. This shall apply to the worship
facility only, and not to other church owned properties. In the event a portion
of such premises shall be used for commercial or industrial purposes, the owner
shall have the privilege of separating the water service so that the
residential portion of the premises is served through a separate meter, and in
such case, the water usage as registered by the water meter serving such
portion of the premises used for residential purposes would qualify under the
sprinkling rate. The Town Council shall be the arbitrator in any dispute as to
whether or not a lot, parcel of real estate, or building is used in part or
wholly for commercial or industrial purposes.

§ 150.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The State Legislature has, in I.C. 36-7-4,
granted the power to local government units to control land use within their
jurisdictions. Therefore, the Town Council does hereby adopt the following
floodplain management regulations.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities,
and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-
proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage;
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
      (6)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (D)   Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To protect human life and health;
      (2)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains; and
      (6)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood
blight areas.
(Prior Code, § 15.04.010) (Ord. 2014-4, passed 8-21-2014)
Editor’s note:
   Ord. 2014-4, Articles 1 through 7, adopted August 21, 2014, effective
November 5, 2014, deleted the former Ch. 15.04, §§ 15.04.010 through 15.04.140,
and enacted prior code Ch. 15.04. The former Ch. 15.04 pertained to similar
subject matter and derived from Ord. 2004-4, §§ 1 through 14.
§ 150.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A ZONES,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are as
follows.
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
      (3)   ZONE AE and A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. (ZONE AE is on new and revised maps in place of ZONES
A1-A30.)
      (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
      (5)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      (6)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common
loadbearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed ADDITION, which
is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter loadbearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the floodplain administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community’s
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. The portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.

develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use, or store hazardous materials,
or hazardous waste.
   DEVELOPMENT. 
      (1)   Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate

roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent
structures.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter
walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or
columns (posts and piers).

elevation information.
   EMERGENCY PROGRAM. The first phase under which a community participates in
the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOOD WAY MAP (FBFM). An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration
(FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. See FLOOD.
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA. See FREEBOARD.
   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The FLOODPLAIN includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in
flood prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to
as FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS, FLOODPLAIN ORDINANCE, FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
ORDINANCE, and FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for
nonresidential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. The portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP. As related to variances of this chapter, the exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Board of
Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar
to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional HARDSHIP. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURES. Any structures individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include letter of map amendment (LOMA), letter of map revision
(LOMR), and letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
as follows.
      LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the currently
effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA
through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is only
issued by FEMA.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the currently
effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations,
and elevations.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision by
letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA’s determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entry
way immediately next to the structure.

the structure;
      (4)   The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or
pillars; and
      (5)   The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement,
below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and
         (c)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a recreational vehicle.

replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or
adjusted assessed values.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of MITIGATION
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.

velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the
letter A is subject to the 1% ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. See REGULATORY FLOOD.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community’s FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain
boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These
changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements,
annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base
flood elevations or SFHAS.
   PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE. Anything which is injurious to the safety or
health of an entire community, neighborhood, or any considerable number of

150.03(B). The REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the term BASE FLOOD, 1% ANNUAL
CHANCE FLOOD, and 100-YEAR FLOOD.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of

or ordinances that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land
development or occupancy in flood prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdiction of the
town subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the town are
generally identified as such on the Posey County, Indiana, and Incorporated
Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated November 5, 2014, as well as any future
updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as Zone A,
AE, A1-A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO.)
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued; provided, the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes
recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration
of a historic structure; provided, that the alteration will not preclude the
structures continued designation as a historic structure.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in VIOLATION until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel, or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X ZONES shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X ZONES (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type
of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. See definition for A ZONE.
   ZONE B, C, AND X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(ZONE X is used on new and revised maps in place of ZONES B AND C.)
(Prior Code, § 15.04.020) (Ord. 2014-4, passed 8-21-2014
§ 150.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all
SFHAs and known flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the town.
   (B)   Basis for establishing regulatory flood data. This chapter’s
protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory
flood data is listed below.
      (1)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the town shall be as delineated on the
1% annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Posey County,
Indiana and Incorporated Areas and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map
dated November 5, 2014, as well as any future updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date.
      (2)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for
each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the town, delineated as an “A
Zone” on the Posey County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate
Map dated November 5, 2014, as well as any future updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the
State Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from
the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party disagrees
with the best available data, the party needs to replace existing data with
better data that meets current engineering standards. To be considered, this
data must be submitted to the State Department of Natural Resources for review
and subsequently approved.
      (3)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community’s known flood prone areas
shall be according to the best data available as provided by the State
Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile.
      (4)   Upon issuance of a letter of final determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.
   (C)   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain
development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of
special flood hazard.
   (D)   Compliance. No structure shall hereafter be located, extended,
converted, or structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with
the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. No land or stream
within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the
terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.
   (E)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (F)   Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground elevations.
      (1)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles shall govern.
      (2)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
      (3)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above
the base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site shall
be considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be
applied. The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA.
   (G)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (H)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Therefore, this chapter does not create any liability on the part of the town,
the State Department of Natural Resources, or the state, for any flood damage
that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder.

prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered professional
engineer and certified by same. (The floodplain administrator shall review the
floodproofing certification submitted.) The applicant shall correct any
deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is allowed to
proceed. Failure to submit the floodproofing certification or failure to make
correction required shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
      (3)   Finished construction. Upon completion of construction, an
elevation certification which depicts the “as-built” lowest floor elevation is
required to be submitted to the floodplain administrator. If the project
includes a floodproofing measure, floodproofing certification is required to be
submitted by the applicant to the floodplain administrator.
   (C)   Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
      (1)   The floodplain administrator and/or designated staff is hereby
authorized and directed to enforce the provisions of this chapter. The

such notifications to FEMA;
         (g)   Maintain for public inspection and furnish upon request local
permit documents, damaged structure inventories, substantial damage
determinations, regulatory flood data, SFHA maps, letters of map change (LOMC),
copies of DNR permits, letters of authorization, and floodplain analysis and
regulatory assessments (letters of recommendation), federal permit documents,
and “as-built” elevation and floodproofing data for all buildings constructed
subject to this chapter;
         (h)   Utilize and enforce all letters of map change (LOMC) or physical
map revisions (PMR) issued by FEMA for the currently effective SFHA maps of the
community;
         (i)   Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is
not diminished;
         (j)   Review certified plans and specifications for compliance;
         (k)   Verify and record the actual elevation of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, in

building, structure or premises that is being done contrary to the provisions
of this chapter shall immediately cease.
            2.   Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the
owner of the property, or to his or her agent, or to the person doing the work,
and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed.
         (n)   Revocation of permits.
            1.   The floodplain administrator may revoke a permit or approval,
issued under the provisions of the chapter, in cases where there has been any
false statement or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application
or plans on which the permit or approval was based.
            2.   The floodplain administrator may revoke a permit upon
determination by the floodplain administrator that the construction, erection,
alteration, repair, moving, demolition, installation, or replacement of the
structure for which the permit was issued is in violation of, or not in
conformity with, the provisions of this chapter.

in lieu of being elevated if done in accordance with the following:
         (a)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the structure has been designed so that below the FPG, the structure and
attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the
effects of the regulatory flood. The structure design shall take into account
flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic pressures, and impacts
from debris or ice. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set
forth in §
150.04(C)(2)(k).
         (b)   Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human
intervention and without an outside source of electricity.
      (4)   Elevated structures. 
         (a)   New construction or substantial improvements of elevated
structures shall have the lowest floor at or above the FPG.
         (b)   Elevated structures with fully enclosed areas formed by

and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls. Designs must meet the following minimum criteria:
            1.   Provide a minimum of two openings located in a minimum of two
exterior walls (having a total net area of not less than one square inch for
every one square foot of enclosed area);
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no more than one foot
above the exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath each
opening, whichever is higher;
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or

structure may be constructed on a permanent land fill in accordance with the
following.
         (a)   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep
before compacting to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with either the
Standard or Modified Proctor Test method. The results of the test showing
compliance shall be retained in the permit file.
         (b)   The fill shall extend ten feet beyond the foundation of the
structure before sloping below the BFE.
         (c)   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during
flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulkheading. If vegetative cover is
used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
         (d)   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties.
         (e)   The top of the lowest floor including basements shall be at or
above the FPG.
      (6)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially
improved on a site for more than 180 days must meet one of the following
requirements.
         (a)   These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed
on a site outside a manufactured home park or subdivision; in a new
manufactured home park or subdivision; in an expansion to an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage”
as a result of a flood.
            1.   The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent
foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement.
            2.   Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior
walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated
structures in division (B)(4) above.
            3.   Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the frame
or foundation of a manufactured home are not required to have openings.
         (b)   These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed
on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that has not
been substantially damaged by a flood:
            1.   The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the lowest
floor of the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or
other foundation elevations that are no less than 36 inches in height above
grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to
resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
            2.   Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior
walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated
structures in division (B)(4) above.
            3.   Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the frame
or foundation of a manufactured home are not required to have openings.
         (c)   Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either:
            1.   Be on site for less than 180 days;
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (defined as being
on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions); or
            3.   Meet the requirements for manufactured homes as stated earlier
in this section.
      (7)   Accessory structures. Relief to the elevation or dry floodproofing
standards may be granted for accessory structures. Such structures must meet
the following standards:
         (a)   Shall not be used for human habitation;
         (b)   Shall be constructed of flood resistant materials;
         (c)   Shall be constructed and placed on the lot to offer the minimum
resistance to the flow of flood waters;
         (d)   Shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation;
         (e)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment
shall be elevated or floodproofed to or above the FPG; and
         (f)   Shall be designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as
required for elevated structures in division (B)(4) above.
      (8)   Above ground gas or liquid storage tanks. All above ground gas or
liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral
movement.
   (C)   Standards for subdivision proposals.
      (1)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
      (2)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage.
      (3)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
      (4)   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres.
   (D)   Critical facility. Construction of new critical facilities shall be,
to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of
new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA
shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site.
Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes
elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to
the extent possible.
   (E)   Standards for identified floodways. 
      (1)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
150.03(B) are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the floodplain administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the State Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1, a permit for
construction in a floodway from the State Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing, and
paving and the like undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. I.C. 14-28-1-
26Cite allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a
residence in a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for
construction in the floodway from the State Department of Natural Resources.
Please note that if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing
grade, prior approval for the fill is required from the State Department of
Natural Resources.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the floodplain administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
State Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in the
floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the State Department of Natural Resources, the
floodplain administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in this section have been met. The floodplain
development permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit for construction
in a floodway issued by the State Department of Natural Resources. However, a
community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
      (3)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in
combination with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the
efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse
affect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at
least fifteen-hundredths of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory
flood elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-
floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
      (4)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 C.F.R. § 65.12.

      (1)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted that allows the lowest
floor of a structure to be built below the flood protection grade shall be
given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
         (a)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
flood protection grade will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts of insurance coverage as set by the Town Council from
time to time; and
         (b)   Such construction below the flood protection grade increases
risks to life and property.
      (2)   The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance.

determines that the standards in this chapter have been met and a public
hearing is required for the proposed plat, shall set a time, date, and place
for a public hearing before the Town Plan and Historic Preservation Commission
(Plan Commission). The Director shall notify the applicant in writing and shall
publish notice of the time, date, and place of the hearing of the preliminary
application for plat approval at least ten days prior to the date of such
hearing.
         (b)   To assist the Town Plan and Historic Preservation Commission
Director in determining that the engineering criteria of this chapter have been
satisfied by the applicant, a standing Technical Committee of the Town Plan and
Historic Preservation Commission (Plan Commission) shall be appointed and
designated as the Technical Subdivision Committee. The Committee shall consist
of two members of the Commission, the Director, County Surveyor, County

the applicant must either submit a final plat or have received an extension of
time by the Town Plan and Historic Preservation Commission (Plan Commission) as
provided in division (F)(1)(b) below. Otherwise, the preliminary plat approval
shall be considered void. Any plat to be considered by the Commission must be
filed at least 15 days before the date of the meeting of the Commission at
which such plat is to be considered.
         (b)   Prior to the expiration of one year after the date of approval
of the preliminary plat, the applicant may request in writing an extension of
the time for submission of the final plat. If the Town Plan and Historic
Preservation Commission (Plan Commission) decides to extend the one-year
period, it may grant one or more six months extensions. If the Commission
grants an extension or extensions of time, delaying presentation of the final
plat, when the final plat is submitted, the Commission shall:

preliminary plat was based have not changed substantially; or
            2.   Required changes in the plat, before final approval,
reflecting any substantial changes on the subdivision site or in its
surroundings, have taken place since the grant of preliminary approval.
         (c)   Where the one-year period, or any extension thereof, has
expired, the subdivider may resubmit the preliminary plat for re-approval,
providing such copies in addition to those required for its review.
      (2)   Plat drawing. The final plat drawing shall be submitted in the form
of an original tracing with waterproof ink on standard size (24 inches by 36
inches) tracing cloth or approved equivalent drawn to a scale of 50 feet to the

rights-of-way, easements, and other reservations shown on the plat;
            3.   By the Town Plan and Historic Preservation Commission (Plan
Commission), fixed with the seal of the Commission, signed by the President or
presiding officer of the Commission, and attested to by the secretary of the
Commission, if the plat was approved with public notice and hearing, the
certificate shall disclose that proper notice was given and that a majority of
the members of the Commission concur in its approval;
            4.   By the Town or County Engineer, the certificate shall state
that either all the improvements and installations as required by the
subdivision control ordinance have been completed or that such improvements and
installations have not been completed, and in the event that such improvements
and installations have not been completed, that the public is notified that the
town or county will not accept the streets within the subdivision for
maintenance and repair until the improvements and installations have been
completed and accepted by the town or county; or
            5.   By the director of the Town Plan and Historic Preservation
Commission (Plan Commission), this certificate shall be notice to the County
Recorder that the plat complies with the provisions of this chapter.
   (G)   Administration fees.
      (1)   The state statutes provide that the Town Plan and Historic
Preservation Commission (Plan Commission) shall give at least ten days’ notice
prior to the date set for the public hearing, such notice shall be by
publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the county. The cost
of this advertisement or legal notice is paid for by the Commission, which in
turn, is reimbursed by the subdivider.
      (2)   The Town Plan and Historic Preservation Commission (Plan
Commission) staff and other governmental offices spend considerable time in
checking and researching the proposed subdivision plat. In an effort to place
some of the cost upon the individual receiving this service, a fee is collected
and placed in the General Fund of the town. This fee is designated as a plat
release fee, since it must be paid before the final approved plat is removed
from the offices of the Commission. The fee in an amount as set by the Town
Council from time to time is set for each lot or parcel of land contained
within the boundaries of the final plat. The foregoing fees shall not apply to
governmental agencies.

time of approval of the final plat, then the subdivider shall provide the
subdivision with a complete sanitary sewer system connected to the sanitary
sewer outlet. If, at the time of the approval of the final plat, there is no
such sewer outlet available; or if the total cost of connecting a sanitary
sewer for the subdivision to the nearest sanitary sewer outlet and of
constructing and extending the sanitary sewer to service all lots in the
subdivision is greater than one and one-half times the total cost of private
individual sewage systems for all lots in such subdivision, then the subdivider

purchaser will install on the lot a private sewage disposal system all laid out
in accordance with minimum standards of the County Health Department and with
due consideration to the soil limitation as interpreted by the Soil
Conservation Service from its soil maps, which agreement shall further provide
that the provision of such agreement shall be covenants running with the title
to the lot. The agreement shall further provide that in the event of a breach
of such agreement, the town or county may institute legal action against the
purchaser or his or her successor to enforce the terms and provisions of such
agreement. The plans for installation of a sanitary sewer system shall be
prepared by the subdivider and approved by the Town or County Engineer and the
County Health Department. Upon completion of the sanitary sewer system
installation, the plans for such system as built, shall be filed with the
County Area Plan Commission and the County Health Department. In this division
(B)(3) and division (B)(4) below, the phrase THE SUBDIVIDER shall be
interpreted to mean that the subdivider shall install the facility referred to;
or whenever a private sewage disposal system, or an individual water supply is
to be provided, that the subdivider shall require as a condition of the sale of
each referred to in these sections shall be installed by the developer or
individual owner of the lot or parcel in accordance with these regulations.
      (4)   Water.
         (a)   Where there is an available municipal or community water supply
approved by the County Health Department at the time of the approval of the
final plat, then the subdivider shall provide the subdivision with a complete
water main supply system connected to the existing water system. If, at the
time of approval of the final plat, there is no available municipal or
community water supply system for the subdivision, the subdivider shall either:
            1.   Provide an individual water supply for each lot in the
subdivision in accordance with the minimum requirements of the County Health
Department; or
            2.   Obtain from each purchaser of any lot in the subdivision, an
agreement that the purchaser will install on such lot an individual water
supply in accordance with the minimum requirements of the County Health
Department, which agreement shall further provide that the provisions of such
agreement shall be covenants running with the title of the lot. Such agreement
shall further provide that in the event of a breach of such agreement, the town
or county may institute legal action against the purchaser or successors to
enforce the terms and provisions of such agreement.
         (b)   The plans for installation of a water main supply system shall
be prepared by the subdivider and approved by the County Health Department.
Water systems to be connected to any municipal water main system must be
approved by the Water Department. Upon completion of the water supply
installation, the plan for such system “as built” shall be filed with the
County Area Plan Commission and the municipality to which the system is
connected.
      (5)   Storm drainage. The subdivider shall provide the subdivision with
an adequate storm sewer system, in accordance with plans and specifications
prepared by the subdivider and approved by the Town and County Engineer, where
the streets in the subdivision are constructed with curbs and gutters, or the
natural surface drainage is determined by the town or county engineer to be
inadequate surface inlets will be required at appropriate intervals along the
street to remove storm water. When a storm water sewer system cannot be
provided due to the amount of drainage required, easements for surface drainage
shall be provided.
      (6)   Monuments and markers. Monuments and markers shall be constructed
as follows:
 
         Construction                                         Minimum Size
Marker   Iron pipe or iron or steel bars                      24” x ½”
Monument Concrete or stone or securely imbedded brass markers 4” x 4” x 30”
 
         (a)   Placement. Monuments and markers must be placed so that the
scored or marked point coincides exactly with the point of intersection of the
lines to be monumented. They must be set so that the top of the monument or
marker is level with the surface of the surrounding ground.
         (b)   Location. Monuments shall be set at the following locations:
            1.   At the intersection of lines forming angles at the boundaries
of the subdivision;
            2.   At section, half-section, and quartersection corners within
the subdivision boundaries, if these points to not have existing monuments; and
            3.   Markers shall be set at the following locations:
               a.   At the beginning and ending of curves along the street
property lines;
               b.   At angles in property lines of lots; and
               c.   At all other control points.
         (c)   References. Existing or new monuments described under division
(B)(1) above shall be described and referenced by magnetic bearings and
distances from a minimum of three physical locations, prudently chosen by the
surveyor for their permanency. If no such physical points of reference are
available, a note to this fact shall be set out on the plat.
   (C)   Roads, streets, and alleys.
      (1)   Arrangement.
         (a)   The road, street, and alley design shall provide direct access
to all lots and parcels of land within the subdivision and shall provide for
continuity of arterial or collector roads and streets. The Town Plan and
Historic Preservation Commission (Plan Commission) requires the extension of
certain roads, streets, or alleys to the exterior boundary of the subdivision
and may require the subdivider to provide a partial right-of-way on adjoining
lands or for the purpose of extending arterial or collector roads.
         (b)   Alleys may be required in a subdivision of land designated to
commercial or industrial districts.
      (2)   Minimum width of right-of-way.
         (a)   The minimum width of right-of-way shall be 50 feet except that
cul-de-sacs may utilize a 40-foot right-of-way with an 80-foot diameter, or
equivalent, at its terminus. The length of a cul-de-sac is limited to 600
linear feet, unless the Town Plan and Historic Preservation Commission (Plan
Commission) determines that a longer length will not be detrimental to local
traffic flow.
         (b)   Rights-of-way for alleys, when required by the Town Plan and
Historic Preservation Commission (Plan Commission) in a commercial or
industrial district, shall have a total width of 20 feet; all others shall be
12 feet.
   (D)   Intersection.
      (1)   At street intersections, property line corners shall be rounded by
an arc at least 20 feet in radius.
      (2)   At alley intersections, property line corners shall be rounded by
an arc at least ten feet in radius.
      (3)   All streets intersecting a through (preferential) street shall do
so at right angles or as nearly as is possible. Where the intersection angle is
less than 60 degrees, the foregoing radii shall be increased not less than 40%.
   (E)   Blocks.
      (1)   The width of blocks shall be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots
as described in divisions (F)(1) or (F)(2) below.
      (2)   Blocks shall not exceed 1,320 feet in length.
   (F)   Lots.
      (1)   In any subdivision or part of a subdivision proposed for
residential uses, the minimum width and area for lots shall conform to the
requirements of the County Area Plan Commission zoning ordinance.
         (a)   Where property is proposed for commercial or industrial use, the
minimum permissible lot size shall be at the discretion of the Town Plan and
Historic Preservation Commission (Plan Commission).
      (2)   The depth-to-width ratio of a lot shall be at a maximum of three to
one except that when prevailing topographic or other natural conditions would
so reduce the portion of the lot than can be used for residence and accessory
purposes as to make the lot unusable, the maximum depth-to-width ratio shall
apply to such portion of the lot as is usable for residential purposes.
      (3)   Building setback lines shall be established back of road and street
right-of-way lines at least to the extent prescribed for front yards in the
town zoning ordinance.
      (4)   Whenever possible, side lines of lots shall be at right angles or
radial to street lines.
      (5)   Every lot shall abut on a street, road, or dedicated right-of-way.
      (6)   Through lots, having frontage on two parallel or approximately
parallel streets (double frontage) will be permitted only by the discretion of
the Town Plan and Historic Preservation Commission (Plan Commission).
      (7)   Double frontage should be avoided in residential subdivisions.
      (8)   Utility easements four feet in width shall be provided on each side
of alleys along the rear of lots and along the side of lots where necessary.
Where alleys are not provided, each lot shall have an easement for utility
lines along the rear lot line and along the side lot line where necessary.
These easements shall not be less than six feet wide on each lot, making an
overall easement width of 12 feet.
      (9)   When the terrain so requires, easements for sanitary sewers along
lot lines other than the rear lot lines, shall be provided along the property
lines.
   (G)   Public spaces. Whenever the Town Plan and Historic Preservation
Commission (Plan Commission) considers that any part of the proposed
subdivision is needed in the interest of the town or county for a park, an open
space, a recreational site, a school site, or such other legitimate purpose,
the Commission may require that the subdivider either dedicate the area or
convey such area as directed by the Commission; provided, however, within six
months after the approval of the preliminary plat:
      (1)   The subdivider of the land to be dedicated or conveyed has been
paid the full fair market value of the real estate;
      (2)   The subdivider of the real estate to be dedicated or conveyed has
entered into a contract satisfactory to the subdivider, to be paid the fair
market value of the real estate to be dedicated or conveyed; or
      (3)   An appropriate governmental authority has instituted legal action
to condemn by eminent domain the areas which are to be dedicated or conveyed.
(Prior Code, § 16.04.040) (Ord. 2005-5, passed - -)
§ 151.05 DESIGN OF ROADS AND STREETS.
   (A)   Purpose. Expanding urbanization has created many problems involving
streets, highways, and transportation. Therefore, for the safety, convenience,
and welfare of the citizens, it is necessary that highway systems be more
carefully planned to serve the needs of the community. The standards of design
by which a road or street is constructed are of utmost importance to its proper
functioning. As the quantity and type of traffic increases, so must the quality
of the standards. The standards include the desirable design speed, vertical
and horizontal curves, grades, and stopping sight distance consistent with the
design speed control, parking, degree of control of access along road frontage
and at intersections, and width of shoulders. It should be understood that the
standards are not rigid rules which cannot be changed, but that any variations
should be made only after careful study of the local conditions requiring
changes, and after sound decisions utilizing good engineering judgment, have
been made.
   (B)   Road and street classification. 
      (1)   To provide guidelines for the promotion of adequate highways
commensurate with the needs occasioned by population growth, changing land
uses, and the economy of the community, the highways and streets, exclusive of
federal highways and expressways, have been classified into systems according
to traffic patterns. These classifications, subject to alterations justified by
changes in traffic patterns, are shown on the official road and street
classification map for subdivision control.
      (2)   The roads and streets are defined as follows.
         (a)   ARTERIAL ROADS AND STREETS. These roads and streets are
primarily responsible for moving large volumes of traffic.
         (b)   COLLECTOR ROADS AND STREETS. These roads and streets collect
traffic from local roads and streets and channel it into the arterial system.
         (c)   LOCAL ROADS AND STREETS. These roads and streets provide the
primary function of access to adjoining property neighborhoods, and collector
roads and streets.
      (3)   A developer shall assume the construction cost of an arterial or
collector road or street that may be adjacent or within the proposed
subdivision in the amount of the cost of a local road or street. The town or
county shall assume the additional construction cost.
   (C)   Special provisions.
      (1)   Partial and half streets.
         (a)   New streets. New half or partial streets are permitted only:
            1.   Where the subdivider obtains agreement in writing to the town
or county from adjoining property owners to dedicate and improve as required
the other half of the street when the adjoining property is subdivided;
            2.   Where essential to reasonably subdivide a tract in conformance
with the other requirements and standards of these regulations; or
            3.   Where needed to complete existing half streets.
         (b)   Existing streets. Where an existing street traverses or abuts
the subdivision, the entire right-of-way required by these regulations must be
provided. The right-of-way must be measured from the center line of the
existing roadway.
         (c)   Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sac streets in general may not exceed 600
feet in length. They must be provided with a paved turnaround with a minimum
diameter of 60 feet to the outside curb and 80 feet to the legal right-of-way.
Geometric design of a turnaround other than a circle may be used at the
termination of the street when approved by the Town Plan and Historic
Preservation Commission (Plan Commission).
      (2)   Curbs and gutters. Curbs and gutters, when required, shall conform
to the standards adopted by the town or county.
         (a)   Sidewalks shall conform to the established location and width of
existing sidewalks within the same block, but not less than four feet in width.
         (b)   In residential areas, the back side of the sidewalk shall be
located one foot, six inches inside the right-of-way.
         (c)   In commercial and other congested areas, the Town Plan and
Historic Preservation Commission (Plan Commission) may require sidewalks of
greater width constructed adjacent to the curb.
      (3)   Frontage roads.
         (a)   Frontage roads separate local traffic from the higher speed
through traffic or major transportation arteries, and shall be required by the
Commission to be located outside the right-of-way of federal highways, state
highways, and expressways.
         (b)   Frontage roads may also be required by the Town Plan and
Historic Preservation Commission (Plan Commission) to be located outside the
right-of-way arterial roads and streets when the average daily traffic volume
exceeds 1,500 vehicles and the speed limit exceeds 40 mph, or when the number
of curb cuts creates a traffic hazard.
         (c)   Design of frontage roads shall be based on providing access to
the property, maintaining circulation of traffic within the subdivision,
provide access for parking requirements and surface drainage.
      (4)   Intersection.
         (a)   Types of intersection. Intersection involving the junction of
more than two roads and streets is prohibited. Three-way intersections may be
used wherever appropriate, particularly in residential areas. Right angle
intersections must be used wherever practicable. When local roads and streets
intersect arterial or collector streets, the angle of intersection of the
street center lines may not be less than 75 degrees.
         (b)   Intersection grades. Intersections must be approached on all
sides by level areas. Where the grade exceeds seven percent, these level areas
must have a minimum length of 50 feet (measured from the intersection to the
center line), within which no grade may exceed a maximum of 4%.
         (c)   Intersection curb radii. Design of curb or edge of pavement
radii shall conform to the applicable standards of the town or county.
         (d)   Intersection sight distance. Minimum sight distance at
intersections should be sufficient to avoid the hazard of collision between a
vehicle starting from a stop position and a vehicle approaching the
intersection from the left or right at the design speed.
      (5)   Erosion control and sediment control. Erosion control and sediment
control plans shall be provided as required to:
         (a)   Prevent off-site damage due to sedimentation of drainage
ditches, storm sewers, ponds, lakes, streets, or other property, both public
and private; and
         (b)   Prevent erosion of adjoining land due to the change in land use
or rerouting surface water.
   (D)   Construction plans. After receipt of the preliminary approval of the
plat, the applicant shall prepare and submit construction plans of the
subdivision for approval by the Town or County Engineer. They shall contain all
necessary details, including cost estimates and a construction schedule.
      (1)   Plans shall conform to the design standards of the town or county.
      (2)   Plans and cost estimates shall be approved or disapproved by the
Town or County Engineer, and the County Drainage Board, when required by the
state drainage laws, within 30 days after receipt thereof.
   (E)   Geometries. Set out at the end of this chapter are drawings and charts
of minimum standards for geometric design which shall be used for the various
highway systems, as shown for arterial road and street classification map for
subdivision control. The subdivider’s engineer shall furnish the proper
authorities with the California Bearing Ratio number or other suitable
classification of the subgrade soils that will be encountered during
construction, and the engineer shall design the road and street accordingly,
keeping in mind the drainage and traffic volumes.
(Prior Code, § 16.04.050) (Ord. 2005-5, passed - -)
§ 151.06 FLOOD CONTROL AND DRAINAGE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of these provisions is the protection of the
proposed development from inundation or flood hazard from any water course and
to provide for the conveyance of storm water, both those originating from
outside or inside the proposed subdivision, through the development of the
upstream tributary areas, and to discharge storm waters originating within or
conveyed through the subdivision on the downstream adjacent lands to return
flow to as near predevelopment conditions as possible. This does not imply that
the developer make extensive or unreasonable improvement of existing inadequate
drainage facilities on adjoining properties other than necessary for
satisfactory operation of the drainage facilities in the proposed development.
   (B)   General provisions.
      (1)   Legal drains. According to Chapter 305 of the 1965 Acts of the
General Assembly, of the state, plans for any changes to a waterway that is
classified as a legal drain, must be approved by the Posey County Drainage
Board. It shall be the duty of the subdivider’s engineer to make the necessary
investigation of the watershed or watersheds in which the proposed subdivision
lays and determine if the subdivision discharges storm water directly or
indirectly into a legal drain.
      (2)   Drainage channels and closed conduits. All drainage channels,
conduits and appurtenances located outside the road or street right-of-way
shall be contained in suitable public easements or right-of-way. Easements for
open channels shall include sufficient area to permit access for the operating
of maintenance equipment. A covenant shall be set out on the plat which
prohibits the encroachment upon a drainage easement for open channels by any
permanent structures, trees, shrubs, flowers, gardens, or vegetation other than
grass.
      (3)   Lot drainage. Lot grading, in-tract drainage, and street
improvements, should be so designed that floods having an average recurrence
interval of less than 50 years will not cause inundation or damage to dwellings
and buildings.
   (C)   Design.
      (1)   Design flow.
         (a)   Design storm water flows to be carried in the street or within
the street right-of-way, should be contained within the gutters or parking
lanes of the approved street cross-section or as a minor depression or ditch
outside of the shoulder but within the street right-of-way. Design discharges
that exceed the capacity of the approved street cross-section or which would
encroach on the traveled lanes, shall be discharged into open channels outside
of the street right-of-way or into underground storm drains. Driveway culverts
shall not be less than 12 inches in diameter and of sufficient length to
provide a proper turning radius and side slopes, and under no circumstances
should they restrict the flow of water.
         (b)   Hillside development will require special consideration by the
Town Plan and Historic Preservation Commission (Plan Commission) in the areas
of lot size and slope stability particularly where building sites have been
benched into hillsides to protect downhill areas from slides and erosions of
unstable soil.
      (2)   Hydraulic design.
         (a)   The hydraulic design of the subdivision shall be such that,
after accumulating all energy losses through the various drainage transmission
systems within the subdivision, depth of flow in the streets shall not exceed
curb heights for ten years average recurrence and the depth of flow or ponding
shall not exceed a level which would cause inundation of foundations or
basements in residences constructed within the subdivision.
         (b)   Within the subdivision, catch basins shall be so placed along
the streets that the flow of water in the gutter will not exceed the top of the
curb for a ten-year average recurrence interval.
         (c)   Bridge and box culverts spanning open waterways shall have a
minimum freeboard above the high water elevation of two feet. High water
elevations are available from the County Engineer and the State Department of
Natural Resources.
      (3)   Structural design; open channels.
         (a)   Earth channels constructed within the subdivision shall have
slide slopes of three to one or flatter, and a minimum width of one foot:
revetment, bank stabilization along constructed or natural channels will be
required in the channel if velocities are sufficient to cause bank or invert
erosion.
         (b)   Earth channels constructed within the subdivision in those areas
not revetted and having a slope of less than 3% shall be seeded with a mulched
mixture of the following:
            1.   Agriculture limestone: 83 pounds/100 square yards;
            2.   12-12-12 fertilizer: 13 pounds/100 square yards;
            3.   One pound Alta fescue or Kentucky fescue;
            4.   Two-tenths pounds perennial rye;
            5.   Kentucky Blue: two-tenths pounds/100 square yards; and
            6.   Mixture to be held in place with pegged burlap or liquid
asphalt to establish a vegetative cover.
         (c)   Earth channels leaving a slope of more than 3% but less than 8%
shall be sodded with grass similar in content to seeding mixture.
         (d)   Earth channels having a slope greater than 8% shall be paved.
      (4)   Closed conduits. Excepting for adequate natural waterways, as
hereinafter defined, and except for allowable gutter flow, all storm drainage
within the subdivision which is capable of being transmitted in a reinforced
concrete pipe 42 inches or less in diameter, shall be carried in a closed
conduit. Minimum conduit size shall be carried in a closed conduit. Minimum
conduit size shall be 12 inches and a minimum clearance between top of pipe and
ground shall be one foot, six inches. The alignment of closed conduits shall be
as nearly straight as practicable without undue bends and angle points and at
intervals not to exceed 400 lineal feet. Inverted siphons shall not be
installed. All pipe to be installed within the right-of-way shall conform to
State Highway Standard Specifications dated 1969, and all amendments thereto
and subsequent provisions for culvert pipe. Pipe for installation outside the
right-of-way is not required to meet the 1969 specification; however, these
pipes shall be capable of sustaining loads that will be imposed upon it.
      (5)   Hydraulic design.
         (a)   Open channels or underground storm drains shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with the following frequencies.
            1.   MAJOR WATERWAYS are defined as those having tributary area in
excess of four square miles and shall be designed for an average recurrence
interval of 50 years.
            2.   SECONDARY WATERWAYS are defined as those having a tributary
area between one and four square miles and shall be designed for an average
recurrence interval of 25 years.
            3.   MINOR WATERWAYS are defined as those with one square mile or
less of tributary area and shall be designed for an average recurrence interval
of ten years.
         (b)   Design quantities of flow for secondary and major waterways up
to 25 miles in area shall be computed by the subdivider’s engineer according to
the publication “Estimating Peak Rates of Runoff from Small Watersheds in
Portions of Indiana” (Hydraulic Engineering Circular Number 4, Indiana, as
prepared by the Bureau of Public Roads, Washington, D.C., 20235). Design
quantities of flow for major waterways over 25 square miles in area shall be
obtained from the State Department of Natural Resources, State Office Building,
Indianapolis, Indiana.
         (c)   Design flows for minor waterways shall be computed by the
subdivider’s engineer by use of the rational formula Q=CiA wherein:
            1.   Q=Cubic feet per second;
            2.   C=Runoff coefficient;
            3.   i=Intensity of rainfall in inches per hour;
            4.   A=Tributary area; and
            5.   Basic data prerequisite to the determination of “C” and “i”
will be provided to the subdivider by the County Engineer.
