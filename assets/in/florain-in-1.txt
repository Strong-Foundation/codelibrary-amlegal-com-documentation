§ 10.01 TITLE OF CODE.
   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the town, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered, and consolidated into component codes,
titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the “Flora
Town Code,” for which designation “code of ordinances,” “codified ordinances,”
or “code” may be substituted. Code title, chapter, and section headings do not
constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.
§ 10.02 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.03 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.04 CONSTRUCTION OF CODE.
   (A)   This code is a codification of previously existing laws, amendments
thereto, and newly enacted laws. Any previously existing law or amendment
thereto reenacted by this code shall continue in operation and effect, as if it
had not been repealed by this code. All rules and regulations adopted under
laws reenacted in this code shall remain in full force and effect unless
repealed or amended subsequent to the enactment of this code.
   (B)   Any appropriation repealed and reenacted by this code is continued
only for the period designated in the original enactment of that appropriation.
   (C)   The numerical order and position of sections in this code does not
resolve a conflict between two or more sections.
   (D)   Any irreconcilable conflict between sections shall be resolved by
reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or division.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters, or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)
§ 10.05 RULES OF INTERPRETATION; DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Rules of interpretation. This code shall be construed by the following
rules unless the construction is plainly repugnant to the legislative intent or
context of the provision.

usual sense. Technical words and phrases having a peculiar and appropriate
meaning in law shall be understood according to their technical import.
      (2)   Words imputing joint authority to three or more persons shall be
construed as imputing authority to a majority of the persons, unless otherwise
declared in the section giving the authority.
      (3)   Where a section requires an act to be done which, by law, an agent
or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.
      (4)   Words denoting the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the
feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,
and words in the plural shall include the singular; the use of a verb in the
present tense shall include the future, if applicable.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this code of ordinances, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.

thereof, and, as applied to corporations, the officers or agents thereof.

code, refer to the sections or divisions next following or next preceding that
in which the words occur, unless some other section is designated.

mark.

(I.C. 1-1-4-5)
§ 10.06 SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   If any section of this code now enacted or subsequently amended or its
application to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid section
or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is severable.
If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of
whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a section or amendment stating that the provisions of a
chapter, subchapter, or section are severable as provided in division (B) above
does not affect the operation of division (B) above with respect to that
chapter, subchapter, or section.
(I.C. 1-1-1-8)
§ 10.07 REFERENCE TO OTHER SECTIONS.
   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof, the
reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified, or renumbered unless the subject matter is
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OFFICES; NAME DESIGNATIONS.
   (A)   Reference to offices. Reference to a public office or officer shall be
deemed to apply to any office, officer, or employee of this municipality
exercising the powers, duties, or functions contemplated in the provision,
irrespective of any transfer of functions or change in the official title of
the functionary.
   (B)   Name designations. Whenever any ordinance or resolution of the Council
refers to any board, bureau, commission, division, department, officer, agency,
authority, or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; on the effective date of that ordinance or following the
effective date, the rights, powers, duties, or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority, or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date
or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which the duties,
liabilities, powers, and rights were transferred.
(I.C. 1-1-6-1)
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
the error.
§ 10.10 REASONABLE TIME.
   (A)   In all cases where an ordinance requires an act to be done in a
reasonable time or requires reasonable notice to be given, REASONABLE TIME OR
NOTICE shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of the act or the giving of the notice.
   (B)   The time within which an act is to be done, as herein provided, shall
be computed by excluding the first day and including the last. If the last day
is a Saturday, Sunday, or a state holiday, it shall be excluded.
§ 10.11 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture, or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected
by the repeal and reenactment; but all suits, proceedings, and prosecutions for
causes arising or acts committed prior to the effective date of this code may
be commenced and prosecuted with the same effect as if this code had not been
enacted.
Statutory reference:
   Periods of limitation, see I.C. 1-1-1-7

   (A)   If the legislative body shall desire to amend any existing chapter or
section of this code, the chapter or section shall be specifically repealed and
a new chapter or section, containing the desired amendment, substituted in its
place.
   (B)   Any ordinance which is proposed to add to the existing code a new
chapter or section shall indicate, with reference to the arrangement of this
code, the proper number of the chapter or section. In addition to an indication
thereof as may appear in the text of the proposed ordinance, a caption or title
shall be shown in concise form above the ordinance.
§ 10.15 SECTION HISTORIES; STATUTORY REFERENCES.
   (A)   As histories for the code sections, the specific number and passage
date of the original ordinance, and amending ordinances, if any, are listed

§ 10.16 PRESERVATION OF PENALTIES, OFFENSES, RIGHTS, AND LIABILITIES.
   All offenses committed under laws in force prior to the effective date of
this code shall be prosecuted and remain punishable as provided by those laws.
This code does not affect any rights or liabilities accrued, penalties
incurred, or proceedings begun prior to the effective date of this code. The
liabilities, proceedings, and rights are continued; punishments, penalties, or
forfeitures shall be enforced and imposed as if this code had not been enacted.
In particular, any agreement granting permission to utilize highway rights-of-
way; contracts entered into or franchises granted; the acceptance,
establishment, or vacation of any highway; and the election of corporate
officers shall remain valid in all respects, as if this code had not been
enacted.

code for which another penalty is not specifically provided shall, upon

   (B)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following
described substances, materials, or wastes if it appears likely, in the opinion
of the Superintendent, that such wastes can harm either the sewers, sewage
treatment process, or equipment; have an adverse effect on the receiving
stream; or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or constitute a
nuisance. In forming his or her opinion as to the acceptability of these
wastes, the Superintendent will give consideration to such factors as the
quantities of subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers,
materials of construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment
process, capacity of the sewage treatment plant, degree of treatability of
wastes in the sewage treatment plant, and other pertinent factors. The
substances prohibited are:

treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters;
      (11)   Any substance which may cause the treatment plant effluent or any
other residues, slugs, or scams to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or
to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case shall a substance
discharged to the system cause the town to be in noncompliance with sludge use
or disposal regulations or permits issued under 40 C.F.R. parts 257, 403, and
503 or all state and federal requirements applicable to the sludge use and
disposal practices being used by the town;
      (12)   Any slugs, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of
industrial wastes; and
      (13)   Any material identified as hazardous waste according to 40 C.F.R.
part 261.
   (C)   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged, to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or
possess the characteristics enumerated in division (B) above, and which, in the
judgment of the Superintendent, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage
works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a
hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent may:
      (1)   Require new industries or industries with significant increase in
discharges to submit information on wastewater characteristics and obtain prior
approval for discharges;
      (2)   Reject the wastes in whole or in part for any reason deemed
appropriate by the town;
      (3)   Require pretreatment of such wastes to within the limits of normal
sewage as defined;

   (C)   When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a
suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his or her
expense and shall be maintained by him or her so as to be safe and accessible
at all times. Agents of the town, the State Water Pollution Control Agencies,
and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency shall be permitted to enter all
properties for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling,
and testing.
   (D)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of water
and wastes to which reference is made in this accordance shall be in accordance
with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. part 136, and shall be determined
at the control manhole provided, except for application for NPDES permits and
report thereof which shall be conducted in accordance with rules and
regulations adopted by the USEPA, published in the Federal Register October 16,
1973 (38 C.F.R. § 20758) and any subsequent revisions subject to approval be
the town. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control
manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public
sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be
carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of
constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to
life, limb, and property. (The particular analysis involved with determine
whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or
whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD
suspended solids analysis are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls
whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples.)
   (E)   No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the town and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste or unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the town for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the
industrial concern, at such rates as are compatible with §§
53.25 through
53.35.
   (F)   No user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way
attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly
authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard.
   (G)   Pollutant limitations as set forth by federal and/or state
regulations, requirements, and/or permit are hereby incorporated into this
subchapter.
   (H)   The town reserves the right to require and establish more stringent
pollutant limitations for the purpose of protecting the sewage works, natural
resources, or persons and property.
   (I)   Pretreatment of industrial wastes from major contributing industries
prior to discharge to the treatment works is required and is subject to the
rules and regulations adopted by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (USEPA) and published in the Federal Register (40 C.F.R. part 403) and
“Federal Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants,”
published in the Federal Register (40 C.F.R. part 136), in addition to any more
stringent requirements established by town, and any subsequent state or federal
guidelines and rules and regulations. Users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards are required to comply with applicable standards as set out in 40
C.F.R. chapter 1, subchapter N, parts 405-471 and incorporated herein.
   (J)   Plans, specifications, and any other pertinent information relating to
pretreatment or control facilities shall be submitted for approval of the town
and no construction of such facilities shall be commenced until approval, in
writing, is granted. Where such facilities are provided, they shall be
maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operating order by the
owner at his or her expense and shall be subject to periodic inspection by the
town to determine that such facilities are being operated in conformance with
the applicable federal, state, and local laws and permits. The owner shall
maintain operating records of the influent and effluent to show the performance
of the treatment facilities and for comparison against town monitoring records.
   (K)   Unpolluted water from air conditioners, cooling, condensing systems,
or swimming pools shall be discharged to a storm sewer where it is available,
or to a combined sewer approved by the town. Where a storm sewer is not
available, discharge may be to a natural outlet approved by the town and by the
state. Where a storm sewer, combined sewer, or natural sewer is not available,
such unpolluted water may be discharged to a sanitary sewer pending written
approval by the town.
   (L)   Industrial cooling water which may be polluted with insoluble oils or
grease or suspended solids shall be pretreated for removal of pollutants, and
the resultant clear water shall be discharged in accordance with division (K)
above.
   (M)   The town may require users of the treatment works, other than
residential users, to supply pertinent information on wastewater flow
characteristics. Such measurements, tests, and analyses shall be made at the
users’ expense. If made by the town, an appropriate charge may be assessed to
the user at the option of the town.
   (N)   The strength of wastewaters shall be determined for periodic
establishment of charges provided for in §§
53.25 through
53.35 from samplings taken at the aforementioned structure at any period of
time and of such duration and in such manner as the town may elect or at any
place mutually agreed upon between the user and the town. Appropriate charges
for sampling and analysis may be assessed to the user at the option of the
town. The results of routine sampling and analysis by the user may also be used
for determination of charges after verification by the town.
   (O)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors or traps shall be provided when, in
the opinion of the town, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid
wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand,

§ 53.11 FAILURE TO COMPLY; ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any user found to be violating this subchapter or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement shall be served by the
Superintendent with a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the
receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific requirement
actions, shall be submitted to the Superintendent. Submission of this plan in
no way relieves the user of the liability for any violations occurring before
or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall
limit the authority of the town to take emergency action without first issuing
a notice of violation.
   (B)   The Superintendent is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with the user responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will
include specific action to be taken by the industrial user to correct the
noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders
shall have the same force and effect as administrative orders issued pursuant
to divisions (D) and (E) below and shall be judicially enforceable.
   (C)   The Superintendent may order any user, which causes or contributes to
violation(s) of this subchapter, wastewater permits or orders issued hereunder,
or any other pretreatment requirement to appear before the Superintendent and
show cause with a proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and
a request that the user show cause who this proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior
to the hearing. Such notice may be served on an authorized representative of
the industrial user. Whether or not the industrial user appears as noticed,
immediate enforcement action may be pursued following the hearing date.
   (D)   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated or continues to
violate the subchapter, permits, or orders issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment requirement, he or she may issue and order to the user responsible
for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, sewer
service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably
necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including additional
self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. Furthermore, the Superintendent may
continue to require such additional self-monitoring for at least 90 days after
consistent compliance has been achieved, after which time the self-monitoring
conditions in the discharge permits shall control.
   (E)   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated or continues to
violate this subchapter, permits, or orders issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment requirement, the Superintendent may issue an order to the user
directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirement; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
(Ord. 99-12, passed 11-22-1999)
§ 53.12 SUSPENSION OF SERVICE.
   (A)   Assessments may be added to the user’s next scheduled sewer service
charge and the Superintendent shall have such other collection remedies as may
be available for other service charges and fees.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 20% of the unpaid balance and interest shall
accrue thereafter at a rate of 7% per month. Furthermore, these unpaid charges,
fines, and penalties, together with interest therefrom, shall constitute a lien
against the individual user’s property.
   (C)   Industrial users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written
request for the Superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment
of the fine about within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where the
Superintendent believes a request has merit, he or she shall convene a hearing
on the matter within 15 days after receiving the request from the industrial
user. In the event the user’s appeal is successful, the payment, together with
any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the industrial user. The
town may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement action, such as
notices and orders, to assess the fine.
   (D)   (1)   A user that exceeds pollutant limitations, as set forth in §
53.10(A), shall receive an initial warning. A notice of violation as defined
herein shall constitute a warning. A second exceedance of the same pollutant
limitation shall result in a second warning.
      (2)   Any subsequent exceedances of the same pollutant limitation shall
result in the assessment fines as described herein. Warnings above shall begin
following a period of one year in which the user does not exceed the pollutant
limitation.
   (E)   The Superintendent may suspend the sewer service user for a period not
to exceed 30 days whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons,
interferes with the operation of the municipal wastewater system, or which
presents or may present an endangerment to the environment.
      (1)   (a)   Any user notified of a suspension for its service shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Superintendent shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the system,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals.
         (b)   The Superintendent shall allow the user to recommence its
discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the town that
the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings set
forth in division (F) below are initiated against the user.
      (2)   A user which is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence to the Superintendent prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under §
53.11(C) and division (F) below.
   (F)   (1)   Any user which violates the following conditions of this
subchapter, wastewater permits, or orders issued hereunder is subject to
service termination:
         (a)   Violation of permit conditions;
         (b)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
         (c)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; and
         (d)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling.
      (2)   Noncompliance industrial users will be notified of the proposed
termination of their service and be offered an opportunity to show cause under
§
53.11(C) why the proposed action should not be taken.
(Ord. 99-12, passed 11-22-1999)
§ 53.13 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Upset. An upset shall be an affirmative defense to an enforcement
action brought against a user for violating a pretreatment standard and
requirement if the following conditions are met.
      (1)   The user can identify the cause of the upset.
      (2)   The facility was operating in a prudent and workpersonlike manner
at the time of the upset and was in compliance with applicable O&M procedures.
      (3)   The user submits, within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset, a
description of the discharge and its causes, the period of noncompliance (if
not corrected, then the time the noncompliance is anticipated to end), and the
steps being taken to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the
noncompliance.
      (4)   If this report is given orally, the user must also submit a written
report containing such information within five days unless waived by the
Superintendent.
      (5)   (a)   UPSET shall mean an exceptional incident in which there is
unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment
standards and requirements because of factors beyond the reasonable control of
the industrial user.
         (b)   Noncompliance caused by operational error, improperly designed
pretreatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive
maintenance, or careless or improper operation does not constitute an upset.
   (B)   Bypass.
      (1)   The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an
individuals user’s treatment facility shall be an affirmative defense to an
enforcement action brought against the industrial user if the user can
demonstrate that such a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life,
personal injury, or severe property damage.
      (2)   In order to be eligible for the affirmative defense, the industrial
user must demonstrate that there was no feasible alternative to the bypass and
submit notice of the bypass as required by 40 C.F.R. § 403.17.

§ 53.28 DETERMINING QUANTITY OF WATER DISCHARGED.
   The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewerage system and
obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the town shall be
determined by the town in such manner as the town shall reasonably elect, and
the sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates; except as
hereinafter provided in this section, the town may make proper allowances in
determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be
consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the town that such
quantities do not enter the sanitary sewerage system.
   (A)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the town, and the water used thereon or
therein is not measured by a water meter or is measured by a meter not
acceptable to the town, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise
measured or determined by the town. In order to ascertain the rate or charge
provided in this subchapter, the owner or other interested party shall, at his
or her expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring
devices, or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the
town for determination of sewage discharge.
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the town, and in addition, is a user of
water from another source which is not measured by a water meter or is measured
by a meter not acceptable to the town, then the amount of water used shall be
otherwise measured or determined by the town. In order to ascertain the rates
or charges, the owner or other interested parties shall, at his or her expense,
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the town for the
determination of sewage discharge.
   (C)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and
the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in such case,
for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for each
user and the base charge and the flow rates and charges shall apply to each of
the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate, or buildings served
through the single water meter.
   (D)   In the event two or more dwelling units such as mobile homes,
apartments, or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other
liquids into the town’s sanitary sewerage system, either directly or
indirectly, are users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a
single water meter, then in such case, billing shall be for a single service in
the manner set out elsewhere herein, except that the minimum bill shall not be
less than the number of such dwelling units times the base rate per month of
$14.01 for Phase I and $18.56 for Phase II (as described in §
53.27). In the case of mobile home courts, the number of mobile home spaces
available for rent plus any other dwelling units served through the meter. A
dwelling unit shall be interpreted as a room or rooms or any other space or
spaces in which cooling facilities are provided.
   (E)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water, or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in
excess of 25,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of
the town that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does
not and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other
interested party shall, at his or her expense, install and maintain meters,
weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any adequate or approved method of
measurement acceptable to the town for the determination of sewage discharge.
(Ord. 2011-01, passed 3-7-2011)
§ 53.29 BASIS ON STRENGTH AND CHARACTER.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered to users, the town shall base its charges not
only on the volume, but also on strength and character of the stronger-than-
normal domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose of.
The town shall require the user to determine the strength and contents of all
sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly, into the sanitary
sewage system in such manner and by such method as the town may deem
practicable in light of the conditions and attending circumstances of the case,
in order to determine the proper charge. The user shall furnish a central
sampling point available to the town at all times.
   (B)   Normal domestic waste strength should not exceed a biochemical oxygen
demand of 200 milligrams per liter of fluid or suspended solids in excess of
240 milligrams per liter of fluid. Additional charges for treating stronger-
than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis:
      (1)   Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids. There shall be an
additional charge per pound of suspended solids for suspended solids received
in excess of 240 milligrams per liter of fluid, as follows:
 
Phase I (effective upon adoption of this subchapter) $0.65 per pound
Phases II (effective January 1,2012)                 $0.67 per pound
 
      (2)   Rate surcharge based upon BOD. There shall be an additional charge
per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for BOD received in excess of 200
milligrams per liter of fluid, as follows:
 
Phase I (effective upon adoption of this subchapter) $0.78 per pound
Phase II (effective January 1,2012)                  $0.80 per pound
 
   (C)   The determination of suspended solids and five-day biochemical oxygen
demand contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the latest copy of
“Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage, and Industrial Wastes,”
as written by the American Public Health Association, the American Waterworks
Association, and the Water Pollution Control Federation, and is in conformance
with “Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants,”
regulation 40 C.F.R. part 136, published in the Federal Register on October 16,
1973.
(Ord. 2011-01, passed 3-7-2011)
§ 53.30 COLLECTION.
   Such rates and charges shall be prepared, billed, and collected by the town
in the manner provided by law and ordinance.
   (A)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed
monthly.
   (B)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying
the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but
such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in the event
payment is not made as herein required. The owners of properties served, which
are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to examine the
collection records of the town for the purpose of determining whether bills
have been paid by such tenant or tenants, provided that such examination shall
be made at the office at which said records are kept and during the hours that
such office is open for business.
   (C)   As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when due are
hereby declared to be delinquent, and a penalty of 10% of the amount of the
rates or charges shall be thereupon attached thereto. The time at which such
rates or charges shall be paid is now fixed on the twenty-fifth day of each
month in accordance with statements mailed to all users not later than the
tenth day of each month prior thereto.
(Ord. 2011-01, passed 3-7-2011)
§ 53.31 FAIR AND EQUITABLE STUDIES.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain
fair and equitable and be in proportion to the costs of providing services to
the various users or user classes, the town shall cause a study to be made
within a reasonable period of time following the first two years of operation,
following the date on which this subchapter goes into effect. Such study shall
include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the costs associated with the
treatment of excessive strength effluents from industrial users, volume and
delivery flow rate characteristics attributed to the various users or user
classes, the financial position of the sewage works, and the adequacy of its
revenue to provide reasonable funds for the operation and maintenance,
replacements, debt service requirements, and capital improvements to the
wastewater treatment systems.
   (B)   Therefore, on a biennial basis, within a reasonable period of time
following the normal accounting period, the town shall cause a similar study to
be made for the purpose of reviewing the fairness and equity of the rates and
charges for sewage services on a continuing basis. Said studies shall be
conducted by officers or employees of the town, or by a firm of certified
public accountants or a firm of consulting engineers, which firms shall have
experience in such studies, or by such combination of officers, employees,
certified public accountants, or engineers as the town shall determine to be
best under the circumstances.
(Ord. 2011-01, passed 3-7-2011)
§ 53.32 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   The town shall make and enforce such by laws and regulations as may be
deemed necessary for the safe, economical, and efficient management of the
town’s sewerage system, pumping stations, and sewage treatment works, for the
construction and use of house sewers and connections to the sewerage treatment
works, the sewerage collection system, and for the regulation, collection,
rebating, and refunding of such rates and charges.
   (B)   The town is hereby authorized to prohibit dumping of wastes into the
town’s sewerage system which, in its discretion, are deemed harmful to the
operation of the sewage treatment works of the town or to require methods
affecting pretreatment of said wastes to comply with the pretreatment standards
included in the NPDES permit issued to the sewage works.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The state legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Town Council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 2015-01, passed 1-12-2015)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately floodproofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 2015-01, passed 1-12-2015)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
   (F)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood
insurance program.
(Ord. 2015-01, passed 1-12-2015)
§ 151.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains; electric, telephone, and sewer lines; streets; and bridges
located in floodplains; and
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
(Ord. 2015-01, passed 1-12-2015)
§ 151.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A ZONES,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1
through A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR, and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions
are presented below.
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   ZONE AE and A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones
A1 through A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.

minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration
(FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.

where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited
to, emergency preparedness, plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to
as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention
ordinance, and floodplain management requirements.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP. (As related to variances of this chapter) means the exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
Town Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional,
unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial
hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations,
physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors
likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these
problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even
if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURES. Any structures individually listed on the National

damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997
will include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include letter of map amendment (LOMA), letter of map revision
(LOMR), and letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below.
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in
a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is
only issued by FEMA.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOIUIR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision
by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA’s determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the

below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of floodwaters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the

or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the
letter “A” is subject to the 1% annual chance flood. (See REGULATORY FLOOD.)
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community’s FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain

regulations, or ordinances that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict
land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdiction of the
town subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the town are
generally identified as such on the county and incorporated areas flood
insurance rate map, dated January 16, 2015, as well as any future updates,
amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1
through A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO.)
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the

other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred “repetitive loss”
or “substantial damage” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any
alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structures continued designation as a “historic structure.”
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.

Shaded X ZONES shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X ZONES (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type
of flooding in the area.

§ 151.11 DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND ELEVATION.
   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles shall govern.
   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
   (C)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the
base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site shall be
considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied.
The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA.

(Ord. 2015-01, 1-12-2015) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.44 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
151.07, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the State Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1, a permit for
construction in a floodway from the State Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving, and the like undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the State Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the State Department of Natural
Resources.)
   (B)   (1)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
State Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in the
floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the State Department of Natural Resources, the
Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in §§
151.40 through
151.46 have been met.
      (2)   The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than
the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the State Department of
Natural Resources. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any)
shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
0.15 of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under
the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as
proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees), the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 C.F.R. § 65.12.

151.99
§ 151.45 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
151.40 through
151.46 have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of
any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.
(Ord. 2015-01, passed 1-12-2015)
§ 151.46 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the State Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the State Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the State Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in §§
151.40 through
151.46 have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
151.40 through
151.46 have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and shall not increase flood
damages or potential flood damages.
