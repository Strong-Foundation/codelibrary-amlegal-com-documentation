manifest intention, and the provision shall have the same effect as though the

date of issuance of the citation of violation. Further, the person or entity
cited shall be required to contact the town to schedule an inspection of the

the date of issuance of the citation of violation(s). In the event that
appropriate corrective measures have been taken within seven days from the date
of issuance of the citation, and an inspection requested and made within the
same seven day period results in verification of full and complete compliance
by the duly designated town representative, then the citation issued will be
voided and all further proceedings terminated. In the event that the person or
entity cited for ordinance or town code violation(s) within the calendar year
does not take corrective measures within the required seven day time period, or
takes corrective measures within the required seven day time period but does
not notify and schedule an inspection by the duly designated town
representative within the required seven day time period to verify full and
complete compliance, then the person or entity cited shall have 14 days from
the date of issuance of the citation to appear at the Ordinance Violations
Bureau to pay the applicable fine(s) for the citation(s) issued.

this section to pay fines for cited violation(s) to the Ordinance Violations
Bureau shall do so within 14 days from the date of issuance of the citation of
violation.

was issued.

town code violation within the jurisdiction of the Ordinance Violations Bureau
shall sign a written denial of the violation, and thereafter, the cited
violation shall be filed by the administrator of the Ordinance Violations
Bureau, or duly designated representatives, with the Clerk of the court having
jurisdiction over such ordinance or town code violations, and the matter shall
be set for trial.
   (I)   In the event that a citation for an ordinance or town code violation
has not been paid at the Ordinance Violations Bureau within 14 days of
issuance, the cited ordinance or town code violation(s) shall be filed with the
Clerk of the court having jurisdiction over such violations, and the matter
shall be set for trial.
   (J)   Nothing herein shall be construed as limiting the rights of the town,
or its duly designated officers, officials, representatives, employees, or
attorneys, to maintain an action in a court of proper jurisdiction to enjoin or
abate any ordinance or town code violation, and to recover in the same
proceedings any penalties, fine, costs or damages provided for such ordinance

(Ord. 692, passed 12-10-96)
§ 32.86 RECORDING AND ACCOUNTING.
   (A)   The town and its various departments shall classify capital
expenditures as capital outlays within the fund from which the expenditure was
made in accordance with the chart of accounts of the cities and towns
accounting manual. The cost of the property, plant, and equipment includes all
expenditures necessary to put the asset into position and ready for use. For
purposes of recording fixed assets of the town and its departments, the
valuation of assets shall be based on historical costs, or where the historical
cost is indeterminable, by estimation for those assets in existence.
   (B)   The town’s municipally owned utilities shall record acquisition of
fixed assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. When
as asset is purchased for cash, the acquisition is simply recorded at the
amount of cash paid, including all outlays relating to its purchase and
preparation for intended use. Assets may be acquired under a number of other
arrangements, including but not necessarily limited to the following:
      (1)   Assets acquired for a lump-sum purchase price.
      (2)   Purchase on deferred payment contract.
      (3)   Acquisition under capital lease.
      (4)   Acquisition by exchange of non-monetary assets.
      (5)   Acquisition by issuance of securities.
      (6)   Acquisition by self-construction.
      (7)   Acquisition by donation or discovery.
   (C)   Some of these arrangements present special problems relating to the
cost to be recorded. For example, in utility accounting, interest during a
period of construction has long been recognized as a part of the asset cost.
Reference to an intermediate accounting manual will illustrate the recording of
acquisition of assets under the aforementioned acquisition arrangements. For
purposes of recording fixed assets of the utilities, the valuation of assets
shall be based on historical cost.
   (D)   For the purposes of this subchapter, as amended from time to time, an
asset register (prescribed Form 211) shall be maintained by the Town Clerk-
Treasurer to provide a detail record of the capital assets of the town.
(Ord. 692, passed 12-10-96)
§ 32.87 SAFEGUARDING OF ASSETS.
   (A)   The accounting controls set forth in this section are hereby
authorized to be designed, implemented, and followed by all departments,
officials, employees, and agents of the town to provide reasonable assurances
that town assets are safeguarded for the benefit of the town and its residents.
   (B)   Capital expenditures made by the town and its various departments and
utilities shall be in accordance with management’s authorization, as documented
in the minutes.
   (C)   Transactions of the utilities shall be recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
   (D)   Adequate detail records shall be maintained to assure accountability
for town and utility owned assets.
   (E)   Access to assets shall be permitted in accordance with management’s
authorization.
   (F)   The recorded accountability for assets shall be compared with the
existing assets at least every two years, and appropriate action shall be taken
with respect to any differences.

directly to the town, except that first-tier subcontractors shall submit the
required information (including the name, address, and type of work for each of
their first-tier subcontractors) to the successful bidder no later than five
business days after the subcontractor's first day of work on the public work

giving the town written notice of the name, address and type of work of the
substitute subcontractor. The substitute subcontractor is subject to all of the
obligations of a subcontractor under this subchapter, as amended from time to

further consideration deemed necessary by the town, the contractor or
subcontractor may be designated as pre-qualified for future town public works

subcontractors who are pre-qualified must submit a complete application for
continued or pre-qualified standing, on a form provided by the town, (also
referred to as the "short form") by December 31 for the upcoming calendar year.

contractor or subcontractor shall still be permitted to bid on town public
works project.
   (B)   Any material changes to the contractor's status at any time must be
reported in writing by the contractor within ten days of its occurrence to the
town. The pre-qualification designation is solely within the discretion of the
town and the town specifically reserves the right to change or revoke the
designation for a stated written reason(s).

information obtained by the town through its own independent verification of
the information provided by the contractor.
(Ord. 1405, passed 12-7-21)

bidder and all subcontractors working on a public works projects shall submit a
certified payroll report utilizing the federal form now known as WH-347 which
must be prepared on a weekly basis and submitted to the town within ten
calendar days after the end of each week in which the bidder or subcontractor
performed its work on the public work project. These certified payroll reports
shall identify the job title and craft of each employee on the project, e.g.
journeyman electrician or apprentice electrician. In the event that any
contractor or subcontractor uses independent contractors to perform work on the
project, such individual must be identified on the WH-347 form with the same
information as is required for employees.
   (B)   The town may withhold payment due for work performed by a bidder if
the bidder fails to timely submit its certified payroll reports until such time
as such certified payroll reports are submitted. The town may also withhold
payment due for work performed by a subcontractor if the subcontractor fails to
timely submit its certified payroll reports until such time as certified
payroll reports are submitted. The town shall not withhold payment to a bidder
for work performed by the bidder or for work performed by subcontractors who
have submitted their certified payroll reports, because one or more other
subcontractors failed to timely submit their certified payroll reports.
(Ord. 1405, passed 12-7-21)
§ 32.117 PUBLIC RECORDS.
   All information submitted by a bidder or subcontractor pursuant to this
subchapter, including certified payrolls, are public records subject to

   Any bidder that willfully makes, or willfully causes to be made, a false,
deceptive or fraudulent statement, or willfully submits false, deceptive or
fraudulent information in connection with any submission made to the town shall
be disqualified from bidding on all town public works projects for a period of
three years. Thereafter, the disqualified bidder shall comply with all

the bidder entity, is again a qualified bidder for town public works projects.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 34.01 APPOINTMENTS OF MEMBERS.
   (A)   All appointments of members required to be made to the boards and
commissions of the town shall be made by majority vote and approval of the Town
Council at a public meeting of the Town Council, whenever a vacancy on any
board or commission occurs. All appointments of members to the boards and
commissions of the town shall be made in this manner unless provisions of the
Indiana Code, as amended from time to time, specifically provide otherwise.
   (B)   All existing ordinances, or parts thereof, or sections of this code of
ordinances in conflict with the provisions of this section, are hereby deemed
null, void, and of no legal effect, and are specifically repealed.
(Ord. 505, passed 4-25-90)
§ 34.02 APPOINTMENT POLICY.
   (A)   There is hereby established, in addition to all specific appointment
requirements set forth in either the Indiana Code or by enabling ordinances of
the town, a general Boards and Commissions Appointment Policy. Such policy is
set forth in division (D) below.
   (B)   The Boards and Commissions Appointment Policy requirements are
supplemental to the legal requirements for appointment to various boards and
commissions, as set forth in the individual appointment statutes governing the
same, or the individual enabling ordinances of the town establishing the same.
Where there is conflict between the supplemental regulations established hereby
and state law or local enabling ordinances, the state law or enabling ordinance
provisions shall prevail and supercede these Boards and Commissions Appointment
Policy requirements. In the event that any of the adopted Boards and
Commissions Appointment Policy requirements herein are contrary to any
provision of applicable state law or local enabling ordinance establishing such
board or commission and providing for appointment thereto, then such
requirement of the newly adopted Boards and Commissions Appointment Policy
established hereby shall be deemed null, void and of no legal effect.
   (C)   The Boards and Commissions Appointment Policy established hereby shall
be provided to all applicants seeking consideration for appointment to any
board or commission in the town at the time of submission of such application,
which policy receipt shall be acknowledged by a duly executed receipt
instrument for the same which shall be maintained in the records of the town
pertaining to the appointment application procedure.
   (D)   Appointment Policy Requirements. The Town Council believes that it is
good public policy to provide minimum requirements for candidates to position
openings on all boards and commissions of the town. These policy requirements
are guides for all appointed positions by the Town Council and the Town Council
President.
      (1)   Each candidate must file a complete application with the Town
Clerk-Treasurer prior to the announced deadline.
      (2)   Each candidate must be available for interviews.
      (3)   Each candidate must reside within the municipal corporate
boundaries of the town unless other statutory provisions provide otherwise.
Residency must be validated by the candidate in the form of driver’s license,
voter registration record, or other acceptable means.
      (4)   The voting records of the candidate will be checked at the Lake
County Voter Registration Board. A letter from the precinct chairman where the
candidate resides may be necessary if the voter records cannot determine party
affiliation, if party affiliation is a necessary requirement for board/
commission position.
      (5)   All candidates appointed are expected to attend all regular and
special meetings of the commission or board to which they are appointed.
Attendance records will be kept and reviewed from time to time. Continued and
regular service to the commission or board will be a significant consideration
for reappointment purposes.
      (6)   Appointed candidates are expected to dress and act appropriately in
all public meeting venues. As an appointed citizen, the candidate represents
the town in all his or her actions and dealings with the public being served.
      (7)   All questions concerning duties, expectations, regulations, laws
and the like are to be directed to one of the following people:
         (a)   The commission or board president being served;
         (b)   The Town Council President; or
         (c)   The Town Manager.
   All of these individuals seek to assist informed, responsible and upstanding
appointees to represent the town and its residents.

§ 34.120 MEANS OF FINANCING.
   (A)   Taxing district.
      (1)   This subchapter creates a special taxing district, including all
territory within the municipal corporate boundaries of the town, for the
purpose of providing for the collection and disposal of stormwater of the
district in a manner that protects the public health and welfare and for the
purpose of levying special benefit taxes for purposes of stormwater collection
and disposal.
      (2)   Any area added to the district hereunder is considered to have
received a special benefit from the stormwater collection and disposal
facilities of the district equal to or greater than the special taxes imposed
on the area by this subchapter or any other authority or legislative act in
order to pay all or part of the costs of such facilities.
   (B)   Municipal assessment.
      (1)   The reasonable cost and value of any service rendered to the town
by the stormwater system by furnishing stormwater collection and disposal shall
be:
         (a)   Charged against the town; and

necessary current expenses.

         (c)   Bonds which may be issued either as registered bonds or as

negotiability.
      (3)   All monies received from bonds issued under this subchapter shall
be applied solely to the acquisition, construction, repair, and maintenance of
the stormwater system, the cost of the issuance of the bonds, and the creation
of any reserve for the bonds.

performance of all duties required by this subchapter of the Board issuing the
bonds or of any officer of the Board, including the following:

valuation, after deducting all exemptions, of the property within the district.

if the payment has been provided for by an irrevocable deposit in escrow of
government obligations sufficient to pay the bonds when due or called for
redemption.
      (4)   The bonds are not a corporate obligation or indebtedness of the
town but are an indebtedness of the stormwater district. The bonds and interest
are payable:
         (a)   Out of a special benefit tax levied upon all of the property of
the stormwater district; or
         (b)   By any other means including revenues, cash on hand, and cash in
depreciation or reserve accounts.

purpose for which they are issued.

issued and the interest on the bonds, the Board:

tax upon all the property of the stormwater district in the amount necessary to
meet and pay the principal of the bonds as they severally mature, together with

stormwater system; and

collected before maturity of the principal and interest of the bonds payable in
the following calendar year.

of bonds under this subchapter which are or may be payable from the special
benefit property tax.
      (12)   Revenues received by the Department may be used to pay for bonds
issued to acquire, construct, install, operate, and maintain facilities and
land for stormwater collection and disposal systems.
      (13)   In the event there are bonds outstanding for which user fees were
pledged, the Board may not rescind user fees or reduce them below a rate that
would produce 125% of the highest annual debt service on the bonds issued under
this subchapter to their final maturity, based on an average of the immediately
preceding three years of user fee collections. In the event the user fees have
been levied for the preceding three years, the Board may not reduce user fees
below a rate that would produce 125% of the highest debt service, based upon a
study by a qualified public accountant or financial adviser.
      (14)   With respect to bonds for which a pledge has been made under
division (D)(11) of this section, the Indiana General Assembly covenants with
the holders of these bonds that:
         (a)   This statutory provision will not be repealed or amended in a
manner that will adversely affect the imposition or collection of the user fees
under this subchapter; and
         (b)   This statutory provision will not be amended in a manner that
will change the purpose for which revenues from the user fees imposed under
this subchapter may be used, as long as those bonds are outstanding.

of all property appropriated by the resolution. In the event a landowner is a
nonresident and the landowner’s place of residence is known, a notice shall be
mailed to the nonresident owner. In the event the nonresident owner’s residence
is unknown to the Board, then the owner is considered notified of the pendency
of the proceedings by the publication of notice.
   (E)   Separate descriptions of each piece or parcel of land are not required
in the resolution and notice, but it is a sufficient description of the

hereinafter, a member may be disciplined by demotion, dismissal, reprimand,
forfeiture, or suspension upon either:
            1.   Conviction in any court of a crime; or
            2.   A finding and decision of the Board of Safety that the member
has been or is guilty of:
               a.   Neglect of duty;
               b.   A violation of rules;
               c.   Neglect or disobedience of an order;
               d.   Incapacity;
               e.   Absence without leave;
               f.   Immoral conduct;
               g.   Conduct injurious to the public peace or welfare;
               h.   Conduct unbecoming of an officer; or
               i.   Another breach of discipline.
         (b)   The Board of Safety may not consider the political affiliation
of the member in making a decision under this division (A). If a member is
suspended or placed on administrative leave under this division, the member is
entitled to the member's allowances for insurance benefits to which the member
was entitled before being suspended or placed on administrative leave. In
addition, the town may provide the member's allowances for any other fringe
benefits to which the member was entitled before being suspended or placed on
administrative leave.
      (2)   (a)   Before a member of the Metropolitan Police Department may be
suspended in excess of five days without pay, demoted, or dismissed, the Board
of Safety shall offer the member an opportunity for a hearing. If a member
seeks a hearing, a member must request the hearing not more than five days
after receiving the notice of the suspension, demotion, or dismissal. Written
notice shall be given either by service upon the member in person or by a copy
left at the member's last and usual place of residence at least 14 days before
the date set for hearing. The hearing conducted under this division shall be
held not more than 30 days after the hearing is requested by the member unless
a later date is mutually agreed upon by the parties. The notice must state:
            1.   The date, time and place of hearing;
            2.   The charges against the member;
            3.   The specific conduct that comprises the charges;
            4.   That the member is entitled to be represented by counsel;
            5.   That the member is entitled to call and cross-examine
witnesses;
            6.   That the member is entitled to require the production of
evidence; and
            7.   That the member is entitled to have subpoenas issued, served,
and executed in the county.
         (b)   A disciplinary hearing concerning a member of the Metropolitan
Police Department shall be conducted in the manner prescribed by the rules
adopted by the Board of Safety, which rules shall provide for an appropriate
appeal procedure.
      (3)   Upon an investigation into the conduct of a member of the
Metropolitan Police Department, or upon the trial of a charge preferred against
a member of the Metropolitan Police Department, the Board of Safety may compel
the attendance of witnesses, examine them under oath, and require the
production of books, papers, and other evidence at a meeting of the Board. For
this purpose, the Board of Safety may issue subpoenas and have them served and
executed in any part of the county. If a witness refuses to testify or to
produce books or papers in his or her possession or under his or her control,
the provisions of IC 36-4-6-21, as amended from time to time, control, to the
extent applicable. The proper court may compel compliance with an order by
attachment, commitment, or other punishment.
      (4)   The reasons for the suspension, demotion, or dismissal of a member
of the Metropolitan Police Department shall be entered as specific findings of
fact upon the records of the Board of Safety. A member who is suspended for a
period exceeding five days, demoted, or dismissed may appeal the decision to
the Circuit or Superior Courts of the county. However, a member may not appeal
any other decision.
      (5)   An appeal under this division (A) must be taken by filing in Court,
within 30 days after the date the decision is rendered, a verified complaint
stating in concise manner the general nature of the charges against the member,
the decision of the Board of Safety, and a demand for the relief asserted by
the member. A bond must also be filed that guarantees the appeal will be
prosecuted to a final determination and that the plaintiff will pay all costs
adjudged against the plaintiff. The bond must be approved as bonds for costs
are approved in other cases. The town must be named as the sole defendant, and
the plaintiff shall have a summons issued as in other cases against the town.
Neither the Board of Safety, nor the Commissioners of it, may be made parties
defendant to the complaint, but all are obligated by service upon the town and
any judgment rendered by the Court.
      (6)   In an appeal under division (A)(5), no pleading is required by the
town to the complaint, but the allegations are considered denied. The town may
file a motion to dismiss the appeal for failure to perfect it within the time
and in the manner required by this division (A). If more than one person was
included in the same charges and in the same decision of dismissal by the Board
of Safety, then one or more of the persons may join as plaintiffs in the same
complaint, but only the persons that appeal from the decision are affected by
it. The decision of the Board of Safety is final and conclusive upon all
persons not appealing. The decision appealed from is not stayed or affected
pending the final determination of the appeal but remains in effect unless
modified or reversed by the final judgment of the Court.
      (7)   A decision of the Board of Safety is considered prima facie
correct, and the burden of proof is on the party appealing. All appeals shall
be tried by the Court. The appeal shall be heard de novo only upon any new
issues related to the charges upon which the decision of the Board of Safety
was made. The charges are considered to be denied by the accused person. Within
ten days after service of summons, the Board of Safety shall file in court a
complete transcript of all papers, entries and other parts of the record
relating to the case. Inspection of these documents by the person affected, or
by the person's agent, must be permitted by the Board of Safety before the
appeal is filed, if requested. Each party may produce evidence relevant to the
issues that it desires, and the Court shall review the record and decision of
the Board of Safety upon appeal.
      (8)   The Court shall make specific findings and state the conclusions of
law upon which its decision is made. If the Court finds that the decision of
the Board of Safety appealed from should in all things be affirmed, its
judgment should state that, and judgment for costs shall be rendered against
the party appealing. If the Court finds that the decision of the Board of
Safety appealed from should not be affirmed in all things, then the Court shall
make a general finding, setting out sufficient facts to show the nature of the
proceeding and the Court's decision on it. The Court shall either:
         (a)   Reverse the decision of the Board of Safety; or
         (b)   Order the decision of the Board of Safety to be modified.
      (9)   The final judgment of the Court may be appealed by either party.
Upon the final disposition of the appeal by the courts, the Clerk of the Court
shall certify and file a copy of the final judgment of the Court to the Board
of Safety, which shall conform its decisions and records to the order and
judgement of the Court. If the decision is reversed or modified, then the Board
of Safety shall pay to the party entitled to it any salary or wages withheld
from the party pending the appeal and to which the party is entitled under the
judgment of the Court.
      (10)   Either party shall be allowed a change of venue from the Court or
a change of Judge in the same manner as such changes are allowed in civil
cases. The Indiana Rules of Trial Procedure govern in all matters of procedure
upon the appeal that are not otherwise provided for by this division (A).
      (11)   An appeal takes precedence over other pending litigation and shall
be tried and determined by the Court as soon as practical.
      (12)   Except as modified in IC 36-5-2-13, the Town Executive may reduce
in grade any member of the Metropolitan Police Department who holds an upper
level policy making position. The reduction in grade may be made without
adhering to the requirements of divisions (A)(1) through (11) above. However, a
member may not be reduced in grade to a rank below that which the member held
before the member's appointment to the upper level policy making position.
      (13)   If the member is subject to criminal charges, the Board of Safety
may place the member on administrative leave until the disposition of the
criminal charges in the Trial Court. Any other action by the Board of Safety is
stayed until the disposition of the criminal charges in the Trial Court. An
administrative leave under this division may be with or without pay, as
determined by the Board of Safety. If the member is placed on leave without
pay, the Board of Safety, in its discretion, may award back pay if the member
is exonerated in the criminal matter.
   (B)   Fire Department.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (A)(12) above, a member of the
Municipal Fire Department holds office or grade until he or she is dismissed or
demoted by the Board of Safety. A member may be disciplined by demotion,
dismissal, reprimand, forfeiture, or suspension for causes set forth in rules
adopted by the Board of Safety, which rules are served upon the members of the
Municipal Fire Department. Until such rules are made and served, the causes and
procedures shall be the same as those provided for members of the Metropolitan
Police Department.
      (2)   (a)   Before a member of the Metropolitan Fire Department is
suspended in excess of five days without pay, demoted, or dismissed, the Board
of Safety shall offer the member an opportunity for a hearing. For purposes of
this division (B) and these disciplinary provisions, the Board of Safety is the
Town Council, as town legislative body, which is the appropriate appointing
authority of the town. If a member seeks a hearing, the member must request the
hearing not more than five days after the notice of the suspension, demotion,
or dismissal. Written notice shall be given either by service upon the member
in person or by a copy left at the member's last and usual place of residence
at least 14 days before the date set for the hearing. The hearing conducted
under this division (B) shall be held not more than 30 days after the hearing
is requested by the member unless a later date is mutually agreed upon by the
parties. The notice must state:
            1.   The date, time, and place of the hearing;
            2.   The charges against the member;
            3.   The specific conduct that comprises the charges;
            4.   That the member is entitled to be represented by counsel;
            5.   That the member is entitled to call and cross-examine
witnesses;
            6.   That the member is entitled to require the production of
evidence; and
            7.   That the member is entitled to have subpoenas issued, served,
and executed in the county.
         (b)   In a disciplinary hearing concerning a member of the Municipal
Fire Department, such hearing shall be conducted in the manner prescribed by
the rules adopted by the Board of Safety, which rules shall provide for an
appropriate appeal procedure.
   (C)   In addition to the disciplinary powers of the Board of Safety, the
Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department or the Chief of the Municipal Fire
Department, may, without a hearing, reprimand or suspend without pay a member,
for a maximum of five working days. For the purposes of this division (C),
eight hours of paid time constitutes one working day. If a chief reprimands a
member in writing or suspends a member, the Chief shall, within 48 hours notify
the Board of Safety in writing of the action and the reasons for the action. A
member who is reprimanded in writing or suspended under this division (C) may,
within 48 hours after receiving notice of the reprimand or suspension, request
in writing that the Board of Safety review the reprimand or suspension and
either uphold or reverse the Chief’s decision. At its discretion, the Board of
Safety may hold a hearing during this review. If the Board of Safety holds a
hearing, written notice must be given either by service upon the member in
person or by a copy left at the member's last and usual place of residence at
least 14 days before the date set for the hearing. The notice must contain the
information listed under division (B) of this section. If the decision is
reversed, the member who was suspended is entitled to any wages withheld as a
result of the suspension.

discharged, to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or
possess the characteristics enumerated in division (D)(l) of this section, and
which in the judgment of the Superintendent, may have a deleterious effect upon
the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise
create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent
may:
         (a)    Reject the wastes;
         (b)    Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge
to the public sewers;
         (c)    Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; or

safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense,
and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (I)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Waste- water”, published by the American Public Health Association,
and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable
samples taken at the control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has
been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer
is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples.)
   (J)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the town and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the town for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the

shall be charged each month, even though the property is not used or occupied
year round.
   (C)   The rates and charges to users outside the corporate limits shall be
100% of the rates and charges set forth above.
   (D)   (1) In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered, the town shall have the right to base its
charges not only on volume, but also on the strength and character of the
sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose of. The town shall
have the right to measure and determine the strength and content of all sewage
and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly, into the town’s sanitary
sewage system, in such manner and by such method as it may deem practicable in
the light of the conditions and attending circumstances of the case, in order
to determine the proper charge.
      (2)   Extra charges based on the strength of the sewage and liquid wastes
shall be made on the following basis:
         (a)    Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids. There shall be an
additional charge of $.13 per 1,000 gallons of flow for each 100 milligrams, or
fraction thereof, of suspended solids in excess of 300 milligrams per liter of
fluid.
         (b)    Rate surcharge based upon B.O.D. There shall be an additional
charge of $.16 per 1,000 gallons of flow for each 100 milligrams, or fraction
thereof, of biochemical oxygen demand in excess of 300 milligrams per liter of
fluid.
      (3)   To determine the strength of the sewage and wastes, samplings and
analysis may be made from time to time whenever it is deemed desirable by the
town. After charges have been established based upon the strength of sewage and
wastes, the owner may request reconsideration of these charges by the town by
submitting analyses of composite samples of the sewage and wastes subject to
such charges, certified by a registered engineer or a qualified graduate
chemist. The town may then adjust the charges to the ordinance rates required
by such analysis or may recheck the findings by additional sampling and
analysis. Requests for rate adjustments by the owner may be submitted not more
often than every 12 months.
      (4)   The determination of suspended solids and five-day biological
oxygen demand contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the latest
copy of “Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage and Industrial
Wastes”, as written by the American Public Health Association, the American
Water Works Association and the Federation of Sewage and Industrial Wastes
Association.
   (E)   For services rendered to the town by the works, the town shall be
subject to and pay like rates and charges as herein provided for governmental
users.
   (F)   In order to produce an amount sufficient to meet the interest on the
revenue bonds, and other expenses, payable prior to the completion of the
works, beginning as soon as the actual work has commenced on the sewage works,
the owners of each and every lot, parcel of real estate or building to be
connected with the town’s sanitary sewage system, as a result of construction
of the works, shall pay, each month 63% of the rates and charges established
above, for each such existing structure to be connected. Beginning with the
first month after the sanitary sewers are available for connection and use to
any lot, parcel of real estate or building, the full rates and charges shall
become effective for such lot, parcel of real estate, or building.

§ 51.21 CHARGES PER EMPLOYEE.
   Any user assessed a sewage rate by this chapter which is based upon the
number of employees of such user shall, on or before May 1, 1972, file with the
Clerk-Treasurer an affidavit stating the average number of employees of such
user for the 12-month period ending March 31, 1972. Thereafter, any such user,
shall annually file with the Clerk-Treasurer on or before February 1 of each
year a new affidavit stating the average number of employees of such user for
the preceding calendar year. Such affidavit shall be used by the town as the
prima facie basis for computing the charge to be made to such user; provided
that if in any succeeding month the average number of employees shall increase
by more than 20%, the user shall file a supplemental affidavit to be used as
the basis for computing the charge to such user, and if in any succeeding month
the average number of employees shall decrease by more than 20%, the user may
file a supplemental affidavit to be used as the basis for computing the charge
to such user. The town, by any of its designated officers or employees, shall
have the right to inspect the employment records of any user filing such
affidavit at any reasonable time for the purpose of determining the accuracy of
such affidavit; and if the affidavits required hereunder are not filed, the
town, by any of its designated officers or employees, may estimate the number
of employees as the basis for computing the charge.
(‘82 Code, § 32-201)
§ 51.22 CONNECTION CHARGE.
   The owner of any lot, parcel of real estate, or building connecting to the
sewage works shall, prior to being permitted to make a connection, pay a
connection charge in the amount of $500 for the first dwelling unit upon that
real estate, and an additional connection charge in the amount of $250 for each
additional dwelling unit upon that parcel of real estate, which charge the
Board of Trustees now finds to be a reasonable and equitable pro rata cost of
construction of a local or lateral sewer adequate to serve the property so
connecting.
(‘82 Code, § 32-202)
§ 51.23 ADDITIONAL PREMISES.
   The rates and charges herein fixed shall be extended to and cover any
additional premises hereafter connected with the sewer system of the town

§ 51.24 COLLECTION OF CHARGES.
   (A)   The rates and charges established by this chapter will be billed to
the owners of the property served. Owners are liable for payment as required
herein, and owners have the right to examine all collection records of the town
rates and charges of the property served. Examination of records shall be made
in the office in which the records are kept and during regular business office
hours as established by the town.
   (B)   The rates and charges will be billed to the tenants occupying the
property served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owners but such
billing shall in no way relieve the owner from liability in the event payment
is not made as herein required. The owners of the properties served, which are
occupied by tenants, shall have the right to examine the collection records of
the town for the purpose of determining whether the rates and charges have been
paid by the tenants, provided that the examination shall be made in the office
in which the records are kept and during the hours that the office is open for
business.
   (C)   The Board of Trustees shall make and enforce such bylaws and
regulations as may be deemed necessary for the safe, economical, and efficient
management of the town’s sewerage collection system, regulatory chambers,
pumping station, and sewage treatment facilities, for the construction and use
of house sewers and connections in the sewerage system, and for the regulation,
collection, rebating, and refunding of such rates and charges.

§ 51.25 ENFORCEMENT OF PAYMENT.
   It shall be the duty of the officer charged with the collection of the
charges to enforce payment thereof, together with the penalties provided by
law. If any such charge shall not be paid for service rendered to any lot,
parcel of real estate, or building served within 30 days after written notice
of the amount due has been given to the owner thereof, such officer shall
proceed to enforce payment as directed by the Board of Trustees or as provided

Board or its designee, then the account related to this property shall be
placed on an inactive status from that day forward; provided that the owner of
this property makes a formal, written request of the Board of Trustees for the
establishment of this property on an inactive status.
   (B)   In the event such property has been placed on inactive sewer billing
status and the current owner or a subsequent owner thereof desires to reconnect

of a town wastewater and municipal utility account:
      (1)   Ministerial adjustments including, but not limited to, new home
billings that need to be pro-rated, NSF checks and fees, bankruptcy filings
which require adjustments, and posting error corrections; and/or
      (2)   Penalty fees assessed according to §
51.24 of this code, as amended, that were assessed to the town wastewater and

§ 51.30 SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CHARGE.
   (A)   The equivalent residential customer (ERC) shall $3,500 per new sewer
tap connection for water service lines up to ¾ inch. Effective January 1, 2019,
a one-time charge known as the system development charge will be collected from
new customers of the sewage works system in accordance with the following
schedule:
 
Water Line Service Size Flow Ratio System Development Charge
5/8" x 3/4"             1.00       $ 3,500
1 inch                  2.50       8,751
1¼ inch                4.00       14,001
1½ inch                5.00       17,502
Note: When a building permit is applied for, the system development charge
for larger water service lines will be calculated and applied.
 
   (B)   To determine the system development charge for water line services
over 1 1/2 inches, divide the area of the proposed water line service size by
the area of a 5/8-inch water service line (flow ratio), then multiply by
$3,500.
   (C)   Collection. The established sewage works system development charge
shall be collected as follows:
      (1)   For all existing subdivided lots, the system development charge
shall be collected at the time a building permit is issued for connection to
the sanitary system; or
      (2)   For any unsubdivided non-residential property, the system
development charge shall be paid for:
         (a)   After preliminary or primary plat approval at the time
connection is made to the sanitary sewer system for all sanitary tap
connections required for the lots contained on the preliminary or primary plat;
or
         (b)   After final plat approval and prior to the execution of the
Final Plat mylar for all sanitary tap connections required for the lots
contained on the Final Plat.
      (3)   For any unsubdivided non-residential property, the System
Development Charge shall be paid for:
         (a)   In the minimum amount of $3,500 per connection if the water line
service size is unknown after preliminary or primary plat approval at the time
connection is made to the sanitary sewer system for all sanitary tap
connections required for the lots contained on the preliminary or primary plat;
or
         (b)   In the minimum amount of $3,500 per connection if the water line
service size is unknown after final plat approval and prior to the signing of
the final plat mylar for all sanitary tap connections required for the lots
contained on the final plat; and
         (c)   At the time of building permit issuance for each subdivided lot,
the remainder of the actual system development charge based upon the water line
service size less the minimum amount paid in (C)(3)(a) or (b) of this section.

(Ord. 1002, passed 6-5-07)
§ 53.03 ESTABLISHMENT PROCEDURES; SPECIAL FUND.
   (A)   Stormwater utility user fee establishment procedures. The stormwater
utility user fee shall be $10 per ERU per calendar month. The stormwater
utility user fee is designed to pay the cost of rendering stormwater service to
the users of the stormwater system, and shall be the basis for assessment of
the town’s stormwater utility user fee. This fee is established so as to
maintain fund reserves to provide for reasonably expected variations in the
costs of providing services, as well as variations in the demand for services.
This rate is further established for purposes of servicing capital financing
debt service for stormwater revenue bonds, to be used for stormwater sewer
improvements in the town Y2017 High Grove Subdivision Road Improvement Project,
South Shore Subdivision Road Improvement Project and Parrish Avenue (141st to
151st) Road Improvement Project.
   (B)   Stormwater improvement special fund establishment and related. There
is hereby established a Cedar Lake stormwater improvement special fund. The
fund is established for the specific purpose of segregation and payment of that
portion of the monthly rates collected from the owners of property served by
the Department of Stormwater Management, as well as all users, property owners
and ratepayers of the town stormwater utility, in the amounts identified by the
town financial advisor firm in excess of the current amount of fee before
amendment per ERU ($5), and amount of the increased fee established hereby
required for debt service payment obligations, including reserves, for the

§ 53.04 USER FEE STRUCTURE.
   For the purposes stated herein, there is hereby assessed a stormwater
utility user fee to each stormwater utility customer/user within the municipal
corporate limits of the town in an amount as determined below. For any such
property, lot, parcel of land, building or premises which contributes directly
or indirectly to the stormwater system of the town, such charge shall be based
upon the quantity of equivalent impervious area situated thereon. All
properties having pervious or impervious area within the town will be assigned
an equivalent residential unit (ERU), or a multiple thereof.
   (A)   Residential properties. A monthly flat user fee for stormwater service
rendered to residential property located within the town shall be charged to
each account, according to the service address. All residential properties are
hereby assigned one ERU. This flat rate shall apply to all residential
properties as defined herein, except that any residential property having land
area in excess of five acres shall be assigned one ERU for the first five
acres, and the remaining acres in excess of five acres shall be calculated
according to its land cover type and size and additional ERUs shall be billed
accordingly. This calculation will be rounded to the first decimal place
(nearest tenth of one ERU).
   (B)   Non-residential properties. Non-residential properties located within
the town will be assigned an ERU based upon said properties individually
calculated equivalent impervious area (in square feet) divided by 2,903 square
feet (one ERU). This division will be calculated to the first decimal place
(nearest tenth of one ERU).
   (C)   Vacant residential property. Vacant residential property located
within the town shall be assigned one-half of one ERU except that any vacant
residential property in excess of five acres shall be assigned one-half of one
ERU for the first five acres; thereafter the remaining acres will be calculated
based on the land cover type and additional ERUs will be billed accordingly.
This calculation will be rounded to the first decimal place (nearest tenth of
one ERU).
(Ord. 1002, passed 6-5-07)
§ 53.05 BILLINGS AND TERMS OF PAYMENT.
   (A)   Billings. All stormwater service bills shall be rendered on a monthly
basis, along with the stormwter utility user’s charges for other town utility
services.
   (B)   Terms of payment. The stormwater utility user fee shall be due on the
payment date set out for the town utility bill. It shall be a violation of this
chapter to fail to pay a stormwater service bill when due. All bills for storm
water services not paid on or before the due date, which due date shall be
approximately 15 days after the bill is rendered, shall be subject to a
collection or deferred payment charge equal to 10% of the outstanding balance.
   (C)   Collection. Delinquent stormwater utility user fees may be collected
in a civil action along with other delinquent town utility charges by the town,
and the town shall be permitted to collect its reasonable attorney’s fees and
court costs.
   (D)   Backbilling.
      (1)   Failure to receive a bill is not justification for nonpayment. The
owner of each parcel of land is obligated and required to pay a storm water
utility user fee as set forth by the terms and provisions of this chapter, as
amended.
      (2)   In the event that a parcel is under-billed or in the event that no
bill is issued to the owner or owners of parcels of land in the town, the town
may backbill, or adjust, the fee up to the known date of error or for a period
of one year, whichever period is shorter, after written notice to the parcel
owner. The parcel owner may request that payment of the backbilled charges be
spread over the next 12 monthly billing cycles.
(Ord. 1002, passed 6-5-07; Am. Ord. 1061, passed 9-15-09)
§ 53.06 CREDIT POLICY AND PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Credit availability. Credit will be available to all properties except
individual residential properties for various forms and levels of abatement,
and as approved by the DSM in accordance with the Town of Cedar Lake Stormwater
Service Credit Application and Appeal of ERU Calculations Instruction Manual. A
copy of said Manual is adopted by reference and incorporated as if fully set
forth herein.
      (1)   Maintenance requirements. Credit may only be allowed for lots and
parcels of real property where structural controls are maintained in fully
functional condition and according to maintenance criteria and design standards
required by the DSM.
      (2)   Existing structure credits. Credit may be allowed for previously
constructed abatement features or stormwater controls. The amount of credit
granted will be determined by the methods of design of the structure and as
approved by the DSM.
      (3)   Direct discharge credit. Credit may be granted on the basis of
location of a given property in relation to Cedar Lake, Cedar Creek, Founder’s
Creek/Hog Pen Ditch or West Creek, or any laterals to drains that are regulated
by the Lake County Drainage Board, if such property directly discharges its
stormwater to such drain in conformance with all maintenance criteria and
design standards as applicable.
      (4)   Voluntary controls. Voluntary controls and/or upgrades of existing
private stormwater facilities through retrofitting that exceed the town’s
standard stormwater abatement design criteria may be considered for credit on a
case-by-case basis considering the impact of the controls on the town’s
stormwater system, as determined by the DSM.
      (5)   Industrial NPDES permit credits. No credit shall be allowed for
industries in compliance with federal laws and regulations regarding industrial
stormwater discharge permits.
      (6)   Pollution reduction. No credit shall be allowed for voluntary
efforts to reduce the amount of pollutants in a user’s stormwater runoff or for
improvements to the quality of a user’s stormwater discharge.
      (7)   Regional basins. Credit will not be granted to properties draining
into ponds or basins maintained or owned by the town. Credit may only be
considered for privately owned and maintained regional controls.
      (8)   (a)   Percent discounted credits for private stormwater facilities.
Discounts and credits shall be computed on an ERU basis. A maximum credit equal
to 80% of the gross ERUs originally assigned may be granted for the
construction and maintenance of private stormwater facilities considering the
potential of each such facility to reduce peak and/or volume stormwater flow
and direct discharge capabilities.
         (b)   The administrative costs involved with operation of the DSM
shall be shared by all stormwater utility customer/users, including future
costs incurred to meet quality-based NPDES Permit requirements which provide
community-wide benefits, and thus cannot be credited. The administrative cost
component of the stormwater utility user fee charges is approximately 20% of
the overall DSM operation costs. Discounts and credits shall be cumulative;
however, in no case shall the total amount of discounts and credits exceed 80%
of the stormwater utility customer/user’s gross stormwater utility user fee.
The formula for determining the applicable credit percentage for individual
parcels shall be specifically set out by the DSM.
      (9)   Federal, state, town, county and private roadways. Streets, roads
and highways shall be given 100% credit as they form an integral part of the
stormwater system. The surface water control system incorporated in design of
roadways are areas engineered to convey all design runoff without street
flooding. Primary elements of the drainage system yield community-wide benefits
and are installed to service the general public’s interests.
      (10)   Subdivision group credit. A subdivision group comprised of
residential properties and/or vacant residential properties may be eligible for
a subdivision group credit.
      (11)   Non-residential property credit.
         (a)   A credit will be available to non-residential property owners
for abatement of the storm water utility user fee imposed on such parcels as
set forth herein. A non-residential property owner may elect and apply for a
credit or discount determination under division (B) of this section, as well as
appeal any ERU determinations as permitted by §
53.07 for credit/discount/correction benefits as permitted by said
aforementioned ordinance provisions. Alternatively, a credit of 20% of the eru
(s) computed and applied to a non residential property shall be provided to
such parcel or parcels.
         (b)   A non-residential property owner may elect the greater of the
alternative credit, or appeal and administrative review credit, for the storm
water utility user fee to be computed and charged, but not both. In the event
no administrative review credit is applied for or sought, the alternative 20%
credit will be applied, but in no event shall the storm water utility user fee
under this alternative be less than one (1) ERU rate charge for such property.
   (B)   Credit procedures.
      (1)   Timing of applications/determinations. An application for credit
shall be made on forms provided by the DSM and the Clerk-Treasurer and shall be
accompanied by the appropriate application fee in the sum of $100. It is the
intent of the town that all applications will be reviewed and credits and
discounts determined within 45 days after submittal of a complete and correct
application package. Any credit issued or approved will be effective on the
first billing cycle for that property following completion of construction, or
the date of the application. However, in the discretion of the DSM, and as
determined by the DSM, a credit issued or approved may be applied retroactively
to the first billing of service charges under this chapter.
      (2)   Appeals. Appeals of credit or discount determinations shall be
considered and reviewed consistent with the procedures set out below for
reconsideration of ERU determinations.
      (3)   Payment required pending appeal determination. An application for
credit, or an appeal of a determination thereon, shall not constitute a valid
reason for non-payment of the originally assessed stormwater service charge by
the stormwater utility customer/user.
(Ord. 1002, passed 6-5-07; Am. Ord. 1278, passed 12-19-17)
§ 53.07 APPEALS OF ERU DETERMINATIONS.
   In the event that a stormwater utility customer/user determines that the ERU
multiple assigned to said user’s real property is incorrect for any reason,
said stormwater utility customer/user shall have the right to appeal the ERU
determination and thus the rate assessed in the following manner:
   (A)   The stormwater utility customer/user shall obtain and complete a
petition to appeal storm water rate form (“petition”), which shall be returned
to the Clerk-Treasurer with verifiable documentation supporting the appeal.
   (B)   The Director shall investigate the appeal and, upon review thereof,
shall render a written determination to the Board and the stormwater utility
customer/user that either the original ERU determination and assessed rate
should be affirmed or the stormwater utility user fee should be adjusted in
accordance with the petition.
   (C)   In the event that a petition to appeal is denied, said determination
shall be forwarded to the stormwater utility customer/user by certified mail,
return receipt requested. The stormwater utility customer/user shall then have
30 days from the date of receipt of said determination to request a
reconsideration by the Board. Any additional facts concerning the appeal shall
be submitted in writing to the DSM, along with a copy of the original petition
and supporting documents, to the Board. The Director shall submit a written
report of the determination in the case, along with any documents used in
denying the appeal.
   (D)   Thereafter, the Board shall review all documentation and, if requested
in writing by the stormwater utility customer/user, conduct a hearing to
determine and resolve the appeal. Such hearing will be scheduled by the DSM and
the stormwater utility customer/user will be notified by certified mail of the
date of such hearing, which notice shall be received by the stormwater utility
customer/user at least seven days prior to the date of such hearing. A written
opinion shall be rendered within 45 days after the hearing or submission of
documentation if no hearing is conducted. The written opinion of the Board
shall constitute the final DSM determination. The hearing shall be
electronically recorded and if requested by the stormwater utility customer/
user, a transcript of the hearing shall be provided to the stormwater utility
customer/user. The stormwater utility customer/user will be charged at a cost
per page as determined by the Board, in accordance with applicable law, as
amended from time to time.
   (E)   A stormwater utility customer/user aggrieved by the final Board
determination shall have the right to judicial review of such determination in
accordance with applicable Indiana law.
   (F)   If the Director recommends the stormwater utility user fee be reduced,
or reduction is ordered by the Director, the Board or any court of competent
jurisdiction, the stormwater utility customer/user shall be credited
accordingly for any overpayment made from the date of the petition.
   (G)   Dispute or appeal of an ERU determination or stormwater service rate
shall not be a valid reason for non-payment of the originally assessed storm
water utility user fee by the stormwater utility customer/user.
(Ord. 1002, passed 6-5-07)
§ 53.08 STORMWATER FUND.
   (A)   There is hereby established for the town a Cedar Lake Stormwater
Operation and Maintenance Fund, which shall be a non- reverting fund. All
revenues and fees collected for stormwater service, including, but not limited
to, stormwater utility user fees, credit application fees, and interest
earnings on any unused funds, shall be deposited in the Cedar Lake Stormwater
Operation and Maintenance Fund. Disbursements from this fund will be authorized
by the Board. Such disbursements will be used for the operation, maintenance
and improvement of the town’s stormwater system in accordance with applicable
Indiana law. Monies from this fund shall not revert to any other town utilities
or town fund and may not be transferred for any other purpose, except as
permitted by applicable Indiana law. The fund shall exist in perpetuity or
until such time as this chapter has been repealed, at which time any monies
held in said fund shall be transferred to the town’s general fund after payment
of any and all fees, expenses or charges that may then be owing for the
operation, maintenance and improvement of the town’s stormwater system.
   (B)   Commencing in the first quarter of 2008, the Board, in cooperation
with the Clerk-Treasurer, shall, on a biennial basis retain the services of a
certified public accountant to perform an independent financial management
report regarding the DSM and the stormwater utility. Such report shall include
an evaluation of the rates and charges collected by the DSM, including the
stormwater utility user fee, expenditures by the Board, anticipated future
revenues, and the overall financial condition of the DSM and the stormwater
utility. The report is intended to provide information to the Board and the
town officials in their role as managers of the stormwater utility. The cost of
such report shall be paid by the DSM from the Cedar Lake Storm Water Operation
and Maintenance Fund.
(Ord. 1002, passed 6-5-07)
§ 53.09 LIEN ON PREMISES.
   Each stormwater utility user fee charged pursuant to this chapter is hereby
made a lien upon the residential, non-residential and vacant residential
property to which the same is charged, and, if the same is not paid within 90
days after it shall be due and payable, it may, in the discretion of the Board,
be certified to the Auditor of Lake County, who shall place the same on the tax
duplicate of said county with the interest and penalties allowed by law to be
collected as other taxes are collected.

vehicle proceeding.
   (B)   If a person who drives a vehicle is involved in a collision with a
pedestrian in a crosswalk or a vehicle in the intersection after driving past a
yield sign without stopping, the collision is considered prima facie evidence
of the person’s failure to yield the right-of-way.

amended from time to time, shall be cited by any authorized representative of
the town which receives a complaint regarding weeds, noxious growth, rank
vegetation, or any other environmental public nuisance on any property within
the town.
   (B)   Assignment of complaint. A complaint shall be forwarded to the duly
designated inspector for processing and inspection, who shall follow that
complaint case through to its resolution or compliance disposition.
   (C)   Notice to abate. Upon receipt of a complaint that weeds, noxious
growth, rank vegetation, or other environmental public nuisance exists in
violation of this subchapter, the inspector shall make an inspection and upon
confirmation of the same, shall cause written notice to be issued to the
property owner by first class mail or an equivalent service permitted under IC
1-1-7-1, to:
      (l)   The owner of record of real property with a single owner; or
      (2)   At least one of the owners of real property with multiple owners;
at the last address of the owner for the property as indicated in the records
of the Auditor's Office of Lake County on the date of the notice.
   (D)   Contents of notice. The notice to abate shall contain the following
information:
      (1)   The address of the real property;
      (2)   The date of the notice;
      (3)   The address and the telephone number of the Planning and Building
Department; and
      (4)   A statement that the designated violation shall be removed from the
property within five calendar days after the mailing of the notice, or the

class mail, or equivalent service under division (C) above, a continuous
abatement notice may be posted at the property at the time of abatement instead
of by certified mail, first class mail, or equivalent service as required under

property owner that each subsequent violation during the same year for which
the initial notice of the violation was provided may be abated by the town or
its contractors.

environmental public nuisance still exists, action shall be taken to abate said
condition in accordance with the provisions of this section and these
regulations, as amended from time to time.
   (B)   Citation for violation. In the event that the inspector finds that
weeds, rank vegetation, and/or other environmental public nuisance exists on

violations. In the event that the enforcement authority uses municipal
employees to perform the abatement, the town shall set and assign an
appropriate per hour rate for employees, equipment, supplies and chemicals that
may be used.
   (G)   Responsibility for abatement expense. The property owner shall be
responsible for all expenses related to abatement of the violation performed by
the town. Following receipt of the statement of actual cost involved for the
abatement of the violation, the town shall send the statement to the owner by
first-class mail. The owner shall pay the amount noted to the town within 14
days after receipt, which shall be deposited in the Town General Fund.
   (H)   In the event that the owner fails to pay a town bill or invoice issued
under this subchapter within 14 days, and has not filed an appeal, as provided

the organization, the name and telephone number of the responsible and
authorized organization representative, the list of locations where
solicitation activities will be undertaken, and all related information.
      (6)   All solicitation activities permitted shall be authorized to start
no earlier than 8:00 a.m., and conclude or finish in four consecutive hours.
This will mean that solicitation activities commencing at 8:00 a.m. will
conclude at 12:00 p.m., by example. All solicitation activities will be
completed by 1:00 p.m., on the approved day, regardless of the time of
commencement.

solicitation activities pursuant to the provisions of this section, as the same
is amended from time to time. This agreement will be in a form and content
deemed appropriate by the town, and shall be required to be executed and
delivered together with the insurance certificates before the solicitation day
activities are permitted.
   (C)   Enforcement. In the event of noncompliance or violation of any of the
terms of this section, Metropolitan Police Department personnel shall be
authorized to immediately terminate and end the solicitation activities of the
organization occurring in violation hereof. Due to the sensitive nature and
safety requirements of such activities, it is deemed an appropriate exercise of
the police power of the town to serve and protect both pedestrians as well as
individuals operating motor vehicles to assure the safety of all residents,
citizens and affected individuals. Additionally, the Town Council may pursue
any and all remedies available at law, including utilization of its
discretionary legislative authority to decline to permit other applications by
the violating entity or organization seeking permission and authority for
solicitation activities.

which a special charge is made based on program or service content, time, or
spectrum space usage.
   “BASIC SERVICE.” All subscriber services provided by the grantee in one or

which is required for the selection or use of such programming or other

communication services are authorized by this chapter. In addition, the
definition of “CABLE SYSTEM” shall not be deemed to circumscribe any valid

activities of telephone or telegraph companies, or the provision of any service
over the cable system that is not a "Cable Service" as such term is defined
herein.

   “CONTROL” or “CONTROLLING INTEREST.” Actual working control or ownership of

percent or more of a cable system or the franchise under which the system is
operated. A change in the control or controlling interest of an entity which

§ 115.008 TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (F) below, a franchise shall not be
assigned, transferred, pledged, leased, sublet, hypothecated, or mortgaged,
either in whole or in part, in any manner, nor shall title thereto, either
legal or equitable, or any right, interest or property therein, pass to or vest
in any person without the prior written approval of the Municipality. The
grantee may, however, transfer or assign the franchise to a parent or wholly
owned subsidiary of the grantee and such parent or subsidiary may transfer or
assign the franchise back to the grantee without such consent, providing that
such assignment is without any release of liability of the grantee. Any
proposed assignee must show legal, technical and financial responsibility as
determined by the Municipality, and must agree, in writing, to comply with all
provisions of the franchise. The grantee shall submit a petition to the
Municipality requesting the Municipality's approval at least 90 days before the
grantee takes any action in furtherance of accomplishing any such assignment,
transfer, pledge, lease, sublet, hypothecation, or mortgage, containing or
accompanied by such information as is required in accordance with FCC
regulations and by the Municipality. The Municipality shall have 120 days to
act upon any request for approval of any such assignment, transfer, pledge,
lease, sublet, hypothecation, or mortgage. The Municipality shall be deemed to
have consented to a proposed assignment, transfer, pledge, lease, sublet,
hypothecation, or mortgage if it fails to render a final decision within 120
days following receipt of the petition and receipt of all necessary information
as to the effect of the proposed assignment, transfer, pledge, lease, sublet,
hypothecation, or mortgage upon the public, unless the requesting party and the
Municipality agree to an extension of time. The Municipality shall not
unreasonably withhold consent to a proposed transfer and shall promptly notify
grantee of any action taken on such a request. Where the Municipality deems to
have found the petition to be incomplete or requiring further information, the
Municipality shall request further information from the grantee within 30
calendar days from the receipt of the petition.
   (B)   The grantee shall promptly notify the Municipality of any actual or
proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of,
control of the grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to
major stockholders but also includes actual working control in whatever manner
exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred
shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of
persons (excluding any parent or subsidiary thereof) of 5% or more of the of
the grantee or the franchise under which the cable system is operated. Change,
transfer or acquisition of control of the grantee without the Municipality's
consent shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the
Municipality shall have consented thereto, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent
to such change, transfer or acquisition of control, the Municipality may
inquire into the qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the
grantee shall assist the Municipality in such inquiry.
   (C)   The consent or approval of the Municipality to any transfer of the
grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the
Municipality in and to any public street or public way, and any transfer shall,
by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of the
franchise.
   (D)   In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the Municipality shall
not be required to approve any transfer or assignment of a new franchise prior
to substantial completion of construction of the proposed system.
   (E)   In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved
without the successor(s) in interest to the franchise agreement becoming a
signatory to the franchise agreement.
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit any assignment,
pledge, lease, sublease, mortgage, or other transfer of all or any part of the
grantee's cable system, or any right or interest therein, solely for financing
purposes, provided that each such assignment, pledge, lease, sublease,
mortgage, or other transfer shall be subject and subordinate to the rights of
the Municipality pursuant to this chapter, the franchise agreement, and
applicable law.

received from such agencies shall be provided to the Municipality within ten
working days of the Municipality's request.

§ 115.011 TIME OF THE ESSENCE.
   Whenever any provision of this chapter or the franchise agreement shall set
forth any time for any act to be performed by a grantee, such time shall be
deemed to be of the essence. The grantee's failure to perform within the time
allotted shall, in all cases, be sufficient grounds for the Municipality to
invoke an appropriate remedy or penalty, which may include the revocation of
the franchise.
(Ord. 767, passed 4-25-00)
§ 115.012 DELEGATION OF POWERS.
   Any right, power, or duty of the Municipality, the agency or any official of

appropriate officer, employee, or department of the Municipality, the
Consortium, or any legal authority created for the purpose of regulating the
operation and development of the cable system.

parties as part of a franchise agreement; provided, however, that such

franchise, files with the Municipality its unconditional acceptance of the
franchise and promise to comply with and abide by all of its provisions, terms
and conditions and the provisions of this chapter, now, and as hereafter

(Ord. 767, passed 4-25-00)
§ 115.024 RENEWAL.
   (A)   To the extent applicable, current federal procedures and standards
pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 546 shall govern the renewal of any franchise awarded
by the approval and passage of this chapter.
   (B)   In the event that any or all of the applicable provisions of federal

grantee shall notify the Municipality in writing of its intent to seek renewal
of the franchise.
      (2)   The grantee shall submit a written proposal for renewal which

with the terms, conditions, and limitations of this chapter, as amended from
time to time, and its franchise;
         (b)   That its system has been installed, constructed, maintained and

         (c)   That it has the legal, technical, financial, and other
qualifications as set forth in this chapter or a franchise agreement, to
provide the services, facilities, and equipment set forth in its proposal; and
         (d)   That it has made a good faith effort to provide services and
facilities which accommodate the demonstrated needs and interests of the
community as may be reasonably ascertained by the Municipality, with public
input; and that it has made a good faith effort to maintain, operate, and
extend its system as the state of the art progresses so as to assure its
subscribers high quality service, balanced against the costs of such needs and
interests.
      (3)   The Municipality shall proceed to determine whether the grantee has
satisfactorily performed its obligations under the franchise. To determine
satisfactory performance, the Municipality shall consider all relevant

satisfactory, and finds the grantee's technical, legal, and financial abilities

related needs of the community, balanced against the costs of meeting these
needs and interests, a new franchise shall be granted pursuant to this chapter
as amended for a period to be determined by the Municipality.

of which shall be separate and distinct obligations of the grantee and its
affiliates;
      (3)   Neither the grantee nor any affiliate shall have or make any claim

tax or other fee or charge, or if the grantee or any affiliate applies or seeks
to apply all or any part of any such tax or other fee or charge as a deduction

chapter and the franchise. In the event that the Municipality finds, by
resolution, that the grantee has failed to maintain these technical standards

improvements to be made, the grantee shall make such improvements. Failure to
make such improvements within three months of such resolution will constitute a
breach of a condition for which penalties contained in §
115.999 are applicable.
   (M)   The grantee shall keep a monthly service log which indicates the
nature of each service complaint received in the last 24 months, the date and

or subcontractors who are in contact with cable subscribers shall wear on their
outer clothing identification cards bearing their name and photograph. The
grantee shall account for all identification cards at all times. Every vehicle
of the grantee shall be clearly visually identified to the public as working
for the grantee. Vehicles belonging to contractors or subcontractors of the
grantee shall be clearly identified with the name of the contractor or
subcontractor and the grantee. Such identification need not be of a permanent
nature. All customer service representatives shall identify themselves orally
to callers.
(Ord. 767, passed 4-25-00)
§ 115.066 CONTINUITY OF SERVICE MANDATORY.
   (A)   It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving service
as long as their financial and other obligations to the grantee are honored. If
the grantee elects to over build, rebuild, modify or sell the system, or the
Municipality gives notice of intent to terminate or fails to renew the
franchise, the grantee shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive
continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances for a period
not to exceed six months after the franchise has terminated.
   (B)   In the event that there is a change of franchise, or if a new operator
acquires the system, the grantee shall cooperate with the Municipality, new
franchisee and operator in maintaining continuity of service to all
subscribers. During such period, the grantee shall be entitled to the revenues
for any period during which it operates the system.
   (C)   In the event that the grantee fails to operate the system for three
consecutive days without prior approval of the Municipality or without just
cause, the Municipality, may, at its option, operate the system or designate an
operator until such time as the grantee restores service under conditions
acceptable to the Municipality or a permanent operator is selected. In the
event that the Municipality is required to fulfill this obligation for the
grantee, the Municipality shall be entitled to all revenues for any period
during which it operates the system and shall be entitled to draw on the letter
of credit and cash security deposit established pursuant to §
115.060 of this chapter to recover all of its costs and damages in excess of
such revenues. In any event, the grantee shall be obligated to reimburse the
Municipality for all costs or damages incurred by the Municipality resulting
from the grantee's failure to perform that the Municipality does not recover
from such revenues or the letter of credit or cash security deposit.
(Ord. 767, passed 4-25-00)
§ 115.067 COMPLAINT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   During the term of the franchise and any renewal thereof, the grantee
shall maintain a central office for the purpose of receiving and resolving all
complaints regarding the quality of service, equipment malfunctions, billing,
and similar matters. The office must be reachable by a local and/or toll-free
telephone call to receive complaints regarding quality of service, equipment
functions and similar matters. The grantee will make good faith efforts to
arrange for one or more payment location in a central location where customers
can pay bills or conduct other business activities.
   (B)   As subscribers are connected or reconnected to the system, the grantee
shall, by appropriate means such as a card or brochure, furnish information
concerning the procedures for making inquiries or complaints, including the
name, address and local or toll free telephone number of the employee or
employees or agent to whom such inquiries or complaints are to be addressed.
   (C)   When there have been similar complaints made, or where there exists
other evidence, which, in the judgment of the Municipality, in consultation
with the grantee, casts doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service,
the Municipality shall have the right and authority to require the grantee to
test, analyze and report on the performance of the system. The grantee shall
fully cooperate with the Municipality in performing such testing and shall
prepare results and a report, if requested, within 30 days after notice. Such
report shall include the following information:
      (1)   The nature of the complaint or problem that precipitated the
special tests;
      (2)   The system component(s) tested;
      (3)   The equipment used and procedures employed in testing;
      (4)   The method, if any, in which such complaint or problem was
resolved; and
      (5)   Any other information pertinent to the tests and analysis which may
be required.
   (D)   If, after receiving grantee's report, and after the grantee has
completed any corrective action identified in the report, the Municipality
determines that reasonable evidence still exists of inadequate cable system
performance, then the Municipality may enlist an independent engineer at
grantee's expense to perform tests and analysis directed toward such suspected
failures to meet the requirements of this chapter. The grantee shall cooperate
and permit such testing.
   (E)   The Municipality shall require tests, analysis and reports covering
specific subjects and characteristics based on complaints or other evidence
only when the Municipality has reasonable grounds to believe that the
complaints or other evidence require that tests be performed to protect the
public against substandard cable service.

than the above minimum requirements, in which case the schedule will be made
part of the franchise agreement, and will be binding upon the grantee.
   (C)   Any delay beyond the terms of this timetable, unless specifically
approved by the Municipality, will be considered a violation of this chapter
for which the provisions of either §§
115.101 or
115.999 shall apply, as determined by the Municipality.
   (D)   In special circumstances and for good cause shown by the grantee, the
Municipality, in the exercise of its sole discretion, may waive 100% completion
within the two year time frame, provided that substantial completion is
accomplished within the allotted time frame, substantial completion to be not
less than 95%. Justification for less than 100% must be submitted subject to
the approval of the Municipality.
   (E)   Where the grantee is rebuilding, reconstructing, or upgrading its
cable system, such rebuilding, reconstruction, or upgrade of the cable system
must be completed within 18 months from the issuance of the initial permit for
construction. The grantee and the Municipality may agree to a lesser or greater
period of time for reconstruction, rebuilding, or upgrading in a franchise
agreement.
(Ord. 767, passed 4-25-00)
§ 115.081 LINE EXTENSIONS.
   (A)   In areas of the franchise territory not initially served, a grantee
shall be required to extend its system pursuant to the following requirements:
      (1)   No customer shall be refused service arbitrarily. To expedite the
process of extending the cable system into a new subdivision, the Municipality
will forward to the grantee an approved engineering plan of each project.
Subject to the density requirements, the grantee shall commence the design and
construction process upon receipt of the final engineering plan. Upon
notification from the Municipality that the first home in the project has been
approved for a building permit, the grantee shall have a maximum of three
months to complete the construction/ activation process within the applicable
project phase, barring any unforeseen adverse weather or ground conditions.
      (2)   Unless a franchise agreement provides otherwise, a grantee must
make cable service available to every unserved structure within the franchise
area. The grantee shall extend service to any annexed areas according to the
following schedule:
         (a)   For areas of territory annexed to the city of five acres or
more, the grantee shall extend service to such areas within three months of the
date of annexation; or
         (b)   For those areas of less than five acres, the grantee shall
extend service to such annexed areas within one month of the date of
annexation. Where unserved structures located within the franchise area have
been previously annexed into the Municipality prior to the effective date of a
franchise agreement, the grantee shall extend service to such areas within 12
months for areas of less than five acres and within 18 months for areas of five
acres or more.
      (3)   The grantee shall extend and make cable service available to any
isolated resident outside the initial service area requesting connection at the
standard connection charge, if the connection to the isolated resident would
require no more than a standard 125 foot drop line.
   (B)   The franchising authority may contract with owners of real property
for the installation of cable service and the construction of cable system
lines within the Municipality or within one and one half (1½) miles in order to
provide service for the area in which the real property of the owners is
located. The contract must provide, for a term not to exceed that agreed upon
between the grantee and the franchising authority in a franchise agreement, for
the payment to the owners and their assigns by any owner of real property who
did not contribute to the original cost of the wiring of cable service to the
area in which the real property of the owners is located; and subsequently
obtains a subscription for cable service and is served served by the wiring of
cable service to the area in which the real property of the owners is located;
of a pro-rata share of the cost of the construction of the cable system subject
to the conditions of this chapter, the franchise agreement, and applicable law
and notwithstanding any other law relating to the functions of local government
entities. However, the contract does not apply to any owner of real property
who is not a party to it unless it has been recorded in the office of the
County Recorder before the owner has received installation of the cable system.
The franchising authority may provide that the pro-rata share of the cost of
construction include interest at a rate not exceeding the amount of interest
allowed on judgments, and the interest shall be computed from the date that the
extension of the cable system was approved by the franchising authority to the
date payment is made to the Municipality.
   (C)   The contract must include, as part of the consideration running to the
Municipality, the release of the right of the parties to the contract and their
successors in title to remonstrate against pending or future annexations of the
Municipality of the area served by the cable system. Any person who is
connected to the cable system and receives cable service contracted for is
considered to waive his/her rights to remonstrate against the annexation of the
area served by the cable system. The aforementioned does not apply if the costs
of extension of or connection to the cable system are paid by a person other
than the landowner or the Municipality.
   (D)   This section shall apply when:
      (1)   Any part of the cost of a cable system is to be assessed against
the owners of real property;
      (2)   The proposed cable system is to be connected into the cable system
referenced under this chapter or a franchise agreement;
      (3)   The owners did not contribute to the cost of the extension of the
cable system.
   (E)   There shall be included in the grantee's estimate, submitted to the
franchising authority and the assessments, a sum equal to the amount provided
in or computed from the contract as the fair pro-rata share due from the owners
upon and for the contracted extension of the cable system, including any
interest owed. The sum included in the grantee's estimate must be separately
itemized.
   (F)   In cases of new construction or property development where utilities
are to be placed underground, all cable system facilities also shall be placed
underground, except as otherwise specifically approved in advance by the
Municipality. In the event that the grantee receives notice of such new
construction or property development, including the date on which open
trenching is available for the grantee's work (the "Notice"), then the grantee
shall provide, to the developer or property owner and to the Municipality, the
specifications for its trenching, and the grantee shall install its conduit,
pedestals and vaults, and laterals within five working days after the trenches
first become available to the grantee for such work. Costs of trenching and
easements required to bring service to the development shall be borne by the
developer or property owner; provided, however, that if the grantee fails to
install its conduit, pedestals and vaults, and laterals within five working
days, then the cost of any new trenching, and easements if necessary, shall be
borne by the grantee. The notice may be given to the grantee at the address
stated in the franchise agreement or to the local general manager or system
engineer of the grantee. Written or oral notice from the developer, property
owner, or Municipality shall be sufficient to qualify as the notice.
   (G)   Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the grantee from serving
areas of the service area not covered under this section upon agreement with
developers, property owners, residents, or businesses, provided that all
applicable fees are paid by the grantee to the Municipality therefor, including
without limitation the franchise fee provided in this chapter, as may be
amended from time to time.
   (H)   A grantee, in its new or renewal application, may propose a line
extension policy that will result in serving more residents of the service area
than as required above, in which case the grantee's policy will be incorporated
into the franchise agreement and will be binding on the grantee.
   (I)   Any violation of this section shall be considered a violation of this
chapter for which the provisions of either §§
115.101 or
115.999 shall apply, as determined by the Municipality.

the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
      (6)   The grantee shall regularly check radio frequency leakage at
reception locations for emergency radio services to prove and verify that no
interference signal combinations are possible which may disrupt municipal
public works, police, fire, or administrative communications, or township,
county, or state communications. Stray radiation shall be measured adjacent to
any proposed aeronautical navigation radio sites to prove no interference to
airborne navigational reception in the normal flight patterns. All applicable
FCC rules and regulations shall govern.
      (7)   The grantee shall maintain equipment capable of providing standby
power for headend, transportation and trunk amplifiers for a minimum of four
hours.
      (8)   All towers, antennas, satellite receive stations, cable wiring,
service connections, and other exposed equipment located within the service

Safety Code and the National Electrical Code as now or hereafter amended. The
grantee shall also comply with any local ordinance pertaining to the
establishment of electrical grounding standards, and with any additional
grounding standards established by electric and telephone companies if the
grantee has arranged to lease pole space from the companies. In the event that
the grantee has erected wiring and related appurtenances upon poles owned by
private parties other than electric or telephone companies, the grantee shall
comply with provisions of the National Electrical Code. The grantee, at its
discretion, may properly ground the equipment in such a manner that exceeds
normal engineering requirements, provided, however, that such grounding is in
compliance with the National Electrical Code.
      (9)   In all areas of the Municipality where the cables, wires and other
like facilities of public utilities are placed underground, all cables, wires
and other like facilities of the grantee installed after the effective date of
the grantee's franchise shall be placed underground. When public utilities
relocate their facilities from pole to underground, the grantee shall
concurrently do so at no expense to the Municipality.
      (10)   Where the grantee places cabling underground as part of a
relocation of cabling, or as an element of new construction or reconstruction
of the cable system, the grantee shall utilize directional boring wherever
possible.
(Ord. 767, passed 4-25-00)
§ 115.083 PLANS & PERMITS.
   (A)   Right to review; briefings.
      (1)   The Municipality shall have the right to review the grantee's
construction plans and specifications prior to the commencement of any new
construction to assure compliance with the standards specified in this chapter
and to inspect all aspects of cable system construction. The Municipality shall
not, however, be required to review or approve such plans and specifications or
to make such inspections, and the Municipality specifically disclaims such
obligation. The grantee shall be solely responsible for taking all steps
necessary to assure compliance with such standards and to ensure that the cable
system is installed in a safe manner and pursuant to the terms and conditions
of this chapter and the franchise agreement.
      (2)   Before beginning new construction of, or on any part of, the cable
system, the grantee's chief engineer or designated individual shall meet with
the Municipal Administrator, Manager or designated individual to provide and
explain the grantee's construction plans and work program in detail. Similar
briefings shall be held from time to time as deemed necessary by either the
Municipality or the grantee until the work is completed.
   (B)   The grantee shall, within 90 days after the effective date of its
franchise, furnish to the Municipality complete "as-built" plans of the cable
system and shall, thereafter, furnish to the Municipality amendments to such
plans within 45 days after completion of any extension or modification of the
cable system. If so requested by the grantee, the Municipality shall keep such
as-built plans confidential to the extent allowable by law, and shall show such
plans only to those employees, contractors or Municipality officials who need
to see them as a part of their responsibilities to the Municipality, or
pursuant to their responsibilities for locating utilities. Upon implementation
of a municipal Geographic Information System (GIS), the grantee shall provide
said "as-built" plans in a digital format which is compatible to the computer
systems of the grantee and the Municipality.
   (C)   The grantee shall obtain permits from the Municipality before
commencing any new construction of or within the cable system, with specific
permission being required for the opening or disturbance of any public street
or public way within the Municipality. The permit application shall include a
plan drawn in sufficient detail to demonstrate to the Municipality that the
cable system will be constructed in accordance with all applicable codes and
ordinances. Where cable is to be installed on existing poles, the permit
application shall include a drawing showing the existing poles and additional
poles, if requested. Without characterizing the violation of other provisions
of this chapter, as amended from time to time, the failure to obtain permits
shall constitute a material violation of this chapter. The grantee also, before
the commencement of new construction of, or on any part of, the cable system,
shall become and remain a member of the J.U.L.I.E. system, or the utility
locating system serving Lake County, Indiana ("Holey Moley"). The grantee may
redact any information which it deems proprietary.
   (D)   All work involved in the construction, operation, maintenance, repair,
and removal of the cable system, or any part thereof, shall be performed in a
workmanlike manner using materials of good and durable quality. If, at any
time, it is determined by the Municipality or any other agency or authority of
competent jurisdiction that any part of the cable system, including without
limitation any means used to distribute signals over or within the cable
system, is harmful to the health or safety of any person, then the grantee, at
its sole cost and expense, shall promptly correct all such conditions. Any
contractor, subcontractor, or other person proposed to be employed for the
installation, maintenance, relocation, or repair of cable system equipment or
facilities shall be licensed in accordance with applicable laws and shall be
thoroughly experienced in the work for which he or she is retained.
   (E)   The grantee shall at all times comply with the rules and regulations
for infrastructure specifications as found in Appendix A of this chapter and
any and all rules and regulations enacted or to be enacted by the Municipality
with reference to construction activity in public streets or public ways. All
poles, wires, conduits, cables, equipment, pipes, appurtenances, structures,
and other facilities of the cable system shall be installed and located in
compliance with all applicable municipal codes and ordinances and the
applicable provisions of the franchise so as to cause minimum interference with
the rights and reasonable convenience of the general public, all as determined
by the Municipality in its sole and absolute discretion. Unless the
Municipality shall in writing waive its right to review plans, no construction
or other work relating to such facilities within the public streets and public
ways of the Municipality shall be commenced until the Municipality shall have
approved and issued a permit on the plans, specifications and methods for such
work. Any such permit may be so conditioned or restricted as deemed necessary
by the Municipality to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. All such
facilities shall at all times be kept and maintained in a safe condition and in
good order and repair.

§ 115.084 LOCATION OF PEDESTALS AND VAULTS.
   (A)   Pedestals and similar aboveground appurtenances.
      (1)   The Municipality has determined that pedestals and similar
aboveground appurtenances located on a public street or public way (other than
in an alley or as provided in division (C) below) or on public property will
adversely affect the appearance of the Municipality and of the property
therein. Accordingly, pursuant to § 541(a)(2) of the Cable Act, the grantee
shall not under any circumstances install or locate a pedestal or any similar
aboveground appurtenance on any public street or public way (other than in an
alley or as provided in division (C) below) or on any public property as a part
of any new construction or any relocation or reinstallation.
      (2)   Pedestals or similar aboveground appurtenances may be installed on
private property only with the express, prior written consent and permission of
the affected property owner or his or her authorized agent, or the duly elected
or appointed representative of the affected property; provided, however, that
such pedestals or aboveground appurtenances shall comply with all applicable
provisions of the Municipal Code.
      (3)   Notwithstanding division (B) above, pedestals or similar
aboveground appurtenances may be installed within certain utility easements on
private property without the consent or permission of the affected property
owner provided that the grantee is lawfully authorized to use such utility
easement pursuant to applicable state or federal law; no such pedestal or
similar aboveground appurtenance may be installed unless, at the time of the
desired installation, there exists within the utility easement,a similar
aboveground appurtenance of another utility company or entity; the grantee's
pedestal or similar aboveground appurtenance shall be located as close as is
practicable to the existing aboveground appurtenance; and in the event of an
emergency, the grantee shall attempt to contact the property owner or legal
tenant in person and shall leave a door hanger notice in the event personal
contact is not made.
   (B)   Vaults.
      (1)   The grantee shall not install underground vaults on any public
street or public way after the effective date of this franchise, except in
accordance with and pursuant to the provisions of subsection (4) below. All
underground vaults shall be flush mounted with the surface of the land area.
      (2)   The grantee shall inform the owner of any private property in the
Municipality where the grantee contemplates placing a vault on the parkway
immediately adjacent to the private property, that the owner has the right to
elect between the construction and installation of an underground vault on the
owner's private property or on the public street or public way (including,
without limitation, the parkway) immediately adjacent to the owner's property.
Notice shall be in writing, in form and substance acceptable to the Municipal
Administrator or Manager, and delivered by certified mail or personal delivery
to the owner at least 30 days immediately before the commencement of
construction on or around the owner's property.
      (3)   In the event that the owner elects to allow construction and
installation of an underground vault on the owner's property, then the owner
shall be required to grant the grantee an easement, in form reviewed and
approved by the Municipality's attorney, allowing for such construction and
installation.
      (4)   In the event that the owner elects not to allow construction and
installation of an underground vault on the owner's property; fails to respond
to the election notice delivered by the grantee pursuant to subsection (2)
above within 45 days after the owner receives the notice; or refuses to grant
the grantee the easement pursuant to subsection (3) above within 30 days after
the owner's receipt of an easement document, then the grantee shall be entitled
to construct and install an underground vault on the public way (including,
without limitation, the parkway) that is immediately adjacent to the owner's
property.
   (C)   Trenching requirements. The grantee shall excavate all trenches at a
depth no less than that required by the National Electrical Code for the
installation of drop cable, feeder cable and trunk cable. All open trenches in
which work is being performed shall be covered at the end of each working day,
and when the trench is not occupied by a work crew, with a wooden covering in a
public way, or with a metal covering where work is being performed in a public
street. Coverings shall be adequately secured in order to prevent movement of
the trench cover which would expose the trench opening.
(Ord. 767, passed 4-25-00)
§ 115.085 USE OF STREETS.
   (A)   Poles, wires and appurtenances. The grantee's system, poles, wires and
appurtenances shall be located, erected and maintained so that none of its
facilities shall endanger or interfere with the lives of persons or interfere
with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of
the public streets and public ways, or interfere with any improvements the
Municipality may make, or hinder or obstruct the free use of the streets,
alleys, bridges, easements or public property.
   (B)   Erection, removal and common uses of poles.
      (1)   No poles or other wire-holding structures shall be erected by the
grantee without prior approval of the Municipality with regard to location,
height, type, and any other pertinent aspect. However, no location of any pole
or wire-holding structure of the grantee shall be a vested interest and such
poles or structures shall be removed or modified by the grantee at its own
expense whenever the Municipality determines that the public convenience would
be enhanced thereby.
      (2)   Where poles or other wire-holding structures already existing for
use in serving the Municipality are available for use by the grantee, but it
does not make arrangements for such use, the Municipality may require the
grantee to use such poles and structures if it determines that the public
convenience would be enhanced thereby and the terms of the use available to the
grantee are just and reasonable.
      (3)   Where the Municipality or a public utility serving the Municipality
desires to make use of the poles or other wire-holding structures of the
grantee, but agreement thereof with the grantee cannot be reached, the
Municipality may require the grantee to permit such use for such consideration
and upon such terms as the Municipality shall determine to be just and
reasonable, if the Municipality determines that the use would enhance the
public convenience and would not unduly interfere with the grantee's
operations.
   (C)   If at any time during the period of the franchise the Municipality
shall elect to alter or change the grade of any public street or other public
ways or utilities, the grantee, upon reasonable notice by the Municipality,
shall promptly remove or relocate as necessary its poles, wires, cables,
underground conduits, manholes and other fixtures at its own expense.
   (D)   The grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a building
moving permit issued by the Municipality, temporarily raise or lower its wires
to permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal,
raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same,
and the grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance.
The grantee shall be given not less than 48 hours advance notice to arrange for
such temporary wire changes.
   (E)   The grantee shall not use road cuts for the laying of cable or wires
without the prior approval of the Municipality. Any cabling placed beneath a
public street shall be buried in conduit.
   (F)   The right of the grantee to use and occupy the public streets and
public ways shall not be exclusive. The Municipality reserves the right to
grant any right or use of such public streets or public ways to any person at
any time during the term of the franchise or any other franchise subsequently
granted to any other person.
   (G)   If any public street or public way or portion thereof used by the
grantee shall be vacated by the Municipality, or the use thereof is
discontinued by the Municipality or the grantee, during the term of the
franchise, then the grantee shall forthwith at its sole cost and expense remove
its facilities therefrom unless specifically permitted to continue to use the
same and, on the removal thereof, the grantee shall restore, repair, or
reconstruct the public street or public way in accordance with the
specifications and requirements found in Appendix A. In the event of any
failure, neglect, or refusal by the grantee, after 30 days written notice from
the Municipality to repair, improve, or maintain such public street or public
way, the Municipality may, but shall be under no obligation to, conduct such
work, or cause it to be conducted, and the actual cost thereof shall be paid by
the grantee in the time and manner as directed by the Municipality. Collection
may be made by resort to the letter of credit or cash security deposit
established pursuant to §
115.060 of this chapter, or by court action, or otherwise.

§ 115.101 FORFEITURE AND TERMINATION.
   (A)   In addition to all other rights and powers retained by the
Municipality under this chapter or otherwise, the Municipality reserves the
right to terminate the franchise and all rights and privileges of the grantee
hereunder in the event of a breach of its terms and conditions. A breach by the
grantee shall include, but shall not be limited to the following:
      (1)   Violation of any material provision of the franchise or any
material rule, order, regulation or determination of the Municipality made
pursuant to the franchise;
      (2)   Attempt to evade any provision of the franchise or to practice any
fraud or deceit upon the Municipality or its subscribers or customers; or
      (3)   Failure to begin or complete system construction or system
extension as provided under §§
115.080 and
115.081;
      (4)   Failure to provide the services promised in the grantee's initial
application;
      (5)   Failure to restore service after 96 consecutive hours of
interrupted service, except when approval of such interruption is obtained from
the Municipality;
      (6)   Material misrepresentation of fact in the application for or
negotiation of the franchise; or
      (7)   Failure to pay any fees or other consideration when due pursuant to
the franchise or this chapter.
   (B)   The Municipality shall make a written demand that the grantee comply
with any such provision, rule, order or determination under or pursuant to the
franchise. In the event that the violation by the grantee continues for a
period of 30 days following such written demand without written proof
satisfactory to the Municipality that the corrective action was initiated
immediately and thereafter has been completed or has been continuously,
actively, and expeditiously pursued, the Municipality may place the issue of
termination of the franchise before the Board. The Municipality shall cause to
be served upon the grantee, at least 20 days prior to the date of such meeting,
a written notice of intent to request such termination and the time and place
of the meeting.
   (C)   The Board shall hear and consider the issues, shall hear any person
interested therein and shall determine in its discretion whether any violation
by the grantee has occurred. The grantee shall be afforded an opportunity to be
heard at the hearing, including an opportunity to present all relevant evidence
and witnesses and to question witnesses presented against the grantee. The
grantee may, at its own expense, make a transcript of any such hearing.
   (D)   In the event that the Board determines that the violation by the
grantee was the fault of the grantee and within its control, and the grantee is
not taking actions to correct such violation if such violation could not be
corrected within the 30 day time frame mentioned above, then the Board may, by
resolution stating the violation or violations on which the decision is based,
declare that the franchise of the grantee shall be forfeited and terminated
immediately or within such period as the Board in its sole discretion may fix,
unless there is compliance.
(Ord. 767, passed 4-25-00)
§ 115.102 FORCE MAJEURE.
   Whenever a period of time is provided for in the franchise for either the
Municipality or the grantee to do or perform any act or obligation, neither
party shall be liable for any delays or inability to perform due to causes
beyond the control of the party such as war, riot, insurrection, rebellion,
sabotage, unavoidable casualty or damage to personnel, materials or equipment,
fire, flood, storm, earthquake, tornado, or any act of God; provided, however,
that the time period shall be extended for only the actual amount of time the
party is so delayed. An act or omission shall not be deemed to be "beyond the
grantee's control" if committed, omitted, or caused by the grantee, the
grantee's employees, officers, agents or a subsidiary, affiliate, or parent of
the grantee, or by any corporation or other business entity that holds a
controlling interest in the grantee, whether held directly or indirectly.
Further, the failure of the grantee to obtain financing or to pay any money due
from it to any person, including the Municipality, for whatever reason, shall
not be an act or omission "beyond the grantee's control." The failure of the
grantee to obtain necessary permits from applicable governmental or utility
agencies shall be deemed "beyond the grantee's control" only if the grantee has
made a timely and complete request and application for the permit and is
diligently pursuing the issuance of the permit.
(Ord. 767, passed 4-25-00)
§ 115.103 FORECLOSURE.
   Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of
the cable system, or upon the termination of any lease covering all or a
substantial part of the cable system, the grantee shall notify the Municipality
of such fact, and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a
change in control of the grantee has taken place, and the provisions of the
franchise governing the consent of the Municipality to such change in control
of the grantee shall apply.
(Ord. 767, passed 4-25-00)
§ 115.104 RECEIVERSHIP.
   The Municipality shall have the right to cancel a franchise 120 days after
the appointment of a receiver, or trustee, to take over and conduct the
business of the grantee, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or
other action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have
been vacated prior to the expiration of 120 days, or unless:
   (A)   Within 120 days after his/her election or appointment, such receiver
or trustee shall have fully complied with all the provisions of this chapter
and remedied all defaults thereunder; and
   (B)   Such receiver or trustee, within the 120 days, shall have executed an
agreement, duly approved by the Court having jurisdiction in the premises,
whereby such receiver or trustee assumes and agrees to be bound by each and
every provision of this chapter and the franchise granted to the grantee.
(Ord. 767, passed 4-25-00)
§ 115.105 LANDLORD AND TENANT.
   (A)   Neither the owner of any multiple unit residential dwelling nor his
agent or representative shall interfere with the right of any tenant or lawful
resident thereof to receive cable service, cable installation or maintenance
from a cable television grantee regulated by and lawfully operating under a
valid and existing franchise issued by the Municipality.
   (B)   Neither the owner of any multiple unit residential dwelling nor his

   (D)   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a person from requiring that
cable system facilities conform to laws and regulations and reasonable
conditions necessary to protect safety, functioning, appearance and value of
premises or the convenience and safety of persons or property.
   (E)   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a person from requiring a
grantee to agree to indemnify the owner, or his agents or representatives for
damages or from liability for damages caused by the installation, operation,
maintenance or removal of cable television facilities.
(Ord. 767, passed 4-25-00)
§ 115.106 NONENFORCEMENT BY MUNICIPALITY.
   The grantee shall not be excused from complying with any of the terms and
conditions of the franchise by any failure of the Municipality, on any one or
more occasions, to insist on the grantee's performance of, or to seek the
grantee's compliance with, any one or more of the terms or conditions.
(Ord. 767, passed 4-25-00)
§ 115.107 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.
   (A)   In the event of a violation or an alleged violation of the franchise
by the grantee, the Municipality, by suit, action, mandamus, or other
proceeding, in law or in equity, may enforce or compel the performance of the

the cable television signals. No person receiving within the Municipality any
cable service, program, or signal transmitted by any grantee operating under a
franchise issued by the Municipality shall resell such service, program, or
signal without the expressed written consent of the grantee. Violations of the
provisions of this section shall be punishable by a fine of no less than $500
per day per occurrence, and where applicable, incarceration as so prescribed by
statutory provisions concerning theft of services.
(Ord. 767, passed 4-25-00)
§ 115.999 PENALTIES; PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Penalties. For the violation of any of the following provisions of
this chapter, as amended from time to time, or the franchise agreement,
penalties may be levied against the grantee and shall be paid by the grantee
and, if not so paid, shall be chargeable to the letter of credit or cash
security deposit, as follows:
      (1)   Failure to furnish, maintain, or offer all cable services to any
potential subscriber within the Municipality upon order of the Municipality:
$250 per day, per violation, for each day such failure occurs or continues;
      (2)   Failure to obtain or file evidence of required insurance,
construction bond, performance bond, or other required financial security: $200
per day, per violation, for each day such failure occurs or continues;
      (3)   Failure to provide access to data, documents, records, or reports
to the Municipality as required by this chapter, including without limitation
§§
115.008,
115.009,
115.040 and
115.042: $150 per day; per violation, for each day such failure occurs or

      (4)   Failure to comply with applicable construction, operation, or
maintenance standards: $200 per day, per violation, for each day such failure
occurs or continues;
      (5)   Failure to comply with a rate decision or refund order: $300 per
day not stayed, per violation not stayed, for each day such a violation occurs
or continues;
      (6)   Any violations for non-compliance with the customer service
standards of §§
115.064,
115.065 and
115.066: $250 per day, per violation, for each day that such noncompliance
continues;
      (7)   Any other violations of this chapter: not less than $50 per day to
a maximum of $750 per day, per violation, for each day such violation occurs or
continues, and the governing body of the Municipality may determine the amount
of the penalty for other violations which are not specified in a sum not to
exceed $750 for each violation, with each day constituting a separate
violation.
   (B)   Procedures.
      (1)   Whenever the Municipality determines that the grantee has violated
any term, condition or provision of this chapter or the franchise agreement,
and determines it appropriate to impose monetary penalties, a written notice
shall be given to the grantee informing it of such alleged violation or
liability. The written notice shall describe in reasonable detail the specific
violation so as to afford the grantee an opportunity to remedy the violation.
The grantee shall have 30 days notice subsequent to the date of such notice in
which the grantee shall have the opportunity to cure the violation before the
Municipality may impose penalties unless the violation is, in the opinion of
the Municipality, of such a nature so as to require more than 30 days and the
grantee proceeds, immediately upon receipt of such notice, and continuously,
and diligently, to cure the violation. In any case where the violation is not
cured within 30 days of notice from the Municipality, or such other time to
which the grantee and the Municipality may mutually agree, the Municipality may
proceed to impose penalties and to exercise any other remedy provided in this
chapter or the franchise agreement.
      (2)   The grantee may, within ten days of receipt of notice, notify the
Municipality that there is a dispute as to whether a violation or failure has,
in fact, occurred. Such notice by the grantee to the Municipality shall specify
with particularity the matters disputed by the grantee and shall stay the
running of the 30 day cure period pending decision by the governing body as
required below. The governing body shall hear the grantee's dispute. The
grantee must be given at least five days notice of the hearing. At the hearing,
the grantee shall be entitled to the right to present evidence and the right to
be represented by counsel. In the event the Municipality upholds the finding of
a violation, the grantee shall have 15 days thereafter or the remaining time
period set in subsection (1) above, whichever is longer, or such other time
period as the grantee and the Municipality mutually agree, to correct the
violation. In any case where the violation is not cured within 30 days of
notice from the Municipality, or such other time to which the grantee and the
Municipality may mutually agree; the Municipality may proceed to impose
penalties retroactive to the date of notice to cure the violation(s) and to
exercise any other remedy provided in this chapter or the franchise agreement.
      (3)   The rights reserved to the Municipality under this section are in
addition to all other rights of the Municipality whether reserved by this
chapter or authorized by law or equity, and no action, proceeding or exercise
of a right shall affect any other right the Municipality may have.

EXCAVATION AND BACKFILL FOR UNDERGROUND CONDUITS
§ 1-1 DESCRIPTION.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, underground conduits shall be
considered sewer pipe, water main, culverts, or any other pipe conduits
indicated on the plans. Wherever the term "pipe" or "pipe line" is used, it
shall mean underground conduit.
   (B)   Excavation and backfill shall include all excavation backfilling,
compacting, disposal of surplus material, restoration of all disturbed surface,
and all other work incidental to the construction of trenches, including any
additional excavation which may be required for manholes or other structures
forming a part of the pipe line.
§ 1-2 CONSTRUCTION DETAILS.
1-2.01 Surface Removal:
   Along the proposed pipe lines as indicated on the plans, the contractor
shall remove the surface materials only to such widths as will permit a trench
to be excavated which will afford sufficient room for proper efficiency and
proper construction. Where sidewalks, driveways, pavements and curb and gutter
are encountered, care shall be taken to protect against fracture or disturbance
beyond reasonable working limits. In areas specified on the plans, the top 12
inches shall be piled separately and preserved so that it may be restored after
the remainder of the backfill is replaced.
1-2.02 Excavation by Hand or Machine:
   When working space will permit, trenches may be excavated by machine,
provided that by so doing, public and private improvements will not be
subjected to an unreasonable amount of damage. If, however, excavation by
machine methods cannot be made without material damage being done to public and
private improvements, hand excavation shall be employed.
1-2.03 Width of Excavation:
   (A)   The bottom of the trench at and below the top of the pipe and inside
the sheeting and bracing, if used, shall not exceed the following widths:
Pipe Size Width Pipe Size Width Pipe Size Width
Pipe Size Width Pipe Size Width Pipe Size Width
6"        2'6"  27"       4'3"  66"       9'1"
8"        2'6"  30"       4'7"  71"       9'8"
10"       2'6"  33"       5'4"  78"       10'3"
12"       2'8"  36"       5'8"  84"       10'10"
15"       2'10" 42"       6'3"  90"       11'5"
18"       3'2"  48"       6'10" 96"       12'0"
21"       3'8"  54"       7'11" 102"      12'7"
24"       4'0"  60"       8'6"  108"      13'2"
 
Note: The strength or class of pipe shall be as indicated on the plans or
special provisions.
   (B)   Trench sheeting and bracing or a trench shield shall be used as
required by the rules and regulation of O.S.H.A. The bottom of the trench
excavation shall conform to the details shown on the plan.
1-2.04 Excavation Below Grade:
   In cases where the excavation is carried beyond or below the lines and
grades given by the Engineer, the Contractor shall refill all such excavated
space with suitable granular material.
1-2.05 Rock Excavation:
   Whenever "rock" is used as the name of an excavated material, it shall mean
boulders or pieces of rock, concrete, or masonry measuring one-half (½) cubic
yard or more, hard shale or solid ledge rock and masonry which, in the opinion
of the Engineer, requires for its removal the continuous use of pneumatic tools
or drilling or blasting.
1-2.06 Braced and Sheeted Trenches:
   (A)   Open-cut trenches shall be sheeted and braced or otherwise protected
as required by any governing federal, state or county laws and municipal
ordinances, and as may be necessary to protect life, property, or the work. In
any event, the minimum protection shall conform to the recommendations in
O.S.H.A. Safety and Health Standards for Construction. A sand box or trench
shield may be used in lieu of sheeting as permitted by O.S.H.A. and approved by
the Engineer. When close-sheeting is used, it shall be so driven as to prevent
adjacent soil from entering the trench either below or through such sheeting.
   (B)   Where sheeting and bracing are used, the trench width shall be
increased accordingly. The Engineer may order the sheeting driven to the full
depth of the trench or to such additional depth as may be required for the
protection of the work. Where soil in the lower limits of the trench has the
necessary stability to meet the O.S.H.A. Standards, the Engineer, at his
discretion, may permit the contractor to stop the driving of sheeting at such
designated elevation above the trench bottom. The granting of permission by the
Engineer, however, shall not relieve the Contractor in any degree from his full
responsibility under the contract. Sheeting and bracing which have been ordered
left in place shall be cut off at the elevation ordered by the Engineer. Trench
bracing, except that ordered left in place, may be removed when the backfilling
has reached the respective levels of such bracing. Sheeting, except that
ordered left in place, may be removed after the backfilling has been completed
or has been brought to such an elevation as to permit its safe removal.
1-2.07 Trenches With Sloping Sides, Limited:
   The Contractor may, at his option, where working conditions and right-of-way
permit (as determined by the Engineer), excavate pipeline trenches with sloping
sides, but with the following limitations:
   (A)   In general, only braced and vertical trenches will be permitted in
traveled streets, alleys or narrow easements.
   (B)   Where trenches with sloping sides are permitted, the slopes shall not
extend below the top of the sewer, and trench excavations below this point
shall be made with vertical sides with widths not exceeding those specified
herein for the various sizes of pipe.
1-2.08 Short Tunnels:
   In some instances, trees, fire hydrants, sidewalks and other obstructions
may be encountered, the proximity of which may be a hindrance to opencut
excavation. In such cases, the Contractor shall excavate by means of short
tunnels in order to protect such obstructions against damage.
1-2.09 Piling Excavated Material:
   All excavated material shall be piled in a manner that will not endanger the
work and that will avoid obstructing streets, alleys, sidewalks and driveways.
Fire hydrants under pressure, valve pit covers, valve boxes, curb stop boxes,
or other utility controls shall be left unobstructed and accessible until the
work is completed. Gutters shall be kept clear or other satisfactory provisions
made for street drainage. Natural watercourses shall not be obstructed.
1-2.10 Removal of Water:
   The Contractor shall, at all times during construction, provide and maintain
ample means and devices with which to promptly remove and properly dispose of
all water entering the excavations or other parts of the work until all work to
be performed therein has been completed. No sanitary sewer shall be used for
disposal of trench water.
1-2.11 Safety:
   (A)   Barricades, Guards and Safety Provisions. To protect persons from
injury and to avoid property damage, adequate barricades, construction signs,
torches, red lanterns and guards, as required, shall be placed and maintained
by the Contractor at his expense during the progress of the construction work
and until it is safe for traffic to use the roads and streets. All material
piles, equipment and pipe which may serve as obstructions to traffic shall be
protected by proper lights when the visibility is poor. The rules and
regulations of O.S.H.A. and appropriate authorities respecting safety
provisions shall be observed.
   (B)   Structure Protection. Temporary support, adequate protection and
maintenance of all underground and surface structures, water mains, drains,
sewers and other obstructions encountered in the progress of the work shall be
furnished by the Contractor under the direction of the Engineer. The structures
which may have been disturbed shall be restored upon completion of the work.
   (C)   Protection of Property and Surface Structures. Trees, shrubbery,
fences, poles and all other property and surface structures shall be protected
during construction operations unless their removal for purposes of
construction is authorized by the Engineer. Any fences, poles, or other man
made surface improvements which are moved or disturbed by the Contractor shall
be restored to the original conditions after construction is completed. Any
trees, shrubbery, or other vegetation, which are approved for removal or
ordered for removal by the Engineer in order to facilitate construction
operations, shall be removed completely, including stumps and roots, by the
Contractor. Responsibility for any damage or claims for damage caused by
construction operations to shrubbery or other landscape improvements which were
not authorized for removal by the Engineer shall be assumed by the Contractor.
1-2.12 Deviations Occasioned by Other Structures or Utilities:
   Whenever obstructions are encountered during the progress of the work and
interfere to such an extent that an alteration in the plan is required, the
Engineer shall have the authority to approve the plans and order a deviation
from the line and grade or arrange with the owners of the structures for the
removal, relocation or reconstruction of the obstructions. Where gas, water,
telephone, electrical, hot water, steam, or other existing utilities are an
impediment to the vertical or horizontal alignment of the proposed pipe line,
the engineer shall require a change in grade or alignment or shall direct the
Contractor to arrange with the owners of the utilities for their removal.
1-2.13 Interruption to Utilities:
   (A)   The Contractor shall proceed with caution in the excavation and
preparation of the trench so that the exact location of underground structures
may be determined. Prior to proceeding with trench excavation, the Contractor
shall contact all utility companies in the area to aid in locating their
underground services.
   (B)   The Contractor shall take all reasonable precautions against damage to
existing utilities. However, in the event of a break in an existing water main,
gas main, sewer or underground cable, he shall immediately notify the
responsible official of the organization operating the utility interrupted. The
Contractor shall lend all possible assistance in restoring services and shall
assume all cost, charges, or claims connected with the interruption and repair
of such services if the location of the utility was marked by the owner thereof
prior to excavation.
1-2.14 Maintenance of Traffic and Closing of Streets:
   The Contractor shall carry on the work in a manner which will cause a
minimum of interruption to traffic, and may not close a street to through
travel without the express approval of the Director of Operations. Where
traffic must cross open trenches, the Contractor shall provide suitable bridges
at street intersections and driveways. The Contractor shall post, where
directed by the Engineer, suitable signs indicating that a street is closed and
necessary detour signs for the proper maintenance of traffic. Prior to closing
any driving lanes of a street, the Contractor shall notify responsible
municipal authorities; including the Director of Operations, Police, Fire and
School.
1-2.15 Construction in Easements:
   In easements across private property, the Contractor shall be responsible
and liable for all damage outside of the easement area. Trees, fences,
shrubbery or other types of surface improvements located in the easements will
require protection during construction. The provisions of §
1-2.11(C) above shall apply to all easement areas as well as to public rights-
of-way. Precautions shall be taken by adequate sheeting or other approved
methods to prevent any cave-in or subsidence beyond the easement limits or
damage to improvements within the easement. In general, the easement area is
intended to provide reasonable access and working area for efficient operation
by the Contractor. Where easement space for the efficient operation is not
provided, the Contractor shall be responsible for organizing his operations to
perform within the restrictions indicated.
1-2.16 Underground Conduit Constructed in Tunnel:
   (A)   Where required by the Engineer, pipe lines shall be constructed in
tunnel. This work will be conducted in accordance with requirements of any
permits obtained by the owner from railroads or state or county highway
departments for tunnel work or in accordance with the following requirements:
      (1)   Materials. Pipe materials shall be shown on the plans or as
described in the special provisions.
      (2)   Excavation and Laying. Requirements for excavation, laying, and
joints shall be those applicable for the type of pipe line involved, unless
otherwise specified.
      (3)   Methods of Construction.
         (a)   The tunnel shall be only of sufficient width and height to
provide free working space. The sides and roof of the tunnel shall be braced
sufficiently to support the external loads and to prevent caving, bulging, and
settling of the earth.
         (b)   The Contractor shall backfill all tunnels with well-compacted
sand, fine gravel or stone screenings as rapidly as the conditions permit.
         (c)   The backfill material shall be deposited in the tunnel in such a
manner as not to injure or disturb the pipe. The filling of the tunnel shall be
carried on simultaneously on both sides of the pipe in such a manner that
injurious side pressures do not occur. Special care shall be taken to compact
the backfill under the haunches of the pipe. The remainder of the tunnel, or
such portion of the remainder as may be possible, shall then be backfilled by
one of the following methods, at the option of the Contractor, if in the
opinion of the Engineer the method is practicable.
            1.   The material shall be deposited in uniform layers not to
exceed 12 inches thick (loose measure) and such layer either inundated or
deposited in water; or
            2.   The tunnel shall be backfilled with loose material or only
partly backfilled at a time, if necessary, and settlement secured in either
case by introducing water through holes jetted into the material to a point
approximately two feet above the top of the pipe.
         (d)   If neither of the above methods is practicable or can be used
for only a portion of the backfill, the remainder of the tunnel shall be
completely backfilled with material carefully deposited in layers and each
layer compacted by ramming or tamping with tools approved by the Engineer.
         (e)   When sheeting and bracing have been used, sufficient bracing
shall be left across the trench as the backfilling progresses to hold the sides
and top firmly in place without caving or settlement before the backfilling has
been placed. This bracing may be removed as soon as practicable.
         (f)   Any depressions which may develop within the area involved in
the construction operations due to settlement of the backfilling material shall
be filled in a manner meeting the approval of the Engineer.
      (4)   Use of Casing Pipe. The Contractor may, subject to the approval of
the Engineer, use metal casing pipe as a tunnel liner in place of timber
shoring for tunnel sections. The diameter, gauge and type of such pipe, method
of placing and method of installing pipe within it shall be subject to the
approval of the Engineer. The entire void space between tunnel liners and pipe
shall be filled with compacted sand or other approved material if such method
of construction is used.
      (5)   Jacking or Boring of Pipe. The Contractor may, subject to the
approval of the Engineer, use special cast iron or specially designed
reinforced concrete pipe jacked and/or bored into position with or without
tunnel liners, for tunneled sections of pipe. In such cases, all conditions of
performance of the work shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer.
1-2.17 Excavation and Foundation:
   (A)   The trench shall be excavated to an elevation of four inches below the
bottom of the pipe and so that the flow line of the finished sewer will be at
the depth and grade specified or established by the Engineer.
   (B)   Well compacted moist fine aggregate bedding material, at least four
inches in depth below the pipe, shall be placed the entire width of the trench
and for the length of the pipe. The fine aggregate shall meet the approval of
the Engineer and shall be compacted to his satisfaction by ramming or tamping
with tolls approved by the Engineer.
   (C)   When pipe having bells or hubs is used, cross trenches, not more than
two inches wider than the bell or hub, shall be excavated to provide uniform
bearing along the length of the pipe.
   (D)   If the excavation has been made deeper than necessary, the foundation
shall be brought to the proper grade by the addition of well compacted bedding
material.
   (E)   Where a firm foundation is not encountered at the grade established,
due to soft, spongy, or other unsuitable soil, all such unsuitable soil under
the pipe and for the width of the trench shall be removed and replaced with
well compacted bedding material.
   (F)   Where rock, in either ledge or boulder formation, is encountered, it
shall be removed below grade and replaced with a cushion of well compacted
bedding material having a thickness under the pipe of not less than eight
inches.
   (G)   Concrete Cradle. Where sub-grade conditions, in the opinion of the
Engineer, warrant extra precautions for the bedding of pipe, the Engineer may
require the construction of a concrete cradle to be installed in conformance
with the size and dimensions indicated on the plans. All concrete used in
concrete cradle shall have a minimum compressive strength of 2,500 psi at 28
days.
1-2.18 Backfill:
   (A)   As soon as the condition of the pipe will permit, the entire width of
the trench shall be backfilled, with moist fine aggregate to a height of at
least the elevation of the center of the pipe. The fine aggregate shall be
placed longitudinally along the pipe. The elevation of the backfill material on
each side of the pipe shall be the same. Special care shall be taken to
completely fill the space under the pipe. The fine aggregate backfill material
shall be placed in four inch layers, loose measurement, and compacted to the
satisfaction of the Engineer by ramming or tamping with tools approved by the
Engineer. The fine aggregate used for backfilling shall meet the approval of
the Engineer.
   (B)   The remainder of the trench and excavation shall be backfilled to the
natural line or finished surface as rapidly as the condition of the sewer will
permit. The backfill material shall consist of the excavated material or trench
backfill as herein specified. All backfill material shall be deposited in the
trench or excavation in such a manner as not to damage the sewer. The filling
of the trench shall be carried on simultaneously on both sides of the pipe in
such a manner that injurious side pressures do not occur. The backfill for
trenches and excavation made in the sub-grade of the proposed improvement, and
for all trenches outside of the sub-grade where the inner edge of the trench is
within two feet of the edge of the proposed pavement, curb, gutter, curb and
gutter, stabilized shoulder or sidewalk, shall be made with trench backfill
material unless the excavated material meets the requirements of § 211 of the
Indiana State Highway Standard Specifications.
   (C)   All backfill material up to a height of 12 inches above the pipe shall
be carefully deposited in uniform layers not exceeding four inches thick (loose
measure). The material in each layer shall be firmly compacted by ramming or
tamping with tools approved by the Engineer, in such a manner as not to disturb
or injure the pipe. The backfilling above this height shall be done by Method
1, 2 or 3 below.
   (D)   When required, trench backfill material or excavated material meeting
the requirements of § 211 of the Indiana State Highway Specifications above the
first 12 inches above the pipe shall be compacted by either Method 2 or Method
3 specified below, or in accordance with Method 1 except that the compacted
lifts shall not exceed four inches in thickness.
   Method 1: The material shall be deposited in uniform layers not exceeding
twelve 12 inches thick (loose measure) and each layer shall be compacted by
ramming or tamping with tools approved by the Engineer.
   Method 2: The material shall be deposited in uniform layers not exceeding 12
inches thick (loose measure), and each layer shall be either inundated or
deposited in water.
   Method 3: The trench shall be backfilled with loose material and settlement
secured by introducing water through holes jetted into the backfill to a point
approximately two feet above the top of the pipe. The holes shall be spaced as
directed by the Engineer, but shall not be any further than six feet apart.
   (E)   The water shall be injected at a pressure just sufficient to sink the
holes at a moderate rate of speed. The pressure shall be such that the water
will not cut cavities in the backfill material nor overflow the surface. If
water does overflow the surface, it shall be drained into the jetted holes by
means of shallow trenches. Water shall be injected as long as it will be
absorbed by the backfill material and until samples taken from test holes in
the trench show a satisfactory moisture content. The Contractor shall bore the
test holes not more than 50 feet apart and at such other locations in the
trench designated by the Engineer. As soon as the water soaking has been
completed, all holes shall be filled with soil and compacted by ramming with a
tool approved by the Engineer.
   (F)   Backfill material which has been water soaked shall be allowed to
settle and dry for at least ten days before any surface course or pavement is
constructed on it. The length of time may be altered if deemed desirable by the
Engineer.
   (G)   Where the inner edge of the trench is within two feet of the edge of
the proposed pavement, curb, gutter, or curb and gutter, the provisions of this
paragraph shall also apply.
   (H)   At the end of the settling and, drying period, the crusted top of the
backfill material shall be scarified and, if necessary, sufficient backfill
material added, as specified in Method 1, to complete the backfilling
operations.
   (I)   The method used for backfilling and compacting the backfilling
material will be the choice of the Contractor. However, if the method used does
not produce results satisfactory to the Engineer, the Contractor will be
required to alter or change the method being used so that the resultant
backfill will be satisfactory to the Engineer.

   (C)   The percent purity, germination and weed content shall meet the
requirements as set forth in the Indiana State Highway Specifications.
   (D)   Preparation of Seed Bed.
      (1)   After the areas to be seeded have been brought to the proper grades
and cleared of all stones, boulders and debris, the areas shall be thoroughly
tilled to a depth of at least three inches by discing, harrowing or other
approved methods acceptable to the Engineer. The incorporation of fertilizer
may be a part of the tillage operation specified above.
      (2)   Fertilizer shall be distributed uniformly at the rate of 400 pounds
per acre, over the area indicated to be fertilized, and shall be incorporated
into the soil to a depth of at least three inches by discing, harrowing, or
other approved methods acceptable to the Engineer. The incorporation of
fertilizer may be a part of the tillage operation specified above.
      (3)   Lime shall be distributed uniformly on all areas to be fertilized
at the rate of one ton to one acre, and shall be incorporated in the soil to a
depth of at least three inches by discing, harrowing, or by other methods
acceptable to the Engineer, immediately following or simultaneously with the
incorporation of the fertilizing.
   (E)   Seeding Methods.
      (1)   No seed shall be sown during high winds or when the ground is not
in a proper condition for seeding, nor shall any seed be sown until the purity
test has been completed for the seed to be used, and shows that the seed meets
the noxious weed seed requirements. Equipment shall be operated in a manner to
insure complete coverage of the entire area to be seeded. When seed or
fertilizer is applied with a hydraulic seeder, the rate of application shall be
not less than 1,000 gallons of slurry per acre. This slurry shall contain the
proper quantity of seed or fertilizer specified per acre. When using a
hydraulic seeder, the fertilizer nutrients and seed shall be applied in two
separate operations.
      (2)   Within 12 hours, all seed areas shall be rolled at right angles to
the run-off with an approved type roller or cultipacker to compact the seedbed
and place the seed in contact with the soil. On areas seeded with a hydraulic
seeder, rolling shall not be required.
      (3)   The optimum depth for seeding shall be ¼ inch.
      (4)   All legumes (clover, vetch, lespedeza, and alfalfa) shall be
inoculated with the proper bacteria in the amounts and manner recommended by
the manufacturer of the inoculant before sowing or being mixed with other seeds
for sowing. The inoculation shall be furnished by the Contractor and shall be
approved by the Engineer. The seed shall be sown, as soon as possible, after
inoculation and seed that has been standing more than five hours after
inoculation shall be reinoculated before sowing. If legumes are applied by
hydro seeder, three times the normal amount of inoculation shall be used. The
Contractor shall furnish the inoculant and the cost of furnishing it shall be
included in the contract unit price per acre for seeding of the class
specified.
   (F)   Replacement of Sodded Areas. At locations specified, shown on the
plans, or designated by the Engineer, the Contractor shall remove and carefully
store the sod. Upon compaction of the trench in a manner satisfactory to the
Engineer, the sod shall be replaced in a neat, workmanlike manner, over a
minimum of two inches of topsoil. Any deficiency in sod, necessary to restore
the surface to a condition equal or better to that, which existed before
construction operations began, will require new sodding to be performed by the
Contractor. The Contractor shall maintain sodded areas until certification of
completion by the Engineer.
2-2.06 Disposal of Surplus Excavated Material:
   Surplus excavated soil, not needed for backfill shall be promptly removed
from the site and transported to the Munster Landfill.
2-2.07 Cleaning Up:
   (A)   All surplus materials and all tools and temporary structures shall be
removed from the site by the Contractor. The construction site shall be left

Where a Certificate of Registration shall be issued, authority to transact
business thereunder as a contractor or specialty contractor shall be limited to
one individual, officer or representative of such business entity to be
designated in the application and named in the Certificate of Registration. In
the event the designated individual, officer or representative leaves the
entity, the Certificate of Registration becomes null and void. Each other
individual or employee of such business entity seeking to act as a contractor
or specialty contractor in connection with the business of the entity, shall be
required to apply for and receive a separate Certificate of Registration.
   (C)   All applications shall be signed by the applicant, or its duly
authorized representative or officer, and shall be accompanied by a
recommendation as to the character and honesty of the applicant from two
residents of the town who are not related to the applicant, or in the case of a
corporation, its duly designated officer.
   (D)   Every application shall be accompanied by two recent photographs of
the applicant (size: 1-1/2 inches x 2 inches).

applicant, the town shall require the applicant to provide proof of the filing
of the bond required to be provided by the Lake County Board of Licensing and
Registration, as well as proof of compliance with the County Board of Licensing
and Registration insurance requirements. For construction that includes siding,
roofing, doors, windows, decks and sidewalks, contractors are required to
provide, in addition to the aforementioned insurance, a minimum of $1,000,000
of liability coverage, proof of same, together with valid proof of workers’
compensation coverage, as well as the required bond. For any new residential,

period of two years; or the applicant has not violated, during the preceding
registration period, any of the provisions of this subchapter or rules and
regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.
   (J)   In the event a contractor or special contractor who is issued a
Certificate of Registration by the town allows the registration to expire, that
business entity shall be required by the town to reapply for a new Certificate
of Registration.
   (K)   Upon receipt of an application for renewal by an applicant who, during
the preceding period of registration, has violated any of the provisions of
this subchapter, or any rules and regulations promulgated herein, the town
shall make such investigation as it deems necessary to determine the fitness of
the applicant for renewal of the Certificate of Registration. In the event the
town determines after said investigation that issues exist as to whether the
application for renewal under consideration should be renewed, it shall advise
the applicant and that applicant shall thereafter within 30 days show cause to
the town why the Certificate of Registration should be renewed. If, after
hearing, the town determines that the Certificate of Registration should not be
renewed, the applicant shall be notified, and the applicant thereafter may seek
remedies under state law.
   (L)   No Certificate of Registration shall be renewed during any period a
registrant is under citation by the town for violation of any the provisions of
this subchapter, or any rules promulgated by the town; however, the town, at
its discretion, may temporarily extend the applicant's current registration for
a period of time, not to exceed 30 days, or until the act complained of shall

Certificate of Registration.
   (P)   In the event a Certificate of Registration holder shall have been
convicted in this state, or any other state, of obtaining money under false
pretenses, extortion, forgery, embezzlement, or criminal conspiracy to defraud,
or other like offenses, and a duly certified or exemplified copy of the record
in the proceeding is filed with the town, the town shall revoke the Certificate
of Registration issued to the holder. In the event of the revocation or
suspension of the Certificate of Registration issued to any member of a co-
partnership, association, or corporation or an employee thereof, the
certificate issued to the other co-partner, member, or members of the firm,
association, or corporation shall be revoked unless, within the time fixed by
the town, where a co-partnership or association, the connection of the member
or employee whose license has been suspended or revoked shall be severed and
his or her interest in the co- partnership or association, or his or her
employment thereby in the case of an employee, be terminated, and his or her
share in its activities brought to an end; or where a corporation, the
offending officer or employee shall be discharged and shall have no further
participation in the corporate activities.

§ 155.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-4 and IC 14-28-4, both as amended
from time to time, granted the power to local government units to control land
use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the Town Council of the town does
hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations for the town.
(Ord. 1235A, passed 3-15-16)
§ 155.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-proofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 1235A, passed 3-15-16)
§ 155.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and,
   (F)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 1235A, passed 3-15-16)
§ 155.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains;
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas, and;
   (G)   To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a
flood area.
(Ord. 1235A, passed 3-15-16)
§ 155.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   “A ZONE.” Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In “A ZONES,”
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones Al-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM or FHBM. The definitions are
presented below:
      (1)   “ZONE A.” Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply.
      (2)   “ZONE AE” and “A1-A30.” Areas subject to inundation by the 1%
annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations
are shown within these zones. (“ZONE AE” is on new and revised maps in place of
“ZONES A1-A30”.)
      (3)   “ZONE AO.” Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses arc shown within this zone.
      (4)   “ZONE AH.” Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
      (5)   “ZONE AR.” Areas that result from the decertification of a
previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the
process of being restored to provide base flood protection.
      (6)   “ZONE A99.” Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance
flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an
under-construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special
flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a
protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for
insurance rating purposes. “ZONE A99” may only be used when the flood
protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion.
No base flood elevations or depths are shown.
   “ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (appurtenant structure).” A structure with a floor area
400 square feet of less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   “ADDITION (to an existing structure).” Any walled and roofed expansion to
the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common
load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which
is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-
bearing walls, is new construction.
   “APPEAL.” A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
   “AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING.” A designated AO or AH Zone on the community’
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   “BASE FLOOD.” The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year.
   “BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE).” The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   “BASEMENT.” That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   “BOUNDARY RIVER.” The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   “BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY.” The floodway of a boundary river.
   “BUILDING.” See definition for “STRUCTURE.”
   “COMMUNITY.” A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   “COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS).” A program developed by the Federal
Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the
regular program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management
requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   “CRITICAL FACILITY.” A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. “CRITICAL FACILITIES” include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   “D ZONE.” Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding
is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is
not required by regulation in this zone.
   “DEVELOPMENT.”
      (1)   Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate including
but not limited to:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any

         (c)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction
of roads, or similar projects;
         (d)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements, etc.;
         (e)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling
operations;
         (f)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
         (g)   Storage of materials; or
         (h)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
      (2)   “DEVELOPMENT” does not include activities such as the maintenance
of existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing
roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent
structures.
   “ELEVATED STRUCTURE.” A non-basement structure built to have the lowest
floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation
perimeter walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls),
pilings, or columns (posts and piers).
   “ELEVATION CERTIFICATE.” A certified statement that verifies a structure’s
elevation information.
   “EMERGENCY PROGRAM.” The first phase under which a community participates in
the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   “ENCROACHMENT.” The advance or infringement of uses, fill, excavation,
buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may
impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.

commenced before the effective date of the community’s first floodplain
ordinance.
   “EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.” A manufactured home park
or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots
on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the

of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
   “EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.” The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   “FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM).” An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration
(FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   “FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM).” An official map of a community, issued
by FEMA, where the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been
identified as Zone A.
   “FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM).” An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   “FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS).” The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   “FLOOD PRONE AREA.” Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See “FLOOD.”)
   “FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG).” The elevation of the regulatory flood plus
two feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See “FREEBOARD.”)
   “FLOODPLAIN.” The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake,
or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The “FLOODPLAIN” includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT.” The operation of an overall program of corrective
and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS.” This chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which
control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state,
or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for
preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
REGULATIONS” are also referred to as “FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS,” “FLOODPLAIN
ORDINANCE,” “FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ORDINANCE,” and “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
REQUIREMENTS.”
   “FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING).” A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   “FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE.” A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   “FLOODWAY.” The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
cany and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
“FREEBOARD.” A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which
is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than those calculated for the base flood.
   “FRINGE.” Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   “FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT FACILITY.” A facility which cannot be used for its
intended purpose unless it is located or earned out in close proximity to
water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and
unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood
processing facilities. The term does not include long-term storage,
manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   “HARDSHIP (as related to variances of this chapter).” The exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
Cedar Lake Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional,
unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial
hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations,
physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors
likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these
problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even
if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   “HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE.” The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a
structure.
   “HISTORIC STRUCTURE.” Any structure individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   “INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).” The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include “ICC” coverage.
   “LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD).” A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process whicli establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The “LFD” initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   “LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC).” A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
      (1)   “LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA).” An amendment to the currently
effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA
through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A “LOMA” is only
issued by FEMA.
      (2)   “LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR).” An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (3)   “LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F).” An official
revision by letter to an effective NFIP map. A “LOMR-F” provides FEMA’s
determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on
fill above the BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
   “LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE.” The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.

      (2)   The top of the basement floor;
      (3)   The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of
the structure;
      (4)   The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or
pillars;
      (5)   The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement,
below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of floodwaters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. The bottom
of all such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade
or the interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher;
and
         (c)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.
   “MANUFACTURED HOME.” A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
“MANUFACTURED HOME” does not include a “recreational vehicle.”
   “MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.” A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   “MAP AMENDMENT.” A change to an effective NFIP map that results in the
exclusion from the SFHA of an individual structure or a legally described
parcel of land that has been inadvertently included in the SFHA (i.e., no
alterations of topography have occurred since the date of the first NFIP map
that showed the structure or parcel to be within the SFHA).
   “MAP PANEL NUMBER.” The four-digit number followed by a letter suffix
assigned by FEMA on a flood map. The first four digits represent the map panel,
and the letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been
revised. (The letter “A” is not used by FEMA, the letter “B” is the first
revision.)
   “MARKET VALUE.” The building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between
a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate
market will bear. “MARKET VALUE” can be established by independent certified
appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value),
or adjusted assessed values.
   “MITIGATION.” Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk
to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of
“MITIGATION” is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the
cost of disaster response and recovery.
   “NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP).” The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   “NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD) OF 1929.” As corrected in 1929 is a

than a boundary river.
   “NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88).” As adopted in 1993 is a
vertical control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations
within the floodplain.
   “OBSTRUCTION.” Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization,
bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris earned by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   “ONE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD (100-YEAR FLOOD).” The flood that has a 1% chance of
being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with
the letter A is subject to the 1% annual chance flood.” (See “REGULATORY
FLOOD.”)
   “ONE-PERCENT (1%) ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD.” The flood that has a 1% chance of
being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with
the letter A is subject to the “1% ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD.” (See “Regulatory

regulations that are consistent with the standards of the NFIP.
   “PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR).” An official republication of a community’s
FEMA map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations,
floodplain boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric
features. These changes typically occur as a result of structural works or
improvements, annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or
correction to base flood elevations or SFHAs.
   “POST-FIRM CONSTRUCTION.” Construction or substantial improvement that
started on or after the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community or
after December 31, 1974, whichever is later.

manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.
   “RECREATIONAL VEHICLE.” A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projections;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and

quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   “REGULAR PROGRAM.” The phase of the community’s participation in the NFIP
where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and
higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations
determined in a FIS.
   “REGULATORY FLOOD.” The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is
acceptable to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and
the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any
location is as defined in §
155.06(B). The “REGULATORY FLOOD” is also known by the term “BASE FLOOD,” “1%
ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD,” and “100-YEAR FLOOD.”
   “REPETITIVE LOSS.” Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   “RIVERINE.” Relating to, formed by, or resembling a stream (including creeks
and rivers).
   “SECTION 1316.” That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided
for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly
constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to
be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that
intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood prone areas.
   “SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA).” Those lands within the jurisdiction of
the town subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The “SFHAs” of the town
are generally identified as such on the Lake County, Indiana and Incorporated
Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated January 18, 2012 as well as any future
updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FHBM or FIRM as
Zone A, AE, A1-A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).
   “START OF CONSTRUCTION.” Includes substantial improvement, and means the
date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The “ACTUAL START” means the first placement or permanent construction of a
structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of
slabs or footing, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For
substantial improvement, the “ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION” means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   “STRUCTURE.” A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes
recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.
   “SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.” Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
“SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE” includes buildings that have suffered repetitive loss.
   “SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.” Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred “repetitive loss”
or substantial damage” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration
of a “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structures continued designation as a “historic structure.”
   “SUSPENSION.” The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   “VARIANCE.” A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   “VIOLATION.” The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   “WATER SURFACE ELEVATION.” The height, in relation to the North American
Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) or National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929
(NGVD) (other datum where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and
frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas.
   “WATERCOURSE.” A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
“WATERCOURSE” includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   “X ZONE.” The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
“SHADED X ZONES” shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). “UNSHADED X ZONES” (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   “ZONE.” A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or
type of flooding in the area.
   “ZONE A.” (See definition for “A ZONE.”)
   “ZONE B, C, and X.” Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate
or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)
(Ord. 1235A, passed 3-15-16)
§ 155.06 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all
SFHAs and known flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the Town of Cedar
Lake.
   (B)   Basis for establishing regulatory flood data. This chapter’s
protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory
flood data is listed below.
      (1)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the town shall be as delineated on the
1% annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Lake County,
Indiana and Incorporated Areas dated January 18, 2012 and the corresponding
Flood Insurance Rate Map(s) dated January 18, 2012, as well as any future
updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency with the most recent date.
      (2)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for
each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the town, delineated as an “A
Zone” on the Lake County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate
Map dated January 18, 2012 as well as any future updates, amendments, or
revisions prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area
from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace existing
data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and subsequently approved.
      (3)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community’s known flood prone areas
shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile.
      (4)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.
   (C)   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain
development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of
special flood hazard.
   (D)   Compliance. No structure shall hereafter be located, extended,
converted or structurally altered within the SFFJA without full compliance with
the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. No land or stream
within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the
terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.
   (E)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (F)   Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground elevations.
      (1)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles shall govern.
      (2)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
      (3)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above
the base flood elevation and not in the floodway, that site shall be considered
outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied. The
property owner should be advised to apply for a LOMA.
   (G)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (H)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Therefore, this chapter does not create any liability on the part of the town,
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any
flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder.
   (I)   Penalties for violation. Failure to obtain a floodplain development
permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a floodplain
development permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. All violations shall be considered a common nuisance
and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code for
the Town of Cedar Lake. All violations shall be punishable by a fine not less
than $200 and not more than $2,500 for each day the violation exists.
      (1)   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the
violation continues to exist.
      (2)   The Town of Cedar Lake Town Council shall inform the owner that any
such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and
therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be
suspended.
      (3)   Nothing herein shall prevent the town from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.
   (J)   Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC). In order for buildings to qualify
for a claim payment under ICC coverage as a “repetitive loss structure,” the
National Reform Act of 1994 requires that the building be covered by a contract
for flood insurance and incur flood-related damages on two occasions during a
ten-year period ending on the date of the event for which the second claim is
made, in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled
or exceeded 25% of the market value of the building at the time of each such
flood event.

the following: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location,
dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed
structures, earthen fill, storage of materials or equipment, drainage
facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically the following
information is required:
      (1)   Application stage.
         (a)   A description of the proposed development;
         (b)   Location of the proposed development sufficient to accurately
locate property and structure in relation to existing roads and streams;
         (c)   A legal description of the property site;
         (d)   A site development plan showing existing and proposed
development locations and existing and proposed land grades;
         (e)   Elevation of the top of the lowest floor (including basement) of
all proposed buildings. Elevation should be in NAVD 88 or NGVD;
         (f)   Elevation (in NAVD 88 or NGVD) to which any non-residential
structure will be floodproofed;
         (g)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. A hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering study is required and any watercourse changes submitted
to DNR for approval and then to FEMA as a Letter of Map Revision. (See division
(C)(6) below for additional information.)
      (2)   Construction stage.
         (a)   Upon placement of the lowest floor of an elevated structure or
structure on fill, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the
Floodplain Administrator a certification of the NAVD 88 or NGVD elevation of
the lowest floor, as built. Said certification shall be prepared by or under
the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer
and certified by the same. (The Floodplain Administrator shall review the
lowest floor and floodproofing elevation survey data submitted.) The applicant
shall correct deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is
allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said
corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the
project. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the elevation certification
shall be at the applicant’s risk.
         (b)   Upon establishment of the floodproofed elevation of a
floodproofed structure, it shall be the duty of the applicant to submit to the
Floodplain Administrator a floodproofing certificate. Certification shall be
prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered professional
engineer and certified by same. (The Floodplain Administrator shall review the
floodproofing certification submitted.) The applicant shall correct any
deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is allowed to
proceed. Failure to submit the floodproofing certification or failure to make
correction required shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
      (3)   Finished construction. Upon completion of construction, an
elevation certification (FEMA Elevation Certificate Form 81-31 or any future
updates) which depicts the “as-built” lowest floor elevation is required to be
submitted to the Floodplain Administrator. If the project includes a
floodproofing measure, floodproofing certification (FEMA Floodproofing
Certificate Form 81-65 or any future updates) is required to be submitted by
the applicant to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   Duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. The
Floodplain Administrator and/or designated staff is hereby authorized and
directed to enforce the provisions of this chapter. The Administrator is
further authorized to render interpretations of this chapter, which are
consistent with its spirit and purpose. Duties and responsibilities of the
Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to:

prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit copies of
such notifications to FEMA;
      (7)   Maintain for public inspection and furnish upon request local
permit documents, damaged structure inventories, substantial damage
determinations, regulatory flood data, SFHA maps, Letters of Map Change (LOMC),
copies of DNR permits and floodplain analysis and regulatory assessments
(letters of recommendation), federal permit documents, and “as-built” elevation
and floodproofing data for all buildings constructed subject to this chapter;
      (8)   Utilize and enforce all Letters of Map Revision (LOMR) or Physical
Map Revisions (PMR) issued by FEMA for the currently effective SFHA maps of the
coimnunity;
      (9)   Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated
portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not
diminished;
      (10)   Verify and record the actual elevation of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, in
accordance with division (B) above;
      (11)   Verify and record the actual elevation to which any new or
substantially improved structures have been floodproofed, in accordance with
division (B) above;
      (12)   Review certified plans and specifications for compliance;
      (13)   Perform a minimum of three inspections to ensure that all
applicable ordinance and floodplain development requirements have been
satisfied. The first upon the establishment of the flood protection grade
reference mark at the development site; the second upon the establishment of
the structure’s footprint/establishment of the lowest floor; and the final
inspection upon completion and submission of the required finished construction
elevation certificate. Authorized town officials shall have the right to enter
and inspect properties located in the SFHA;
      (14)   Stop work orders.
         (a)   Upon notice from the Floodplain Administrator, work on any
building, structure or premises that is being done contrary to the provisions
of this chapter shall immediately cease;
         (b)   Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner
of the property, or to his agent, or to the person doing the work, and shall
state the conditions under which work may be resumed;
      (15)   Revocation of permits.
         (a)   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit or approval,

false statement or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application
or plans on which the permit or approval was based.
         (b)   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit upon
determination by the Floodplain Administrator that the construction, erection,
alteration, repair, moving, demolition, installation, or replacement of the
structure for which the permit was issued is in violation of, or not in
conformity with, the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 1235A, passed 3-15-16)
§ 155.08 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   (A)   General standards. In all SFHAs and known flood prone areas the
following provisions are required:
      (1)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure;
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not
limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard
shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for
resisting wind forces;
      (3)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage below the FPG;
      (4)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
      (5)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning
equipment, utility meters, and other service facilities shall be located at/
above the FPG or designed so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components below the FPG. Water and sewer pipes, electrical and
telephone lines, submersible pumps, and other waterproofed service facilities
may be located below the FPG;
      (6)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to

      (8)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding;
      (9)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a
structure that is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall meet
the requirements of “new construction” as contained in this chapter; and
      (10)   Whenever any portion of the SFHA is authorized for use, the volume
of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the
BFE shall be compensated for and balanced by compensatory storage excavation
below the BFE. The excavation volume shall be at least one and one-half times
the floodplain storage lost due to the fill or structure. The Floodplain
Administrator may alter the compensation ration (however, not less than 1:3),
based on extenuating circumstances, for a specific project, for specific
written reasons.
         (a)   The excavation shall take place in the floodplain and in the
same property in which the authorized fill or structure is located;
         (b)   Under certain circumstances, the excavation may be allowed to
take place outside of but adjacent to the floodplain provided that the
excavated volume will be below the regulatory flood elevation, will be in the
same property in which the authorized fill or structure is located, will be
accessible to the regulatory floodwater, will not be subject to ponding when
not inundated by floodwater, and that it shall not be refilled;
         (c)   The excavation shall provide for true storage of floodwater but
shall not be subject to ponding when not inundated by floodwater;
         (d)   The fill or structure shall not obstruct a drainage way leading
to the floodplain;
         (e)   The grading around the excavation shall be such that the
excavated area is accessible to the regulatory floodwater;
         (f)   The fill or structure shall be of a material deemed stable
enough to remain firm and in place during periods of flooding and shall include
provisions to protect adjacent property owners against any increased runoff or
drainage resulting from its placement; and
         (g)   Plans depicting the areas to be excavated and filled shall be
submitted prior to the actual start of construction or any site work; once site
work is complete, but before the actual start of construction, the applicant
shall provide to the Floodplain Administrator a certified survey of the
excavation and fill sites demonstrating the fill and excavation comply with
this division (A)(10).
   (B)   Specific standards. In all SFHAs, the following provisions are
required:
      (1)   In addition to the requirements of division (A) above, all
structures to be located in the SFHA shall be protected from flood damage below
the FPG. This, building protection requirement applies to the following
situations:
         (a)   Construction or placement of any new structure having a floor
area greater than 400 square feet;
         (b)   Addition or improvement made to any existing structure where the
cost of the addition or improvement equals or exceeds 50% of the value of the
existing structure (excluding the value of the land);
         (c)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged structure where the
costs of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure (excluding the value of the
land) before damage occurred;
         (d)   Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site
for more than 180 days;
         (e)   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new
manufactured home on an existing site. This chapter does not apply to returning
the existing manufactured home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it
was removed to avoid flood damage;
         (f)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a repetitive loss structure;
         (g)   Addition or improvement made to any existing structure with a
previous addition or improvement constructed since the community’s first
floodplain ordinance.
      (2)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the
lowest floor; including basement, at or above the FPG (two feet above the base
flood elevation). Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of
floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of division (B)
(4) below.
      (3)   Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure (or
manufactured home) shall either have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above the FPG (two feet above the base flood elevation) or be
floodproofed to or above the FPG. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be
used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of
Subsection division (B)(4) below. Structures located in all “A Zones” may be
floodproofed in lieu of being elevated if done in accordance with the
following:
         (a)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the structure has been designed so that below the FPG, the structure and
attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the
effects of the regulatory flood. The structure design shall take into account
flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic pressures, and impacts
from debris or ice. Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator as set forth in §
155.07(C)(11) above.
         (b)   Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human
intervention and without an outside source of electricity.
      (4)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements
of elevated structures shall have the lowest floor at or above the FPG.
Elevated structures with fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other
exterior walls below the flood protection grade shall be designed to preclude
finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of
floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls. Designs must meet the following minimum criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings located in a minimum of two
exterior walls (having a total net area of not less than one square inch for
every one square foot of enclosed area); and
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no more than one foot above
the exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath each opening,
whichever is higher; and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
         (d)   Openings are to be not less than three inches in any direction
in the plane of the wall. This requirement applies to the hole in the wall,
excluding any device that may be inserted such as typical foundation air vent
device; and
         (e)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to
allow for parking for vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
         (f)   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms; and
         (g)   The interior grade of such enclosed area shall be at an
elevation at or higher than the exterior grade; and
         (h)   Property owners shall be required to execute a flood openings/
venting affidavit acknowledging that all openings will be maintained as flood
vents, and that the elimination or alteration of the openings in any way will
violate the requirements of this division (B)(4). Periodic inspections will be
conducted by the Floodplain Administrator to ensure compliance. The affidavit
shall be recorded in the office of the Lake County Recorder.
         (i)   Property owners shall be required to execute and record with the
structure’s deed a non-conversion agreement declaring that the area below the
lowest floor (where the interior height of the enclosure exceeds six feet)
shall not be improved, finished or otherwise converted; the community will have
the right to inspect the enclosed area. The non-conversion agreement shall be
recorded in the office of the Lake County Recorder.
      (5)   Structures constructed on fill. A residential or nonresidential
structure may be constructed on a permanent land fill in accordance with the
following:
         (a)   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep
before compacting to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with either the
Standard or Modified Proctor Test method. The results of the test showing
compliance shall be retained in the permit file.
         (b)   The fill should extend at least ten feet beyond the foundation
of the structure before sloping below the FPG.
         (c)   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during
flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or buikheading. If vegetative cover is
used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
         (d)   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties.
         (e)   The top of the lowest floor including basements shall be at or
above the FPG.
         (f)   Fill shall be composed of clean granular or earthen material.
      (6)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially
improved on a site for more than 180 days must meet one of the following
requirements:
         (a)   These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed
on a site outside a manufactured home park or subdivision; in a new
manufactured home park or subdivision; in an expansion to an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage”
as a result of a flood:
            1.   The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent
foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement.
            2.   Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior
walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated
structures in division (B)(4) above.
            3.   Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the frame
or foundation of a manufactured home are not required to have openings.
         (b)   These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed
on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that has not
been substantially damaged by a flood:
            1.   The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the lowest
floor of the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or
other foundation elevations that are no less than 36 inches in height above
grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to
resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
            2.   Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior
walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated
structures in division(B)(4) above.
            3.   Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the frame
or foundation of a manufactured home are not required to have openings.
         (c)   Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either:
            1.   Be on site for less than 180 days; and
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (defined as being
on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions); or
            3.   Meet the requirements for “manufactured homes” as stated
earlier in this section.
      (7)   Accessory structures. Relief to the elevation or dry floodproofing
standards may be granted for accessory structures. Such structures must meet
the following standards:
         (a)   Shall not be used for human habitation.
         (b)   Shall be constructed of flood resistant materials. The total
cost of the accessory structure shall not exceed $10,000.
         (c)   Shall be constructed and placed on the lot to offer the minimum
resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
         (d)   Shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation.
         (e)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment
shall be elevated or floodproofed to or above the FPG.
         (f)   Shall be designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as
required for elevated structures in division (B)(4) above.
      (8)   Above ground gas or liquid storage tanks. All above ground gas or
liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral
movement. All new tanks shall be elevated to or above the FPG.
   (C)   Standards for subdivision proposals.
      (1)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
      (2)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage;
      (3)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards; and
      (4)   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions).
      (5)   All subdivision proposals shall minimize development in the SFHA
and/or limit density of development permitted in the SFHA.
      (6)   All subdivision proposals shall ensure safe access into/out of SFHA
for pedestrians and vehicles (especially emergency responders).
   (D)   Critical facility. Construction of new critical facilities shall be,
to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of
new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA
shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site.
Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes
elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to
the extent possible.
   (E)   Standards for identified floodways.
      (1)   (a)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
155.06(B), are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving, etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway.
         (b)   (IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction of non-substan- tial
additions/ improvements to residences in a non-boundary river floodway without
obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the Indiana Department
of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to elevate an addition
above the existing grade, prior approval (construction in a floodway permit)
for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.)
      (2)   (a)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator
until a permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction
in the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in this section have been met. The Floodplain
Development Permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit for construction
in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a
community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
         (b)   No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in
combination with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the
efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse
affect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at
least fifteen-hundredths of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory
flood elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-
floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
         (c)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill
(including levees) the Floodplain Administrator shall submit the data and
request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory
flood data per mapping standard regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
   (F)   Standards for identified fringe. If the site is located in an
identified fringe, then the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit provided the provisions contained in this section
have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new
or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.
   (G)   Standards for SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or
floodways/fringes.
      (1)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regula- tory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in this section have been met.
      (2)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
         (b)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this
section have been met.
      (3)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not
increase the regulatory flood more than fourteen-hundredths of one foot and
shall not increase flood damages or potential flood damages.
   (H)   Standards for flood prone areas. All development in known flood prone
areas not identified on FEMA maps, or where no FEMA published map is available,
shall meet applicable standards as required per this section.
(Ord. 1235A, passed 3-15-16)
§ 155.09 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Designation of Variance and Appeals Board. The Board of Zoning Appeals
as established by Town Council of the Town of Cedar Lake, Lake County, Indiana
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from requirements of
this chapter.
   (B)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board. The Board shall hear and decide
appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination is made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the
Board may appeal such decision to the Superior and/or Circuit Courts of Lake
County.
   (C)   Variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the Cedar Lake
Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant
factors, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (2)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (3)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (4)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (6)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (7)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (8)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (9)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
of transport of the floodwaters at the site; and,
      (10)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued when there is:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
      (2)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §
155.08(E) or (G)(1) may be granted.
      (3)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §
155.08(E) or (G)(1) will require a permit from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources.
      (4)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §
155.08(B) may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (6)   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of
any structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places
or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
      (7)   Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and
the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the
cost of the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation (see division (E) below).
      (8)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request (see division (E)
below).
   (E)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
that allows the lowest floor of a structure to be built below the flood
protection grade shall be given written notice over the signature of a
community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the flood
protection grade will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   Such construction below the flood protection grade increases risks
to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the County Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in the community’s biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
2016 S-28
   (F)   Historic structure. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as an “historic structure” and the variance is the minimum to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (G)   Special conditions. Upon the consideration of the factors listed in
this section, and the purposes of this chapter, the Cedar Lake Board of Zoning
Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the puiposes of this chapter.
