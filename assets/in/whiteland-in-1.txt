§ 30.31 DISCUSSION.
   It is the policy of this town that all hourly employees, as defined by the

clocks as the method for accurate time keeping for the compensation of regular
and overtime hours.
(Ord. 00-06, passed 3-13-00)
§ 30.32 ELIGIBILITY.

§ 30.33 PROCEDURE.

   (A)   The employee will use the time clock at his or her workplace to record

   (B)   The employee shall use the time clocks to verify that the employee(s)
were, in fact, “on duty.”
   (C)   Clocking in prior to the regular start time of the employee does not
constitute the eligibility for overtime, unless authorized by his or her
immediate supervisor.
   (D)   The policy, in consideration of when an employee will be docked, due
to tardiness, or compensated for potential overtime will be determined by the
following:
      (1)   Work time is paid on the quarter hour only. If an employee clocks
in, up to seven minutes after his or her designated starting time, he or she
will not be considered late for work.
      (2)   If an employee clocks in eight minutes or after, up to fifteen

hour, the employee, if eligible, will receive overtime for that fifteen minute
period.

time clocks, however, the employee's immediate supervisor shall initial the
employee's time card for approval of call out time in each case (only if the
employee spends less than one hour).
(Ord. 00-06, passed 3-13-00)

PURCHASING
§ 33.03 REGULATIONS FOR AND ESTABLISHMENT OF A PURCHASING AGENCY.
   (A)   The Town Council is designated as the Purchasing Agency for the town
and shall have all the powers and duties authorized under I.C. 5-22.
      (1)   The Town Council shall act as the Purchasing Agency for every
agency, board, office, branch, bureau, commission, council, or other
establishment of the town; provided that the Storm Water Management Board and
the Redevelopment Commission may each designate themselves as a Purchasing
Agency and designate Purchasing Agents for themselves.
      (2)   The Town Council may designate in writing one or more employees of
the Town of Whiteland as a Purchasing Agent.
   (B)   Supplies manufactured in the United States shall be specified for all
town purchases unless the town determines that:
      (1)   The supplies are not manufactured in the United States in
reasonably available quantities;
      (2)   The prices of the supplies manufactured in the United States
exceeds by an unreasonable amount the price of available and comparable
supplies manufactured elsewhere;
      (3)   The purchase of supplies manufactured in the United States is not
in the public interest.
   (C)   (1)   Purchasing Agent. The Town Council as the Purchasing Agency
designates the following employees to act as the Purchasing Agents for the
town.
         (a)   The Town Manager, or the Director of Administration if there is
no Town Manager, for any purchases for the town, which may include purchases
for the town departments and the town utilities to the extent deemed necessary
or appropriate by the Town Manager, or the Director of Administration, as
applicable. Provided, however, the Town Manager, or the Director of
Administration, as applicable, may make purchases for the Police Department
only if the Police Chief is not available or if the Police Chief consents.
         (b)   The Police Chief, for purchases of the Police Department.
         (c)   The Director of Operations, for purchases for the Street
Department and the town utilities, including without limitation, the sewer
utility, the water utility, and the storm water utility.
      (2)   Powers and duties. The Purchasing Agents shall have the power to
handle all administrative matters of the purchases for the town. However, only
the Town Council shall have the power to accept a bid or award a contract for
an amount of $50,000 or more.
      (3)   Delegation of authority to make small purchases. Each of the Town
Council’s Purchasing Agents shall have the authority, in its discretion, to
make individual purchases in an amount up to $10,000, so long as the purchase
is to be paid for exclusively from funds previously appropriated or budgeted by
the Town Council or the Board of Storm Water Management for the department or
utility for which the purchase is being made. In addition, each of the Town
Council's Purchasing Agents shall have the authority to make individual
purchases in an amount from $10,000 to $25,000 if the purchase is approved in
writing by the Council President, so long as the purchase is to be paid for
exclusively from funds previously appropriated or budgeted by the Town Council
or the Board of Storm Water Management for the department or utility for which
the purchase is being made. However, if any of the above purchases will require
additional expenditures from a fund outside of the Purchasing Agent's
authority, the purchase must also be approved by the Town Manager, or if there
is no Town Manager, the Director of Administration and/or the Director of
Operations, in order to ensure that there are funds available to cover the
additional required expenditures. Any individual purchase in excess of $25,000
must be specifically approved by the Town Council. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event of a bona fide emergency condition threatening the
public health, welfare, or safety, or threatening injury to persons or
property, each of the Town Council's Purchasing Agents shall have the authority
to make individual purchases in an amount up to $50,000 without Council
approval, so long as the purchase is to be paid for exclusively from funds
previously appropriated or budgeted by the Town Council or the Board of Storm
Water Management for the department or utility for which the purchase is being
made, and provided the purchase is approved by the Town Manager, or if there is
no Town Manager, the Director of Administration, or the Council President if
the Town Manager or Director of Administration is unavailable. Purchases may
not be artificially divided so as to avoid required approval by the Town
Manager, Director of Administration, Council President, or the Town Council.
   (D)   Small purchases policy. To the extent the necessary funds have been
appropriated or otherwise authorized, and subject to the limits of authority
otherwise provided by the Town Council or within the town code, whenever the
Town Council or a purchasing agent expects a purchase or annual rental payment
on a lease to be less than $50,000, the Town Council or a purchasing agent may
proceed to make the purchase or lease under either divisions (D)(1) or (2)
below.
      (1)   The Town Council or a Purchasing Agent may invite quotes from at
least three persons known to deal in the lines or classes of personal property
to be purchased by mailing, emailing, faxing, or otherwise delivering a written
invitation to quote to the persons at least seven days before the time fixed
for receiving quotes. If the Town Council or a Purchasing Agent receives a
satisfactory quote, a contract may be awarded to the lowest responsible and
responsive offeror for each line or class of personal property required. The
Town Council or the Purchasing Agent may reject all quotes and proceed to make
the purchase under division (D)(2) hereof.
      (2)   The Town Council, or a Purchasing Agent if determined by the
Purchasing Agent to be in the best interest of the town, may purchase or lease
the personal property in the open market without inviting or receiving bids or
quotes.
   (E)   Special purchasing methods policy. The Town Council, or a Purchasing
Agent if determined by the Purchasing Agent to be in the best interest of the
town, may use any special purchasing method for which it can qualify under I.C.
5-22-10, as amended from time to time.

§ 35.01 COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS.
   (A)   The town is required by Federal Law to comply with the DOT/FHWA
regulations as it pertains to drug and alcohol testing programs.
   (B)   All drivers required to have a commercial driver's license (CDL) are
subject to the controlled substances and alcohol testing rules. A commercial
driver's license is required for drivers operating a vehicle in excess of
26,000 pounds gross vehicle (GVWR) or designed to carry 16 or more passengers
(including the driver), or of any size, which carries placardable amount of
hazardous material.
   (C)   A driver must be in compliance while performing safety sensitive
duties, which includes all of the following:
      (1)   All time at a facility or property waiting to be dispatched.
      (2)   All time inspecting, servicing, or conditioning any commercial
motor vehicle at any time.
      (3)   All time spent at the driving controls.
      (4)   All time, other than driving time, spent on or in a commercial
motor vehicle.
      (5)   All time loading or unloading a commercial motor vehicle,
supervising, or assisting in the loading and unloading, attending a vehicle
being loaded or unloaded, remaining in readiness to operate the vehicle.
      (6)   All time spent performing the driver requirements associated with
an accident.
      (7)   All time repairing, obtaining assistance, or remaining in
attendance upon a disabled vehicle.
   (D)   Driver conduct that is prohibited by DOT regulations are as follows:
      (1)   No use of alcohol for four hours prior to duty.
      (2)   No use of alcohol while on duty.
      (3)   No use of alcohol after an accident for at least 8 hours or until
the employee has been tested.
      (4)   No use of controlled substances, except as prescribed by a licensed
physician with knowledge of the employee's safety-sensitive job duties.
      (5)   On a DOT alcohol test, no result of 0.04 BAC or greater.
      (6)   On a DOT drug test, no confirmed positive test result.
      (7)   No refusal to participate in a DOT alcohol or drug test.
   (E)   A driver will be tested for alcohol and controlled substance under
certain circumstances: pre-employment, post-accident, reasonable suspicion,
random, and return to duty and follow up.
(Ord. 97-2, passed 8-25-97)
§ 35.02 PURPOSE.
   It is the policy of the town that its drivers be free of substance abuse and
alcohol abuse. Consequently, the use of illegal drugs by drivers is prohibited.
Further, drivers shall not use alcohol or engage in "prohibited conduct" as
defined herein. The overall goal of this policy is to ensure a drug and
alcohol-free transportation environment and to reduce accident, injuries, and
fatalities.
(Ord. 97-2, passed 8-25-97)
§ 35.03 TYPES OF TESTS.
   Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Department of Transportation
(DOT), the town has implemented six circumstances for drug and alcohol tests:
   (A)   Pre-employment testing;
   (B)   Post-accident testing;
   (C)   Random testing;
   (D)   Reasonable suspicion testing;
   (E)   Return-to-duty testing;
   (F)   Follow-up testing.
(Ord. 97-2, passed 8-25-97)
§ 35.04 REFUSAL TO TEST.
   Refusal to submit to the types of drug and alcohol tests employed by the
town will be grounds for refusal to hire driver-applicants and to terminate
employment of existing drivers. A refusal to test is defined to be conduct
which would obstruct the proper administration of a test. A delay in providing
a urine or breath specimen could be considered a refusal. If a driver cannot
provide a sufficient urine specimen or adequate breath, he/she will be
evaluated by a physician of the town's choice. If the physician cannot find a
legitimate medical explanation for the inability to provide a specimen (either
urine or breath), it will be considered a refusal to test. In that
circumstance, the driver has violated one of the prohibitions of the
regulations.
(Ord. 97-2, passed 8-25-97)
§ 35.05 CONSEQUENCES OF POLICY VIOLATION.
   Any driver who becomes unqualified or engages in prohibited conduct as set
forth herein may be subject to termination of employment.
(Ord. 97-2, passed 8-25-97)
§ 35.06 PRE-EMPLOYMENT TESTING.
   (A)   All applicants for driving positions must submit to urine drug tests.
A driver/applicant is not required to submit to urine drug tests if the town
can verify that the driver has participated in a valid drug testing program
within the preceding 30 days and, while participating in that program, was
either tested within the past six months or participated in a random selection
program for the previous 12 months.
   (B)   The town must also ensure that no prior employer of the driver has
knowledge or records of a violation of the DOT alcohol rules within the
previous six months.
   (C)   If the driver/applicant has an alcohol test result between .02 and
.0399, he/she shall not be allowed to drive for 24 hours. The driver shall be
removed from safety-sensitive functions and the applicant is not allowed to
operate a commercial motor vehicle for 24 hours.
(Ord. 97-2, passed 8-25-97)
§ 35.07 RANDOM TESTING.
   (A)   The town conducts random drug and alcohol testing. The town or its
agents will submit all drivers to a random selection system. The random
selection system provides an equal chance for each driver to be selected each
time random selection occurs. Random selections will be reasonably spread
throughout the year. The town will drug test, at a minimum, 50% of the average
number of driver positions in each calendar year. The town will select, at a
minimum, 25% of the average number of driver positions for random alcohol
testing. Random selection, by its very nature, may result in drivers being
selected in successive selections or more than once a calendar year.
Alternatively, some drivers may not be selected in a calendar year.
   (B)   If a driver is selected at random, for either drug or alcohol testing,
a town official will notify the driver. Once notified, every action the driver
takes must lead to a collection. If the driver engages in conduct which does
not lead to a collection as soon as possible after notification, such conduct
may be considered a refusal to test.
(Ord. 97-2, passed 8-25-97)
§ 35.08 POST-ACCIDENT TESTING.
   (A)   When a driver is involved in an accident where a fatality is involved,
the driver shall submit to post-accident drug and alcohol testing. When a
driver is involved in a recordable accident and receives a citation for a
moving violation arising from the accident, the driver also must submit to a
drug and alcohol test. Following any accident, the driver must contact the town
as soon as possible.
   (B)   The DOT requires that any time a post-accident drug or alcohol test is
required, that it be performed as soon as possible following the accident. If
no alcohol collection can be made within eight hours, attempts to collect a
breath sample shall cease. If no urine collection can be obtained for purposes
of post-accident drug testing within 32 hours, attempts to make such collection
shall cease.
   (C)   In the event that federal, state, or local officials conduct breath or
blood tests for the use of alcohol and/or urine tests for the use of controlled
substances following an accident, these tests shall be considered to meet the
requirements of this section, provided the tests conform to applicable federal,
state, or local requirements. The employee will sign a release allowing the
town to obtain the test results from federal, state, or local officials.
   (D)   In the event a driver is so seriously injured that the driver cannot
provide a urine or breath specimen at the time of the accident, the driver must
provide necessary authorization for the town to obtain hospital records or
other documents that would indicate whether there were controlled substances or
alcohol in the driver's system at the time of the accident.
(Ord. 97-2, passed 8-25-97)
§ 35.09 REASONABLE SUSPICION TESTING.
   Reasonable suspicion for requiring a driver to submit to drug and/or alcohol
testing shall be deemed to exist when a driver manifests physical or behavioral
symptoms or reactions commonly attributed to the use of controlled substances
or alcohol. Such driver conduct must be witnessed by at least one supervisor
trained in compliance with § 382.603 of the DOT regulations.
(Ord. 97-2, passed 8-25-97)
§ 35.10 PROHIBITED CONDUCT.
   (A)   The following shall be considered "prohibited conduct" for purposes of
this policy:
      (1)   No driver shall report for duty or remain on duty while having an
alcohol concentration of .04 or greater.
      (2)   No driver shall be on duty or operate a commercial motor vehicle
while the driver possesses alcohol unless the alcohol is manifested and
transported as part of a shipment.
      (3)   No driver shall use alcohol while performing safety-sensitive
functions.
      (4)   No driver shall perform safety-sensitive functions within four
hours after using alcohol.
      (5)   No driver required to take a post-accident alcohol test shall use
alcohol for eight hours following the accident or until he/she undergoes a
post-accident alcohol test, whichever occurs first.
      (6)   No driver shall refuse to submit to a post-accident, a random, a
reasonable suspicion, return-to-duty, or a follow-up breath alcohol or urine
drug test.
      (7)   No driver shall report for duty or remain on duty when the driver
uses any controlled substance, except when use is pursuant to the instructions
of a physician who has advised the driver that the substance does not adversely
affect the driver's ability to operate a commercial motor vehicle.
   (B)   If the town has actual knowledge or has reason to believe that a
driver has engaged in prohibited conduct, the town may require the driver to
submit to drug and/or alcohol testing.
   (C)   If a driver engages in prohibited conduct, the driver is not qualified
to drive a commercial motor vehicle and shall be immediately removed from
service. The town may in its discretion, at the request of the driver, keep the
driver's position open while such driver attempts to become requalified. The
Town may also take action against the employee up to and including termination.
(Ord. 97-2, passed 8-25-97)
§ 35.11 SUBSTANCE ABUSE EVALUATION.
   Any driver who engages in prohibited conduct shall be provided with the
names, addresses, and telephone numbers of qualified substance abuse
professionals. If the driver desires to become requalified, the driver must be
evaluated by a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) and submit to any treatment
prescribed by the SAP. Following evaluation and treatment, if any, in order to
become requalified, the driver must submit to and successfully complete a
return-to-duty drug and/or alcohol test. Such driver is also subject to follow-
up testing. Follow-up testing is separate from and in addition to the town's
reasonable suspicion, post-accident, and random testing procedures. Follow-up
testing shall be on a random basis and be in accordance with the instruction of
the Substance Abuse Professional. Follow-up testing may continue for a period
of up to 60 months following the driver's return to duty. No fewer than six
tests shall be performed in the first 12 months of follow-up testing. The costs
of an SAP evaluation or prescribed treatment shall be borne by the driver. The
town does not guarantee or promise a position to the driver should he/she
regain qualified status.
(Ord. 97-2, passed 8-25-97)
§ 35.12 AUTHORIZATION FOR PREVIOUS TEST RECORDS.
   Within 14 days of performing a safety-sensitive function, federal
regulations require that the town obtain certain drug and alcohol testing
records from driver's previous employers for the previous two years. As a
condition to employment, the driver shall provide the town with a written
authorization for all previous employers within the past two years to release
such drug and alcohol testing records as are required under federal regulation.
(Ord. 97-2, passed 8-25-97)
§ 35.13 DRUG URINALYSIS.
   (A)   Drug testing will be performed through urinalysis. Urinalysis will
test for the presence of drugs and/or metabolites of the following controlled
substances:
      (1)   Marijuana;
      (2)   Cocaine;
      (3)   Opiates;
      (4)   Amphetamines;
      (5)   Phencyclidine (PCP).
   (B)   The urinalysis procedure starts with the collection of a urine
specimen. Urine specimens will be submitted to a SAMHSA-certified laboratory
for testing. As part of the collection process, the specimen provided will be
split into two vials: a primary vial and a secondary vial. The SAMHSA-certified
laboratory will perform initial screenings on all primary vials. In the event
that the primary specimen tests positive, a confirmation test of that specimen
will be performed before being reported by the laboratory to the MRO as
positive.
   (C)   All laboratory results will be reported by the laboratory to a Medical
Review Officer (MRO) designated by the town. Negative test results shall be
reported by the MRO to the town. Before reporting a positive test result to the
town, the MRO will attempt to contact the driver to discuss the test result. If
the MRO is unable to contact the driver directly, the MRO will contact the town
management official designated in advance by the town, who shall in turn
contact the driver and direct the driver to contact the MRO. Upon being so
directed, the driver shall contact the MRO immediately or, if after the MRO's
business hours and the MRO is unavailable, at the start of the MRO's next
business day. In the MRO's sole discretion, a determination will be made as to
whether a result is positive or negative.
   (D)   Pursuant to DOT regulations, individual test results for driver/
applicants and drivers will be released to the town and will be kept strictly
confidential unless consent for the release of the test results has been
obtained. Any individual who has submitted to drug testing in compliance with
this policy is entitled to receive the results of such testing upon timely
written request.
   (E)   An individual testing positive may make a request of the MRO to have
the secondary vial tested. The driver may request that the secondary vial be
tested by a different SAMHSA-certified lab than tested the primary specimen.
The individual making the request for a test of the second specimen must pre-
pay all costs associated with the test. The request for testing of a second
specimen is timely if it is made to the MRO within 72 hours of the individual
being notified by the town of a positive test result.
   (F)   An individual testing positive shall be terminated from his employment
with the town.
(Ord. 97-2, passed 8-25-97)
§ 35.14 ALCOHOL TESTS.
   The town will perform alcohol tests using an evidential breath testing
device. The town may provide use of an evidential breath testing device through
a vendor or agent. The driver shall report to the site of an evidential breath
testing device as notified by the town. The evidential breath testing device
will be operated by a breath alcohol technician. The driver shall follow all
instructions given by the breath alcohol technician. In the event that a
driver, on the basis of the evidential breath test, has a blood alcohol content
of .02 to .0399, the driver shall be removed from duty for 24 hours or until
his/her next scheduled on-duty time, whichever is longer. If in the event a
driver has tested .02 to .0399 three times within the calendar year, said
driver shall be terminated. In the event a driver has tested .02 to .0399 five
times during the driver's term of employment, the driver shall be terminated.
Applicants are not medically qualified until after the 24-hour time frame
expires. Drivers with tests indicating a blood alcohol concentration of .04 or
greater are considered to have prohibited conduct which may result in
disciplinary action up to and including termination. In the event a driver has
tested .04 or greater, and it is the first test result within the calendar year
for the driver, said driver shall be suspended for a period of three days
without pay. In the event a driver has tested .04 or greater two times within
the calendar year, said driver shall be terminated. In the event a driver has
tested .04 or greater three times during said driver's term of employment, the
driver shall be terminated. All alcohol tests shall be performed just prior to,
during, or just after duty.
(Ord. 97-2, passed 8-25-97)
§ 35.15 TRAINING.
   (A)   The town shall ensure that supervisors who are designated to determine
whether reasonable suspicion exists by requiring a driver to undergo testing
under § 382.307 of the DOT regulations receive at least 60 minutes of training
on alcohol misuse and receive at least an additional 60 minutes of training on
controlled substances use. The training shall cover the physical, behavioral,
speech, and performance indicators of probable alcohol misuse and use of
controlled substances.
   (B)   The town shall provide educational materials that explain the
requirements of § 382.601 of the DOT regulations, consequences of violating the
regulations, and the employer's policies and procedures with respect to meeting
these requirements. The materials supplied to drivers may include information
on additional employer policies with respect to the use or possession of
alcohol or controlled substances, for example, the consequences for a driver
found to have a specified alcohol or controlled substances level based on the
employer's authority independent of § 382.601 of the DOT regulations. The town
shall ensure each driver is required to sign a statement certifying that he or
she has received a copy of these materials described in § 382.601 of the DOT
regulations.
   (C)   This policy is not intended nor should it be construed as a contract
between the town and the employee. This policy may be changed at any time at
the sole discretion of the town.

IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM FOR WHITELAND UTILITIES
§ 38.01 PURPOSE.
   This Identity Theft Prevention Plan (the "Plan") is intended to identify red
flags that will alert our employees when new or existing accounts are opened
using false information, protect against the establishment of false accounts,
establish methods to ensure existing accounts were not opened using false
information, and measures to respond to such events.
(Res. 09-4, passed 10-13-09)
§ 38.02 RISK ASSESSMENT.
   Whiteland Utilities has conducted an internal risk assessment to determine
the risk of identity theft resulting from the opening of an account with
Whiteland Utilities. This assessment evaluated the types of covered accounts it
maintains, the methods it provides to open its covered accounts, the methods it
provides to access its covered accounts and its previous experience with
identity theft. The adopted Plan considered and responds to these risk factors.
(Res. 09-4, passed 10-13-09)
§ 38.03 THE PLAN.
   Whiteland Utilities establishes an Identity Theft Prevention Plan to detect,
prevent and mitigate identity theft. The Plan consists of following components.
   (A)   Procedures to open accounts to ensure the customer's identity;
   (B)   Methods to detect and protect against the use of someone else's
financial information in making payments;
   (C)   Procedures to respond to suspected identity theft;
   (D)   Delineation of procedures to protect sensitive information received
from customers in opening their accounts; and
   (E)   Ensuring the Plan is updated periodically to reflect changes in risks
to customers and to the safety and soundness of the creditor from identity
theft.
(Res. 09-4, passed 10-13-09)
§ 38.04 ACCOUNT OPENING PROCEDURES.
   Whiteland Utility employees will adhere to the following procedures in
initiating new accounts to protect against accounts being opened under fake
names or stolen identities:
   (A)   Employees will request customers applying for new accounts by
telephone to provide the following information:
      (1)   Name;
      (2)   Address;
      (3)   Phone number;
      (4)   Employer;
      (5)   Date of birth; and
      (6)   Social Security number.
   (B)   The prospective customer's Social Security number will be entered into
a reputable Social Security search database to ensure the number is valid and
compare the reported date of birth for the provided Social Security number with
the birth date given by the customer.
      (1)   If the Social Security number provided is valid and matches the
customer's date of birth, the account may be opened (unless the employee has
other reasonable grounds for suspicion).
      (2)   If the Social Security number comes back invalid, raises suspicion
about its validity or does not match the customer's date of birth, the employee
must request the customer appear at a Whiteland Utility office in person and
present a valid form of photo ID to establish their identity.
   (C)   For a customer that appears to open an account in person, a valid
photo ID and all information provided in division (A) shall be provided.
   (D)   In reviewing the information provided by the prospective customers,
employees should look for the following red flags:
      (1)   Identification documents provided appear to be altered;
      (2)   Any discrepancy between the information provided by the potential
customer and the results of the Social Security check;
      (3)   Photo and physical description on photo ID do not match appearance
of potential customer;
      (4)   Information provided by the potential customer does not match other
sources of information;
      (5)   Social Security number, address or telephone number is the same as
that of another customer of Whiteland Utilities;
      (6)   Potential customer cannot provide information requested beyond what
could commonly be found in a purse or wallet; or
      (7)   Identity theft is reported or discovered.
   (E)   Employees shall take steps to ensure an account is not opened under a
false name including refusing to open an account if satisfactory identifying
information is not provided.
(Res. 09-4, passed 10-13-09)
§ 38.05 PAYMENT WITH STOLEN INFORMATION.
   Employees shall put a note in the billing record of any customer who pays or
attempts to use a stolen credit card, check, direct deposit from an account
such customer is not authorized to use or other financial resource. Future
payments from that customer must be made in cash or cash equivalent such as a
money order.
(Res. 09-4, passed 10-13-09)
§ 38.06 RESPONSE TO SUSPECTED IDENTITY THEFT.
   Pursuant to the Plan, employees should take appropriate responses to

be commensurate with the degree of risk posed. Appropriate responses may
include:
   (A)   Monitor a covered account for evidence of identity theft;

permit access to a covered account;

ensure customer information is protected, but shall not foreclose an employee
from using other steps to protect customer specific information:

works.
         (d)   Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting
slugs.
      (9)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
   (B)   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in division (A) of this section and which, in
the judgment of the Superintendent, may have a deleterious effect upon the
sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving waters or which otherwise
create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent
may:
      (1)   Require new industries or industries with significant increase in
discharges to submit information on wastewater characteristics and obtain prior
approval for discharges;
      (2)   Reject the wastes in whole or in part for any reason deemed
appropriate by the town;
      (3)   Require pretreatment of the wastes to within the limits of normal
sewage;
      (4)   Require control or flow equalization of the wastes so as to avoid
any slug loads or excessive loads that may be harmful to the treatment works;
or
      (5)   Require payment of a surcharge on any excessive flows or loadings
discharged to the treatment works to cover the additional costs of having
capacity for and treating such wastes.
   (C)   If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of
waste flows, the design and installation of the plant and equipment shall be
subject to the review and approval of the Superintendent and subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
   (D)   Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided
for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operation by the owner at the owner’s expense.
   (E)   When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a
suitable control manhole, together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and
measurement of the wastes. The manhole, when required, shall be accessible and
safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s
expense and shall be maintained to be safe and accessible at all times. Agents
of the town, the state water pollution control agencies and U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency shall be permitted to enter all property for the purpose of
inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing.
   (F)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater", published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at the control manhole, except for applications for NPDES permits and
report thereof which shall be conducted in accordance with rules and
regulations adopted by the USEPA published in the Federal Register October 16,
1973 (40 CFR 136) and any subsequent revisions subject to approval by the town.
In the event no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the
point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out
by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the
sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and
property. The particular analysis involved will determine whether a 24-hour
composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD suspended solids
analysis are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH is
determined from periodic grab samples.
   (G)   No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the town and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the town for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the
industrial concern at rates compatible with the rate ordinance.

§ 50.85 PROVISION FOR DISCHARGE OF WATER OBTAINED FROM OTHER SOURCES.
   (A)   The quantity of water discharged into the sewage works and obtained
from sources other than the utility that serves the town shall be determined by
the town in such manner as the town shall reasonably elect, and the sewage
service shall be billed as provided in §
50.84.
   (B)    Except as otherwise provided in this section, in determining the
sewage bill the town may make proper allowances for quantities of water which
are shown on the records as being consumed but which do not in fact enter the
sewage works.
   (C)   Determination of charges.
      (1)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial sewage, water or other liquids into the town’s
sewage works, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied by
the water utility serving the town and the water used thereon or therein is not
measured by a water meter or is measured by a water meter not acceptable to the
town, the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or determined by the
town. To ascertain the rate or charge, the owner or other interested party
shall, at the owner’s or interested party’s expense, install and maintain
meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method
of measurement acceptable to the town for determining sewage discharge.
      (2)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial sewage, water or other liquids into the town’s
sewage works, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water supplied by the
water utility serving the town and is a user of water from another source which
is not measured by a water meter or is measured by a meter not acceptable to
the town, the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or determined by
the town. In order to ascertain the rates or charges, the owner or other
interested party shall, at the owner’s or interested party’s expense, install
and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and
approved method of measurement acceptable to the town for determination of
sewage discharge.
      (3)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate
or buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the
town’s sewage works, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and the
quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, the quantity of water
used shall be averaged for each user and the flow rates and charges, including
the minimum charge, shall apply to each of the number of lots, parcels of real
estate or buildings served through the single water meter.
      (4)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial sewage, water or other liquids into the town’s
sewage works, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess of 20,000
gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the town that a
portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not and cannot
enter the sewage works, the owner or other interested party shall, at the
owner’s or interested party’s expense, install and maintain meters, weirs,
volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the town for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (D)   Where a metered water supply is used for fire protection as well as
for other uses, the town may, in its discretion, adjust the user charge as may
be equitable.

§ 50.86 CHARGES BASED ON VOLUME, STRENGTH AND CHARACTER; USER TO FURNISH
SAMPLING POINT.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered to users, the town shall base its charges not
only on the volume but also on the strength and character of the stronger-than-
normal domestic sewage and shall require the user to determine the strength and
content of all sewage and wastes discharged either directly or indirectly into
the sewage works, in such manner and by such method as the town may deem
practicable in light of the conditions and attending circumstances of the case.
The user shall furnish a central sampling point available to the town at all
times.
   (B)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a biochemical
oxygen demand of 200 milligrams per liter of fluid and suspended solids should
not exceed 250 milligrams per liter of fluid. Additional charges for treatment
of stronger-than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis:
      (1)   Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids. There shall be an
additional charge of $ 0.226 per pound of suspended solids for suspended solids
received in excess of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid.
      (2)   Rate surcharge based on BOD. There shall be an additional charge of
$ 0.19 per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for BOD received in excess of 200
milligrams per liter of fluid.
   (C)   The determination of suspended solids and five-day biochemical oxygen
demand contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the latest editions
of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage and Industrial
Wastes" written by the American Public Health Association, American Water Works
Association and the Water Pollution Control Federation, and shall be in
conformance with "Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of

§ 50.87 AVAILABILITY FEES AND CONNECTION FEES.
   (A)   General provisions; definition.
      (1)   No connection to the town's sewage works system shall be allowed
until a permit is obtained and payment of availability fees and connection fees
has been made to the town, except as provided in this section.
      (2)   AVAILABILITY FEE is the charge to a user for a new or additional
connection to the town's sewage works system and is charged in return for the
town making available to such user the town's sewage works system consisting of
all facilities and operations necessary to pickup, transport and treat sewage
of such user.
   (B)   Availability fee established. The availability fee is hereby
established in the amount of $3,964 per Equivalent Domestic Unit (EDU). The
classification set forth in the table for estimating wastewater flows shall be
used to calculate the estimated wasteload allocations or capacity and for
determining the number of EDU’s the owner, lessee, or developer shall pay the
availability fee according to the following schedule:
      (1)   Developments - inside city limits. One-third of the availability
fee, upon the latter of the approval by the Whiteland Plan Commission of a
commercial site development for real estate located inside the town limits or
being annexed or the acceptance of performance or maintenance bonds for public
sanitary sewer improvements, with the balance of the availability fee due per
EDU upon the application of an improvement location permit for each EDU that a
permit is requested.
      (2)   Other developments - inside town limits. One-third of the
availability fee, upon an approval by the Town Council for sewer service, if
none of the above applies, with the balance of the availability fee due per EDU
upon the application of an improvement location permit or sewer connection
permit for each EDU that a permit is being requested.
      (3)   Miscellaneous. All of the availability fee, upon the application
for an improvement location permit or sewer connection permit when no portion
of an availability fee has been paid for said connection of the real estate.
      (4)   Classification change.  
         (a)   All of the availability fee, upon the application of an
improvement location permit or from an increase or changed use on the real
estate resulting in a greater classification of estimated wastewater flows.
         (b)   The balance of an availability fee due shall mean the amount due
based upon the estimated wasteload as outlined in this section and the
availability fee in existence at the time payment is due to be made. The Town
Council, or their designee, shall be permitted to round figures so to express
the availability fee in whole dollars.
      (5)   Other developments - outside town limits. The Town Council shall
determine, on a case by case basis, what the availability fee shall be.
      (6)   Equivalent Domestic Unit (EDU); table of estimated flow,
availability fee calculation.
         (a)   One EDU is equivalent to the estimated average daily sewage flow
for a standard single family residence within the town's sanitary sewer system,
which is 310 gallons per day (gpd).
         (b)   For the purpose of determining the estimated average flow in
gallons per day for users other than a standard single family residence and for
purposes of calculating the availability fee, the number of EDU’s for a user,
other than a standard single family residence, shall be determined according to
the table below, which estimated flow shall be divided by 310 gpd to derive the
number of EDU’s and to calculate the resulting availability fee:

         (c)   The Availability Fee Infrastructure and Capacity Fund
(hereinafter “AFICF Fund") is hereby created and all the revenues generated by
the AF shall be deposited in said fund. All interest earned on monies in the
AFICF Fund shall be credited to said Fund. The AFICF shall not be considered as
net revenue of the sewage works and may be expended for designated
infrastructure capital projects and the associated professional services
necessary for said projects to provide the town with additional capacity. The
Town Council may utilize the monies in the AF Fund to pay debt service on bonds
issued to finance designated infrastructure, capital projects, the associated
professional services necessary for said capital projects to provide the town
with additional capacity, and pay direct administrative expenses associated
with establishing or operating the collection of the AFICF.
   (C)   Town Council to make rules and regulations for availability fee and
related matters.
      (1)   The Town Council is hereby authorized to make rules and regulations
for the determination, processing, implementation and collection of the AF, but
is not limited to, establishing procedures and approving forms and agreements
for the AF.
      (2)   The amount of the availability fee may, from time to tine, be
changed by the Town Council.
   (D)   Sewer connection fee, also sometimes known as a "tap-on" or "hook-on”
fee. Any user connecting to the sewage works shall pay a connection fee based
upon the diameter size of the water meter installed at the premises as follows:
      For each inch or ¾ inch or less size water meter: $650
      For each water meter larger than ¾ inch but less than 2 inches: $1,400
      For each 2 inch water meter: $5,750
      For each water meter over 2 inches: $10,900
      (1)   In lieu of the above connection fees there shall be an optional
connection fee available for selection by owners of real estate desiring a
sewer connection for buildings consisting of multi-family dwelling units
located on a single parcel of real estate under one ownership but in which each
dwelling unit will have an individual inch or ¾ inch or less water meter as
follows: the Town Council, or its designee, shall determine the diameter size
(s) of the water line or lines feeding the owner's multi-family dwelling units
buildings and pay the connection fee set forth above based upon the size of the
master water meter that would have been required to provide a single source
water supply to the single parcel of real estate under one ownership but for
the individual metering of each dwelling unit. If the owner elects to pay the
connection fee under this provision, the owner shall enter into an agreement
with the Town Council to promptly pay the sewer bill of any tenant within a
dwelling unit that is more than one month delinquent. The Town Council is
hereby authorized to make rules and regulations.
   (E)   Summer rates. In order that there be no additional sewage charge to
residential users for water used in lawn sprinkling and other uses that do not
enter the sewer system during the spring and summer months, the monthly sewage
billing for May, June, July, and August in each year shall be determined as
follows:
      (1)   The lower of actual or estimated units of water as billed by
private, public or municipal water utility or acceptable town meter times 1.25
x (times) the winter average.
      (2)   Winter average shall be defined as the actual or estimated units of
water used as billed by private, public or municipal water utility or
acceptable town meter during November, December, January, February, and March
divided by five.
      (3)   Residential users shall be defined as users of the sewage works
whose premises or buildings are used primarily as a residence for one or more
persons, including all dwelling units.
(Ord. 01-08, passed 6-11-01; Am. Ord. 2024-14, passed 11-12-24)
§ 50.88 SPECIAL RATE CONTRACTS.
   The town is hereby authorized to enter into special rate contracts with
customers or wholesale customers of the sewage works where clearly definable
costs to the sewage works can be determined, and such special rates shall be
based on those costs. This section does not, however, authorize the provision
of service without charge under any circumstances whatsoever.
(Ord. 1984-6, passed 8-27-84; Am. Ord. 00-8, passed 9-27-00)

definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      CROSS CONNECTION. Any physical connection or arrangement between two
otherwise separate systems, one of which contains potable water from the
Whiteland water system, and the other, water from a private source, water of
unknown or questionable safety, or steam, gases, or chemicals, whereby there
may be a flow from one system to the other, the direction of flow depending on
the pressure differential between the two systems.
      BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICE. A device or means designed to prevent
backflow or backsiphonage. Most are commonly categorized as air gap, reduced
pressure principle device, double check valve assembly, pressure vacuum
breaker, atmospheric vacuum breaker, hose bibb vacuum breaker, and barometric
loop.

any property so served shall furnish to the inspection agency any pertinent
information regarding the piping system or systems on such property. The
refusal of access or refusal of requested pertinent information shall be deemed
evidence of the presence of cross connections.
   (E)   The Whiteland Water Department is hereby authorized and directed to
discontinue water service to any property wherein any connection in violation
of this section exists, and to take such other precautionary measures deemed
necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water system.
Water service shall be discontinued only after reasonable notice is served on
the owner, lessee, or occupants of the property or premises where a violation
is found or suspected to exist. Water service to such property shall not be
restored until the cross connection(s) has been eliminated in compliance with
the provisions of this section.
   (F)   If it is deemed by the Whiteland Water Department that a cross
connection or an emergency endangers public health, safety, or welfare and
requires immediate action, and a written finding to that effect is filed with

   (H)   Nonconformity to law discovered after permit issued or plans approved.
The issuance of a permit pursuant to the provisions of this section, or the
approval by the Building Commissioner of plans, prints, or specifications,
shall not be deemed to authorize any erection, construction, alteration or
repair, or the performance of any work, in violation of any of the provisions
of this chapter, nor the approval by the Building Commissioner of buildings of

code relating to zoning regulation, or of any law or ordinance, nor shall such
issuance or approval, or the affixation to any plans, print, or specifications
of a stamp indicating the approval thereof by said Building Commissioner, be a
guarantee, warrant or assurance to any person that any such plans, print or set
of specifications, is in conformity to the provisions of this code and to all
state statutes and/or town ordinances. Upon the discovery of any departure of
any such plans, prints or specifications from the requirements of this chapter,

such departure shall be corrected immediately, and the erection, construction,
repair or work shall be made to conform to the provisions of this chapter, of
such zoning regulations and to all state statutes and town ordinances.

the zoning regulation, or of any state statute and town ordinances have been

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Town Council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 2015-03, passed 11-9-15)
§ 151.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the

§ 151.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
   (F)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.

§ 151.005 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A ZONES,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
      ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood event.
Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood
elevation or depths are shown.
      ZONE AE and A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance
flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown
within these zones. (ZONE AE is on new and revised maps in place of ZONES A1-
A30.)
      ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow flooding
(usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one
and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses
arc shown within this zone.
      ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow flooding
(usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and three feet.
Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within
this zone.
      ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      ZONE A99. Areas as subject to, inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
of 400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as
the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.

interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.

preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to
as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention
ordinance, and floodplain management requirements.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact

residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOOD WAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP (AS RELATED TO VARIANCES OF THIS CHAPTER). The exceptional HARDSHIP
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Board of
Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar
to the property involved. Mere economic or financial HARDSHIP alone is NOT
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional HARDSHIP. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.

damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,1997,
will include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new

adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
      LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the currently
effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA
through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is only
issued by FEMA.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the currently
effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations,
and elevations.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision by
letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the

flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the

or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the
letter A is subject to the 1% annual chance flood. See REGULATORY FLOOD.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community's FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain

intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood-prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdiction of the
Town of Whiteland subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of
the town are generally identified as such on the Johnson County, Indiana and
Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated August 2, 2007, as well as
any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM
as Zone A, AE, A1-A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab, footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the

other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the START OF CONSTRUCTION of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred SUBSTANTIAL
DAMAGE or REPETITIVE LOSS regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any
alteration of a HISTORIC STRUCTURE, provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structures continued designation as a HISTORIC STRUCTURE.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.

Shaded XZONESshown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2 % chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X ZONES (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type
of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. (See definition for A ZONE.)
   ZONE B, C, AND X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)

§ 151.013 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this chapter does not create any
liability on the part of the town, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.

§ 151.026 PERMIT PROCEDURES.
   Application for a Floodplain Development Permit shall be made to the
Floodplain Administrator on forms furnished by him or her prior to any
development activities, and may include, but not be limited to, the following
plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and
elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, earthen
fill, storage of materials or equipment, drainage facilities, and the location
of the foregoing. Specifically the following information is required:
   (A)   Application stage.
      (1)   A description of the proposed development;
      (2)   Location of the proposed development sufficient to accurately
locate property and structure(s) in relation to existing roads and streams;
      (3)   A legal description of the property site;
      (4)   A site development plan showing existing and proposed development
locations and existing and proposed land grades;
      (5)   Elevation of the top of the planned lowest floor (including
basement) of all proposed buildings. Elevation should be in NAVD 88 or NGVD;
      (6)   Elevation (in NAVD 88 or NGVD) to which any non-residential
structure will be floodproofed; and
      (7)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development. A hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering study is required and any watercourse changes submitted to DNR for
approval and then to FEMA as a Letter of Map Revision. (See § 151.027(B)(6) for
additional information.)
   (B)   (1)   Construction stage. Upon establishment of the lowest floor of an
elevated structure or structure constructed on fill it shall be the duty of the
applicant to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the NAVD
88 or NGVD elevation of the lowest floor, as built. Said certification shall be
prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or
professional engineer and certified by the same. The Floodplain Administrator
shall review the lowest floor elevation survey data submitted. The applicant
shall correct deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is
allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said
corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the
project. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the elevation certification
shall be at the applicant's risk.
      (2)   Upon establishment of the floodproofed elevation of a floodproofed
structure, it shall be the duty of the applicant to submit to the Floodplain
Administrator a floodproofing certificate. Certification shall be prepared by
or under the direct supervision of a registered professional engineer and
certified by same. (The Floodplain Administrator shall review the floodproofing
certification submitted.) The applicant shall correct any deficiencies detected
by such review before any further work is allowed to proceed. Failure to submit
the floodproofing certification or failure to make correction required shall be
cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
   (C)   Finished construction. Upon completion of construction, an elevation
certification which depicts the "as-built" lowest floor elevation is required
to be submitted to the Floodplain Administrator. If the project includes a
floodproofing measure, floodproofing certification is required to be submitted
by the applicant to the Floodplain Administrator.

displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above
the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. 2015-03, passed 11-9-15)
§ 151.039 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
151.007, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a pen nil for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving, etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C.14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit,
provided the provisions contained in §§
151.035 through
151.042 have been met. The Floodplain Development Permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community's more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse effect is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
(0.15) of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation
under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition
as proven with hydraulic analyses; and
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR §
65.12.
(Ord. 2015-03, passed 11-9-15)
§ 151.040 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
151.035 through
151.042 of this chapter have been met. The key provision is that the top of the
lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or
above the FPG.
(Ord. 2015-03, passed 11-9-15)
§ 151.041 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the one-
percent annual chance flood elevation and the recommended Flood Protection
Grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
Floodplain Development Permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
Floodplain Development Permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in §§
151.035 through
151.042 have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and one-percent annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
151.035 through
151.042 have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and shall not increase flood
damages or potential flood damages.

floor of a structure to be built below the flood protection grade shall be
given written notice over the signature of a community official that:

protection grade will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up

structure" and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character
and design of the structure.

the provisions of the Zoning Code for the Town of Whiteland. The penalties for
such violation shall be $300 per day for each offense, in the event there is a
conflict between this chapter and the nuisance ordinance, this chapter shall
control.
   (A)   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the violation
continues to exist.
   (B)   The Floodplain Administrator shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the town from taking such other lawful

alternative proposal, the Plan Commission may approve a request for waiver of
provisions or requirements of this chapter so that substantial justice may be
done and the public interest may be secured, provided that such waiver shall
not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter. The
Plan Commission shall not approve a waiver unless it shall make findings, based
upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case, that:

safety, health, or welfare, or injurious to nearby property;
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a waiver are based are
unique to the property for which the waiver is sought and are not applicable
generally to other properties;
      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if this chapter is strictly adhered to; and

zoning ordinance, comprehensive plan, or zone map, as interpreted by the Plan
Commission.
   (B)   In approving waivers, the Plan Commission may require such conditions
as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of standards and
requirements herein.

impose a condition is discretionary.
   (D)    Procedure.

§ 154.43 SPECIFICATIONS FOR SECONDARY PLATS.
   The secondary plat shall be prepared by a land surveyor licensed by the
State of Indiana at a convenient scale of not more than 100 feet to the inch,
and the sheets shall be numbered in sequence if more than one sheet is used.
The plat shall be presented in ink on reproducible Mylar at an appropriate

changes required by the conditions of primary approval, along with the
following information:
   (A)   The plat certificates listed herein.
   (B)   The Deed of Dedication listed herein, with the notation of any self-
imposed restrictions, and locations of any building lines proposed to be
established in this manner, if required by the Plan Commission, in accordance
with these regulations.
   (C)   All monuments erected, and corner and other points, shall be noted at
the representation thereof, or by legend. Metal monuments shall indicate type

   (D)   A statement to the effect that the Town Council does not enforce
subdivision covenants.
(Ord. 2014-03, passed 5-12-14)
§ 154.44 PLAT DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   In determining whether an application for approval shall be
granted, the Plan Commission shall determine if the plat conforms to the
principles and standards required by this chapter, which are deemed minimal;
and whenever applicable requirements of other town ordinances are higher or
more restrictive, those requirements shall control any application for plat
approval.
      (2)   In the subdividing of any land, due regard shall be shown for all
natural features such as tree growth, watercourses, historic features, or
similar amenities which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the
proposed development.
      (3)   Due consideration shall be given to the prevention of air and
stream pollution, proper treatment and disposal of refuse and other waste, and
the elimination of other blighting characteristics.
      (4)   The subdivision layout shall be of such character that it protects
the health, safety, and general welfare of the town and its residents and
visitors.
      (5)   In designing a street system, the petitioner shall be guided by the
following principles:
         (a)   Adequate vehicular and pedestrian access shall be provided to
all parcels.
         (b)   Local residential street systems shall be designed to mitigate
through-traffic movement. Street connections into and from adjacent areas may
be required in order to promote connectivity with the overall thoroughfare
system.
         (c)   Local street patterns shall provide reasonable direct access to
the primary circulation system of collector and arterial roadways.
         (d)   Local circulation systems and land development patterns shall
not significantly conflict with the effectiveness of bordering arterial routes.
         (e)   The street network shall pay consideration to the location of
traffic generators within residential areas.
         (f)   Planning and construction of residential streets shall relate to
their local function.
         (g)   Local streets shall be designed to discourage excessive speeds.
         (h)   Pedestrian-vehicular conflict points shall be minimized.
         (i)   Local streets shall be related to the topography.
   (B)   General street rights-of-way standards and requirements.
      (1)   Current AASHTO standards shall be followed as design standards
unless otherwise specified in this chapter. These standards are minimum
requirements.
      (2)   A minimum of two points of vehicular access onto a collector street
or an arterial street shall be required. One or no points of access may be
permitted or required by the Plan Commission if it is infeasible or impossible
to provide at least two access points, provided that the reduction does not
greatly adversely affect the safety and traffic circulation of the area.
      (3)   Half streets shall not be permitted.
      (4)   Rights-of-way and paving for proposed streets shall be extended to
the boundary lines of the proposed subdivision so that a connection can be made
to all adjacent properties unless such extension is not feasible because of
topography or other physical conditions, or unless, in the Plan Commission's
opinion, such extension is not necessary or desirable for coordination with
existing streets or the most advantageous development of adjacent tracts. If an
adjoining development contains an existing stub street extending to the
property line, the developer of a proposed new subdivision adjacent to that
land must incorporate the stub street into the proposed subdivision. In any
event, no subdivision shall be designed so as to create or perpetuate the land-
locking of adjacent undeveloped land.
      (5)   A temporary dead-end street shall be permitted in any case where a
street is proposed to be, and should logically be, extended, but is not yet
constructed. An adequate easement for a turnaround shall be provided for any
temporary dead-end street that extends 200 feet or more in length. Such
easement shall be automatically vacated to abutting property owners when said
dead-end street is legally extended. The temporary easement shall have a 65-
foot radius, and the traveled surface used for vehicular turnaround shall be at
least 50 feet in radius. If the temporary turnaround is to be in place for
longer than two years, the surface material shall be that specified in the
Design Standards and Specifications Manual.
      (6)   In subdivisions that adjoin or include existing streets that do not
conform to the minimum right-of-way dimensions as established by this chapter
or the Thoroughfare Plan, the petitioner shall dedicate additional width along
either one or both sides of such streets so as to bring them up to standards.
If adjoining or included existing streets do not conform to the minimum
standards of the Design Standards and Specifications Manual, the petitioner
shall improve said streets to meet the standards.
   (C)   Geometric street standards.
      (1)   All dedicated rights-of-way shall conform to the following minimum
dimensions:
Arterial streets         130 feet (or per design)
Major collector streets  100 feet
Minor collector streets  70 feet
Local streets            50 feet
Alley
One-way                  26 feet
Two-way                  30 feet
Cul-de-sac bulb
Commercial or industrial 65-foot radius
Residential              65-foot radius
Crosswalks               10 feet
      (2)   Street jogs, and entrances with traffic counts greater than 100
vehicles per day, with centerline offsets of less than 200 feet shall not be
permitted.
      (3)   All streets shall intersect at 90 degrees whenever possible for a
minimum distance of 100 feet; however, in no instance shall they intersect at
less than 80 degrees onto arterial or collector streets or less than 50 degrees
onto local streets.
      (4)   To ensure adequate sight distances, when the street centerlines
deflect more than 10 degrees, connections shall be made by horizontal curves.
The minimum centerline radius for local and cul-de-sac residential streets
shall be 100 feet, and 200 feet for all other residential streets.
      (5)   A tangent of at least 100 feet shall be introduced between reversed
curves on local and collector streets.
      (6)   Cul-de-sac streets are discouraged in favor of loop streets or
through streets. However, when used, the maximum length of a cul-de-sac street
shall be 600 feet, measured along the centerline from the intersection at
origin through the center of the circle to the end of the right-of-way. The
origin is defined as the nearest street intersection, where the cross street
does not lead to another cul-de-sac or dead-end street. Each cul-de-sac shall
have a terminus of nearly circular shape or a suitable alternate design that
provides an effective vehicular turnaround. For nonresidential subdivisions
only, an administrative waiver may be granted by the Technical Review Committee
and Plan Commission for a cul-de-sac length exceeding 600 feet.
   (D)   Block standards.
      (1)   Block length and width, or acreage between bounding streets, shall
be such as to accommodate the size of lot required in the area by in the Zoning
Ordinance and to provide for convenient access, circulation control, and safety
of street users. Blocks that are unreasonably large or small shall not be
approved.
      (2)   The maximum block length shall be 1,200 feet In the design of
blocks longer than 800 feet, or where deemed necessary for the safety of non-
vehicular street users, the Plan Commission may specify the provision of
pedestrian crosswalks near the center of the block, or wherever most useful to
facilitate pedestrian circulation, such as to a school, park, recreation area,
shopping center, or other significant location.
      (3)   Residential blocks shall be of sufficient depth to accommodate two
tiers of lots of minimum depth, except where a single tier of lots are platted
adjacent to a freeway, arterial street, floodplain, property line, preservation
area, non-residential outlot, or other such similar feature.
      (4)   No specific rule concerning the shape of blocks is set forth, but
blocks must fit easily into the overall plan of the subdivision and their
design must evidence consideration of lot planning, traffic flow, and public
areas.
   (E)   Lot standards.
      (1)   Subdivision lots shall be adequate for the type of development and
land use proposed, and shall conform to the zoning ordinance requirements. No
subdivision of land shall be permitted that creates a non-conforming lot as
defined in the Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   The lot size, width, depth, shape, grade, location, and orientation
shall be in proper relation to street and block design and to existing and
proposed topographical conditions.
      (3)   Every lot or parcel shall have sufficient frontage and access to a
public street designated, designed, and improved in accordance with the terms
of this chapter and the Zoning Ordinance.
      (4)   The minimum lot width, measured at the building setback line, and
the minimum lot size, shall conform to the zoning ordinance, and shall apply to
all buildable parcels included in subdivision plats. No buildings shall be
permitted to be constructed on any parcels not meeting the minimum standards of
the Zoning Ordinance.
      (5)   The minimum setbacks required for each lot shall be in conformance
with the Zoning Ordinance.
      (6)   Corner lots shall be sufficiently larger than interior lots to
allow maintenance of setback lines along both streets.
      (7)   For purposes of calculating minimum lot area, street rights-of-way
shall not be included.
      (8)   Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles or radial
to street lines. Corner lots of sufficient size and lots where all side lot
lines are parallel may be exceptions.
      (9)   Flag lots shall not be permitted.
      (10)   Double-frontage lots shall not be permitted except where the
purpose is to buffer residential development from adverse influences or to
minimize the number of intersections with arterial streets and highways. A no-
access, planted buffer strip of no less than ten feet in width may be required
by the Plan Commission along lot lines adjoining such adverse influence or
arterial street.
      (11)   Lots abutting a watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream shall
have additional minimum width or depth as required to provide an adequate
building site and afford the minimum usable area required for front, rear, and
side yards. An easement shall be provided parallel to all legal drainageways at
a width of 75 feet from the top of bank, unless modified by the Drainage Board.
      (12)   A lowest exterior building grade shall be provided for each lot.
The elevation shall be a minimum of two feet above the emergency flood outlet
stage for each lot (this includes localized flooding outside of the federally-
regulated 100 year flood zones).
   (F)   Commercial and industrial subdivisions.
      (1)   It is recognized that a petitioner creating a commercial or
industrial subdivision faces unique problems of lot design not normally
encountered in residential subdivisions. For this reason, the initial emphasis
of the Plan Commission shall be upon street layout and block arrangement.
      (2)   Generally, the procedural requirements shall be for the owner to
follow the regular procedure outlined herein; however, the petitioner need show
only two lots along with the street and block layout. Then, from time to time,
as prospective buyers or users express interest in lots sized to their required
specifications, the owner shall submit an amendment to the approved, recorded
subdivision plat for consideration. Regular procedural requirements of the Plan
Commission following the receipt of a secondary subdivision plat shall then
apply, except those streets that have been built by following an approved set
of plans on the previously approved secondary plat shall not have to be rebuilt
because of adoption of new specifications. This shall also apply to storm
drainage facilities within said subdivision, unless runoff characteristics have
been changed by newly proposed improvements or unauthorized existing
improvements.
      (3)   Commercial projects shall be subject to minimum lot areas,
setbacks, and other applicable regulations set forth in the Zoning Ordinance.
Each distinct business use shall occupy a separate lot, exempting strip
centers, malls, or buildings containing more than one business.
   (G)   Easements.
      (1)   Adequate areas of suitable size and location shall be allocated for
drainage and/or utility easements. Such easements shall provide reasonable
continuity from block to block and shall be of adequate width to provide for
proper drainage and utility function, and to provide adequate access for
maintenance. Generally, such easements shall be at least 20 feet in width along
all rear lot lines, and, where necessary, at least 15 feet in width along side
lot lines. All exterior boundaries of the subdivision shall be provided with an
easement of at least 20 feet in width. The Plan Commission may require larger
or smaller easements when necessary.
      (2)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel, or stream, adequate areas for storm water or drainage easements shall
be allocated for the purpose of widening, deepening, sloping, improving, or
protecting said watercourses.
      (3)   Whenever practicable, the petitioner shall design for the placement
of utility lines underground, following the required standards and
specifications established by each utility company. The location of each
underground utility system shall be shown by appropriate easement lines on the
proposed plat.
      (4)   Erection of structures with foundations shall be prohibited within
all easements. Placement of temporary, portable structures shall be prohibited
within drainage easements, as shall pavement above the contour elevation of
approved drainage swales. Projection of portions of structures over easements
shall be permitted as long as the entity controlling the easement provides
written approval.
   (H)   Common areas.
      (1)   Common areas shall be provided in the amount required by the Zoning
Ordinance in order to ensure the health, safety, and general welfare of the
subdivision residents, adjacent property owners, and the town.
         (a)   In the absence of a standard in the Zoning Ordinance, the Plan
Commission may require up to 25% of a residential subdivision's gross area to
be common area, open space, preservation area, and the like.
         (b)   In the absence of a standard in the Zoning Ordinance, the Plan
Commission may require up to 20% of a non-residential subdivision's gross area
to be common area, open space, preservation area, buffering, and the like.
      (2)   Common areas shall be laid out so as to facilitate access to and
maintenance of the area by the property owners of the subdivision.
   (I)   Subdivision names, street names, and addressing.
      (1)   Subdivision names and street names shall be approved by the process
in §
154.15.
      (2)   No street names may be used which will duplicate or be confused
with names of existing streets in the Town of Whiteland or in Johnson County.
Streets which are logical extensions or continuations of, or alignments with,
any existing streets, either constructed or appearing on any validly recorded
plat, shall bear the names of such existing streets. The Plan Commission staff
may implement more specific policy guidelines for naming streets.
      (3)   The Plan Commission staff shall assign address numbers for each lot
in a subdivision after approval of the secondary plat.

exercise.
      COOP. A cage or roofed enclosure in which chickens are kept.
      HEN. A female adult chicken.
      ROOSTER. A male adult chicken.
   (C)   The keeping and raising of chickens shall be allowed on properties
zoned for and used for a single-family or two-family dwelling (this is not
intended for multi-family dwellings, i.e., apartments), provided that written
consent from the property owner is required for any such properties that are a
rental dwelling, subject to all of the following conditions and limitations:
      (1)   The resident of the property has applied for and been issued a
backyard chickens permit in accordance with this section.
      (2)   The maximum number of adult hens allowed shall be six.
      (3)   Roosters are prohibited.
      (4)   Hens are allowed only within a coop, pen, or chicken run within in
a fully fenced enclosure within the rear yard, except when being removed to be
transported to, or returned from, a location off of the property, or when being
temporarily confined in a garage or indoor space during periods of extreme cold
or brooding. The fence must be at least four feet in height.
      (5)   A coop shall not exceed 120 square feet in area or ten feet in
height, and shall comply with the requirements for accessory buildings.
      (6)   There shall be a minimum six square feet of run space per hen.
      (7)   A chicken coop shall be set back at least three feet from any
building on the subject property and 25 feet from any residence on a
neighboring property.
      (8)   Chicken feed must be kept secure from pests.
      (9)   All animal byproducts and waste must be collected and removed or
composted on a regular basis, allowing the storage of one sealed container up
to 20-gallon in size. All byproducts, waste, and carcasses must be properly
disposed of in accordance with applicable law, including without limitation,
the rules and regulations of the Indiana Board of Animal Health. Neither the
waste, anything contaminated by the waste or carcasses may be disposed of
through the town municipal trash services. If a permit holder fails to properly
dispose of any chicken byproducts or chicken waste and or causes any potential
contamination of the ground, the permit holder shall be responsible for the
costs incurred to clean up and mitigate, as necessary, any and all such
byproducts, waste, or contamination. Violations of this division are subject to
the fines and penalties provided under §
156.181(F)(5).

standards, must be afforded in all aspects including adequate and proper food,
water, and clean living conditions, and proper handling, restraining,
sheltering, exercise, grooming, nutrition, parasite control, and waste
management. Poor condition or health of a chicken in the absence of veterinary
supervision is prima facie evidence of a violation.
      (15)   No property owner or resident of property located within 200 feet
of the property has objected to the proposed keeping and raising of chickens on
the property showing that the requirements and conditions of this section have
not been satisfied or showing that the issuance of a backyard chickens permit
would likely result in a nuisance to them or their property.
      (16)   Compliance with all other generally applicable provisions of the
Whiteland Zoning Code and the town code.
      (17)   A person is in violation of this section if the person is a holder
of a backyard chickens permit and refuses, upon request by a town official
during reasonable hours, to make his or her animals, premises, facilities,
equipment, and any necessary registrations or permits, available for
inspection. Regular inspections may occur to ensure that the property is in
compliance with this section. The town may hire a third-party contractor to
assist with inspections and/or other non-compliance matters. Addressing non-
compliance matters shall be at the permit holder's expense.
      (18)   This section shall not supersede, replace, or have control over
any recorded deed restrictions, covenants, homeowners association rules, or
other applicable restrictions that prohibit the keeping of chickens on such
property.
      (19)   Permittees must operate their property in a manner so as not to
pose a threat to public health. Permittees shall isolate chickens that are sick
or diseased so as to not endanger the health and well-being of other animal and
humans. When necessary for the protection of public health and safety, the Town
Manager and/or any public health official may require that a specified animal
be kept confined in a secured enclosure. This provision is subordinate to any
local, state, or federal code governing the treatment of chickens in the event
of a threat to human health. For more information, please refer to the Indiana
State Board of Animal Health.
      (20)   Applicants must complete the Indiana Premises Identification
Registration through the Indiana Board of Animal Health and submit proof of
registration.
      (21)   If a permit holder moves and leaves any chicken byproducts or
chicken waste and/or any potential contamination of the ground, the permit
holder shall be responsible for the costs incurred to clean up and mitigate, as
necessary, any and all such byproducts, waste, or contamination.
   (D)   Chickens that are not kept as provided under this section shall be
deemed a nuisance under §
91.02 of the Whiteland Town Code.

allowing backyard chickens if the applicant is a person other than the owner of
the property on which the backyard chickens will be kept;
         (e)   Place a notice of the application on the property, in accordance
with Rules of the Procedure of the Whiteland Board of Zoning Appeals, which

         (f)   Provide notice, at the applicant's expense and in the form
required by the Department, to all adjoining legal landowners of property
within two property depths, or 660 feet of the subject property, in accordance

chickens on the applicant's property, the backyard chickens permit shall be
issued by the Department.
      (3)   Prior to the issuance of a backyard chickens permit, a site
inspection during reasonable hours may be conducted by a representative of the
Department to verify compliance with the requirements of this section.
      (4)   All backyard chickens permits issued under this section shall be
nontransferable and valid only for the applicant and location for which it was
originally issued. In the event the permit holder no longer resides at the

refund; otherwise, a backyard chickens permit has an indefinite duration,
subject to revocation as provided in this section.
      (5)   The Department may revoke a backyard chickens permit issued under
this section or refuse to issue a permit if the permittee or applicant fails to
meet the conditions and limitations of this section, refuses to permit
inspections of the property, or violates any provision of this section.

and limitations of this section, refuses to make the property or chickens in
its possession available for an inspection, seriously or repeatedly violates
this section in a way that threatens the health or well-being of the permittee
or applicant, the permittee's or applicant's neighbors, or animals in their
care, fails to comply with any condition of the permit, or otherwise violates
this section in any other way, if the Department gives the permittee or
applicant notice that:
         (a)   States the reason(s) for the revocation or denial;
         (b)   States that the permittee or applicant may appeal the decision
by submitting a timely written appeal to the Department; and

the permittee or applicant. If no appeal request is received within the 15 day
period, the revocation or denial of the permit becomes final. In the event of
an appeal by a permittee or applicant, the permittee or applicant shall
simultaneously provide notice of the appeal to all owners residents of adjacent
properties entitled to notice of the original application, and to any residents
who have submitted to the Department a written objection to the proposed
keeping of chickens on the applicant's property, in accordance with the
application notice requirements, and the applicant shall provide the Department
the certified mail receipts or the certificate of mailing and any unopened
returned notices, or the dated signatures of property owners or residents, as
applicable, indicating personal receipt of the notice, accompanied by an

make a ruling on the appeal. The director's decision on the appeal may be
appealed to the Whiteland Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) in accordance with the
BZA's Rules of Procedure, provided the appeal to the BZA is filed with the
Department within15 days of the issuance of the director's decision to the
permittee or applicant, and any other interested parties.
      (4)   The permittee or applicant may reapply for a new permit under this
section at any time.
      (5)   The issuance of a revocation of a backyard chickens permit shall be
a remedy in addition to, and not in lieu of, any penalty authorized by the town
code, and shall not limit any other rights of the town to pursue other
enforcement actions or remedies to address any violation of the provisions of
this section or the town code. Whoever violates any provision of this section
for which another penalty is not provided shall be fined no less than $100 for
the first offense, $250 for the second offense, and $500 for each offense

§ 156.226 TELECOMMUNICATION TOWER FACILITY STANDARDS.
   (A)   These telecommunication tower facility standards are intended to
provide for adequate, Reliable public and private telecommunication service
while maximizing the use of existing transmission towers and sites. The
requirements seek to minimize the adverse, undesirable visual impact of towers
through minimizing needed sites, design, and screening. These standards apply
to all zoning districts in which telecommunication towers are a permitted use.
   (B)   Required approvals. The placement of telecommunication tower
facilities shall meet the following approval requirements:
      (1)   New antenna. The installation of a new antenna on an existing
tower, including legal non-conforming towers, and existing alternative
structures (water towers, buildings, steeples, etc.) may be approved by the
staff subject to conformance with other applicable requirements of this
section. If a new antenna will add height to an existing tower by more than ten
feet, it will be subject to the regulations for the installation of a new
tower.
      (2)   New accessory structure(s). The installation of new accessory
structures (i.e. equipment buildings) to support the installation of an antenna
on an existing tower or alternate structure may be approved by the staff
subject to conformance with other applicable requirements of the zoning code
and the town code.
      (3)   New tower. The construction of a new tower shall be reviewed by
staff in the case of a permitted use or by the Board of Zoning Appeals as a
special exception use consistent with the provisions of this section.
   (C)   Removal. Property owner(s) are responsible for the removal and site
restoration of a telecommunication tower that has been unused or abandoned for
12 consecutive months.

positions for co-located antenna and the minimum separation distance between
antenna;
         (c)   Describes the tower's capability, including the type and number
of antenna it can accommodate;
         (d)   Documents the steps the tower owner will take to avoid
interference with established public safety telecommunication facilities; and
         (e)   Includes the engineer's stamp and registration number.

owner and their successors to remove the tower and all related structures if
the tower is abandoned.
      (5)   Determination of need. Any proposal for a new tower shall only be
approved if the applicant submits verification from a professional engineer
(holding a valid license in the State of Indiana) that the antennas planned for
the proposed tower cannot be accommodated on any exiting towers or other
structures within a two mile radius of the proposed tower location due to one
or more of the following reasons:
         (a)   Inadequate structural capacity. Antennas would exceed the
structural capacity of existing facilities and the structure cannot be
reinforced or modified to accommodate the needed antennae at a reasonable cost.
         (b)   Interference. The array would cause interference impacting the
usability of other, existing, equipment at a tower site.
         (c)   Inadequate height. Exiting towers or structures within the
specified radius cannot accommodate the equipment at a height necessary to
function.
         (d)   Unforeseen circumstances. Other, unforeseen reasons, that make
it unfeasible or impossible to locate the planned equipment on existing towers
or structures.
         (e)   Reasonable lease agreement. The tower owner is unable to enter
into a reasonable lease term with existing tower/land owner(s).
         (f)   Land availability. Additional land area is not available to
accommodate the needed facilities.
   (E)   Design requirements. All towers and facilities shall meet the
following design requirements:
      (1)   Contextual design. Towers and antennae should generally be designed
to blend into the surrounding environment through the use of color,
camouflaging, and architectural treatment, except in an instance where color is
dictated by Federal or state regulations.
         (a)   Wireless towers should generally be of a monopole design.
         (b)   The use of residentially compatible materials such as wood,
brick, or stone is required for associated accessory structures that must be
designed to architecturally match the exterior of adjacent residential or
commercial structures.
      (2)   Lighting. Only when lighting is needed for safety or security
reasons, or as required by the FAA or other authority shall it be permitted on
the site. All ground level security lighting shall be oriented inward so as not
to project onto surrounding properties.
      (3)   Co-location. All towers must be structurally designed to be able to
accommodate additional equipment with an antenna loading equal to the initial
user,
      (4)   Tower height. All towers and antenna shall conform with all FAA
tall structure requirements. Tower height is measured from ground level in all
instances. Maximum tower height shall be 200 feet; maximum height of any
accessory structure shall be 15 feet.
      (5)   Interference. No new facility shall result in any interference with
public safety telecommunications.
      (6)   Signs. Signs for all telecommunication tower facilities shall be
limited to two square feet per user.
   (F)   Site requirements. All telecommunication tower facilities shall meet
the following site requirements.
      (1)   Residential areas. No tower may be located closer than 500 feet
from any property zoned residential (Rl, R2, R3, A).
      (2)   Staffing. All facilities should be designed to be fully automated
and unattended on a daily basis.

utility poles within public right-of-way is permitted. An Improvement Location
Permit shall be obtained prior to co-location unless otherwise exempted.
   (D)   New support structures. The construction and placement of new support
structures for small cell facilities shall be permitted within areas with a
non-residential zoning classification and in residentially zoned areas with
existing above ground utility infrastructure. An improvement location permit
shall be required for all new support structures.
   (E)   Prohibition. 
      (1)   The construction, placement, or use of above-ground small cell
facilities and associated supporting structures shall be prohibited in areas of

wireless service, the antenna and such other components of the small cell
facilities and supporting structures as are reasonably deemed necessary to
abate the material inhibition to wireless service, as determined by the
Commission, may be placed above ground, with the remainder of the small cell
facilities remaining underground.
   (F)   Variance. A variance from the prohibition against the installation of
new utility poles or new wireless support structures in a Residential SUBU Area
may be requested by applying to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a development
standards variance.
   (G)   Notice of application. Upon receipt of an application for the
construction, placement, or use of a small cell facility on one or more new
utility poles or one or more new wireless support structures in a Residential
SUBU Area, the town shall post notice of the application on the town's internet
web site. The notice of the application required by this clause must include a
statement indicating that the application is available to the public upon
request.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
§ 156.300 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. As provided for by IC 36-7-4-1500 et seq., the
purpose of these regulations is to allow greater design flexibility in
development of land while remaining consistent with the goals of the
Comprehensive Plan. The regulations are intended to encourage developments that
are innovative and/or responsive to unique opportunities or constraints of a
site. Planned unit developments should be used to address unique environmental
aspects, provide a mix of land uses, or otherwise better implement the goals of
the Comprehensive Plan than what could be accomplished with established zoning
districts. Planned unit developments should be avoided where the proposed
development could be achieved using a combination of established zoning
districts.
   (B)   Uses allowed.
      (1)   All uses are subject to the discretion and approval of the Plan
Commission and Council during the adoption of a planned unit development (PUD).
Uses must be compatible with the intent of the Comprehensive Plan and
surrounding existing and future land uses.
      (2)   Permitted and special exception uses shall be specified in the PUD
proposal. Special exception uses should be minimized.
   (C)   Development standards.
      (1)   Development standards and requirements shall be stated as part of a
planned unit development proposal. All proposed development standards shall be
subject to review and approval of the Plan Commission and Council during the
approval process.
      (2)   Generally, PUD proposals may provide standards in place of lot or
development standards stated in this chapter; sign development standards stated
in Chapter 153, the Sign Code; and standards in
Chapter 154, the Subdivision Control.
      (3)   No PUD proposal shall reduce the restrictions of
Chapter 151, Flood Damage Prevention.
      (4)   Minimum land area. In order to encourage innovative design in a
variety of scales, there is no minimum land area required for a PUD.
      (5)   Minimum open space.
         (a)   In recognition that innovative designs, particularly those
proposing town center plans, may require flexibility in the amount of open
space provided in the development, there is no minimum open space required.
         (b)   However, proposals with less than 20% of the gross area
dedicated as open space must detail the design elements that justify lower
amounts of open space.
      (6)   Development standards that are not specified in the PUD shall
revert to the standards of the closest comparable established zoning district.
   (D)   Origin of proposals.
      (1)   An applicant may propose a planned unit development district in
accordance with the procedures established in this section.
      (2)   The applicant must be the land owner(s) or intended developer of
the development.
      (3)   The area proposed for a PUD may or may not be under single
ownership. If under multiple ownership, the owners must have a contractual
agreement to develop the property in accordance with the unified plan
stipulated in the PUD and to assure the completion of the PUD as planned and to
the satisfaction of the Plan Commission.
   (E)   Limitation on zoning ordinance amendments.
      (1)   Any amendment of the zoning ordinance that would affect an approved
planned unit development prior to its completion shall not be applied to the
PUD.
      (2)   New amendments to the zoning ordinance shall only apply to PUDs
that have expired or that have been completely developed.
   (F)   Procedures for approval. Application shall be accompanied by all plans
and documents required by this code and by the planning staff. A three-step
application process shall be used: pre-design conference, concept plan
approval, and PUD master plan approval.
   (G)   Pre-design conference. Prior to filing a formal application for
approval of a planned unit development, the applicant shall schedule a pre-
design conference with the planning staff. The purposes of this conference
shall be:
      (1)   To allow the applicant to present a general concept and to discuss
characteristics of the proposed development; and
      (2)   To allow the planning staff to inform the applicant of applicable
policies, standards, and procedures.
      (3)   This pre-design conference is for informational purposes only, and
no decision made during the conference is binding upon either party or upon the
Plan Commission.
      (4)   There is no limit to the number of pre-design meetings requested by
the applicant, if the meetings serve to advance the design and planning of the
proposal.
   (H)   Concept plan approval.
      (1)   An application for planned unit development, the PUD concept plan,
written development standards, other documentation, and filing fee shall be
submitted to the planning staff by the application deadline indicated on the
Plan Commission calendar. Written development standards shall include, at a
minimum, standards for the following:
         (a)   Lot size(s);

         (f)   Open space;
         (g)   Permitted uses;
         (h)   Any other relevant development standard, as determined by the
planning staff. The planning staff shall confirm the application to be complete
and ready for review by the Technical Review Committee.
      (2)   The planning staff and the Technical Review Committee shall review
the proposal and prepare comments and recommendations.
      (3)   The application, TRC comments, planning staff report, and other
pertinent documents shall be forwarded to the Plan Commission for its
consideration, public hearing, and recommendation.
      (4)   The Plan Commission shall hold a public hearing on the application
in accordance with its Rules of Procedure.
      (5)   After the public hearing and review of the application, the Plan
Commission shall certify the application to the Town Council with a favorable
recommendation, an unfavorable recommendation, or no recommendation.
      (6)   The Town Council shall act upon the certified proposal as in the
case of any rezoning petition.
      (7)   Upon Council approval of the PUD concept plan, the PUD zoning shall
become effective and shown on the zoning map designated as a planned unit
development. After approval, the use and development of the site shall be
governed by the planned unit development concept plan, subject to the approval
of a PUD master plan. No permit of any kind shall be issued in the PUD district
until a PUD master plan has been approved.
   (I)   Planned unit development master plan approval. The purpose of the PUD
master plan is to set the specific regulations for development of the planned
unit development. The PUD master plan shall show the exact location of each
building and improvement to be constructed and a designation of the specific
internal use(s) within each building. The PUD master plan shall conform to the
approved PUD concept plan.
      (1)   The PUD master plan and supporting data shall be submitted to the

zoning and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject
property, and the reasons why such departures are or are not deemed to be in
the public interest.
      (4)   The proposal will not be injurious to the public health, safety,
and general welfare.
      (5)   The physical design of the PUD and the extent to which it makes
adequate provision for public services, provides adequate control over
vehicular traffic, provides for and protects designated permanent open space,
and furthers the amenities of light and air, recreation, and visual enjoyment.
      (6)   The relationship and compatibility of the proposed plan to the
adjacent properties and neighborhood, and whether the proposed plan would
substantially interfere with the use or adversely affect the value of adjacent
properties and neighborhoods..
      (7)   The desirability of the proposed plan to the town's physical
development, tax base, and economic well-being.
      (8)   The proposal will not cause undue traffic congestion nor place
excessive burdens on public infrastructure, and can be adequately served by
existing or planned public facilities and services.

(Ord. 2013-01, passed 2-11-13)
SIGNS
§ 156.400 GENERALLY.
   (A)   Purpose and title.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose and intent of this section is to further the
goals of the Comprehensive Plan; avoid the proliferation of signage; encourage
signs to be compatible with the scale of buildings and the surrounding
features; maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment of the town; eliminate
potential hazards to motorists and pedestrians that result from signs; and
promote the health, safety, and public welfare of the town.
      (2)   Title. This section shall be known as the Sign Code of the town and
may be so cited and pleaded.
   (B)   General standards. Except as otherwise provided in this section, it
shall be unlawful for any person to erect, construct, enlarge, move, or convert
any sign within the town, or cause the same to be done without first obtaining
a sign permit. The following general sign standards apply to all signs within
the town.
      (1)   Determining sign area and dimensions.
         (a)   Generally, the area of a sign shall be calculated as the area
used to display the sign message, not inclusive of supporting structures which
do not display any message.
         (b)   For wall signs that are framed, outlined, painted, or otherwise
prepared and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area and
dimensions shall include the entire
portion within such background or frame.
         (c)   For wall signs comprised of individual letters, figures, or
elements on a wall or similar surface of the building or structure, the area
and dimensions of the sign shall encompass a regular geometric shape
(rectangle, circle, trapezoid, triangle, etc.), or a combination of regular
geometric shapes, which form, or approximate, the perimeter of all elements in
the display, the frame, and any applied background that is not part of the
architecture of the building. When separate elements are organized to form one
single sign, but are separated by open space, the sign area and dimensions
shall be calculated by determining the geometric form, or combination of forms,
which comprises all of the display areas, including the space between different
elements. Minor appendages to a particular regular shape, as determined by the
Planning Director, shall not be included in the total area of a sign.
         (d)   For freestanding signs, the sign area shall include the frame,
if any, but shall not include:
            1.   A pole or other structural support unless such pole or support
is internally illuminated or otherwise so designed to constitute a display
device.
            2.   Architectural features that are either part of the building or
part of a freestanding structure, and not an integral part of the sign, and
which may consist of landscaping, building, or structural forms complementing
the site in general.
         (e)   When two identical sign faces are placed back to back so that
both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and are part of
the same sign structure, the sign area shall be computed as the measurement of
one of the two faces. When the sign has more than two display surfaces, the
area of the sign shall be the area of largest display surfaces that are visible
from any single direction.
         (f)   The area of a changeable copy sign face shall be included in
calculating total sign area.
      (2)   Determining sign height and clearance.
         (a)   The height of a freestanding sign shall be measured from the
base of the sign or supportive structure at its point of attachment to the
ground, to the highest point of the sign. A freestanding sign on a man-made
base, for example a graded earth mound, shall be measured from the grade of the
nearest pavement or pavement curb.
         (b)   Clearance under freestanding and projecting signs shall be
measured as the smallest vertical distance between finished grade and the
lowest point of the sign, including any framework or ornamentations.
      (3)   Determining frontages and wall area.
         (a)   Building frontage shall be the length of the elevation(s) facing
a public street, facing a primary parking area, or containing the public
entrance(s) to the building.
         (b)   Building unit frontage shall be measured from the centerline of
the party walls defining the tenant space.
         (c)   Lot frontage shall be the length of the public right-of-way
adjacent to the lot.
         (d)   Wall area shall be the area of the facade on which the sign is
placed, up to the eave line or cornice, and not including any roof area. Wall
area shall include any windows, doors, or other openings.
      (4)   Inspection. Signs for which a permit is required may be inspected
periodically by the Planning Director for compliance with this section.
      (5)   Removal of signs. The Planning Director may order the removal of
any sign erected or maintained in violation of this section, at the cost of the
property owner, consistent with the provisions of division (I).
      (6)   Maintenance. All signs and their components shall be kept in good
repair and in safe, neat, clean, and structurally sound condition.
      (7)   Abandoned signs. A sign structure, inclusive of all poles, frames,
supports, and other structural, electrical, mechanical, and other components,
shall be removed by the property owner if the sign is unused for a period of 12
months or longer. Designated historic signs are exempt from this requirement.
      (8)   Illumination. All illuminated signs shall meet the following
standards:
         (a)   Illuminated signs shall meet the standards as specified in the
National Electric Code.
         (b)   All illuminating elements shall be kept in satisfactory working
condition or immediately repaired or replaced. Signs that are only partially
illuminated shall meet all electrical requirements for that portion directly
illuminated. All electrical wiring shall be in conduit and not exposed to the
elements or external street in any way. All electrical signs shall have a
disconnecting switch located in a readily accessible place.
         (c)   Neither the direct nor reflected light from a light source shall
create a traffic hazard to motor vehicle operators.
         (d)   The light from any illuminated sign shall be so shaded,
shielded, or directed that the light intensity or brightness shall not exceed
0.3 foot-candle at the property line upon any adjoining property located in a
residentially zoned district or above 0.5 foot-candle upon any adjoining non-
residential property.
      (9)   Trademarks. This sign code shall not require alterations to
federally-registered trademarks.
      (10)   Hazardous signs. Signs, by their location, size, height, or other
elements shall not create a hazardous condition to vehicular traffic or
pedestrians, on or off the premises, nor to any surrounding properties. Signs
shall conform to the sight visibility standards of §
156.230.
      (11)   Historic signs. A sign may be designated as a historic sign by the
Plan Commission. As a historic sign, the cultural significance of the sign can
be more important than strict application of the sign code, and so the historic
designation may be used to preserve those signs. The Plan Commission, upon
written request, shall determine if a sign is to be designated a historic sign,
and any conditions of the designation.
      (12)   Interim banners. Upon issuance of a permit for a permanent sign,
one banner may be installed as an interim sign until the permanent sign is
installed. Such banner shall conform to the size and location requirements for
temporary signs. The maximum duration for an interim banner shall be 90 days.
   (C)   Exempt signs. The following signs are exempt from the provisions of
this sign code and no permit shall be required, if the sign is in compliance
with the conditions specified below.
      (1)   Integral identification features. Names of buildings, date of
construction, monumental citations, commemorative tablets, and the like, when
carved into stone, concrete, or similar material or made of bronze, aluminum,
or other permanent type construction and made an integral part of the
structure.
      (2)   Public and quasi-public signs. Public signs erected by or on the
order of public officer(s) in the performance of public duty, such as signs to
promote safety, no trespassing, or traffic signs; memorial plaques; address
numbers; signs of historical interest; and signs directing people to public
facilities.
      (3)   Utility and emergency signs. Utility marker signs, emergency signs,
public safety signs, and the like, installed by public agencies or utilities,
unless such signs are determined to be a hazard by the Planning Director.
      (4)   Real estate signs. Real estate signs located on the property for
sale or lease, provided they are not located in the right-of-way or sight
visibility triangle, are a maximum of eight feet in height, do not exceed more
than one per property or two per corner lot, and do not exceed six square feet
per sign in the residential and apartment zoning districts, and 32 square feet
per sign in all other zoning districts, unless such signs are determined to be
a hazard by the Planning Director.
      (5)   Interior signs. Signs located on the interior of buildings, courts,
athletic fields, fences, or other structures which are not intended to be seen
from the exterior of said buildings or structures. In addition, exterior signs,
which by their size and/or placement, are intended to be seen only by users or
occupants of the property and are not reasonably legible from adjacent
properties or public rights-of-way.
      (6)   Holiday decorations. Holiday decorations and displays, provided
they are not located in a public right-of-way, are displayed no more than 30
days before the holiday, and are removed within 30 days after the holiday.
Holiday displays that cause hazardous traffic conditions may have reasonable
conditions imposed by the Town Marshal or the Planning Director.
      (7)   Construction/contractor signs. Signs posted on a construction site
or a site for which a contractor is performing work, provided they are not
located in a public right-of-way, are setback a minimum of ten feet from any
public right-of-way, do not exceed more than two per property, do not exceed

they are not more than four feet in height and six square feet in area. They
shall be setback a minimum of two feet from any public right-of-way, and shall
comply with the site triangle requirement of §
156.230. Such signs shall be located and installed so as to not present a
hazard to pedestrians or traffic entering or leaving the premises.
      (9)   Social or charitable organization directional signs. Off-site signs
indicating the names and locations of churches, charitable organizations, and
community service organizations, provided that the sign area not exceed four
square feet, be located at least ten feet from the public right-of-way, and be
no less than 500 feet from any other sign in this category.
      (10)   Pennants and flags. Pennants and flags, provided that they are not
located in or encroach upon the public right-of-way. Flag poles located in
residential districts shall not exceed the maximum building height set forth by
the zoning district.
      (11)   Antique signs. Signs that exceed 40 years in age, or replicas
thereof, used solely for aesthetic and/or educational purposes, and not
primarily for advertising or identification of a property, business,
organization, or product.
      (12)   Murals. A work of art, including a hand-painted, hand-tiled, or

area, whichever is greater.
      (13)   Signs on vehicles. Signs painted on or attached directly to the
original body of the vehicle and that do not project or extend beyond the
original manufactured body proper of the vehicle, provided that the vehicle is
operable, used in conducting business (e.g. deliveries, sales calls, employee
transportation), and regularly moved off the property. Signs on vehicles parked
on the business property while off-duty, vehicles parked for the purpose of
lawfully making deliveries or random sales or service, vehicles which are
customarily used for transporting persons or properties, and vehicles parked at
a driver's place of residence during non-business hours or for incidental
purposes are also exempt. Signs on vehicles used primarily for the purpose of

changeable copy sign or billboard, or for normal maintenance and repair such as
painting or cleaning (unless a structural change is involved).
      (2)   Permit application. Application for a permit shall be made to the
Planning Director upon a form provided and shall be accompanied by such
information as may be required to assure compliance with the laws and
regulations of the town.
         (a)   All signs shall be required to obtain a permit for erection,
construction, enlargement or conversion, unless otherwise specified in this
code. This requirement shall not be construed as to require a permit for each
copy change on a sign that is constructed to facilitate changeable letters or
billboard-type signs which are designed and intended for frequent copy changes.
         (b)   The permit application shall include:
            1.   Name and address of the property owner of the premises on
which the sign is located or is to be located.
            2.   Name and address of the owner of the sign.
            3.   Clear and legible drawings with description showing the
location of the sign which is the subject of the permit and all other signs
whose construction requires permits, when such signs are on the same premises.
            4.   Drawings showing dimensions, construction, supports, sizes,
electrical wiring and components, materials of the sign, method of attachments
and character of structural members to which attachment is made. If required by
the Planning Director or Building Commissioner, engineering data shall be
supplied on plans submitted and certified by a duly licensed engineer.
            5.   Any individual or company seeking to erect, construct, alter,
repair, improve, maintain, convert or manufacture any sign adjacent to or
visible from any state or federal roadway shall register, in writing, a

         (a)   A permit fee as specified in §
10.97, Schedule of Fees, of the Town of Whiteland Code of Ordinances, shall be
required with the sign permit application.
         (b)   If any sign is erected, placed, installed or otherwise
established on any property before obtaining a permit as required herein, the
fees specified shall be doubled. Payment of such double fee shall not relieve
any person from compliance with other provisions of this chapter and penalties
prescribed herein.
      (4)   Installation deadlines.
         (a)   The erection of the sign shall begin within 90 days of the date
of issuance of the permit. One 90-day extension may be granted upon written
request of the applicant to the Planning Director, for reasonable cause shown.
         (b)   A sign permit shall become null and void if the work authorized
thereunder has not been started within a period of 90 days following the date
of the permit or authorized extension and completed within a reasonable time
thereafter.
      (5)   Effect of issuance. No permit for a sign issued hereunder shall be
deemed permission or authorization to maintain an unlawful sign, nor shall a
permit issued hereunder constitute a defense in an action to abate an unlawful
sign.
      (6)   Inspection. Signs may be inspected periodically by the Planning
Director for compliance with this and other codes of the town, upon complaint
or at random. Inspections on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays shall not be

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 158.001 AUTHORITY AND TITLE.
   (A)   This chapter is adopted in accordance with statutory authority granted
to the town under I.C. 36-1-3 (“Home Rule”), I.C. 36-9-27 (the “Indiana
Drainage Code”), I.C. 36-9-27.4, and all other statutes, rules or authority
conferring authority upon the town to adopt ordinances dealing with stormwater
management, and further is required by Phase II of the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System Stormwater program (40 CFR Parts 9, 122, 123, and
124; December 8, 1999) authorized by the 1987 amendments to the Clean Water
Act, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management’s (IDEM) municipal
separate storm sewer system (MS4) general permit (MS4 GP), and the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management’s construction stormwater general permit
(CSGP). Based on this authority and these requirements, this chapter regulates:
      (1)   Discharges of prohibited non-stormwater flows into the stormwater
drainage system.
      (2)   Stormwater drainage improvements related to development of lands
located within the town.
      (3)   Drainage control systems installed during new construction and
grading of lots and other parcels of land.
      (4)   Stormwater, including stormwater runoff, snowmelt runoff, and
surface runoff and drainage, associated with construction activity.
      (5)   Stormwater discharges from construction support activities directly
related to construction sites subject to this chapter.
      (6)   Erosion and sediment control systems installed during new
construction and grading of lots and other parcels of land.
      (7)   The design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater drainage
facilities and systems.
      (8)   The design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater quality
facilities and systems.
   (B)   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Town of Whiteland
Stormwater Management Code. Once adopted, this chapter will supersede any
conflicting ordinances previously adopted by the town.
(Ord. 2024-06, passed 4-9-24)
§ 158.002 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   This chapter shall regulate all development and redevelopment
occurring within the town. No building permit shall be issued and no land
disturbance started for any construction in a development, as defined in §
158.005, until the plans required by this chapter for such construction have
been accepted in writing by the town. However, agricultural land-disturbing
activities are exempt from this chapter.
   (B)   In addition to the requirements of this chapter and its companion
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual (Version 1.0, 2023), compliance with all
applicable titles of the town code as well as with applicable federal, State of
Indiana, and other local statues and regulations shall also be required. All
construction activities by the town shall be required to obtain a permit, to
the extent applicable, and are expected to meet all applicable technical
requirements of this chapter and the Town of Whiteland Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual. If the project site is located within a Johnson County-
Regulated Drain Watershed, the applicant will need to check with the Johnson
County Surveyor’s Office to learn if additional Surveyor’s Office requirements
specific to that regulated drain would apply to the site. In case there are
conflicts between the requirements contained in this chapter and applicable
requirements contained in other regulatory documents referenced above, the most
restrictive shall prevail.
   (C)   Any construction activity which has had its final drainage plan
approved by the town within a two-year period prior to the effective date of
this chapter shall be exempt from all requirements of this chapter that are in
excess of the requirements in effect at the time of approval; provided,
however, such an exemption is not applicable to the requirements detailed in §§
158.020 through
158.026.
   (D)   The Town Council has the authority to modify or amend this chapter.
The Town Council has the authority to grant exemptions, and/or waive any and
all the requirements of this chapter and its associated technical standards
document. A pre-submittal meeting with a town representative may be requested
by the applicant to discuss the applicability of various provisions of the
chapter and its associated technical standards document with regards to unique
or unusual circumstances relating to a project. However, any initial
determination of such applicability shall not be binding on future
determinations of the town that may be based on the review of more detailed
information and plans.
(Ord. 2024-06, passed 4-9-24)
§ 158.003 FINDINGS.
   The town finds that:
   (A)   Water bodies, roadways, structures, and other property within the town
or its planning jurisdiction boundary are at times subjected to flooding;
   (B)   Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is
also a danger to the natural resources of the region;
   (C)   Land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds,
resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, increased flooding,
increased stream channel erosion, and increased sediment transport and
deposition;
   (D)   Soil erosion resulting from land-disturbing activities causes a
significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to be transported off-site
and deposited in ditches, streams, wetlands, lakes, and reservoirs;
   (E)   Increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments and
pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects
within the town will, absent reasonable regulation and control, adversely
affect the town’s water bodies and water resources;
   (F)   Pollutant contributions from illicit discharges within the town will,
absent reasonable regulation, monitoring, and enforcement, adversely affect the
town’s water bodies and water resources;
   (G)   Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, non-point source pollution, and
illicit sources of pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation
of stormwater management;
   (H)   Adopting the standards, criteria, and procedures contained and
referenced in this chapter and implementing the same will address many of the
deleterious effects of stormwater runoff and illicit discharges; and
   (I)   Adopting this chapter is necessary for the preservation of the public
health, safety, and welfare, for the conservation of natural resources, and for
compliance with state and federal regulations.
(Ord. 2024-06, passed 4-9-24)
§ 158.004 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the town through the regulation of
stormwater and non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system and to
protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land and water
resources within the town. This chapter establishes methods for managing the
quantity and quality of stormwater entering into the stormwater drainage
system. The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To reduce the hazard to public health and safety caused by excessive
stormwater runoff.
   (B)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the stormwater drainage
system from construction site runoff.
   (C)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the stormwater drainage
system from runoff from new development and re-development.
   (D)   To prohibit illicit discharges into the stormwater drainage system.
   (E)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, monitoring,
and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.

(Ord. 2024-06, passed 4-9-24)
§ 158.026 INSPECTIONS AND MONITORING.
   (A)   Stormwater drainage system. The town has the authority to inspect
properties, facilities, and any portion of the stormwater drainage system under
the town’s control, jurisdiction, or authority, in an effort to detect and
eliminate illicit connections and discharges into the stormwater drainage
system, which shall be as often as may be necessary to determine compliance
with this subchapter. This inspection will include a screening of discharges
from outfalls connected to the stormwater drainage system in order to determine
if prohibited flows are being conveyed into the stormwater drainage system. It
could also include spot testing of waters contained in the stormwater drainage
system itself to detect the introduction of pollutants into the stormwater
drainage system by means other than a defined outfall, such as dumping or
contaminated sheet runoff.
   (B)   Potential polluters. If, as a result of a stormwater drainage system
inspection, a discharger is suspected of an illicit discharge, the town may
inspect and/or obtain stormwater samples from stormwater runoff facilities of
the subject discharger, to determine compliance with the requirements of this
chapter. Upon request, the discharger shall allow properly identified town
representatives to enter upon the premises of the discharger at all hours
necessary for the purposes of such inspection or sampling. The town or its
properly identified representatives may place on the discharger's property the
equipment or devices used for such sampling or inspection. Identified illicit
connections or discharges shall be subject to enforcement action as described
in §§
158.100 through
158.103.
   (C)   New development and re-development. Following the final completion of
construction and the receipt of as-built drawings by the town. The town has the
authority to inspect new development and redevelopment sites to verify that all
on-site stormwater conveyances and connections to the stormwater drainage
system are in compliance with this chapter.
(Ord. 2024-06, passed 4-9-24)
STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT
§ 158.035 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   The storage and controlled release of excess stormwater runoff shall be
required for all new business and institutional developments, commercial and
industrial developments, residential subdivisions, planned development, rural
estate subdivisions, and any redevelopment or other new construction located
within the town. The town, after thorough investigation and evaluation, may
waive the requirement of controlled runoff for minor subdivisions and
parcelization. Additional potential exemptions regarding the detention
requirements are provided under §
158.036.
(Ord. 2024-06, passed 4-9-24)
§ 158.036 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that most streams and drainage channels serving the
town do not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey stormwater runoff
resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, the storage and controlled
release of excess stormwater runoff as well as compensation for loss of
floodplain storage shall be required for all developments and redevelopments
(as defined in § 158.005) located within the town. Release rate requirements,
downstream restriction considerations, acceptable outlet, adjoining property
impact considerations, policy on dams and levees, policy on fluvial erosion
hazard corridors, and compensatory floodplain storage rates are detailed in the
town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (B)   Due to unknowns regarding the future development patterns and the
associated proposed stormwater quantity management systems within a watershed,
it is the policy of the town to discourage direct release of runoff from a new
development or redevelopment without providing detention. However, in rare
circumstances, where a comprehensive watershed-wide hydrologic study or
watershed plan of a major stream (not a “beat the peak” analysis) approved by
the town substantiates the benefits of (or allows for) direct release for a
proposed development located adjacent to a major stream, the detention
requirements provided in this chapter may be waived. Other special
circumstances when such a waiver may be considered by the town include
situations where the design of a regional pond has already taken into account
the provision of direct release in certain areas in the watershed.

   (A)   All stormwater drainage systems, including detention or retention
basins, conveyance systems, structures and appurtenances, located outside of
the public road right-of-way shall be placed within a drainage easement. There
shall be no trees or shrubs planted, nor any structures or fences erected in
any drainage easement, unless otherwise accepted by the town. Additional
easement requirements along stormwater conveyance systems are contained in the
town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. All drainage improvements performed
relative to the conveyance of stormwater runoff and the perpetual maintenance
thereof, within the easements, shall be the responsibility of the owner(s) of
the property served by the drainage improvements and any homeowners or lot
owners association applicable to the property served by the drainage
improvements.
   (B)   Any outlet to, crossing, and/or encroachment of a county-regulated
drainage easement requires application and acceptance from the County Drainage
Board in accordance with the Indiana Drainage Code.

STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION FOR CONSTRUCTION SITES
§ 158.050 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   The town will require a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP),
which includes erosion and sediment control measures and materials handling
procedures, to be submitted as part of a project’s construction plans and
specifications. Any project located within the corporate boundaries of the town
that includes clearing, grading, excavation or other land-disturbing activities
is subject to the requirements of this chapter. This includes both new
development and redevelopment. Section
158.052 provides guidelines for calculating land disturbance. Projects meeting
the coverage requirements of IDEM’s CSGP shall also be in compliance with the
requirements contained in that permit.
   (B)   The requirements under this chapter do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10.
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34.
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under
329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the
expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or
outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
   (C)   For a lot where land disturbance is expected to be one acre or more,
the lot owner must complete their own notice of intent letter, apply for a
stormwater permit from the town and ensure that a sufficient construction and
stormwater pollution prevention plan is completed and submitted in accordance
with §§
158.080 through
158.089, regardless of whether the individual lot is part of a larger permitted
project site. For a lot where land disturbance is less than one acre, a
stormwater permit is required prior to receiving a building permit. Details of
the permitting process are contained in §§
158.080 through
158.089.
   (D)   A lot with land disturbance of less than one acre, located within a
larger permitted project site, is considered part of the larger permitted
project site, and the lot operator must comply with the terms and conditions of
the stormwater permit approved for the larger project site. The stormwater
permit application for the larger project site must include detailed erosion
and sediment control measures for individual lots. In addition, these
individual lots are required to obtain a stormwater permit prior to receiving a
building permit. Details of the permitting process are contained in §§
158.080 through
158.089 and additional requirements for individual lots may be found in the
town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (E)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan is
completed and submitted to the town in accordance with §§
158.080 through
158.089. It is the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure
compliance with this chapter during construction activity and implementation of
the construction plan, to notify the town upon completion of the project and
stabilization of the site, and to request a termination inspection to be
performed by the town. However, all persons engaging in construction and land-
disturbing activities on a permitted project site meeting the applicability
requirements must comply with the requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 2024-06, passed 4-9-24)
§ 158.051 POLICY ON STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION.
   (A)   Effective stormwater pollution prevention on construction sites is
dependent on a combination of preventing movement of soil from its original
position (erosion control), intercepting displaced soil prior to entering a
waterbody (sediment control), and proper on-site materials handling. For land
disturbance of one acre or more, the developer must submit to the town a SWPPP
with detailed erosion and sediment control plans as well as a narrative
describing materials handling and storage, and construction sequencing. The
SWPPP and the project management log must be retained by the project site owner
for at least three years from the date the project permit is terminated.
   (B)   For land disturbances less than one acre, appropriate erosion and
sediment control measures that are consistent with the town Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual must be designed and shown on the plans.
   (C)   The required IDEM general and implementation requirements that apply
to all land-disturbing activities are contained in the town Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual.
(Ord. 2024-06, passed 4-9-24)
§ 158.052 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   In calculating the total area of land disturbance, for the purposes of
determining applicability of this chapter to a project, the following
guidelines should be used: Off-site construction activities that provide
services (for example, road extensions, sewer, water, offsite stockpiles, and
other utilities) to a land-disturbing project site, must be considered as a
part of the total land disturbance calculation for the project site, when the
activity is under the control of the project site owner.
   (B)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by this chapter,
the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the total area of
land disturbance for improvements, such as, roads, utilities, or common areas,
and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as determined by the
following:
      (1)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
one-half acre or more, one-half acre of land disturbance must be used as the
expected lot disturbance.
      (2)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
less than one-half acre in size, the total lot must be calculated as being
disturbed.
      (3)   To calculate lot disturbance on all other types of project sites,
such as industrial and commercial project sites, a minimum of one acre of land
disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance, unless the lots are
less than one acre in size, in which case the total lot must be calculated as
being disturbed.
   (C)   (1)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and
placement of all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction
sites shall meet the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in
the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual, the town Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual, and the product guidance/specifications of the manufacturer. The
methods and procedures included in the above two manuals are in keeping with
the above stated policy and meet the requirements of IDEM’s CSGP permit. A copy
of the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual may be obtained through IDEM.
      (2)   The design requirements that apply to all land-disturbing
activities and that shall be considered in the selection, design, and
implementation of all stormwater quality and management measures contained in
the SWPPP, are contained in the town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
(Ord. 2024-06, passed 4-9-24)
§ 158.053 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING, AND REPORTING.
   (A)   Following approval of the stormwater permit by the town and
commencement of construction activities, the town has the authority to conduct
inspections of the site to ensure full compliance with the provisions of this
chapter, the approved SWPPP, the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual, and the
terms and conditions of the approved permit.
   (B)   A self-monitoring program (SMP) must be implemented by the project
site owner to ensure the SWPPP is working effectively. A trained individual,
acceptable to the town, shall monitor and manage project construction and
stormwater activities. Details regarding the required monitoring activities are
contained in the town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (C)   The SWPPP shall serve as a guideline for stormwater quality but should
not be interpreted to be the only basis for implementation of stormwater
quality measures for a project site. The project site owner is responsible for
implementing, in accordance with this chapter, all measures necessary to
adequately prevent polluted stormwater runoff. Recommendations by the trained
individual for modified stormwater quality measures should be implemented to
the extent consistent with the purposes and intent of this chapter.
(Ord. 2024-06, passed 4-9-24)
STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION
§ 158.060 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   In addition to the requirements of §§
158.050 through
158.053, the stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP), which is to be
submitted to the town as part of the stormwater permit application, must also
include post-construction stormwater quality measures. These measures are
incorporated as a permanent feature into the site plan and are left in place
following completion of construction activities to continuously treat
stormwater runoff from the stabilized site. Any project located within the
corporate boundaries of the town that includes clearing, grading, excavation,
and other land-disturbing activities, resulting in the disturbance of one acre
or more of total land area is subject to the requirements of this chapter. This
includes both new development and redevelopment, and disturbances of land less
than one acre of total land area that are part of a larger common plan of
development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb one acre
or more of total land area. In addition, regardless of the amount of
disturbance, the town reserves the right to require pre- treatment BMPs for
proposed hot spot developments in accordance with provisions contained in the
town Technical Standards Manual.
   (B)   The requirements under this chapter do not apply to any of the
following activities:
      (1)   Agricultural land-disturbing activities;
      (2)   Silvicultural activities per 40 CFR 122.27;
      (3)   Oil and gas exploration, production, processing, or treatment
operations, or transmission facilities per 40 CFR 122.26;
      (4)   Single-family residences and private ponds that are not part of a
larger common plan of development or sale;
      (5)   Individual residential building lots within a permitted project
site;
      (6)   Land-disturbing activities where there will be no additional
impervious surfaces associated with the final completed project, including but
not limited to, ditch construction/reconstruction and utility installation/
maintenance activities;
      (7)   Single-family residential strip development offered for sale or
lease without land improvements and the project is not part of a larger common
plan of development or sale; or
      (8)   Residential developments consisting of four or fewer lots where the
proposed impervious surfaces are 10% or less of the project acreage. The
impervious surface percentage is determined by the sum of the acreage of all
impervious infrastructure (roads, paths, parking, etc.) plus the sum of the
hard surface acreage associated with all buildings (built or planned to be
built) on the lots within the development, together divided by the total
acreage of the lots within the development.
   (C)   The requirements under this chapter do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10.
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34.
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under
329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the
expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or
outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
   (D)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan is
completed and submitted to the town in accordance with §§
158.080 through
158.089. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure
proper construction and installation of all stormwater BMPs (especially, the
protection of post-stormwater BMPs during construction phase) in compliance
with this chapter and with the approved stormwater permit, to notify the town
upon completion of the project and stabilization of the site, and to request a
termination inspection to be performed by the town. However, all eventual
property owners of stormwater quality facilities meeting the applicability
requirements must comply with the requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 2024-06, passed 4-9-24)
§ 158.061 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to undeveloped
areas, generally have increased imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates,
increased runoff rates, and increased concentrations of pollutants such as
fertilizers, herbicides, greases, oil, salts and other pollutants. As new
development and re-development continues within the corporate boundaries of the
town, measures must be taken to intercept and filter pollutants from stormwater
runoff prior to reaching regional creeks, streams, and rivers. Through the use
of appropriate best management practices (BMPs), stormwater runoff will be
filtered and harmful amounts of sediment, nutrients, and contaminants will be
removed.
   (B)   It is also recognized that another major source of pollution in many
Indiana streams, including those within the corporate boundaries of the town,
is the streambank erosion associated with urbanizing watersheds. Stream
channels develop their shape in response to the volume and rate of runoff that
they receive from their contributing watersheds. Research has shown that in
hydrologically stable watersheds, the stream flow responsible for most of the
shaping of the channel (called the bankfull flow) occurs between every one to
two years. When land is developed, the volume and rate of runoff from that land
increases for these comparatively small flooding events that are not normally
addressed by the detention practices and the stream channel will adapt by
changing its shape. As the stream channel works to reach a new stable shape,
excess erosion occurs. As new development and redevelopment continues within
the town, measures must be taken to minimize the impact of such development or
redevelopment on streambank erosion. Through the use of appropriate best
management practices (BMPs), the volume and rate of runoff for channel forming
flows will be reduced in an attempt to minimize increased streambank erosion in
the receiving streams and channels.
   (C)   For land disturbance of one acre or more, the project site owner must
submit to the town a SWPPP that shows placement of appropriate BMP(s) from a
pre-approved list of BMPs specified in the town Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual. The SWPPP submittal shall include an operation and maintenance manual
for all post-construction BMP(s) included in the project and a notarized
maintenance agreement, consistent with the sample agreement provided in the
town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, providing for the long-term
maintenance of those BMPs, both of which shall be recorded in the chain of
title of for the property on which the project is located, by the property
owner and at the property owner’s expense. The noted BMP(s) must be designed,
constructed, and maintained according to guidelines provided or referenced in
the town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. Practices other than those
specified in the pre-approved list may be utilized. However, the burden of
proof, as to whether the performance and ease of maintenance of such practices
will be according to guidelines provided in the town Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual, is placed with the applicant. Details regarding the
procedures and criteria for consideration of acceptance of such BMPs are
provided in the town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (D)   Gasoline outlets and refueling areas must install appropriate
practices to reduce lead, copper, zinc, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in
stormwater runoff. These requirements will apply to all new facilities and
existing facilities that replace their tanks, regardless of the size of the
facility.
   (E)   Discharges from new development and re-development sites will not be
allowed directly into karst features without pre-treatment.
(Ord. 2024-06, passed 4-9-24)
§ 158.062 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   Calculation of land disturbance should follow the guidelines discussed in §
158.052. The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all stormwater quality management measures, or BMPs shall meet the design
criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the town Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual. The methods and procedures included in the
referenced Standards is in keeping with the above stated policy and meet or
exceed the requirements of IDEM’s MS4 GP.

   This subchapter applies to all development, or redevelopment of land, that
results in land disturbance of one acre or more. Individual lots with land
disturbance of less than one acre shall refer to §§
158.050 through
158.053 and §§
158.060 through
158.064 and §
158.083 for plan review requirements and procedures. Appendix A is a flowchart
summarizing the plan review/permit approval/project termination compliance
process for land disturbance of one acre or more and can be found at the end of
this chapter.
   (A)   General procedures.
      (1)   The project site owner shall submit an application for a stormwater
permit to the town. The application shall include a completed application
checklist, construction plan sheets, a stormwater drainage technical report, a
stormwater pollution prevention plan, and any other necessary support
information. Specific information to be included in the application can be
found in §
158.082 below. Two copies of each application must be submitted to the town.
The town may, at its discretion, require one or more copies be submitted to the
Director of Administration, or other entity deemed appropriate by the town.
Additionally, a digital copy of the construction plans is required in a format
accepted by the town.
      (2)   After the town’s receipt of the application, the applicant will be
notified as to whether their application was complete or insufficient. The
applicant will be asked for additional information if the application is
insufficient. If the application is complete, it will be reviewed in detail by
the town and/or its plan review consultant(s). Once all comments have been
received and review completed, the town will either approve the project,
request modifications or deny the project. If the applicant does not agree with
or accept the review findings and wishes to seek an appeal, the town will place
the project on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Town
Council, provided the agenda for the meeting has not yet been advertised or
published. If time for notification does not allow, the project shall be placed
on the following regularly scheduled meeting of the Town Council. If the
project must go through a scheduled meeting, the town will furnish the
applicant a complete list of comments and objections to the plans and
accompanying data prior to the scheduled meeting. After the scheduled meeting,
the town will either issue a permit, request modifications to the construction
plans, or deny the project.
      (3)   The project site owner must notify the town and IDEM before
beginning construction. Notification to the town shall be in the form of an
email while the notification to IDEM shall be in the form of an online IDEM NOI
submittal. Once a permit has been issued and the required construction
notifications have been submitted to the town and IDEM before the beginning of
construction, construction may commence. Once construction starts, the project
site owner shall monitor construction activities and inspect all stormwater
pollution prevention measures in compliance with this chapter and the terms and
conditions of the approved permit. Upon completion of construction activities,
a certification of completion and compliance and as-built plans must be
submitted to the town. Once the construction site has been stabilized and all
temporary erosion and sediment control measures have been removed, a
notification shall be sent to the town, requesting a termination inspection.
The town, or its representative, shall inspect the construction site to verify
that the completed project is fully stabilized and meets the requirements of
this chapter, the town’s Technical Standards, and the terms and conditions of
the permit. Once the applicant receives a signed copy of the termination
inspection checklist confirming compliance, they must forward a copy to IDEM
along with the required IDEM NOT form. Permits issued by the town under this
scenario will expire five years from the date of issuance. If construction is
not completed within five years, an updated permit application must be
submitted to the town and an updated NOI must be resubmitted to IDEM at least
90 days prior to expiration.
   (B)   SWPPP review time limits.
      (1)   Pursuant to I.C. 13-18-27, an MS4-designated entity or other review
authority such as SWCD must make a preliminary determination as to whether the
construction plan associated with a SWPPP is substantially complete before the
end of the tenth working day after the day on which the construction plan
associated with a SWPPP is submitted to the review authority, in the case of a
less than five acres construction activity site, or the fourteenth working day
after the day on which the construction plan associated with a SWPPP is
submitted to the review authority, in the case of a five acres or larger
construction activity site. Depending on the outcome of the SWPPP review, the
following scenarios may play out:
         (a)   No SWPPP review notification received. If the review authority
does not notify the applicant of its preliminary determination as to whether
the construction plan is substantially complete within either ten or 14 days as
noted above, the project site owner may submit a notice of intent letter to
IDEM together with the information required by IDEM, this chapter, and the town
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and after submission of the notice of
intent letter to IDEM, may begin the construction project, including the land-
disturbing activities of the construction project.
         (b)   SWPPP not substantially complete. If the review authority
notifies the applicant that the construction plan is not substantially
complete, the project site owner may not submit a notice of intent letter to
IDEM until the review authority makes a conclusive favorable determination
concerning the construction plan under the IDEM rule/permit, this chapter, and
the town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
         (c)   Unfavorable SWPPP. If the review authority notifies the
applicant that the construction plan is substantially complete, and thereafter
makes a conclusive unfavorable determination concerning the construction plan
under IDEM rule/permit, this chapter, and the town Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual, and notifies the applicant accordingly, the land-disturbing
activities of the construction project may not begin, and if begun, must stop
when the review authority notifies the project site owner of the review
authority's conclusive unfavorable determination concerning the construction
plan.
      (2)   Note that the above time limits only apply to the SWPPP portion of
the overall stormwater permit submittal and does not affect any official or
non-official permit review timelines set by the entity for other aspects of the
stormwater permit application.

(Ord. 2024-06, passed 4-9-24)
§ 158.086 REQUIRED ASSURANCES.
   This subchapter shall apply to all projects whether the stormwater
management system or portions thereof will be dedicated to the town or retained
privately. As a condition of approval and issuance of the permit, the town
shall require the applicant to provide assurance in the form of an irrevocable
letter of credit or a performance bond when the stormwater management plan has
been accepted and before construction begins. Said assurance shall guarantee a
good faith execution of the stormwater drainage plan, the stormwater pollution
prevention plan, the stormwater quality management plan, and any permit
conditions, and shall be in a form acceptable to the town. The assurance shall
be for an amount equal to 125% of the total costs of all stormwater management
measures for the entire project. The above-mentioned costs shall be based on an
estimate as prepared by a registered engineer or land surveyor. Said costs
shall be for the installation and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of erosion
control measures and the construction and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of
storm drainage infrastructure, detention/retention facilities, and stormwater
quality BMPs, as regulated under this chapter, until the construction is
completed, the site is stabilized, and as- built plans are accepted by the
town. Assurances shall be for a minimum of $5,000. All other performance bonds,
maintenance bonds or other assurances required by the town in accordance with
any and all other town code requirements shall also apply and so be required.
Local governmental jurisdictions may require additional performance and/or
maintenance assurances. The intent of this assurance is not only to complete
the installation of storm drain infrastructure for the project, but also to
assure that adequate stormwater pollution prevention measures are properly
installed and maintained. If adequate assurances are set aside by the project
site owner for the overall project, proof of total assurance can be submitted
in place of an individual stormwater assurance.
(Ord. 2024-06, passed 4-9-24)
§ 158.087 TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PERMITS.
   (A)   In granting a stormwater permit, the town may impose such terms and
conditions as are reasonably necessary to meet the purposes of this chapter.
The project site owner shall ensure compliance with such terms and conditions.
Noncompliance with the terms and conditions of permits will be subject to
enforcement as described in §§
158.100 through
158.103.
   (B)   The project site owner shall inform all general contractors,
construction management firms, grading or excavating contractors, utility
contractors, and the contractors that have primary oversight of the development
on any lot, of the terms and conditions of the stormwater permit and the
schedule for proposed implementation.
   (C)   In the event that a project site is determined to impact or discharge
to a sensitive area or is located in an impact drainage area, the town may
require more stringent stormwater quantity and quality measures than detailed
in this chapter or in the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual.
      (1)   Determination of sensitive areas. Sensitive areas include highly
erodible soils, wetlands, karst areas, threatened or endangered species
habitat, outstanding waters, impaired waters, recreational waters, and surface
drinking water sources. Any discharge from a stormwater practice that is a
Class V injection well shall meet the Indiana groundwater quality standards and
be registered with U.S. EPA as required by the IDEM MS4 GP. If wetlands are
suspected on a site, a wetland delineation should be completed in accordance
with the methodology established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE). The
need for the applicant to check for the presence of threatened or endangered
species habitat will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Special terms and
conditions for development determined to impact or discharge to any sensitive
area shall be included in the stormwater permit.
      (2)   Determination of impact drainage areas.
         (a)   The following areas shall be designated as impact drainage
areas, unless good reason for not including them is presented to the town.
            1.   A floodway or floodplain as designated by the most updated
FEMA Code dealing with floodplain regulation and/or by the best available data
through IDNR.
            2.   Land within 25 feet of each bank of any ditch within the
town’s stormwater drainage system.
            3.   Land within 15 feet of the centerline of any stormwater
infrastructure or enclosed conduit within the town’s stormwater drainage
system.
            4.   Land lying within 75 feet of any regulated drain, the 75 feet
shall be measured at right angles to the physical centerline of the regulated
tile, or the top edge of each bank of an open ditch as determined by the
Johnson County Surveyor.
            5.   Land within 50 feet of a natural drainageway.
            6.   Land within the fluvial erosion hazard (FEH) corridor.
            7.   Land within the expected breach inundation zone of an existing
or proposed new dam, and areas protected from flooding by a levee.
         (b)   The town is authorized, but is not required, to classify certain
geographical areas as impact drainage areas. In determining impact drainage
areas, the town may consider such factors as topography, soil type, capacity of
existing drains, and distance from adequate drainage facility.
         (c)   Land that does not have an adequate outlet, taking into
consideration the capacity and depth of the outlet, may be designated as an
impact drainage area by the town. Special terms and conditions for development
within any impact drainage area shall be included in the stormwater permit.
(Ord. 2024-06, passed 4-9-24)
§ 158.088 CERTIFICATION OF AS-BUILT PLANS.
   This section shall apply to all projects whether the stormwater management
system or portions thereof will be dedicated to the town or retained privately.
After completion of construction of the project and before the release of
required performance assurances referenced in §
158.086 above, a professionally prepared and certified as-built set of plans
(record drawings) shall be submitted to the town for review. These as-built
plans/record drawings must be prepared and certified by the engineer of record,
i.e., the company/engineer who originally prepared the construction plans.
Additionally, a digital copy of the as-built plans (record drawings) as well as
finalized digital versions of all analyses, models, manuals, and reports that
are consistent with the as-built conditions is required in a format acceptable
to the town. These plans shall include all pertinent data relevant to the
completed stormwater drainage system and stormwater management facilities, and
shall include those required elements included in the stormwater permit
application packet obtained through the town.
(Ord. 2024-06, passed 4-9-24)
§ 158.089 POST-PROJECT MAINTENANCE BOND AND VERIFICATIONS.
   (A)   In addition to as-built plans and the certification of completion and
compliance as a condition of the release of performance assurances, the
property owner, developer, or contractor shall be required to file a three-year
maintenance bond or other acceptable guarantee with the town in an amount not
to exceed 25% of the cost of the stormwater management system located outside
the public road rights-of-way, and in a form satisfactory to the town in order
to assure that such stormwater drainage system installation was constructed
according to standards of good workmanship, that the materials used in the
construction and installation were of good quality and construction, and that
such project was constructed in accordance with the accepted plans and this
chapter. The bond or other acceptable guarantee shall be in effect for a period
of three years after the date of the release of required performance assurances
referenced in §
158.086 above. The beneficiary of all maintenance bonds shall be the town.
   (B)   Additional requirements for transfer of any applicable stormwater BMP
maintenance agreement and O and M maintenance manual to subsequent owners prior
to release of the maintenance bond is discussed in §§
158.060 through
158.064.

COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 158.100 COMPLIANCE WITH THIS CHAPTER.
   In addition to the requirements of this chapter, compliance with the
requirements set forth in the town’s land usage provisions of the town code is
also necessary. Compliance with all applicable ordinances and town code
provisions of the town as well as with applicable State of Indiana statutes and
regulations shall also be required. Unless otherwise stated, all other
specifications referred to in this chapter shall be the most recent edition
available. Violations of the requirements of this chapter are subject to the
penalties listed below.
   (A)   Violations. Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of
this chapter, the requirements of an approved stormwater management design plan
or permit, and/or the requirements of a recorded stormwater maintenance
agreement may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this
subchapter. Any such action or inaction is deemed to be a public nuisance and
may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of any of
the penalties described below shall not prevent such equitable relief.
   (B)   Warning notice. When the town finds that any person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued
hereunder, the town may serve upon that person a written warning notice,
specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting
the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution
whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of
the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the alleged
violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of
the warning notice. Nothing in this division shall limit the authority of the
town to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement
action, without first issuing a warning notice.
(Ord. 2024-06, passed 4-9-24)
§ 158.101 ENFORCEMENT OF THIS CHAPTER.
   (A)   Notice of violation.
      (1)   If the town determines that a permit applicant has failed to comply
with the terms and conditions of a permit, an approved stormwater management
design plan, a recorded stormwater management maintenance agreement, or the
provisions of this chapter, it shall issue a notice of violation to such
applicant. Where a person is engaged in activity covered by this chapter
without having first secured a permit therefore, the notice of violation shall
be served on the property owner or the responsible person in charge of the
activity being conducted on the site.
      (2)   The notice of violation shall be in the form of a written letter
that contains detailed inspection findings, notice of penalty assessed,
required remedial actions, reasonable deadlines for those remedial actions and
payment of penalty, and the date of re-inspection. The notice of violation may
be served by personal service, by certified mail, or by placement in a
conspicuous place on the property where the violation occurs and shall serve as
notice to a person that he or she has committed a violation of this chapter.
   (B)   Compensatory action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties,
and remedies authorized by this chapter, the town may impose upon a violator
alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at
compliance workshops, creek cleanup, public education, etc.
   (C)   Civil penalties for violations.
      (1)   Any person found in violation of any provision of this chapter
shall be subject to a maximum fine of $2,500 for each offense, plus costs,
damages, attorney’s fees, and expenses, including without limitation, any
federal or state penalties incurred by the town and caused by the person found
guilty of such violations. Each act of violation and each day upon which any
violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The rights and
remedies provided for in this chapter are cumulative and in addition to any
other remedies provided by law. An admission or determination of responsibility
shall not exempt the offender from compliance with the requirements of this
chapter.
      (2)   Any person who aids or abets a person in a violation of this
chapter shall be subject to the penalties provided in this section.
      (3)   For purposes of this section, subsequent offense means a violation
of the provisions of this chapter committed by the same permit applicant within
24 months of a previous violation of the same provision of this chapter for
which said person admitted responsibility or was adjudicated to be responsible.
      (4)   The town has established an enforcement response schedule that
standardizes the approach the town may take in dealing with stormwater
regulations offenses under this chapter and the associated technical standards
document. The enforcement response schedule is as noted in the following table:
Offense # Type of Response Anticipated
Offense #       Type of Response Anticipated
First offense   Written warning notice
Second offense  Notice of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit
Third offense   Notice of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit
Fourth offense  Notice of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit
Fifth offense   Compliance resolution, administrative penalty and/or site visit
Sixth offense   Administrative penalty and/or site visit
Seventh offense Administrative penalty and/or site visit
Eight offense   Litigation and administrative penalty
 
      (5)   The administrative penalties shall be assessed on a per violation,
per offense basis. The schedule of penalties is summarized in the following
table:
 
Offense #                     Penalty
Second offense                $500
Third offense                 $1,000
Fourth and subsequent offense $2,500
 
      (6)   The town reserves the right to immediately issue a maximum penalty
and pursue litigation for any violation deemed sufficiently egregious or
otherwise determined by the town to warrant a maximum penalty. The following
factors may be considered by the town in determining whether the issuance of a
maximum penalty or immediately pursuing litigation is warranted:
         (a)   Whether the person has previously violated the statute or rule
giving rise to the penalty;
         (b)   The amount of the monetary penalty as compared to the
seriousness of the violation;
         (c)   The financial resources of the person;
         (d)   The likelihood of future violations;
         (e)   Remedial measures taken by the person after the violation;
         (f)   Whether the violation was inadvertent, negligent, reckless, or
intentional; or
         (g)   Any other factor that the town determines is relevant.
   (D)   Stop-work order.
      (1)   In addition to the penalties listed above, if land disturbance
activities are conducted contrary to the provisions of this chapter or accepted
final stormwater management plans, the town may order the work stopped by
notice in writing served on any person engaged in the doing or causing of such
work to be done, and any such persons shall forthwith stop such work until
authorized by the town to proceed with the work. A stop-work order will be
posted on the site by the town, and it is unlawful for any person to remove the
notice or continue any work on the site without permission from the town. The
town may also undertake or cause to be undertaken, any necessary or advisable
protective measures to prevent violations of this chapter or to avoid or reduce
the effects of noncompliance herewith. The cost of any such protective measures
shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property upon which the work is
being done and the responsibility of any person carrying out or participating
in the work in violation of this chapter.
      (2)   Any person who neglects or fails to comply with a stop-work order
shall be fined up to $300 per day. A permit reinstatement fee may also be
assessed by the town.
      (3)   For construction projects that are operating under a SWPPP approved
by the town, if a stop-work order is issued on the grounds that the erosion and
sediment control measures included in the construction plan are not adequate,
the project site owner must be notified in writing of the inadequacies in the
erosion and sediment control measures and the project site owner has 72 hours
after receiving written notice to resolve the identified inadequacies before
the stop-work order can take effect.
      (4)   The 72-hour period to resolve identified inadequacies on a
construction project does not apply if the stop-work order is issued to a
construction project where the project site owner is creating a public health
hazard or safety hazard.
   (E)   Withhold certificate of occupancy. The town may refuse to issue a
certificate of occupancy for the building or other improvements constructed or
being constructed on the site until the applicant or other responsible person
has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has
otherwise satisfied the requirements of this chapter as determined by the town.
   (F)   Modification of permits. The town may modify any existing permit that
the violator may also have been previously granted.
   (G)   Suspension of access to the stormwater drainage system.
      (1)   Emergency cease and desist orders.
         (a)   When the town finds that any person has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or
that the person’s past violations are likely to recur, and that the person’s
violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened
discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to
present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or to the environment, the town may issue an order to the violator
directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing
the violator to immediately comply with all applicable requirements and take
such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a
continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations
and/or terminating the discharge.
         (b)   Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under
this division shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering
discharge. In the event of a discharger’s failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the emergency order, the town may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the stormwater drainage system or
waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to persons or to the
environment, including immediate termination of a facility’s water supply,
sewer connection, or other municipal utility services.
         (c)   The town may allow the person to recommence its discharge when
it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the town that the threat of
endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated
against the discharger under this chapter. A person that is responsible, in
whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall
submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful
discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the town
within five days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency
cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the violator.
      (2)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The
town may, without prior notice, suspend stormwater drainage system discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
stormwater drainage system or waters of the state if the violator fails to
comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, and the town may take
such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the stormwater
drainage system or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to persons.
      (3)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the stormwater drainage system in violation of this chapter may
have their stormwater drainage system access terminated if such termination
would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The town will notify a violator of
the proposed termination of its stormwater drainage system access. The violator
may petition the town for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an
offense if the person reinstates stormwater drainage system access to premises
terminated pursuant to this subchapter, without the prior approval of the town.
      (4)   Criminal penalties for violations. For intentional and flagrant
violations of this chapter, the town may issue a notice to the applicant or
other responsible person and the owner of the property, requiring such person
to appear in the Circuit or Superior Court of Johnson County to answer charges
for such violation. The applicant or other responsible person and the owner of
the property may also be prosecuted and subject to criminal penalties under
I.C. 13-30-10 or any successor provisions, and all other applicable state and
federal laws, and shall be subject to payment of reasonable attorney’s fees for
enforcement, costs, damages, and expenses. Each act of violation and each day
upon which any violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense.
(Ord. 2024-06, passed 4-9-24)
§ 158.102 COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION.
   (A)   In addition to any other remedies, should any owner fail to comply
with the provisions of this chapter, the town may, after giving notice and
opportunity for compliance, have the necessary work done, and the property
owner shall be required to promptly reimburse the town for all costs of such
work.
   (B)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the town from taking such other
lawful action as may be necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. All costs
connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. Costs
include, but are not limited to, repairs to the stormwater drainage system made
necessary by the violation, as well as those penalties levied by the EPA or
IDEM for violation of the town’s NPDES permit, administrative costs, attorney
fees, court costs, and other costs and expenses associated with the enforcement
of this chapter, including sampling and monitoring expenses.
   (C)   If the amount due for abatement of the violation is not paid within a
timely manner as determined by the decision of the town or by the expiration of
the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special
assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for
the amount of the assessment.
(Ord. 2024-06, passed 4-9-24)
§ 158.103 APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeal of notice of violation. Any person to whom any provision of
this chapter has been applied may appeal in writing, not later than 30 days
after the action or decision being appealed from, to the Town Council, the
action or decision whereby any such provision was so applied, except for
actions or decisions of the Town Council, which must be appealed following the
procedures found in I.C. 36-9-27-106. An appeal to the Town Council shall
identify the matter being appealed, and the basis for the appeal. The Town
Council shall consider the appeal and make a decision whereby it affirms,
rejects, or modifies the action being appealed. In considering any such appeal,
the Town Council may consider the recommendations of the town staff and the
comments of other persons having knowledge of the matter. In considering any
such appeal, the Town Council may grant a variance from the terms of this
chapter to provide relief, in whole or in part, from the action being appealed,
but only upon finding that the following requirements are satisfied:
      (1)   The application of this chapter’s provisions being appealed will
present or cause practical difficulties for a development or development site;
provided, however, that practical difficulties shall not include the need for
the developer to incur additional reasonable expenses in order to comply with
this chapter; and
      (2)   The granting of the relief requested will not substantially prevent
the achievement of the goals and purposes of this chapter, nor result in less
effective management of stormwater runoff.
   (B)   Enforcement measures after appeal. If the violation has not been
corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation,
or, in the event of an appeal, within five days of the decision of the Town
Council upholding the decision of the town, then representatives of the town
shall enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any
and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property.
It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of
any premises to refuse to allow the town or its designated representatives or
contractors to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above.

§ 159.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion
by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water
quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other
desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches
and the dredging of lakes. In addition, clearing and grading during
construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat.
   (B)   As a result, the purpose of this local regulation is to safeguard
persons, protect property, and prevent damage to the environment in town. This
chapter will also promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating, and
controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any development
or other activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the
movement of earth or land in the town.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 160.001 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   It is hereby determined that:
   (A)   Land development projects and associated increases in impervious cover
alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment
transport and deposition;
   (B)   This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-
borne pollutants; and
   (C)   Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from
development sites.
   (D)   Therefore, the town establishes this set of water quality and quantity
policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for
the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water
resources from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of stormwater
runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff
rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source
pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will
prevent threats to public health and safety.
(Ord. 2006-10, passed 11-27-06)
§ 160.002 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management
requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety,
and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction. This
chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
   (A)   Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order
to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and streambank
erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels;
   (B)   Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater
runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality;
   (C)   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows
from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the pre-
development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable;
   (D)   Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint
source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management controls and
to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no
threat to public safety.
(Ord. 2006-10, passed 11-27-06)
160.003 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   This chapter shall be applicable to all subdivision or site plan
applications, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by the Town
Council under the specifications of §§
160.040 through §
160.042 of this chapter. The chapter also applies to land development
activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such
activities are part of a larger common plan of development that meets the
following applicability criteria, even though multiple separate and distinct
land development activities may take place at different times on different
schedules. In addition, all plans must also be reviewed by local environmental
protection officials to ensure that established water quality standards will be
maintained during and after development of the site and that post construction
runoff levels are consistent with any local and regional watershed plans.
   (B)   To prevent the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff, the Town Council
has developed a set of performance standards that must be met at new
development sites. These standards apply to any construction activity
disturbing one acre or more of land. The following activities may be exempt
from these stormwater performance criteria:
      (1)   Any logging and agricultural activity which is consistent with an
approved soil conservation plan or a timber management plan prepared or
approved by the town, as applicable;
      (2)   Additions or modifications to existing single family structures;
      (3)   Developments that do not disturb more than one or more acre,
provided they are not part of a larger common development plan; or
      (4)   Repairs to any stormwater treatment practice deemed necessary by
the Town Council.
   (C)   When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a
redevelopment project as defined in §
160.007, decisions on permitting and on-site stormwater requirements shall be
governed by special stormwater sizing criteria found in the current stormwater
design manual. This criteria is dependent on the amount of impervious area
created by the redevelopment and its impact on water quality. Final
authorization of all redevelopment projects will be determined after a review
by the Town Council.
(Ord. 2006-10, passed 11-27-06)
§ 160.004 COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER PERMIT AND ORDINANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   This chapter is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other
ordinance, rule or regulation, stature, or other provision of law. The
requirements of this chapter should be considered minimum requirements, and
where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from those
imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law,
whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards
for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.
(Ord. 2006-10, passed 11-27-06)
§ 160.005 SEVERABILITY.
   If the provisions of any section, subsection, division, subdivision or
clause of this chapter shall be judged invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such order of judgment shall not affect or invalidate the
remainder of any section, subsection, division, subdivision or clause of this
chapter.
(Ord. 2006-10, passed 11-27-06)
§ 160.006 DEVELOPMENT OF A STORMWATER DESIGN MANUAL.
   (A)   The Town Council may furnish additional policy, criteria and
information including specifications and standards, for the proper
implementation of the requirements of this chapter and may provide such
information in the form of a Stormwater Design Manual.
   (B)   This manual will include a list of acceptable stormwater treatment
practices, including the specific design criteria and operation and maintenance
requirements for each stormwater practice. The manual may be updated and
expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the local review authority,
based on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring and local maintenance
experience. Stormwater treatment practices that are designed and constructed in
accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be presumed to meet the
minimum water quality performance standards.
(Ord. 2006-10, passed 11-27-06)
§ 160.007 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCELERATED EROSION. Erosion caused by development activities that exceeds
the natural processes by which the surface of the land is worn away by the
action of water, wind, or chemical action.
   APPLICANT. A property owner or agent of a property owner who has filed an
application for a stormwater management permit.
   BUILDING. Any structure, either temporary or permanent, having walls and a
roof, designed for the shelter of any person, animal, or property, and
occupying more than 100 square feet of area.
    CHANNEL. A natural or artificial watercourse with a definite bed and banks
that conducts continuously or periodically flowing water.
   DEDICATION. The deliberate appropriation of property by its owner for
general public use.

WAIVERS TO STORMWATER MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS
§ 160.040 WAIVERS FOR PROVIDING STORMWATER MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required by
this chapter, unless a written request is filed to waive this requirement.
Requests to waive the stormwater management plan requirements shall be
submitted to the Town Council for approval.
   (B)   The minimum requirements for stormwater management may be waived in
whole or in part upon written request of the applicant, provided that at least
one of the following conditions applies:
      (1)   It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely
to impair attainment of the objectives of this chapter.
      (2)   Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of
stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater management plan
that has been approved by the Town Council and the implementation of the plan
is required by local ordinance.
      (3)   Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility.
The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately
sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than
that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a legally
obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the
stormwater practice.
      (4)   The Town Council finds that meeting the minimum on-site management
requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical
characteristics of a site.
      (5)   Non-structural practices will be used on the site that reduce:
         (a)   The generation of stormwater from the site;
         (b)   The size and cost of stormwater storage; and
         (c)   The pollutants generated at the site.
      These non-structural practices are explained in detail in the current
design manual and the amount of credit available for using such practices shall
be determined by the Town Council.
   (C)   In instances where one of the conditions above applies, the Town
Council may grant a waiver from strict compliance with these stormwater
management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation measures are provided.
However, to be eligible for a variance, the applicant must demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Town Council that the variance will not result in the
following impacts to downstream waterways:
      (1)   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures;
      (2)   Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
      (3)   Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation; and
      (4)   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, property.
   (D)   Furthermore, where compliance with minimum requirements for stormwater
management is waived, the applicant will satisfy the minimum requirements by
meeting one of the mitigation measures selected by the jurisdictional
stormwater authority. Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of
an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation. These lands
should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to provide permanent
buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat;
      (2)   The creation of a stormwater management facility or other drainage
improvements on previously developed properties, public or private, that
currently lack stormwater management facilities designed and constructed in
accordance with the purposes and standards of this chapter; and
      (3)   Monetary contributions (fee-in-lieu) to fund stormwater management
activities such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland delineation
studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and macroinvertebrates,
stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species studies, hydrologic
studies, and monitoring of stormwater management practices.
(Ord. 2006-10, passed 11-27-06)
§ 160.041 FEE IN LIEU OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   (A)   Where the Town Council waives all or part of the minimum stormwater
management requirements, or where the waiver is based on the provision of
adequate stormwater facilities provided downstream of the proposed development,
the applicant shall be required to pay a fee in an amount as determined by the
Town Council.
   (B)   When an applicant obtains a waiver of the required stormwater
management, the monetary contribution required shall be in accordance with a
fee schedule (unless the developer and the stormwater authority agree on a
greater alternate contribution) established by the Town Council, and based on
the cubic feet of storage required for stormwater management of the development
in question. All of the monetary contributions shall be credited to an
appropriate capital improvements program project, and shall be made by the
developer prior to the issuance of any building permit for the development.
(Ord. 2006-10, passed 11-27-06)
§ 160.042 DEDICATION OF LAND.
   In lieu of a monetary contribution, an applicant may obtain a waiver of the
required stormwater management by entering into an agreement with the Town
Council for the granting of an easement or the dedication of land by the
applicant, to be used for the construction of an off-site stormwater management
facility. The agreement shall be entered into by the applicant and the Town
Council prior to the recording of plats or, if no record plat is required,
prior to the issuance of the building permit. The applicant shall pay for legal
review at the current hourly rate by the town's attorney.

GENERAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
§ 160.055 CRITERIA FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT.
   Unless judged by the Town Council to be exempt or granted a waiver, the
following performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at
all sites:
    (A)   All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to
control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified
design storms and reduce the generation of stormwater. These practices should
seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate
stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and
landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both
water quality and quantity.
   (B)   All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not
discharge untreated stormwater directly into a jurisdictional wetland or local
water body without adequate treatment. Where such discharges are proposed, the
impact of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be assessed using a
method acceptable to the Town Council. In no case shall the impact on
functional values be any less than allowed by the Army Corp of Engineers (ACE)
or Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) responsible for
natural resources.
   (C)   Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be maintained, by promoting
infiltration through the use of structural and non-structural methods. At a
minimum, annual recharge from the post development site shall mimic the annual
recharge from pre-development site conditions.
   (D)   For new development, structural stormwater treatment practices shall
be designed to remove 80% of the average annual post development total
suspended solids load (TSS). It is presumed that a STP complies with this
performance standard if it is:
      (1)   Sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume (WQv);
      (2)   Designed according to the specific performance criteria outlined in
the local stormwater design manual;
      (3)   Constructed properly; and
      (4)   Maintained regularly.
   (E)   To protect stream channels from degradation, a specific channel
protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the Indiana Stormwater
Quality Manual and the Indiana Handbook for Erosion Control in Developing Areas
(the "Current Stormwater Design Manual").
   (F)   Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources
(i.e., cold water fisheries, shellfish beds, swimming beaches, recharge areas,
water supply reservoirs) may be subject to additional performance criteria, or
may need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater management practices.
   (G)   Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a
stormwater pollution prevention plan, and shall file a notice of intent (NOI)
under the provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) general permit. The stormwater pollution prevention plan requirement
applies to both existing and new industrial sites.
   (H)   Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher
potential pollutant loadings, known as "hotspots", may require the use of
specific structural STPs and pollution prevention practices.
   (I)   Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the town to
determine if they are subject to additional stormwater design requirements.
   (J)   The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the Stormwater
Design Manual shall be used for sizing all stormwater management practices.
(Ord. 2006-10, passed 11-27-06)
BASIC STORMWATER MANAGEMENT DESIGN CRITERIA
§ 160.070 MINIMUM CONTROL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All stormwater management practices will be designed so that the
specific storm frequency storage volumes (e.g., recharge, water quality,
channel protection, 10 year, 100 year) as identified in the Current Stormwater
Design Manual are met, unless the Town Council grants the applicant a waiver or
the applicant is exempt from such requirements.
   (B)   In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater
control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the Town
Council reserves the right to impose any and all additional requirements deemed
necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff.
(Ord. 2006-10, passed 11-27-06)
§ 160.071 SITE DESIGN FEASIBILITY.
   (A)   Stormwater management practices for a site shall be chosen based on
the physical conditions of the site. Among the factors that should be
considered:
      (1)   Topography;
      (2)   Maximum drainage area;
      (3)   Depth to water table;
      (4)   Soils;
      (5)   Slopes;
      (6)   Terrain;
      (7)   Head; and
      (8)   Location in relation to environmentally sensitive features or
ultra-urban areas.
   (B)    Applicants shall consult the Current Stormwater Design Manual for
guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting a
stormwater management practice.
(Ord. 2006-10, passed 11-27-06)
§ 160.072 CONVEYANCE ISSUES.
   (A)   All stormwater management practices shall be designed to convey
stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction in flow
velocities. This shall include, but not be limited to:
      (1)   Maximizing of flowpaths from inflow points to outflow points;
      (2)   Protection of inlet and outfall structures;
      (3)   Elimination of erosive flow velocities;
      (4)   Providing of underdrain systems, where applicable.
   (B)   The Current Stormwater Design Manual shall provide detailed guidance
on the requirements for conveyance for each of the approved stormwater
management practices.
(Ord. 2006-10, passed 11-27-06)
§ 160.073 PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   Every stormwater treatment practice shall have an acceptable form of water
quality pretreatment, in accordance with the pretreatment requirements found in
the Current Stormwater Design Manual. Certain stormwater treatment practices,
as specified in the Stormwater Design Manual, are prohibited even with
pretreatment in the following circumstances:
   (A)   Stormwater is generated from highly contaminated source areas known as
hotspots.
   (B)   Stormwater is carried in a conveyance system that also carries
contaminated, nonstormwater discharges.
   (C)   Stormwater is being managed in a designated groundwater recharge area.
   (D)   Certain geologic conditions exist (e.g., karst) that prohibit the
proper pretreatment of stormwater.
(Ord. 2006-10, passed 11-27-06)
§ 160.074 TREATMENT/GEOMETRY CONDITIONS.
   All stormwater management practices shall be designed to capture and treat
stormwater runoff according to the specifications outlined in the Current
Stormwater Design Manual. These specifications will designate the water
quantity and quality treatment criteria that apply to an approved stormwater
management practice.
(Ord. 2006-10, passed 11-27-06)
§ 160.075 LANDSCAPING PLANS REQUIRED.
   All stormwater management practices must have a landscaping plan detailing
both the vegetation to be in the practice and how and who will manage and
maintain this vegetation. This plan must be prepared by a registered landscape
architect or soil conservation district.
(Ord. 2006-10, passed 11-27-06)
§ 160.076 MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS.
   All stormwater treatment practices shall have an enforceable operation and
maintenance agreement to ensure the system functions as designed. This
agreement will include any and all maintenance easements required to access and
inspect the stormwater treatment practices, and to perform routine maintenance
as necessary to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater treatment practice.
In addition, a legally binding covenant specifying the parties responsible for
the proper maintenance of all stormwater treatment practices shall be secured
prior to issuance of any permits for land disturbance activities.
(Ord. 2006-10, passed 11-27-06)
§ 160.077 NON-STRUCTURAL STORMWATER PRACTICES.
   The use of non-structural stormwater treatment practices is encouraged in
order to minimize the reliance on structural practices. Credit in the form of
reductions in the amount of stormwater that must be managed can be earned
through the use of non-structural practices that reduce the generation of
stormwater from the site. These non-structural practices are explained in
detail in the Current Stormwater Design Manual and applicants wishing to obtain
credit for use of nonstructural practices must ensure that these practices are
documented and remain unaltered by subsequent property owners.
(Ord. 2006-10, passed 11-27-06)
REQUIREMENTS FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN APPROVAL
§ 160.090 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN REQUIRED FOR ALL DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   No application for development will be approved unless it includes a
stormwater management plan detailing in concept how runoff and associated water
quality impacts resulting from the development will be controlled or managed.

 § 160.112 LANDSCAPING AND STABILIZATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Any area of land from which the natural vegetative cover has been
either partially or wholly cleared or removed by development activities shall
be revegetated within ten days from the substantial completion of such clearing
and construction. The following criteria shall apply to revegetation efforts:
      (1)   Reseeding must be done with an annual or perennial cover crop
accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient
coverage to control erosion until such time as the cover crop is established
over 90%of the seeded area. Replanting with native woody and herbaceous
vegetation must be accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of
sufficient coverage to control erosion until the plantings are established and
are capable of controlling erosion.
      (2)   Any area of revegetation must exhibit survival of a minimum of 75%
of the cover crop throughout the year immediately following revegetation.
Revegetation must be repeated in successive years until the minimum 75%
survival for one year is achieved.
   (B)   In addition to the above requirements, a landscaping plan must be
submitted with the final design describing the vegetative stabilization and
management techniques to be used at a site after construction is completed.
This plan will explain not only how the site will be stabilized after
construction, but who will be responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at
the site and what practices will be employed to ensure that adequate vegetative
cover is preserved. This plan must be prepared by a registered landscape
architect or by the soil conservation district, and must be approved prior to
receiving a permit.

   Prior to the issuance of any permit that has an stormwater management
facility as one of the requirements of the permit, the applicant or owner of
the site must execute a maintenance easement agreement that shall be binding on
all subsequent owners of land served by the stormwater management facility. The
agreement shall provide for access to the facility at reasonable times for
periodic inspection by the Town Council, or their contractor or agent, and for
regular or special assessments of property owners to ensure that the facility
is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and any
other provisions established by this chapter. The easement agreement shall be

the Town Council and recorded into the land record prior to final plan
approval. As part of the covenant, a schedule shall be developed for when and
how often maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater
management facility. The covenant shall also include plans for periodic
inspections to ensure proper performance of the facility between scheduled
cleanouts.
   (B)   The Town Council, in lieu of an maintenance covenant, may accept
dedication of any existing or future stormwater management facility for
maintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this chapter
and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or
otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance.
(Ord. 2006-10, passed 11-27-06)
§ 160.132 REQUIREMENTS FOR MAINTENANCE COVENANTS.
   All stormwater management facilities must undergo, at the minimum, an annual

the requirements of this chapter and accomplishment of its purposes. These
needs may include; removal of silt, litter and other debris from all catch
basins, inlets and drainage pipes, grass cutting and vegetation removal, and
necessary replacement of landscape vegetation. Any maintenance needs found must
be addressed in a timely manner, as determined by the Town Council, and the
inspection and maintenance requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to
ensure proper functioning of the stormwater management facility.

§ 160.133 INSPECTION OF STORMWATER FACILITIES.
   Inspection programs may be established on any reasonable basis, including
but not limited to: routine inspections; random inspections; inspections based
upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; inspection of drainage
basins or areas identified as higher than typical sources of sediment or other
contaminants or pollutants; inspections of businesses or industries of a type
associated with higher than usual discharges of contaminants or pollutants or
with discharges of a type which are more likely than the typical discharge to
cause violations of state or federal water or sediment quality standards or the
NPDES stormwater permit; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting
under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not
limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges,
surface water, groundwater, and material or water in drainage control
facilities; and evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities and
other stormwater treatment practices.

and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This includes the
right to enter a property when it has a reasonable basis to believe that a
violation of this chapter is occurring or has occurred, and to enter when
necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a violation of
this chapter.

request.
(Ord. 2006-10, passed 11-27-06)
§ 160.136 FAILURE TO MAINTAIN PRACTICES.
   If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the
maintenance covenant, the Town Council, after reasonable notice, may correct a
violation of the design standards or maintenance needs by performing all
necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. In the event
that the stormwater management facility becomes a danger to public safety or
public health, the Town Council shall notify the party responsible for
maintenance of the stormwater management facility in writing. Upon receipt of
that notice, the responsible person shall have 15 days to effect maintenance
and repair of the facility in an approved manner. After proper notice, the Town
Council may assess the owner(s) of the facility for the cost of repair work and
any penalties; and the cost of the work shall be a lien on the property, or
prorated against the beneficial users of the property, and may be placed on the
tax bill and collected as ordinary taxes by the county.
