office in which the act is to be done is closed during regular business hours,
then the act may be done on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, a
Sunday, a legal holiday, or a day on which the office is closed.
('67 Code, § 1.04)
      (2)   When a public office in which an act required by law is to be

passage date, the conflict shall be construed so as to be consistent with the
meaning or legal effect of the subject matter taken as a whole.
§ 10.09 SEVERABILITY.

any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect

the regulations of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1983, as required

accomplishment of the objectives of this program with respect to handicapped

recipient government if both departments are subject to common administrative
control or are agencies of the same recipient government.
(Res. 23-1984, passed 10-15-84)
§ 36.16 PROVISION OF AUXILIARY AIDS.
   The city shall, at the request of, and in consultation with a qualified

(Res. 23-1984, passed 10-15-84)
§ 36.17 EMPLOYMENT POLICIES.

individual, the city asserts that it shall:
   (A)   Not discriminate against a qualified handicapped individual in
employment in any program or activity;
   (B)   Not participate in a contractual or other relationship that has the
effect of subjecting a qualified handicapped applicant or employee to

demonstrated that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the
operation of program or activity. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION may include:
      (1)   Making facilities used by employees readily accessible to and
usable by handicapped persons, and
      (2)   Job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules,
acquisition or modification of equipment or devices (for example:

readers or qualified sign language interpreters, and other similar actions.
Accommodations shall be made in consultation with the handicapped individual.
The determination of whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on
the operation of a program or activity shall be made on a case-by-case basis

number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget;
         (b)   The type, composition, and structure of the specific program or
activity and the structure of the workforce required; and
         (c)   The nature and cost of the accommodation needed. Such reasonable
accommodation may require more than an insignificant economic cost in making
allowance for the handicap of a qualified applicant or employee and to accept
minor inconvenience which does not bear on the ability of the handicapped
individual to perform the essential functions of the job in question.
   (G)   Not deny any employment opportunity to a qualified handicapped
employee or applicant if the basis for the denial is the need to make
reasonable accommodation to the physical or mental limitations of the employee
or applicant.
   (H)   Not use any employment test, selection criterion, or policy that
screens out or tends to screen out from consideration for employment, a
handicapped individual or any class of handicapped individuals unless:
      (1)   The test, selection criterion, or policy as used by the recipient,
is shown to be directly related to the essential functions of the position in
question, and
      (2)   Alternative job-related tests, criteria, or policies that do not
screen out or tend to screen out as many handicapped individuals are shown to
be not available.
   (I)   Select and administer tests using procedures (for example, auxiliary
aids such as readers for visually- impaired individuals or qualified sign
language interpreters for hearing- impaired individuals) that accommodate the
special problems of handicapped individuals to the fullest extent consistent
with the objectives of the test. The test results shall accurately reflect the
applicant's or employee's ability to perform the essential functions of the job
in question, rather than the applicant's or employee's impaired sensory,
manual, or speaking skills, except where such skills are essential requirements
of the job.
   (J)   Not conduct a preemployment medical examination or make preemployment
inquiry of an applicant as to whether the applicant is a handicapped individual
or as to the nature or the severity of a handicap. But may make preemployment
inquiry into an applicant's ability to perform the essential functions of the
job.

unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   “CAPITAL ASSET.” Land, improvements to land easements, buildings, building
improvements, vehicles, machinery, equipment, works of art and historical
treasures, and all other tangible assets that are used in operations and have
initial useful lives extending beyond a single reporting period.
   “INFRASTRUCTURE ASSET.” Long lived capital assets that normally are
stationary in nature and normally can be preserved for a significantly greater
number of years than most capital assets. Examples include roads, bridges,
stormwater systems, sewer systems, and lighting systems.
(Ord. 10, 2022, passed 12-5-22)
§ 41.02 CAPITALIZATION THRESHOLD AND INVENTORY.
   (A)   To be considered a capital asset for financial reporting purposes, an
item must be at or above the capitalization threshold and have a unit
historical cost of $20,000 or more. With regard to improvements to buildings
and improvements to infrastructure, the expenditure must be at a historical
cost of $20,000 or more; however, repairs and most renovations will be expensed
in the current year. This capitalization threshold is to be applied
prospectively starting January 1, 2022. Regarding land, including rights of
way, all land shall be capitalized at the time of the acquisition. If donated,
it shall be recorded at its acquisition value. All vehicles, regardless of
historical cost or acquisition value, will be capitalized.

of a unit historical cost of $5,000. These assets will also be indicated as
federally funded within the property record for audit purposes.
   (C)   The Clerk Treasurer will ensure that accounting for capital assets is
being exercised by establishing a capital asset inventory, both initially and
periodically in subsequent years. The Clerk Treasurer will further ensure that
the capital asset report will be updated annually to reflect additions,
retirements, and transfers and to reflect the new, annual capital asset
balance.
(Ord. 10, 2022, passed 12-5-22)
§ 41.03 ASSETS BELOW THE CAPITAL THRESHOLD.

stewardship of property (above and in selected instances below the

head of the operating department utilizing the property.
   (B)   For maintenance of the capital asset accounting report, the various
heads of the operating departments have the responsibility to report additions,
retirements, and transfers in detail to the Clerk Treasurer. Details shall
include such data elements as asset description, location, make, model, serial
number, date of acquisition, cost, trade in, or disposal price received, and
any other information that assists control or is deemed relevant.
   (C)   Further, these items below the capitalization threshold, but
considered sensitive may include, but not limited to, weapons, radios,
computers, printers, chain saws, small motor equipment, and powertools. These
minor but sensitive items shall be the responsibility of the departments
utilizing them.

(Ord. 8-2004, passed 12-6-04)
§ 50.097 SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
   (A)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The city
may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or
to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United
States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an
emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or Waters of the United States, or to minimize
danger to persons.
   (B)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this ordinance may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
city will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The
violator may petition the city for a reconsideration and hearing. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated
pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the city.

activity.
   (B)   Access to facilities.
      (1)   The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this subchapter as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this subchapter. If a discharger has security measures in force
which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the city.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the city ready access to all parts
of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
      (3)   The city shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility
such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the city to conduct monitoring
and/or sampling of the facility's storm water discharge.
      (4)   The city has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected arid/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this
subchapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to
discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if
the person denies the city reasonable access to the permitted facility for the

§ 50.201 PROVISIONS FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Title. These regulations shall hereafter be known and cited as the
Stormwater Utility Ordinance of the City of Beech Grove, Indiana.
   (B)   Stormwater Utility operation. The City of Beech Grove shall operate
its Stormwater Utility under provisions of IC 8-1.5-5, which enables an Indiana
municipality to establish a stormwater management district. General Ordinance
No. 1, 2006, an Ordinance of the Common Council of the City of Beech Grove,
Indiana Electing to Withdrawal from the Marion County Stormwater Management
District and Establish the City of Beech Grove Stormwater Management District,
was adopted by the Common Council on October 2, 2006. The Stormwater Utility is
responsible for the operation, maintenance and management of the public
stormwater facilities and will fund stormwater management activities by
charging user fees to the owner of each property containing impervious surface
area within the corporate limits of the City of Beech Grove.
   (C)   Policies and procedures. Policies and procedures have been established
for the Beech Grove Stormwater Utility for determining impervious surface area,
establishing the Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) and multiplier for
stormwater users, billing and collection, and the stormwater user fee credit
process. The Policy and Procedures Manual shall be adopted by the Board of
Public Works and Safety.
   (D)   Assessment of user fees. All residential properties will be charged a
uniform user fee. User fees for non-residential properties will be based upon
the amount of impervious surface area contained within the property. The amount
of impervious surface area for each non-residential property has been
determined based upon measurements using aerial photography and field
measurements. Public right-of-way is exempt from the user fee.
   (F)   Compliance with other ordinances, statutes, and regulations. User fees
do not relieve any property owner from compliance with the City of Beech Grove,
City of Indianapolis, Marion County, or other applicable state and federal
ordinances, laws, and regulations.
(Ord. 2, 2014, passed 5-5-14)
§ 50.202 STORMWATER USER FEES.
   (A)   Calculation of stormwater fees. The fee per one Equivalent Residential
User (ERU) shall be $3.75.
   (B)   Residential stormwater user fee. The monthly user fee is uniform for
all residential properties (as defined in the Policy and Procedures Manual)
which are assigned one ERU.
   (C)   Non-residential stormwater user fee. The monthly user fee for a non-
residential property (as defined in the Policy and Procedures Manual) is
determined using an ERU multiplier, which is calculated by dividing the total
impervious surface area within the property by the base ERU of 2,620 square
fect. This method allows for the non-residential property user fees to be based
upon the amount of impervious surface area within the property as compared to
the amount of impervious surface area of the average residential property. The
ERU multiplier shall be rounded to one decimal place, and the minimum ERU shall
be one. The ERU multiplier is then multiplied by the current user fee for one
ERU to determine the actual user fee in dollars.
(Ord. 2, 2014, passed 5-5-14; Am. Ord. 1, 2018, passed 4-2-18)
§ 50.203 BILLING AND COLLECTION OF STORMWATER USER FEES.
   (A)   Billing. A database has been developed consisting of each property
owner’s/renter’s name, property address, property’s square footage of
impervious surface area, user fee multiplier and monthly user fee. Charges for
stormwater service shall be billed by and through Beech Grove Utilities on the
monthly utility bill and with the implementing of related policies.
   (B)   Delinquent payments. The procedure for delinquent payments shall be as
described in § 50.085 and IC 36-9-23-31 through 36-9-23-34.
   (C)   Application of stormwater user fees to improvements. All stormwater
user lees collected pursuant to this subchapter shall be utilized for
stormwater management activities; stormwater drainage improvements and
maintenance, including debt service for such improvements; personnel to
collect, account for, and deliver the user fees; and personnel and equipment to
perform storm water management activities, ensure compliance with related
regulations and install and maintain stormwater improvements.
(Ord. 2, 2014, passed 5-5-14)

owner, his agent or representative, and the expense and result of removal and
storage shall be borne by the owner, his agent, or representative for the use
and benefit of the city, or of the person who operates or has charge of the
garage or other storage place, whether public or private, unless otherwise
ordered by a judge of the court, after a hearing.
('67 Code, § 71.03(C))
   (C)   Removal, impounding, and storage of a vehicle, pursuant to this
chapter's provisions, shall in no way supersede, bar, excuse, or prevent a
prosecution of any person or in any way relieve him from the penalty prescribed
for his violation of this code or any other city ordinance or state law, for
the violation of which the vehicle has been removed, impounded, and stored, but
remedies and penalties are declared to be distinct and separate as means of
enforcing obedience to this code.
('67 Code, § 75.16(D))
(Ord. 10-1964, passed 9-21-64)
Penalty, see § 75.99
§ 75.03 HEARING.
   (A)   (1)   Refusal to pay impounding costs; affidavit. Whenever an owner,
his agent, or representative fails or refuses to pay expenses of removal and
storage of a vehicle impounded, in addition to and separate from the penalty
incurred by him, the police officer discovering the vehicle parked or left
standing, illegally, shall file or cause to be filed, in any court having
jurisdiction, an affidavit charging the owner, his agent, or representative
with the committed offense. The person so charged shall be cited to appear on a
certain day and hour to answer and stand trial upon the charge. The police
officer shall be present and assist in the prosecution of the charge.
      (2)   Pending a hearing upon the charge, the owner, his agent, or
representative may obtain possession of the impounded vehicle by filing a bond
with the clerk of the court of $25, or in another reasonable sum fixed by the
judge of the court, conditioned upon the appearance of the owner, his agent or
representative before the court at the day and hour set for trial, to answer
the charge in the affidavit.
      (3)   In the event the judge finds the vehicle to have been parked
illegally, the judge shall, in all instances, not only assess the penalty
prescribed herein, or by law for the violation, but in addition thereto, shall
determine and assess against the defendant whatever amount, within the limits
prescribed by this chapter, the judge finds from the evidence is a fair and
equitable reimbursement to the city or other persons, for the removal expense
and for impounding and storage of the vehicle. However, in no event, shall the
sum assessed for impounding be more than the maximum amount in this chapter,
but the charge shall be additional to the assessment of the reasonable charges
for the storage of the vehicle, not exceeding the storage charges herein
provided for.
   (B)   Returning car to owner. In the event that the judge finds from the
evidence that the vehicle was not parked or left standing in violation of any
provisions of this code, or other ordinance or statute, as charged in the
affidavit, the judge shall order the car restored to the owner, agent or
representative without any penalty or the assessment of any charges made
against him.

Penalty, see § 75.99
§ 75.04 TOWING AND IMPOUNDING CHARGES.
   Impounding and storing vehicle. Independent of, and in addition to the
remedy, action, and assessment of any penalty provided for such violations, the
officer may order and effect the removal of the vehicle from the street or
other public place and may cause it to be impounded and stored, as provided for
in this chapter, and any action against or charges assessed against or paid by
or for the person as a result of impounding and storage shall be wholly
distinct from and independent of any offense and penalty which may be assessed
against and paid by or for the person.
('67 Code, § 71.03(B))
(Ord. 10-1964, passed 9-21-64)
§ 75.05 PAYMENT OF FINE WITHIN 48 HOURS.
   Any person receiving a notice authorized by this chapter shall pay a fine of
$5, payable at the office of the Clerk-Treasurer within 48 hours from the time
the notice is attached to the vehicle or served upon the person in charge of
the vehicle. If the fine is not paid within 48 hours, the officer shall
initiate prosecution by affidavit in the appropriate court, in which case
prescribed penalties shall be in full force and applicable. Each notice shall
constitute a separate and distinct offense and each violation shall also
constitute a separate offense.
('67 Code, § 71.06) (Ord. 10-1964, passed 9-21-64)
§ 75.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, whoever violates any
provisions of this chapter shall be fined not more than $200.
   (B)   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter, and whose vehicle
(including taxicabs and public buses) has been impounded, towed in, and stored
pursuant to this chapter's provisions, in addition to and independent of the
payment of all aforesaid costs and charges incurred by the tow-in, impounding
and storage, shall be fined not less than $1 nor more than $100. Each violation
shall constitute a separate offense in addition to any separate charges
incurred by reason of each separate offense.

drive or operate motor vehicles by the state at the office of the Clerk-
Treasurer within five days, by the hour of 12:00 noon, legal time, for the

or of space reserved for the city's use on poles belonging to others shall
create or vest in the company ownership or property rights in the poles, but

potential liability under this subchapter;
   (B)   Has proceeded with reasonable diligence in the prosecution of the
eviction proceedings;
   (C)   If any eviction proceedings are not completed within 30 days by reason
of court ordered delays in such proceedings, the person charged with a

any such eviction proceeding;

evidence in support of the eviction action.

INVESTIGATIONS AND INSPECTIONS
§ 150.045 BUILDING COMMISSIONER TO INVESTIGATE AND INSPECT.
   The Building Commissioner or his authorized representative may at any
reasonable time go in, upon, around, or about the premises where any structure
or building equipment subject to the provisions of this chapter or to the rules
of the Indiana Department of Fire and Building Safety, is located (irrespective
of whether a building permit has been or is required to be obtained) for the
purpose of investigation and inspection of such structure or building
equipment. Such investigation and inspection may be made either before or after
construction activity on the project is completed and it may be made for the
purposes, among others, of determining whether the structure or building
equipment meets building standards and procedures, and ascertaining whether the
construction activity and procedures have been accomplished in a manner
consistent with a certificate filed pursuant to §
150.035,
150.036,
150.037 or
150.048(B)(2). Reasonable efforts to afford an opportunity for investigation
and inspection of the structure or building equipment by the Building
Commissioner shall be made by persons owning property or working on or having
control of the construction activity.
   (B)   However, nothing in this section shall be construed to require the
Building Commissioner to make inspections and investigations.
(Ord. 29-1977, passed 10-17-77; Am. Ord. 4-1996, passed 4-15-96)
§ 150.046 PERMITTEE TO GIVE NOTICE OF AVAILABILITY OF INSPECTION.
   (A)   Whenever a stage of construction activity is reached which is
designated below, the person who applied for the building permit (or if it is
impossible or would impose a substantial hardship for the applicant, the
person, partnership, or corporation which obtained the permit) shall be under a
duty to give appropriate notice to the Building Commissioner that the
construction activity is available for inspection.
      (1)   Relative to the construction of, remodeling of or addition to a
structure, notice of availability is required, as applicable, for:
         (a)   A foundation inspection after poles or piers are set, trenches
or basement areas excavated, any required reinforcing steel is in place, but
prior to the placing of concrete and
         (b)   A frame and masonry inspection after the roof, masonry, all
framing, firestopping, and bracings are in place and all electrical wiring,
pipes, chimneys, and vents are complete, but prior to the interior covering of
walls.
      (2)   Relative to the installation, modernization or replacement of
building equipment (including, but not limited to plumbing work for which
licensure is required by the State Plumbing Commission, or work on electrical
power distribution systems, heating systems, space heating equipment, cooling
systems, or space cooling equipment), notice of availability for a separate
rough inspection is required, as applicable, for each of the three crafts after
installation, but prior to the covering or concealment thereof and before
fixtures are set.
      (3)   Relative to demolition or removal of a structure, notice of
availability for a fill inspection is required (in the instance when a basement
or subgrade chamber exists) after demolition or removal and prior to placing
fill.
      (4)   The Building Commissioner or his authorized representative may
relative to any construction activity add a reasonable number of other
construction stages by communicating the additional stage requirements to the
person obtaining the building permit for that construction activity.
   (B)   Notice of availability shall be given either by telephone
communication over a specified telephone line in the office of the Building
Commissioner (to which may be attached a recording device to make a record of
all information supplied), by hand-delivered written notice, or by a letter
delivered by the United States postal service.
(Ord. 29-1977, passed 10-17-77)
§ 150.047 CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY TO BE AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION.
   (A)   Whenever a stage of construction activity designated in § 150.046 is
reached, no person shall take any action or accomplish any additional
construction activity which would substantially impede the opportunity of the
Building Commissioner or his authorized representative to inspect that stage of
construction activity for a period of at least 48 hours after notice of the
availabil-ity for inspection has been received during business hours of the
Building Commissioner or until after an inspection is made, whichever first
occurs. The 48-hour period shall begin to run upon actual receipt of the notice
during business hours but shall not run during any day when an inspection
attempt by a representative of the Building Commissioner is unsuccessful
because the work is not accessible.
   (B)   A person, partnership, or corporation may, however, pour a foundation
four hours after notification is received in the office of the Building
Commissioner. If a foundation is so poured, the remainder of the excavation
must remain open for a period of 48 hours from the time when notice is received
and the person, partnership, or corporation must assist an inspector in making
the excavation available for proper inspection.

§ 150.048 CONNECTION, PROVISION, OR USE OF ELECTRIC POWER.
   (A)   No person, partnership, or corporation shall accomplish or allow the
connection, provision, or use of electrical power relative to an electrical
power distribution system in or on a structure where construction activity (for
which a building permit has been or is required to be obtained pursuant to this
chapter) has been accomplished, until after an inspection has been made and a
distinctive sticker (signifying the electrical power distribution system may be
used) has been attached to each service equipment by the Building Commissioner
or his authorized representative. It shall be unlawful for any person other the
Building Commissioner or his authorized representative to use, complete, apply,
or alter such sticker.
   (B)   As an alternative to division (A) above, the Building Commissioner may
allow the connection, provision, or use of electrical power on the basis of
certification by a person who is a licensed electrical contractor if all of the
following requirements are met:
      (1)   After the completion of the work and before use of the electrical
power distribution system is initiated, the licensed electrical contractor who
applied for the building permit shall communicate over a specified telephone
line in the office of the Building Commissioner during business hours (to which
the Building Commissioner may attach a recording device to make a record of all
information supplied) the following information:
         (a)   The name of the person telephoning.
         (b)   The electrical contractor license number of the person
telephoning.
         (c)   The address of the affected premises.
         (d)   The building permit number under which the construction activity
was accomplished.
         (e)   The serial number of the electrical craft work certificate of
completion and compliance form to be used.
      (2)   If such information is in order and if the licensed electrical
contractor has accomplished construction activity for a period of the preceding
12 calendar months without violation of building standards or procedures which
in the discretion of the Building Commissioner are of sufficient seriousness to
make the contractor ineligible to use the certificate, the Building
Commissioner shall indicate over the specified telephone line authorization to
attach a certificate to each service equipment and assign an authorization
number to be placed on each certificate by the licensee.
         (3)   (a)   A certificate, in the following form, must then be
executed and attached to each service equipment as a precondition to the
connection, provision, or use of electrical power:
   ELECTRICAL CRAFT WORK CERTIFICATE
   OF COMPLETION AND COMPLIANCE
   Address of the craft work:
   Serial Number:
   Permit Number:
   Authorization Number:
   The undersigned licensee hereby certifies under the penalties for perjury
that:
      (1)   I am an electrical contractor licensed in accordance with Chapter
150 of the Code of Beech Grove.
      (2)   I am responsible for the proper completion of the construction
activity which is the subject of the above referenced building permit as
applicant for the permit or applicant representing the transferee of the
permit, and
      (3)   I have either personally accomplished or personally inspected all
such construction activity or, in the alternative, I have caused the
construction activity to be inspected by a responsible and competent employee
who works under my direction and control, who has fully reported to me the
condition of the construction activity, and
      (4)   I know that such construction activity is completed and in
condition for immediate and final inspection on the date stated below, and
      (5)   I am familiar with the building standards and procedures applicable
to such construction activity, and
      (6)   I know that such construction activity has been done in compliance
with all building standards and procedures, and
      (7)   I acknowledge and understand that if such construction activity is
done in violation of building standards and procedures, that under the
provisions of Chapter 150 my electrical contractor's license may be suspended
or revoked.
   Date certificate attached to service equipment
   Signature:
   Electrical Contractor License Number:
   Typed or printed name.
         (b)   After the signator attaches a certificate to each service
equipment, he shall cause a duplicate copy of each certificate to be either
delivered to the Building Commissioner or postmarked no later than the next
business day by the United States Postal Service.
      (4)   After completion of the above requirements, the Building
Commissioner will notify the electric utility that electrical power can be
connected and used at the site.
   (C)   It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, or corporation to
accomplish the connection, provision, or use of electrical power relative to an
electrical power distribution system without first receiving authorization from
the Building Commissioner either by telephone communication and attachment of
an electrical craft work certificate of completion and compliance or by the
distinctive sticker described in division (A) hereof.
   (D)   Nothing stated in this section shall be construed to deny the right of
the Building Commissioner to inspect the electrical power distribution system
to which electrical power is connected either before or after such connection
is made or before or after the electrical power distribution system is used.
   (E)   Electrical craft work certificates of completion and compliance may be
purchased only by a licensed electrical contractor who is eligible to use such
form from the Building Commissioner acting on behalf of the Clerk-Treasurer,
for a fee specified in §§
150.065 through
150.077 of this chapter. Each certificate form shall bear a different
serialized number which shall be recorded by the Building Commissioner along
with the name and license number of the electrical contractor who purchases the
form. The certificate may only be signed and attached by the licensed
electrical contractor who purchased it from Building Commissioner. It shall be
unlawful to sell or transfer such certificate and unlawful to use, complete,
sign, or attach such certificate except as prescribed by this section.

Pollution Control.
   (C)   No open fires or other sources of flame except necessary cutting
torches are permitted on the inside of the structure which is being wrecked, or
in close proximity to flammable materials located outside the structure, and
every reasonable precaution shall be taken to prevent the possibility of fire.
   (D)   Suitable provisions shall be made for the disposal of materials which
are accumulated during the wrecking of a structure.
   (E)   The buildings, foundations, curbs, sidewalks, concrete or asphalt

a new structure is to be commenced within 90 days, the ground need not be
leveled until all such work on the premises is completed.
   (G)   Material used for fill or grading shall be only material that can be
properly compacted in order to avoid future settlement of earth fill-in or the
structure erected over such fill. No pieces of stone, lumber, boards, or other
material which due to their size or character would prevent proper compacture
or would cause later settlement of the surface shall be used in such fill.
   (H)   When a structure is wrecked and an excavation which at any point is
eight or more feet below grade level is left unfilled, the fence portion of the
walkway required by §
150.095(B) shall remain at the site. However, the Building Commissioner may
approve a fence that does not meet the standards of §
150.095 (B) so long as it is sufficient to prevent persons, especially
children, from falling into the excavation.

the free passage from one part of the roof to any other part thereof or so as
to interfere with the openings in the roof; and no sign that is placed upon the
roof of any building shall project beyond the outer edge of the wall of such
building in any direction. All roof signs shall be so constructed as to leave a
clear space of not less than four feet between the roof level and the lowest
part of the sign. Every roof sign shall be set back at least three feet from
the face of any side, front or rear wall; and, if the sign is illuminated,
overhead lighting reflectors may project six feet beyond the building line, but
in no case shall the reflector be more than six feet from the sign which it is
designed to illuminate.
   (B)   All roof signs shall be entirely of incombustible material, including
the uprights, supports and braces thereof, except ornamental molding and
battens behind the steel facings and decorative latticework may be of wooden
construction. All roof signs shall be constructed as to withstand a wind
pressure of not less than 30 pounds per square foot of superficial area subject
to such pressures, and when erected upon a building, the roof of which is not
constructed of fireproof material, all bearing plates of the sign shall bear
directly or indirectly upon the masonry walls thereof or upon steel girders or
metal columns which are of sufficient strength to withstand the live and dead
load stresses of the roof sign.

feet above the roof level at any point; and no roof sign with a tight, closed,
or solid surface shall be erected on fireproof buildings to a height of not
exceeding 75 feet above the roof level and upon nonfireproof buildings to a
height not exceeding 50 feet above the roof level. The solid portions of such
structures shall not exceed 40% of the superficial area thereof. All such signs
which are erected on the roof of a fireproof building shall be thoroughly
secured to the building upon which they are installed, erected, or constructed
by iron or metal anchors, bolts, supports, chains, stranded cables, steel rods,
or braces. All roof signs erected on nonfireproof buildings shall be so erected
that the live and dead load stresses shall not in any way affect the building,
but the sign shall be carried on steel girders and columns that will resist any
stresses due to the wind pressure and load of the signs. The sign shall be
thoroughly secured and anchored by iron or metal anchors, bolts, supports,
chains, standard cables, steel rods, or braces.
   (D)   Every roof sign and all the supports, braces, guys, and anchors
thereof shall be kept in repair, and unless galvanized or noncorroding material

character, shall be installed in accordance with the following rules:
   (A)   Every electrical sign shall be constructed so as to secure ample
strength and rigidity, and shall have the receptacles so designed as to afford
permanent and reliable means to prevent possible turning. The electrical signs
shall be designed and constructed so that terminals will be at least 1/2-inch
from each other and from the metal of the sign, except that in open work this
distance shall be increased to one inch. Electrical signs shall be of
weatherproof construction and so constructed as to enclose all terminals and
wiring except the supply leads. Transformers, unless of the weatherproof type,
cutouts, flashers, and other similar devices shall be placed in a separate,
completely enclosed, accessible weatherproof box or cabinet made of metal not
less than the thickness of the sign itself, or enclosed in approved cutout
boxes or cabinets. Each compartment shall have suitable provisions for drainage
through one or more holes not less than one-quarter of an inch in diameter.
Miniature receptacles will not be approved for use in outdoor advertising
displays. In every electrical sign, the wiring shall be neatly run and made
mechanically secure and all connections shall be thoroughly soldered and all
exposed parts treated to prevent corrosion. Where sign wiring passes through
walls or partitions within the sign itself, the wiring shall be protected by
standard bushings. In signs where receptacles maintain the wire one inch from
any surface, the receptacles may be placed as much as 12 inches apart without
any other support for the wire. Where the receptacles are more than one foot
apart and less than two feet apart, one additional noncombustible,
nonabsorptive insulator shall be placed halfway between each two adjacent
receptacles to maintain the wire in position. Except as specified above, wires
shall be kept at least 2-1/2 inches apart for voltage up to 300 and four inches
apart for voltages over 300. Wires on the outside of the body of the sign shall
be in standard conduits, with all fittings of approved weatherproof type.
   (B)   Signs constructed with separate letters on metal screens or other
supported structures, and all signs, whether permanent or temporary, whose
sections are widely separated from each other shall be completely wired in
conduit except when, in the opinion of the Building Commissioner, other methods
may be used, but when they are exposed to the weather, the boxes shall be of
cast metal or hot galvanized sheet metal. Cabinets, cutout boxes, and fittings
shall be provided with threaded connections for the reception of the conduits
which enter them. Junction boxes shall be gasketed and made watertight with a
conduit arranged for drainage. Locknuts and bushings will not be approved for
conduit work when they are exposed to the weather.
   (C)   Leads from the electrical sign shall pass through the walls of the
sign and also through either standard metal conduit and armored cable, or one
or more standard, noncombustible, nonabsorbing bushing. Main feeding signs
shall be calculated for a capacity of the total connected load, figuring at
least ten watts for each receptacle. Exterior signs may be connected to
interior lighting circuits when the total load does not exceed 660 watts, but
no sign may be connected to a show window circuit. Outside signs shall be
controlled by accessible switches which shall cut off entirely all wires to the
sign. All metal electric signs shall be thoroughly grounded.
   (D)   All electrically illuminated signs shall bear the approving label of
any nationally recognized testing laboratory.
   (E)   When any sign is illuminated, the electrical work shall be done by a
licensed electrician.
   (F)   Signs cannot be wired with BX, but must be wired with conduit.

interest in real estate on which construction activity has occurred may,
through counsel, bring an action against the bond for expenses necessary to
complete construction activity or correct code deficiencies therein after
written notice of the code deficiency has been given to the contractor and
after the contractor is given a reasonable opportunity to complete or correct
performance. If such a person, partnership, or corporation prevails in any
action brought under this section, he may also be allowed by the court to
recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs
and expenses (including attorney fees based on actual time expended) determined
by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the plaintiff for or in
connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action, unless the
court in its discretion shall determine that such an award of attorneys fees
would be inappropriate.

partnership, or corporation so penalized shall be required to replenish,
maintain, and satisfy the statutory amount required by applicable provision of
this chapter.

buildings of similar structure, purpose, or location without exceeding the
working stresses permitted for such buildings.

to such an extent that walls or other structural portions have materially less
resistance to winds or earthquakes than is required in the case of similar new
construction.
