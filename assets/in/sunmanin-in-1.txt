CHARITABLE DONATIONS
§ 33.155  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DONATION. Includes donations, contributions and gifts.
   RESTRICTED DONATIONS. Those to which the donor has attached terms,
conditions, or purposes. Income or revenues in the form of tax distributions,
tax receipts, fees, rentals, contractual payments, and the like, are not to be
considered donations.
   UNRESTRICTED DONATIONS. Those to which the donor has not attached terms,
conditions, or purposes.
(Ord. 2020-12, passed 12-17-2020)
§ 33.156  DONATION PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The Town Council has the option and responsibility to either accept or
reject, in writing, any proposed donation. If the donation is a restricted
donation, the Council must agree, in writing, to the terms, conditions, or
purposes attached to the proposed donation. Restricted donations can only be
accepted for purposes within the scope of general statutory authority.
   (B)   Donations which are accepted must be handled in the following manner.
      (1)   Unrestricted donations shall be receipted into the Town General
Fund. Expenditure of such donated revenue from the operating fund shall be made
only after an appropriation has been provided for the purpose of the
expenditure. Claims must be filed and approved in the regular legal manner.
      (2)   A restricted donation shall be placed into a separate fund after
such fund is established by the Council. Any appropriate descriptive name may
be given the donation fund. The donation can be expended only for the purpose
and under the terms and conditions agreed to on accepting the donation.
         (a)   Pursuant to Attorney General Official Opinion No. 68 of 1961, no
further appropriation is required for expenditure of a restricted donation for
the designated purpose. Even though no further appropriation is required,
claims must be filed and approved in the regular legal manner before
disbursements can be made from the fund.
         (b)   If the volume of restricted donations justifies it, a “control”
fund may be established for all restricted donations. Separate, individual
accounts would then be established to account for each restricted donation or
each type of restricted donation. The total activities of the separate
accounts: receipts, disbursements, balances,  should be reflected on the
control fund.
         (c)   Income from investments of restricted donations should be
receipted into the same fund in which the principal of the donation has been
receipted, provided it is to be used for the same purpose as the principal.
However, if under the terms of the donation agreement, the principal must be
held in trust in perpetuity and only the income used by the town, there should
be two funds established. One fund should be designated as “trust interest.” In
this situation, expenditures would only be permitted from the Trust Interest
(Income) Fund.
(Ord. 2020-12, passed 12-17-2020)
§ 33.157  CUSTODIAN OF DONATIONS.
   The Town Clerk-Treasurer shall be the custodian of donations received by the
town.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND NEPOTISM POLICY
§ 35.001  GENERALLY.
   (A)   The town finds that it is necessary and desirous to adopt a policy of
conduct with regard to nepotism in the employment with the town and in
contracting with the town in order to continue to be able to provide local
government services to its residents and to comply with the new laws effective
July 1, 2012, known as I.C. 36-1-20.2 and 36-1-21, respectively.
   (B)   On July 1, 2012, the town shall have a nepotism and a contracting with
a unit policy that complies with the minimum requirements of I.C. 36-1-20.2
(hereinafter “nepotism policy”) and I.C. 36-1-21 (hereinafter “contracting with
a unit by a relative policy”) and implementation will begin.
   (C)   The town nepotism policy is hereby established effective July 1, 2012
by adopting the minimum requirements provisions of I.C. 36-1-20.2, and
including all future supplements and amendments thereto which become law from
time to time, and making them a part hereof as if fully set out herein. In
addition, a copy of I.C. 36-1-20.2 in effect on July 1, 2012 and is attached to
Ordinance 2012-1.
   (D)   The town contracting with a unit by a relative policy is hereby
established effective July 1, 2012 by adopting the minimum requirements
provisions of I.C. 36-1-21, and including all future supplements and amendments

fully set out herein. In addition, a copy of the I.C. 36-1-21 in effect on July
1, 2012 is attached to Ordinance 2012-1.
   (E)   The town finds that both I.C. 36-1-20.2 and 36-1-21 specifically allow
a unit to adopt requirements that are more stringent or detailed and that more
detailed are necessary.
   (F)   The town further finds that a single member of the legislative body
cannot act for the body to make work assignments, compensation, grievances,
advancement, or a performance evaluation without prior authority of a majority
of the body and therefore without such authority by the majority, he or she
will not be in the direct line of supervision.
   (G)   The town finds that a single member of governing bodies with authority
over employees in the town cannot act for the governing body to make work
assignments, compensation, grievances, advancement, or a performance evaluation
without prior authority of a majority of the body, when a statute provides that
a majority is needed to act, and therefore, without such authority by the
majority the single member will not be in the direct line of supervision.
   (H)   All elected and appointed officials and employees of the town are
hereby directed to cooperate fully in the implementation of the policies
created by this section and in demonstrating compliance with these same
policies.
   (I)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, compliance,

appointed official of the town who fails to abide by or cooperate with the
implementation, with the compliance and with mandated certifications of the
nepotism policy may be subject to action allowed by law.
   (J)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, compliance,
and certifications connected with the contracting with unit by a relative
policy is a violation and may result in the discipline, including termination,
of an employee or a curative action. An elected or appointed official of the
town who fails to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, with the
compliance, and with mandated certifications of either the nepotism policy or
the contracting with unit by a relative policy may be subject to action allowed
by law.

HEALTH EMERGENCY POLICY
§ 35.015  PURPOSE.
   This subchapter will address town operations and procedures during a public
epidemic or public health emergency. The Town Board should plan for staff being
unavailable to report to work in the event of a serious infectious disease
outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic. Additionally, during a health emergency, other
civil and governmental organizations may take measures to slow the spread of
the illness or outbreak, such as closing town facilities by order of county,
state, federal health, or government officials. It is important that the core
operations of the town be maintained to the extent possible without
jeopardizing the health and safety of the staff and public.
(Ord. passed 4-7-2020)
§ 35.016  DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   There is a difference between a general emergency policy and a health
emergency policy. If the town is required to close facilities due to a fire,
tornado, or other significant natural or human-made event, it is taken for
granted that the staff of the town will return to the building(s) and begin
recovery work almost immediately. If there is a serious infectious disease,
epidemic, or pandemic, it is also taken for granted recovery may be slow, the
staff might be restricted from entering the building(s), and services and hours
might be interrupted for extended lengths of time.
   (B)   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   CLERK-TREASURER. The person elected to perform the day-to-day operations of
the town as provided by state law.
   CLERK DESIGNEE. In the event that the Clerk-Treasurer is unable to fulfill
his or her duties, the Board reserves the right to appoint one or more
temporary designees who will fulfill the Clerk-Treasurer’s responsibilities
until he or she can return to work. The Clerk-Treasurer shall consult with the
Board upon this choice of designee.
   EMPLOYEES AND STAFFING LEVEL. Part-time and full-time staff of the town.
STAFFING LEVEL refers to the minimum number of healthy employees to carry on
operations and be open to the public.
   EPIDEMIC. A disease affecting many people in a specific location at the same
time and spreading disease from person to person in a location where the
disease is not prevalent.
   ESSENTIAL EMPLOYEES. The Clerk-Treasurer and other staff selected by the
Town Board whose duties are necessary for minimal operations to continue. These
can include payroll, bill paying, maintenance, law enforcement, and the like.
   PANDEMIC. An epidemic that has spread over many states or countries and
usually affects many people around the world.
   PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. The condition present when the normal operations of
the town are severely curtailed or there is insufficient staff to maintain
normal operations.

      (2)   If a town employee has been diagnosed with the epidemic or
pandemic, the Board may temporarily close the building(s).

      (3)   Closure with reduced staff: some staff, as directed by the Board or
Clerk-Treasurer, may be permitted to work inside the building(s) even if town
facilities are closed to the public to perform certain functions as the Clerk-
Treasurer or Board may assign.
   (B)   In the absence of a mandated closure from higher authority, the lack
of healthy town employees will determine the extent to which town services can
be delivered and if open hours to the public can be maintained.
(Ord. passed 4-7-2020)
§ 35.019  COMPENSATION.
   (A)   The town will compensate employees their regularly scheduled hours if

(Ord. passed 4-7-2020)

TOWN EMPLOYEE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
§ 35.040  INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   For purposes of this subchapter, all employees will be referred to as
“employee(s)”. The town of Sunman, Indiana will be referred to as the “town”.
   (B)   This subchapter has been designed to acquaint employees with the town
and provide them with information about working conditions, employee benefits,
and some of the policies affecting employment. Employees are responsible for
reading, understanding, and complying with all provisions of this subchapter.
It describes many  responsibilities of an employee and outlines the programs
developed by the town to benefit employees. One of management’s objectives is
to provide a work environment that is conducive to both personal and
professional growth.
   (C)   No employee handbook may anticipate every circumstance or question
about policy. As the town continues to change, the need may arise and the town
reserves the right to revise, supplement, or rescind any policies or portion of
the handbook from time to time as it deems appropriate, in its sole and
absolute discretion. All changes will be made in accordance with federal,
state, and local employment-related laws. Employees will, of course, be
notified of such changes to the handbook as they occur and employees will be
expected to acknowledge in writing they have received those changes.
   (D)   Nothing in this subchapter shall be interpreted to prohibit or
otherwise restrict concerted activities by employees that are protected by
law.   
§ 35.041  ORGANIZATION AND RESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)   The town is organized into various departments, or offices, to ensure
adequate expertise, specialization, and efficient functioning. These
departments, or offices, function under the administrative guidance and control
of the Town Council or their designee, who are responsible for the day-to-day
management and operation of the town.
   (B)   Each employee’s particular duties, obligations, and areas of
responsibility are defined in his or her position description and/or by
assignment or directive of his or her supervisor. Employees are primarily
responsible to their supervisor for completion of specific work assignments and
the quality, quantity, and timeliness of the work performed.
   (C)   The rights, authorities, powers, and responsibilities of town
employees at all levels, with respect to the policies in this subchapter, are
more clearly delineated in the specific subject areas. However, in general, the
Town Council is charged with the development, promulgation, and adoption of the
provisions of this subchapter. The supervisors are charged with applying,
interpreting, enforcing, and generally ensuring compliance with the provisions
of this subchapter.
   (D)   It is the obligation and a requirement as a condition of employment
for each individual person employed by the town to comply in every respect with
the provisions of this subchapter and any related procedures and work rules and
to perform their assigned duties in a responsible manner creditable to the
town. As such, all town employees are expected to become knowledgeable about
its contents and abide by the policies set forth herein. Any questions,
concerns, or lack of understanding about a particular provision of this
subchapter should be promptly discussed with a supervisor.
§ 35.042  POLICY MANUAL ADMINISTRATION.
   To implement the policy and procedure manual and to oversee its
administration on a day-to-day basis, the following procedures will be taken.
   (A)   A copy of this subchapter will be given to all current employees of
the town and all new employees, including part-time, seasonal and temporary.
   (B)   The contents of this subchapter are subject to change without notice
at the sole discretion of the Town Council. Only the Town Council will have the
authority to make revisions.
   (C)   Any changes in the policy and procedure manual shall in no way alter
the employment-at-will policy or create a binding contract between the town and
employee.
   (D)   Employees are encouraged to make suggestions for improvement in
policies and procedures. Suggestions should be made in writing to the Town
Council.
   (E)   The town will undertake to accomplish a review of the manual at 12-
month intervals or as may be indicated by law or change in needs of the town.
   (F)   The supervisor’s rights include recommending method and procedure,
number of work force, assignment of duties and hours of employment compensation
of personnel. They also have a right to recommend hiring, disciplining, and
promotion. The Town Council, by executive session, maintains the ultimate right
to manage their workforce, consistent with the policies set forth in this
subchapter and all the applicable state and federal laws.
§ 35.043  EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY.
   (A)   In order to provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to
all individuals, employment decisions at the town will be based on merit,
qualifications, and abilities. The town strictly enforces Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 as enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC); and thereby does not discriminate in employment
opportunities or practices on the basis of race, color, religion, sex
(including pregnancy, gender identity, including sexual orientation), national
origin, disability, age as referenced in the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act (ADEA), genetic information as referenced in the Genetic Information
Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), military service, veteran status, or any other
characteristic protected by federal, state and local laws.
   (B)   The town will make reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals
with known disabilities in accordance with the American with Disabilities Act
and Amendments (ADAAA), unless doing so would result in an undue hardship. This
policy governs all aspects of employment, including selection, job assignment,
compensation, discipline, termination, and access to benefits and training.
Employees with questions or concerns about any type of discrimination in the
workplace are encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of their
supervisor, or the Clerk-Treasurer’s office.
   (C)   Police Department employees are encouraged to also bring these issues
to the Police Commissioners. Employees may raise concerns and make reports
without fear of reprisal. Anyone found to be engaging in any type of unlawful
discrimination may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment.
§ 35.044  FALSIFICATION OF EMPLOYMENT APPLICATIONS.
   The town relies upon the accuracy of information contained in the employment
application, as well as the accuracy of other data presented throughout the
hiring process and employment. Any misrepresentations, falsifications, or
material omissions in any of the information or data may result in the
exclusion of the individual from further consideration for employment or, if
the person has been hired, immediate termination of employment.
§ 35.045  ACCOUNTABILITY ACT (HIPAA) AND IMMIGRATION LAW COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   The town is committed to employing only United States citizens and
aliens who are authorized to work in the United States and does not unlawfully
discriminate on the basis of citizenship or national origin. In compliance with
the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, each new employee, as a
condition of employment, must complete the Employment Eligibility Verification
Form I-9 and present documentation establishing identity and employment
eligibility.
   (B)   Former employees who are rehired must also complete the form if they
have not completed an I-9 with the town within the past three years, or if
their previous I-9 is no longer retained or valid (supporting documentation has
expired).
   (C)   The I-9 may be completed by the employee prior to his or her first day
of work but federal law requires that this form be completed no more than three
days after the employee starts his or her employment. Failure to complete this
form will cause the employee not to be established as an employee with the town
and he or she will not be able to be paid through the payroll system until the
form is properly completed.
   (D)   Employees with questions or seeking more information on immigration
law issues are encouraged to contact the Clerk-Treasurer’s office. Employees
may raise questions or complaints about immigration law compliance without fear
of reprisal.
§ 35.046  BREASTFEEDING ACCOMMODATIONS.
   The town supports breastfeeding mothers by accommodating the mother who
wishes to express milk during her workday when separated from her newborn
child. In accordance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, being
29 U.S.C. § 207(r), any full-time employee who is breastfeeding will be
provided up to two break periods of 20 minutes each to express milk for her
newborn. Also, a reasonable place to express milk, other than a restroom, will
be provided for the mother. Such space will be shielded from view and free from
intrusion from others. The employee and their supervisor will agree on the
times and location options for these breaks. In addition, the town will provide
an area for the milk to be stored. Contact the Clerk-Treasurer’s office for
additional information.
§ 35.047  DISCRIMINATION/SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   Sexual harassment constitutes discrimination and is illegal under
federal, state and local laws. For the purpose of this subchapter, sexual
harassment is defined, as in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
Guidelines, as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other
verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when, for example:
      (1)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly
a term or condition of an individual’s employment;
      (2)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
      (3)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering
with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating or offensive
working environment.
   (B)   Sexual harassment may include a range of subtle and not-so-subtle
behaviors and may involve individuals of the same or different gender.
Depending on the circumstances, these behaviors may include, but are not
limited to:
      (1)   Unwanted sexual advances or requests for sexual favors;
      (2)   Sexual jokes and innuendo;
      (3)   Improper use of email or voice mail;
      (4)   Verbal abuse of a sexual nature;
      (5)   Comments about an individual’s body, sexual prowess or sexual
deficiencies;
      (6)   Leering, whistling or touching;
      (7)   Insulting or obscene comments or gestures;
      (8)   Display in the work place of sexually suggestive objects or
pictures, including screen savers or improper emails or attachments; and
      (9)   Other physical, verbal or visual conduct of a sexual nature.
      (10)   Harassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is
also strictly prohibited.
   (C)   Under this subchapter, harassment is verbal or physical conduct that
derogates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of his or
her race, color, religion, sex (pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual
orientation), national origin, age (40 and over), disability, genetic
information as referenced in the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act
(GINA), military service veteran status, or any other characteristic protected
by law or that of his or her relatives, friends, or associates, and that:
      (1)   Has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or
offensive work environment;
      (2)   Has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an
individual’s work performance; or
      (3)   Otherwise adversely affects an individual’s employment
opportunities.
   (D)   Harassing conduct includes, but is not limited to:
      (1)   Epithets, slurs, or negative stereotyping;
      (2)   Threatening, intimidating or hostile acts; derogatory jokes; and
      (3)   Written or graphic material that derogates or shows hostility or
aversion toward an individual or group or that is placed on walls or elsewhere
on the employer's premises or circulated in the workplace.
   (E)   Individuals found to be performing such harassing conduct may be
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
   (F)   These policies apply to all applicants and employees, whether related
to conduct engaged in by fellow employees or someone not directly connected to
the town, such as an outside vendor, consultant, or citizen. Conduct prohibited
by these policies is unacceptable in the workplace and in any work-related
setting outside the workplace, such as during business trips, business
meetings, and business-related social events.
§ 35.048  RETALIATION PROHIBITED.
   The town encourages reporting of all perceived incidents of discrimination
or harassment. It is the policy of the town to investigate such reports. The
town prohibits retaliation against any individual who reports discrimination or
harassment, or participates in an investigation of such reports.
§ 35.049  REPORTING AN INCIDENT OF HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION OR RETALIATION.
   (A)   Reporting encouraged. The town encourages reporting of all perceived
incidents of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation, regardless of the
offender’s identity or position. Individuals who believe that they have been
the victims of harassing conduct should discuss their concerns with their
supervisor, or the Clerk-Treasurer’s office. In addition, the town encourages
individuals who believe they are being subjected to such conduct to promptly
advise the offender that his or her behavior is unwelcome and request that it
be discontinued. Often this action alone will resolve the problem. The town
recognizes, however, that an individual may prefer to pursue the matter through
informal or formal complaint procedures.
   (B)   Complaint procedures.
      (1)   If for any reason an individual does not wish to address the
offender directly, or if addressing the offender does not successfully end the
offensive conduct, the individual should notify his or her supervisor, or the
Clerk-Treasurer’s office.
      (2)   An individual reporting harassment, discrimination or retaliation
should be aware however, that the town may find it necessary to take action to
address such conduct beyond an informal discussion. This decision will be
discussed with the individual in an executive session.
      (3)   As noted above, individuals who believe they have been the victims
of conduct prohibited by this policy statement or believe they have witnessed
such conduct should discuss their concerns with their supervisor, or the Clerk-
Treasurer’s office. The town encourages the prompt reporting of complaints or
concerns so that rapid and corrective action may be taken before relationships
become irreparably damaged. Therefore, while no fixed reporting period has been
established, early reporting and intervention have proven to be the most
effective method of resolving actual or perceived incidents of harassment.
      (4)   Any reported allegations of harassment, discrimination or
retaliation will be investigated promptly. The investigation may include
individual interviews with the parties involved and, where necessary, with
individuals who may have observed the alleged conduct or may have another
relevant knowledge.
      (5)   Retaliation against an individual for reporting harassment or
discrimination, or for participation in an investigation of a claim of
harassment or discrimination is a serious violation of this subchapter and,
like harassment or discrimination itself, may be subject to disciplinary
action, up to and including termination.
      (6)   Acts of retaliation should be reported immediately and will be
investigated and corrective action taken promptly. Corrective action may
include, retraining, referral to counseling and/or disciplinary action, up to
and including termination, withholding of a promotion or pay increase,
reassignment, or temporary suspension without pay as deemed appropriate under
the circumstances. If a party to a complaint does not agree with its
resolution, that party may appeal to the Town Council.
   (C)   Confidentiality. The town will make all reasonable efforts to maintain
the confidentiality of all parties involved in a harassment investigation.
Confidentiality, however, cannot be guaranteed. For example, some details or
identities may need to be revealed in order to fully investigate the harassment
complaint.
   (D)   False claims of sexual harassment, retaliation, and/or discrimination.
In order to cover all possibilities of misconduct, the town reserves the right
to discipline employees who have falsely accused another of sexual harassment,
retaliation, and/or discrimination. This does not mean that a complaint will be
considered false, solely because it cannot be corroborated.
   (E)   Conclusion.
      (1)   The town has developed this subchapter to ensure that all its
employees may work in an environment free from harassment, discrimination and
retaliation. The town will make every reasonable effort to ensure that all
necessary persons are familiar with these policies and aware that any complaint
in violation of such policies will be investigated and resolved appropriately.
Any employee who has any questions or concerns about these policies should
speak with the Clerk-Treasurer’s office.
      (2)   Finally, these policies should not, and may not, be used as a basis
for excluding or separating individuals of a particular gender, or any other
protected characteristic, from participating in business or work-related social
activities or discussions. In other words, no one should make the mistake of
engaging in discrimination or exclusion in order to avoid allegations of
harassment. The law and the policies of the town prohibit disparate treatment
on the basis of sex or any other protected characteristic, with regard to
terms, conditions, privileges and prerequisites of employment. The prohibitions
against harassment, discrimination and retaliation are intended to complement
and further those policies, not to form the basis of an exception to them.
      (3)   Nothing in this subchapter shall be interpreted to prohibit or
otherwise restrict concerted activities by employees that are protected by law.
§ 35.050  AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY ACT (ADA).
   (A)   It is the policy of the town that qualified individuals with
disabilities are not to be excluded from participation in or benefit from the
services, programs, or activities of the town.
   (B)   It is the policy of the town not to discriminate against a qualified
individual with a disability in:
      (1)   Job application procedures;
      (2)   The hiring, advancement or discharge of employees;
      (3)   Employee compensation;
      (4)   Job training; and
      (5)   Other terms, conditions and privileges of employment.
   (C)   It is the intent of the town to comply with all applicable
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
   (D)   The town will reasonably accommodate persons with a disability on a
case-by-case basis, which may include making facilities readily accessible to
individuals with a disability, restructuring jobs, modifying work schedules
and/or equipment, or similar accommodations.
   (E)   Employees who want an accommodation should inform the supervisor of
their condition. Such employees are required to provide pertinent medical
information. Employees should contact the supervisor for assistance when an
accommodation is necessary.
   (F)   Accommodations may not create an undue hardship for the town or other
employees. An individual who cannot be reasonably accommodated for a job,
without undue hardship, will not be selected for that position. The supervisor
will make determination of reasonable accommodation.
   (G)   All employees are required to comply with safety standards.
Applicants, who pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other
individuals in the workplace, and where the threat cannot be eliminated by
reasonable accommodation, will not be hired or retained. Current employees who
pose a direct threat to the health or safety of the other individuals in the
workplace will be placed on the appropriate leave. Further, disabled
individuals cannot pose a direct threat to the safety of themselves or others.
Generally, a “direct threat” means a significant risk to the health or safety
of others that cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation.
   (H)   Benefits provided to disabled individuals who are qualified to perform
the work must be consistent with the benefits provided to other employees. Any
individual who believes he or she has received treatment inconsistent with the
policies set forth above or any other requirement of ADA, may file a complaint
with the supervisor.
§ 35.051  DISABILITY ACCOMMODATIONS (ADAAA).
   (A)   The town is committed to complying fully with the Americans with
Disabilities Act and Amendments (ADAAA) and ensuring equal opportunity in
employment for qualified persons with disabilities.
   (B)   All employment practices and activities are conducted on a non-
discriminatory basis in accordance with both federal and state laws.
   (C)   Hiring procedures have been reviewed and provide persons with
disabilities meaningful employment opportunities. Pre-employment inquiries are
made only regarding an applicant’s ability to perform the duties of the
position.
   (D)   Reasonable accommodation is available to all disabled employees, where
their disability affects the performance of job functions.
   (E)   All employment decisions are based on the merits of the situation in
accordance with defined criteria, not the disability of the individual.
   (F)   Qualified individuals with disabilities are entitled to equal pay and
other forms of compensation (or changes in compensation) as well as in job
assignments, classifications, organizational structures, position descriptions,
and benefits and training.
   (G)   The town is also committed to not discriminating against any qualified
employees or applicants because they are related to or associated with a person
with a disability.
   (H)   The town will follow any state or local law that provides individuals
with disabilities greater protection than the ADAAA.
   (I)   This policy is neither exhaustive nor exclusive.
   (J)   The town is committed to taking all other actions necessary to ensure
equal employment opportunity for persons with disabilities in accordance with
the ADAAA and all other applicable federal, state, and local laws.
   (K)   Employees with questions or seeking more information on the ADAAA are
encouraged to contact their supervisor, or the Clerk-Treasurer’s office.
Employees may raise questions or complaints about the ADAAA compliance without
fear of reprisal.
§ 35.052  EMPLOYMENT-AT-WILL.
   (A)   Public employment is based on the “at-will” doctrine. “At-will”
employment means any individual may voluntarily leave employment or may be
terminated by the town at any time with or without cause. Any change to this
policy will be effective only if set forth in writing and signed by both the
employee and the supervisor.
   (B)   This policy may not be modified by any statements contained in this
manual or any other employee materials, including applications, memoranda, or
other documents provided to applicants and employees in connection with their
employment. None of these documents whether single or combined, create an
expressed or implied contract of employment for a definite period, or an
express or implied contract concerning any terms or conditions of employment.
Similarly, town policies and practices with respect to any matter should not be
considered as creating any contractual obligation on the town’s part or as
stating in any way that termination will occur only “for cause”. Statements of
specific grounds for termination set forth in this subchapter or in any other
town documents are examples only, not all-inclusive lists, and are not intended
to restrict the town’s right to terminate at-will.
   (C)   Completion of a probationary period or conferral of regular status
does not change an employee’s status as an at-will employee or in any way
restrict the town’s right to terminate the employee or change the terms or
conditions of employment.
§ 35.053  EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE RELATIONS.

problem. Employees needing help in dealing with such problems will have one
opportunity to ask for help without repercussion. They should contact their

or placed on non-disciplinary suspension with pay while awaiting the post
incident test results.
         (d)   An employee who tests positive for drugs and/or alcohol, or who
refuses or fails to submit to a reasonable suspicion drug and alcohol test will

or transfer will be withdrawn. Rehabilitation will be offered. Refusal to
submit to the test will result in denial of employment.

Clerk-Treasurer’s office.
§ 35.060  EMPLOYMENT ORIENTATION.

   (C)   Generally, only supervisors and management employees of the town who
have a legitimate reason to review information in a file are allowed to do so.

with the town authorizing them to do so. The town may also take legal action
deemed appropriate to recover or protect its property.
§ 35.069  TRAINING.
   (A)   Employee responsibility. It is the employee’s responsibility for
maintaining and upgrading job skills. Each individual administrator, Town
Council, and employee bears primary responsibility for maintaining individual

upgrading skills necessary to meet technological change or seek promotion. The
town will facilitate those efforts and provide training from time to time.
   (B)   Independent training. An employee may pursue independent study or
training but may not obligate the town to pay expenses or compensation without
specific advance permission. Employees may be required to attend job-related
training programs, courses, workshops, seminars, and the like.

employee to attend such training or approves a specific request from an
employee to attend such training, the town shall pay the expense incurred.

current and proposed training programs in order to ensure the program’s
relevance to both the individual employee and organizational training needs.
   (E)   On-the-job training (OJI). On-the-job training prepares an employee to
perform the responsibilities required of his or her position. It allows the
employee to learn his or her job duties, proper procedures, and expected
performance levels.
§ 35.070  ETHICS/CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
   (A)   The proper operation of the town requires that all official
representatives be effective, independent, objective, and accountable to the
people they serve. To ensure these qualities are upheld, the town has adopted
this code of ethics and values to promote and maintain the highest standards of
personal and professional conduct in our community. All elected and appointed
officials, employees, volunteers, and others who participate in our government
are required to subscribe to this code, understand how it applies to their
specific responsibilities and practice these core values in their work. Because
we value the public’s confidence and trust in our services and its decision-
makers, our character and behaviors must meet the most demanding ethical
standards and demonstrate the highest levels of achievement in following this
code.
   (B)   Behavior inconsistent with the values set forth in this code may be
redressed by the traditional instruments of governance including state law,
ordinances, and work rules. No employee shall use his or her position with the
town for personal gain, nor shall he or she engage in any business or
transaction, which are in conflict with the proper discharge of his or her
duties.
   (C)   No employee shall accept any valuable gratuity, whether in the form of
a service, loan, item, or promise from any person, firm, or corporation which
is interested directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever in business
dealings with the town; nor shall employees accept any valuable gift, favor, or
item that may tend to influence an employee in the discharge of his or her
duties.
   (D)   No employee shall grant any improper favor, service, or item in the
discharge of his or her duty. Therefore, a limit of $100 per occasion will be
considered reasonable for gifts that might consist of luncheons or dinners at
various meetings, seminars, or conventions. If an employee accepts a gift more
than the limit, they must report that to their supervisor no later than two
working days after receipt.
   (E)   All employees are expected to maintain the highest possible ethical,
moral, and legal standards, and to perform their duties in compliance with all
applicable federal, state, and local laws, the rules, and regulations continued
in this subchapter, and/or future administrative directives deemed necessary.
   (F)   No employee shall, without proper and legal authorization, disclose
confidential information concerning the property, government, or affairs of the
town.
   (G)   No employee shall engage in, accept private employment, or render
services for private interests, when such employment or service is incompatible
with the proper discharge of his or her official duties, or would tend to
impair his or her independent judgment or action in the performance of his or
her official duties.
§ 35.071  LATE ARRIVAL/ABSENCES.
   (A)   Late arrival on a regular basis is inexcusable and will not be
tolerated. Whenever a covered non-exempt employee is late, that employee may be
subject to a reduction in pay corresponding to the amount of time he or she was
late.
   (B)   In the rare instance when an employee cannot avoid being late to work
or is unable to work as scheduled, he or she should notify the superintendent
and office of the Clerk-Treasurer as soon as possible in advance of the
anticipated tardiness or absence.
   (C)   Failure to notify the proper superintendent, Town Council or the
Clerk-Treasurer of an absence or tardy will make the tardiness or absence
unexcused. These are unexcused absences and will remain on the employee’s
record for a full 12-month period.
   (D)   The definition of an UNEXCUSED ABSENCE is any absence lasting three
days or more for which the employee does not have a doctor’s excuse and the
employee is not using vacation or personal time for the absence.
   (E)   To maintain a safe and productive work environment, the town expects
employees to be reliable and to be punctual in reporting for scheduled work.
Absenteeism and tardiness place a burden on the business operations of the
town.
   (F)   In the rare instances when employees cannot avoid being late to work
or are unable to work as scheduled, they should notify their supervisor prior
to the start of their shift, or as soon as possible in advance of the
anticipated tardiness or absence. Employees who are in a supervisory role must
notify the Clerk-Treasurer if they are going to be tardy or absent. To cover
this missed time, employees are required to use available paid time off.
   (G)   Poor attendance and excessive tardiness are disruptive. Either may
lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
§ 35.072  GROOMING .
   (A)   Grooming. When appropriate, a clean and neat appearance is required.
It is understood that some employees may become dirty during their work
schedule. Every effort should be made to provide the community with a neat and
clean appearance when possible.
   (B)   Clothing/attire.
      (1)   The town is a place of business and staff should dress accordingly.
      (2)   Supervisors are responsible for their employee’s dress.
      (3)   Some employees of the town are provided a clothing allowance to
purchase clothing and must be worn while on duty.
      (4)   Business clothing are only allowed to be worn while on duty.
      (5)   Employees will be required to follow IRS regulations or taxing
purposes if necessary.
§ 35.073  WORKPLACE ETIQUETTE.
   The town strives to maintain a positive work environment where employees
treat each other with respect and courtesy. Sometimes issues arise when
employees are unaware that their behavior in the workplace may be disruptive or
annoying to others. Many of these day-to-day issues may be addressed by
politely talking with a coworker to bring the perceived problem to his or her
attention. In most cases, common sense will dictate an appropriate resolution.
The town encourages all employees to keep an open mind and graciously accept
constructive feedback or a request to change behavior that may be affecting
another employee’s ability to concentrate and be productive.
§ 35.074  VISITORS IN THE WORKPLACE.
   (A)   Policy. To provide for the safety and security of employees and the
facilities at the town, only authorized visitors are allowed in the workplace.
Restricting unauthorized visitors helps maintain safety standards, protects
against theft, ensures security of equipment, protects confidential
information, safeguards employee welfare, and avoids potential distractions and
disturbances.
   (B)   Definition.VISITORS are defined as persons at a town facility for
social reasons or any purpose other than directly job related.
   (C)   Employee responsibility. Employees are responsible for the conduct and
safety of their visitors.
§ 35.075  BUSINESS ETHICS AND CONDUCT.
   (A)   The successful business operation and reputation of the town is built
upon the principles of fair dealing and ethical conduct of our employees. The
reputation for integrity and excellence requires careful observance of the
spirit and letter of all applicable laws and regulations, as well as a
scrupulous regard for the highest standards of conduct and personal integrity.
The continued success of the town is dependent upon  citizens’ trust and the
town is dedicated to preserving that trust. Employees owe a duty to the town
and its citizens to act in a way that will merit the continued trust and
confidence of the public. The town will comply with all applicable laws and
regulations and expects its employees to conduct business in accordance with
the letter, spirit, and intent of all relevant laws and to refrain from any
illegal, dishonest, or unethical conduct.
   (B)   Nothing in this policy shall be interpreted to prohibit or otherwise
restrict concerted activities by employees that are protected by law. In
general, the use of good judgment, based on high ethical principles, will guide
employees with respect to lines of acceptable conduct. If a situation arises
where it is difficult to determine the proper course of action, the matter
should be discussed openly with a supervisor, or the Clerk-Treasurer’s office
for advice and consultation.
   (C)   Compliance with this policy of business ethics and conduct is the
responsibility of every town employee. Disregarding or failing to comply with
this standard of business ethics and conduct may be subject to disciplinary
action, up to and including termination of employment.
§ 35.076  NON-DISCLOSURE.
   (A)   The protection of confidential information is vital to the interests
and the success of the town. I.C. 5-14-3-4 states what is considered to be
public record, and the town will comply with all guidelines. Such confidential
information includes information acquired in the course of one’s work, and may
include:
      (1)   Computer processes;
      (2)   Computer programs and codes;

§ 35.077  COMPUTER, INTERNET AND EMAIL USAGE.
   (A)   Computers, computer files, the email system, and software furnished to
employees are the town’s property and intended for business use, not for
personal use. Employees should not use a password, access a file, or retrieve
any stored communication without authorization. To ensure compliance with this
policy, computer and email usage may be monitored.
   (B)   The town strives to maintain a workplace free of harassment and
sensitive to the diversity of its employees. Therefore, the town prohibits the
use of computers and the email system in ways that are discriminatory,
disruptive, obscene, threatening, harassing, intimidating, offensive to others,
or harmful to morale. For example, the display or transmission of sexually
explicit images, messages, and cartoons is not allowed. Other such misuse
includes, but is not limited to:
      (1)   Ethnic slurs, racial comments, off-color jokes, or anything that
may be construed as harassment or showing disrespect for employees, citizens,
or visitors;
      (2)   Copying, pirating or downloading software and electronic files
without permission;
      (3)   Participating in the viewing or exchange of pornography or obscene
materials;
      (4)   Attempting to break into the computer system of another
organization or employee;
      (5)   Refusing to cooperate with a security investigation;
      (6)   Disclosing information acquired in the course of one’s work; or
      (7)   Sending or posting messages that disparage another organization’s
products or services while engaged in performing his or her work tasks from a
town’s computer or mobile device.
   (C)   The town purchases and licenses the use of various computer software
for business purposes and does not own the copyright to this software or its
related documentation. Unless authorized by the software developer, neither the
town nor any employee has the right to reproduce such software for use on more
than one computer. Employees may only use software on local area networks or on
multiple machines according to the software license agreement. The town
prohibits the illegal duplication of software and its related documentation.
   (D)   Employees should notify the Clerk-Treasurer’s office upon learning of
violations of this policy. Employees who violate this policy may be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
   (E)   Nothing in this policy shall be interpreted to prohibit or otherwise
restrict concerted activities by employees that are protected by law, our
employees and to have met and to maintain our presence as a highly reputable
municipality.
§ 35.078  USE OF OFFICE PHONE AND MAIL SYSTEMS.
   Personal use of the telephone for long-distance and toll calls is not
permitted. Employees should practice discretion when making local personal
calls and may be required to reimburse the town for any charges resulting from
their personal use of the telephone or fax machine. Employees receiving minor
calls during unscheduled work periods that are work-related will not be
compensated. However, if calls or emails are required to be answered by non-
exempt employees regularly during not work periods, they might be subject to
compensation. Employees should discuss non-work period use of phones and emails
with their supervisor.
§ 35.079  PERSONAL PHONE CALLS/MOBILE DEVICE USE.
   (A)   As a representative of the town, mobile device users are reminded that
the regular business etiquette employed when speaking from office phones or in
meetings applies to conversations conducted over a mobile device. During work
hours, occasional, brief personal mobile device usage is permitted within a
reasonable limit. Employees are urged to keep their conversation, emailing,
texting, or data access activities brief and kept to only urgent matters.
Employees are required to conduct lengthy personal conversations and/or
emailing, texting, or data access activities on their lunch breaks or non-
working hours.
   (B)   If mobile device usage, to include talking, emailing, texting, or data
access activities is abused, the first infraction may result in a verbal
warning. A second infraction may result in a written warning and a third or
subsequent violation and continued abuse may result in continued disciplinary
action, up to and including termination of employment.
§ 35.080  EMPLOYEE RELATIONS.
   (A)   The town believes that the work conditions, wages, and benefits it
offers to its employees are competitive with those offered by other employers.
If employees have concerns about work conditions or compensation, they are
strongly encouraged to voice these concerns openly and directly to their
supervisor. When employees deal openly and directly with their supervisor, the
work environment can be excellent, communications can be clear, and attitudes
can be positive. We believe that the town amply demonstrates its commitment to
employees by responding effectively to employee concerns.
   (B)   The Town Council will occasionally make determinations as to changes
or alterations in salary, leave, or other special circumstances.
§ 35.081  CITIZEN RELATIONS.
   Citizens are among the town’s most valuable assets. Every employee
represents the town to its citizens and the public. The way we do our jobs
presents an image of the entire team. Citizens judge all of us by how they are
treated with each employee contact. Therefore, one of our first business
priorities is to assist any citizen or potential citizen. Nothing is more
important than being courteous, friendly, helpful, and prompt in the attention
that employees give to citizens. Our personal contact with the public, our
manners on the telephone, and the communications we send to citizens are
reflections not only of ourselves, but also of the professionalism of the town.
Positive citizen relations not only enhance the public’s perception or image of
the town, but also pay off in greater citizen loyalty.
§ 35.082  OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT.
   (A)   Employees may hold outside jobs as long as they meet the performance
standards of their job with the town. All employees will be judged by the same
performance standards and will be subject to the town scheduling demands,
regardless of any existing outside work requirements.
   (B)   If the town determines that an employee’s outside work interferes with
performance or the ability to meet the requirements of the town as they are
modified from time to time, the employee may be asked to terminate the outside
employment if he or she wishes to remain with the town.
   (C)   Outside employment should be disclosed and discussed with their
supervisor.
   (D)   All police officers must complete a private duty agreement by and
between the outside agency and the town for work duties that are law
enforcement in nature.
   (E)   Outside employment that constitutes a conflict of interest is
prohibited. Employees may not receive any income or material gain from
individuals outside the town for materials produced or services rendered while
performing their jobs. Refer to conflicts of interest for further details.
§ 35.083  NEPOTISM IN THE WORKPLACE.
   (A)   In general. The employment of relatives in the “direct line of
supervision” may cause serious conflicts and problems with favoritism and
employee morale. In addition to claims of partiality in treatment at work,
personal conflicts from outside the work environment may be carried over into
day-to-day working relationships. Accordingly, the town follows state law, I.C.
36-1-20.2 with regards to nepotism.
   (B)   Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires otherwise.
      DIRECT LINE OF SUPERVISION.
         (a)   An elected officer or employee who is in a position to affect
the terms and conditions of another employee’s employment, including making
decisions about work assignments, compensation, grievances, advancement, or a
performance evaluation.
         (b)   Does not include the responsibilities of the executive,
legislative body, or fiscal body of the town, as provided by law, to make
decisions regarding salary ordinances, budgets, or employee policies of the
town.
      EMPLOYED.
         (a)   An individual who is employed by the town on a full-time, part-
time, or temporary basis; or
         (b)   An individual who is a party to an employment contract with the
town.
         (c)   Does not include an individual who holds an elected office.
      RELATIVE. A spouse, parent or stepparent, child or stepchild (including
an adopted child or stepchild), a brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
(including a brother or sister by half-blood), a niece or nephew, aunt or
uncle, daughter-in-law or son-in-law.
   (C)   Relatives in direct line of supervision. Individuals who are relatives
may not be employed by the town in a position that results in one relative
being in the direct line of supervision of the other relative. This applies to
an individual who is employed by the town on the date that the employee’s
relative begins serving a term of an elected office and is not exempt from the
application under exemptions of the policy. This policy does not abrogate or
affect an employment contract with the town that: an individual is party to;
and is in effect on the date the employee’s relative begins serving a term of
an elected office of the town.
   (D)   Exemptions. Employees, who were already employed by the town 7-1-2012,
are not subject to this policy unless they have had a break in employment with
the town. The following are not considered a break in employment: the employee
is absent from the workplace while on paid or unpaid leave, including any paid
time off, medical leave or workers’ compensation and the employee’s employment
with the town is terminated followed by immediate reemployment by the town,
without loss of payroll time.
   (E)   Additional information. Contact the Clerk-Treasurer’s office for
additional information.
§ 35.084  PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINARY POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to state the town’s position on
administering equitable and consistent discipline for unsatisfactory conduct in
the workplace. The best disciplinary measure is the one that does not have to
be enforced and comes from good leadership and fair supervision at all
employment levels. The town’s own best interest lies in ensuring fair treatment
of all employees and in making certain that disciplinary actions are prompt,
uniform, and impartial. The major purpose of any disciplinary action is to
correct the problem, prevent recurrence, and prepare the employee for
satisfactory service in the future. Supervisors are responsible for taking
action in a progressive disciplinary situation with employees or may face
disciplinary action themselves.
   (B)   Progressive discipline. Although employment with the town is based on
mutual consent and both the employee and the town have the right to terminate
the employment-at-will relationship, with or without cause or advance notice,
the town may use progressive discipline at its discretion. Disciplinary action
may call for any of four steps: verbal warning, written warning, suspension
with or without pay, or termination of employment,  depending on the severity
of the problem and the number of occurrences. There may be circumstances when
one or more steps are bypassed.
   (C)   Employee copies of discipline documentation. The employee will be
provided copies of all progressive discipline documentation. The employee will
be asked to sign copies of this documentation attesting to his or her receipt
and understanding of the corrective action outlined in these documents.
   (D)   Progressive discipline steps. Progressive discipline means that, with
respect to most disciplinary problems, these steps will normally be followed:
      (1)   Verbal warning;
      (2)   Written warning;
      (3)   Suspension with or without pay pending executive session; and
      (4)   Termination pending executive session.
   (E)   Issues subject to discipline. The following is a non-comprehensive
list of employee issues that may be subject to progressive discipline:
      (1)   Not meeting job requirements;
      (2)   Inability to meet deadlines;
      (3)   Poor quality of work;
      (4)   Excessive absences;
      (5)   Excessive tardiness;
      (6)   Intentional abuse of company property; and
      (7)   Arguing/fighting with co-workers.
   (F)   Serious misconduct. In the case of serious misconduct, an employee
will be suspended without pay pending executive session. Serious workplace
misconduct includes, but is not limited to:
      (1)   Theft;
      (2)   Behavior/language of a threatening, abusive, or inappropriate
nature;
      (3)   Failure to follow safety procedures causing injury;
      (4)   Misuse, damage to, or loss of company property;
      (5)   Falsification, alteration, or improper handling of company-related
records;
      (6)   Disclosure or misuse of confidential information;
      (7)   Unauthorized possession or concealment of weapons;
      (8)   Insubordination (refusal to carry out a direct assignment);
      (9)   Misuse of the company’s electronic information systems; and
      (10)   Possession, use, sale, manufacture, purchase, or working under the
influence of non-prescribed or illegal drugs, alcohol, or other intoxicants.

   (A)   It is inevitable that misunderstandings and differences will arise
when employees of the town are working together on a day-to-day basis. In order

grievance procedure is hereby established.
   (B)   The employee will submit an oral grievance to the Town Council within
three working days of the action's occurrence. The Town Council and the
supervisor shall meet with the employee and make every effort to resolve the

   (C)   Failure of the employee to submit his or her appeal within the time
limits specified will result in the town considering the matter settled and
closed.
   (D)   The time limits in the grievance procedure may be extended only by

to wear at any given time, they should ask a supervisor. PPE is provided as
required and/or specific PPE preferences are offset by clothing allowance
stipends.
   (B)   If an accident results in an injury, no matter how minor the injury
may be, employees are required to report the incident to their supervisor and
the Clerk-Treasurer’s office. At the time the injury occurs, the need to see a
doctor will be determined. All workplace injuries will be seen by a physician
and/or facility selected by the town and in accordance with state laws. Reports
of injury are necessary to comply with both federal and state laws and initiate
insurance and workers’ compensation benefits. In the event that an employee
does not report an accident or injury, there may be a delay in the benefits
paid, including the possibility that medical bills will not be paid at all. Any
employee injured on the job, may be subject to a drug and alcohol test. Refusal
to submit or positive results may result in disciplinary action, up to and
including termination of employment.
   (C)   Some of the best safety improvement ideas come from employees. Those
with ideas, concerns, or suggestions for improved safety in the workplace are
encouraged to discuss them with their supervisor or the Clerk-Treasurer’s
office. Reports and concerns about workplace safety issues may be made
anonymously if the employee wishes. All reports may be made without fear of
reprisal. Each employee is expected to obey safety rules and to exercise
caution in all work activities. Employees must immediately report any unsafe
condition to the appropriate supervisor. Employees who violate safety
standards, who cause hazardous or dangerous situations, or who fail to report,
or remedy such situations, may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and
including termination of employment.

status of the source of the individual.
   (C)   Employees should not compress trash in waste cans, as it would be easy
to be stuck by a needle or other sharp object. Employees should also not place
their hands on the bottom of trash bags for support as they could be stuck by
sharp objects in the bag. Employees should examine the bags before picking them
up to be sure there are no sharp objects sticking out of the bag.

area.
   NON-WORK TIME. Includes any time during an employee’s workday where the
employee is completely relieved of work duties, such as break time and

is immaterial to the designation of NON-WORK TIME.
   SALARIED. Employee paid a predetermined amount of compensation weekly based
upon a 40-hour work week.
   SOLICITATION. Includes, but is not limited to an act which requests, urges,
or seeks to induce an employee to give or obligate him or her to pay money for

§ 35.102  WAGE AND HOURS.
     (A)   Payroll.
      (1)   All non-exempt employees are required to clock in and out each day
they are on duty.
      (2)   Time cards require the employee’s signature.
      (3)   Time cards must be signed by the employee’s supervisor.
      (3)   All employee, exempt and non-exempt, are required to log PTO,
holidays and vacation days taken.
   (B)   Pay corrections. The town takes all reasonable steps to ensure that
employees receive the correct amount of pay and that employees are paid
promptly on the scheduled payday. In several roles, shift differential, special
assignment pays, clothing allowances, longevity and other distributions vary.
It is recommended that each employee carefully review each bi-weekly pay stub
to ensure that the correct compensation has been received. If there is an error
in the amount of pay, the employee should promptly bring the discrepancy to the
attention the Clerk-Treasurer’s office so that corrections may be made as
quickly as possible.
   (C)   Pay deductions.
      (1)   The law requires that the town make certain deductions from every
employee’s compensation. Among these are applicable federal, state, and local
income taxes. The town also must deduct Social Security taxes on each civilian
employee’s earnings up to a specified limit that is called the Social Security
“wage base.” The town matches the amount of Social Security taxes paid by each
employee with the exception of exempt public safety roles.
      (2)   The town offers programs and benefits beyond those required by law.
Eligible employees may voluntarily authorize deductions from their paychecks to
cover the costs of participation in these programs such as accident or hospital
insurance programs and similar.
      (3)   Pay setoffs are pay deductions taken by the town, usually to help
pay off a debt or obligation to town or others. If an employee has questions
concerning why deductions were made from their paycheck or how they were
calculated, they should contact the Clerk-Treasurer’s office.
   (D)   Payroll complaint procedure.
      (1)   Per I.C. 36-5-2-8, the Clerk-Treasurer is responsible for the
management and administration of payroll. Therefore, employees who believe
their pay has been improperly reduced should immediately contact the Clerk-
Treasurer’s office. The Clerk Treasurer’s office will investigate the
employee’s concern and determine whether an inadvertent improper deduction has
been made. If the deduction was in fact improper, the town will reimburse the
employee as promptly as possible. The town complies with all applicable laws
concerning the payment of wages and will correct any inadvertent improper
deduction, should it occur and monitor the situation to ensure no further
issues arise.
      (2)   An employee’s exempt or nonexempt classification may be changed
only upon written notification by the Town Council. In addition to the above,
each employee will belong one of the following employment categories:
         (a)   Regular full-time employees are those who are not in a temporary
or introductory status and who are regularly scheduled to work a full-time 40
hour per week/public safety full-time schedule. Employees in this category may
be eligible for the town’s benefits package, subject to the terms, conditions,
and limitations of each benefit program. Refer to each benefit policy for
eligibility requirements.
         (b)   Temporary/seasonal employees are those who are hired as interim
replacements, to temporarily supplement the work force, or to assist in the
completion of a specific project. Employment assignments in this category are
of a limited duration. Employment beyond any initially stated period does not
in any way imply a change in employment status. Temporary employees retain that
status unless and until notified of a change. While temporary employees receive
all legally mandated benefits, they are ineligible for any of the town’s other
benefit programs. When specific temporary/seasonal employee matters are not
explicitly stated in this subchapter, department policies will prevail.
   (E)   Overtime.
      (1)   Overtime pay is only paid on over 40 hours physically worked in one
workweek.
      (2)   The superintendent and/or Town Council must approve all overtime.
In some cases, emergency overtime may be scheduled to finish a job or to make
it safe until it can be finished.
      (3)   The town reserves the right to require employees to work overtime
when necessary. Refusal of overtime will be viewed as insubordination.
      (4)   Any employee may be required to work in excess of the normal
workday or workweek to meet operational demands.
      (5)   Overtime will be paid under the guidelines set out by the FLSA
(Fair Labor Standards Act) and paid accordingly. Eligibility for overtime shall
be based upon all hours in “active pay status.”
      (6)   Benefit hours such as holidays, vacation, sick, or personal days
cannot be used in the calculation of over time.
   (F)   Flex time.
      (1)   The town shall utilize “time-off” or flexible hours in order to
avoid having employees work in excess of 40 hours in a workweek.
      (2)   The supervisor must approve flex time scheduling.
      (3)   The supervisor should make every effort to ensure that employees
utilize flex time so as to not work overtime.
      (4)   Flex time must be taken within a pay period.
      (5)   Flex time will not be used in a work week where an employee is
called out for an emergency.
      (6)   Flex time is paid as time for time.
      (7)   Example: If an employee works four hours overtime in a day, then
the employee may be required to take off four hours on another day within that
workweek, thus keeping his or her hours worked at 40 hours for that week.
§ 35.103  EMERGENCY CALL-OUT.
   Employees who are called out in an emergency will be paid a minimum of two
hours at the regular rate of pay.
§ 35.104  CLOTHING ALLOWANCE.
   Some employees may receive a clothing allowance for purchasing uniforms. The
amount of the allowance will be set by the Town Council annually. Employees who
do put use the full amount of the allowance will forfeit the remaining amount
for that year.
§ 35.105  GARNISHMENTS.
   A court-ordered legal claim against the wages of an employee by a creditor
for nonpayment of a debt by legal authority is a garnishment and shall be
recognized and executed by the town. When a garnishment is received for an
employee, the Clerk-Treasurer’s office will notify the employee.

February 5, 1993, allows for ELIGIBLE employees to request and, if approved,
receive up to a total of 12 weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period
for four circumstances:
      (1)   Because of the birth of a child of the employee and in order to
care for the child;
      (2)   Because of the placement of a child with an employee for adoption
or foster care;
      (3)   Because a spouse, parent, or child (including biological, adopted,
foster and stepchildren) of the employee has a “serious health condition” which
requires care by the employee; or
      (4)   Because the employee suffers from a serious health condition which
prevents the employee from being able to perform the functions of his or her
position.
   (B)   Definition. An ELIGIBLE employee is an employee that has been on the
town payroll for at least 12 months and has worked at least 1,250 work hours
during the 12 months preceding the request for leave.
   (C)   Requests. Requests are to be made in writing to the employee’s
supervisor with approvals as required.
   (D)   Notice.
      (1)   In the case of leaves for the birth of a child or adoption, an
employee is required to provide not less than 30 days advance notice or as much
advance notice as possible of the intent to take leave.
      (2)   Employees seeking leave for a foreseeable medical treatment for
himself or herself or a family member must also give 30 days’ notice or as much
notice as possible and, attempt to schedule the treatment so that the leave
does not unduly disrupt town operations.
   (E)   Certification. The town has the right to request that the medical
leave be properly certified by the health care provider and the employee is to
provide such certification in a timely manner. If an employee requests a leave
to care for a family member, the certification must confirm that this is
necessary and contain an estimate of the amount of time involved. When
intermittent medical leave is sought, the certification must recite the
anticipated dates and duration of treatment.
   (F)   Resignation. Failure to return to work on the determined return to
workday will be considered as a resignation by the employee.
   (G)   Approval/denial of FMLA.
      (1)   The Clerk-Treasurer shall notify the employee orally or in writing
within two business days as to the approval or denial of their FMLA request,
and that any sick, personal, or vacation leave will be set off against the
leave pursuant to the supervisor’s policy regarding it (see division (H)
below).
      (2)   Oral notice will be followed by written confirmation by payday
following.
      (3)   If the supervisor is late complying with these notice requirements,
paid leave may only be set off against FMLA leave prospectively, once notice is
given (see division (H) below).
      (4)   The supervisor shall note the starting and ending dates of leave,
reinstatement procedures, and utilization of accrued paid leave.
      (5)   The supervisor shall send a copy of this written notice to the
insurance office. The human resources office shall notify the employee as to
the status of insurance coverage and the employee’s contribution, if
applicable.
   (H)   Utilization of accrued paid leave. Employees are required to utilize
accrued paid leave for all or part of the FMLA 12-week period. Unpaid FMLA
shall be authorized when all eligible accrued paid leaves have been exhausted
(sick leave and vacation). Family and medical leave and paid leave, for
conditions that qualify under FMLA, run concurrently. The entire 12-week FMLA
is not in addition to the paid leave, just any remaining portion after the paid
leave time is subtracted.
   (I)   Leave period.
      (1)   An eligible employee may take up to 12 workweeks of FMLA during a
12-month period. The 12-month period shall be measured forward from the date
the employee's first FMLA begins (for example, an employee whose eligible FMLA
begins September 15, 2010 is entitled up to 12 weeks from September 15, 2010
through September 14, 2011).
      (2)   Employees may request intermittent or reduced leave schedules to
accommodate medically necessary treatment in connection with a serious health
condition.
      (3)   Intermittent or reduced leave may not exceed the total hours an
employee would have worked during their regular 12-week schedule. If
intermittent or reduced leave is approved, the supervisor may require the
employee to schedule the leave so as not to unduly disrupt the department
operation, or the employee may be placed in alternate positions, which better
accommodates the intermittent leave schedule.
   (J)   Insurance coverage during FMLA.
      (1)   Employees are entitled to maintain the same health benefits during
the FMLA. However, it is the employee’s responsibility to make arrangements
through the Human Resources Director for their portion of the contribution of
monthly premiums.
      (2)   Should an employee fail to return to work after his or her FMLA
expires, the supervisor may recover from the employee the town’s share of
health insurance premiums paid during the period of unpaid FMLA.
      (3)    Insurance premiums may not be recovered if the employee fails to
return to work due to the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious
health condition of circumstances beyond the employee’s control.
   (K)   Working while on family and medical leave.
      (1)   An employee who is self-employed, accepts other employment, or
works for any other employer during a family and medical leave, must report
such work immediately to the Human Resources Director.
      (2)   An employee who is self-employed or accepts other employment or
works for any other current employer, performing work of a like or similar
character or exertion as that which the employee performed for the town, during
family medical leave shall be considered to have terminated employment with the
town as of the date of such employment began.
      (3)   Employees described in division (K)(2) above may be required to
reimburse the town for the employer-paid portion of group health insurance
premium contributions made while the employee was on leave.
   (L)   Job restoration.
      (1)   During family and medical leave, every effort will be made by the
town to hold an employee’s position open until he or she returns to work.
      (2)   However, based upon the necessity of continuing operations during
an employee’s absence, the town may choose to fill any non-elected position. If
the position is filled while an employee is on the FMLA, the town will make
every effort to place the employee in an equivalent position, with equivalent
pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment. In addition, the
position into which the employee is placed will have substantially similar
duties.
      (3)   If an employee’s position is eliminated during the time of family
and medical leave, through layoff or restructuring, the employee will not be
entitled to return to his or her former or an equivalent position.
      (4)   The town does not have “light duty” positions, but if a health care
provider indicates in writing that an employee is not able to perform all the
essential functions of the position, but that the employee may perform his or
her job with restrictions, the town will make every effort to cooperate with a
doctor’s written orders for restrictions placed on an employee in order for the
employee to perform meaningful and necessary work the town needs done.
Arrangements for restricted work must be made in writing and approved by the
supervisor in advance of an employee’s return.
      (5)   The town does have a “return to work” policy. Please contact the
Human Resources Director or Safety Director for details of this policy.
      (6)   Employees whose FMLA was for their own personal medical conditions
must, prior to reinstatement, submit a medical certification to the Human
Resources Director as to their ability to return to work, subject to a second
medical opinion as deemed necessary by the supervisor, or a third medical
opinion as provided in the FMLA.
      (7)   Employees on FMLA who do not return to work immediately following
release from the health care provider as fully restored to perform all the
essential functions of his or her positions, shall be considered to have
voluntarily terminated employment as the date of the release.
      (8)   Employment will be terminated if an employee is not able to return
to work at the end of the FMLA. There may be exceptions to termination required
under the ADA, and the town will comply with ADA.
   (M)   Definitions under Family and Medical Leave Act.

incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability.

a parent to the employee (in loco parentis).
         (b)   IN-LAWS are not included in the definition of PARENT.
      SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION.
         (a)   An illness, injury, impairment, or physical/mental condition
that involves a period of treatment that requires absence from employment for
more than three calendar days and involves care by a health care provider.
         (b)   Also includes continuing treatment of chronic or long-term
incurable conditions and prenatal care.
         (c)   The Clerk-Treasurer’s office will assist with any questions in
determining a SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION under the FMLA.
      SPOUSE.
         (a)   A husband or wife.
         (b)   Unmarried domestic partners do not qualify for FMLA to care for
their partner.
   (N)   Absences resulting from work-related injury or illness. An absence
resulting from a work-related injury or illness (workers’ compensation) will be
considered as FMLA leave time if the employee has worked for the town for at
least 12 months and for a minimum of 1,250 hours in the immediately preceding
calendar year (not including holidays). The employee will be mailed the
notification that they are being placed on FMLA during their absence from work
while on workers’ compensation.
   (O)   FMLA and Armed Forces.
      (1)   General. On January 28, 2008, President Bush signed into law H.R.
4986, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2008, which amends the
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) to permit a “spouse, son, daughter,
parent, or next of kin” to take up to 26 workweeks of leave to care for a
“member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or
Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is
otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability
retired list, for a serious injury or illness.” Under the first of these new
military family leave entitlements, eligible employees who are family members
of covered service members will be able to take up to 26 workweeks of leave in
a “single 12-month period” to care for a covered service member with a serious
illness or injury incurred in the line of duty on active duty.
      (2)   Qualifying exigency leave. The second new military leave
entitlement helps families of members of the National Guard and Reserves manage
their affairs while the member is on active duty in support of a contingency
operation. This provision makes the normal 12 workweeks of FMLA job-protected
leave available to eligible employees with a covered military member serving in
the National Guard or Reserves to use for “any qualifying exigency” arising out
of the fact that a covered military member is on active duty or called to
active-duty status in support of a contingency operation. The department’s
final rule defines qualifying exigency by referring to a number of broad
categories for which employees can use FMLA leave:
         (a)   Short notice deployment;
         (b)   Military events and related activities;
         (c)   Childcare and school activities;
         (d)   Financial and legal arrangements;
         (e)   Counseling;
         (f)   Rest and recuperation;
         (g)   Post-deployment activities; and
         (h)   Additional activities not encompassed in the other categories,
but agreed to by the employer and employee.
      (3)   Definitions. For the purposes of this division (O), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires
otherwise.
         ACTIVE DUTY. Duty under a call or order to active duty under a
provision of law referred to in 10 U.S.C. § 101(a).
         COMBINED LEAVE TOTAL.
            1.   During the single 12-month period described in division (O)
(1), an eligible employee shall be entitled to a combined total of 26 workweeks
of leave.
            2.   The number of workweeks of leave to which both a husband and
wife (if they are employed by the town) under this leave may be limited to 26
workweeks during the single 12-month period.
         COVERED SERVICE MEMBER. A member of the Armed Forces, including a
member of the National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment,
recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on
the temporary disability retired list, for a SERIOUS INJURY OR ILLNESS.
         NEXT OF KIN. Used with respect to an individual, means the nearest
blood relative of that individual.
         OUTPATIENT STATUS. With respect to a covered service member, means the
status of a member of the Armed Forces assigned to:
            1.   A military medical treatment facility as an outpatient; or
            2.   A unit established for the purpose of providing command and
control of members of the Armed Forces receiving medical care as outpatients.
         SERIOUS INJURY OR ILLNESS. In the case of a member of the Armed
Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, means an injury
or illness incurred by the member in line of duty on active duty in the Armed
Forces that may render the member medically unfit to perform the duties of the
members office, grade, rank, or rating.
§ 35.113  GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE/LIFE  INSURANCE.
   (A)   Insurance benefits are available to all full-time employees who have
completed a 90-day probationary period.
   (B)   If an employee chooses to have a spouse and/or dependents covered on
the insurance plan, the employee must pay an additional cost.
   (C)   Please contact the Clerk-Treasurer for more information on the health
and life insurance plans.
§ 35.114  RETIREMENT PLAN.

with the town are eligible to participate in the retirement program offered
through the town.
   (B)   The town will contribute 6% of the employee’s gross pay into his or
her retirement plan.
   (C)   All employees are encouraged to contribute a portion of their salary
into their retirement plan.
   (D)   For more information about the benefits, please contact the Clerk-
Treasurer’s office.
§ 35.115  WORKERS’ COMPENSATION.
   (A)   Generally. Workers’ compensation insurance provides coverage for work-
related injuries and illnesses as required under the workers’ compensation laws
of the state. Workers’ compensation insurance covers all authorized expenses
related to the treatment of a work-related illness or injury and provides “lost
time benefits” when an employee must be absent from work on a workers’
compensation disability leave.
   (B)   Reporting a work-related injury or illness.
      (1)   All injuries must be reported to a supervisor as soon as possible
even though medical attention may not be needed at the time.
      (2)   A delay in reporting an injury may result in the loss of a medical
expense benefit.
      (3)   The supervisor is to file the written report with the Clerk-
Treasurer’s office within 24 hours of the injury or illness.
   (C)   Seeking medical attention.
      (1)   An employee with a minor injury occurring between the hours of
operation listed below, shall seek medical attention at:
Margaret Mary Occupational Health & Wellness Center
   1051 State Route 229, Batesville, IN 47006
   Phone: 812.932.5105
   Monday: 7:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
   Tuesday through Friday: 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
      (2)   An employee with a serious or life-threatening injury should be
transported to the nearest appropriate hospital.
      (3)   Compensation and benefits for an absence resulting from a work-
related injury or illness and a workers’ compensation disability leave.
      (4)   Lost time benefits due to a work-related injury or illness begin on
the eighth calendar day following an employee’s absence because of a work-
related injury or illness. If an employee wishes to be paid for work missed
during the first seven calendar days, he or she must use any accrued time.
      (5)   If the absence from work extends longer than 21 calendar days, the
initial seven-day waiting period will be retroactively paid by the workers’
compensation insurance carrier.
   (D)   Insurance coverage.
      (1)   Group health insurance coverage and other insurance benefits will
continue on the same basis, as coverage would have been provided had the
employee been continuously employed during the period of a workers’
compensation disability leave as long as the employee pays his or her regular
portion of the premium on a timely basis.
      (2)   Employees must arrange with the Clerk-Treasurer’s office to pay
their portion of this insurance coverage.

hold the town blameless from any and all claims for damages, or for
nonperformance, with state and other health regulations and requirements
governing the location and operation of the disposal site, and the collection,
transportation, and disposal of the garbage and other refuse, and will furnish

RATES AND CHARGES
§ 51.100  ESTABLISHMENT OF RATES AND CHARGES.
   For the use of the service rendered by the sewage works, rates and charges
shall be collected from the owners of each and every lot, parcel of real
estate, or building that is connected with the town sanitary system or
otherwise discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other
liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the sanitary sewage system of the
town. Such rates and charges include user charges, debt service costs,
excessive strength surcharges, and other service charges, which rates and
charges shall be payable as hereinafter provided and shall be in an amount
determined as follows:
   (A)   The sewage rates and charges shall be based on the quantity of water
used on or in the property or premises subject to such rates and charges as the
same may be measured by the water meter there in use, plus a base charge based
on the size of water meter installed, except as herein otherwise provided. For
the purpose of billing and collecting the charges for sewage service, the water
meters shall be read monthly and the users shall be billed each month (or
period equaling a month). The water usage schedule on which the amount of said
rates and charges shall be determined is as follows:
      (1)   Treatment rate per 1,000 gallons of usage per month for all users
is $6.70; and
      (2)   In addition, the base rate per month is as follows:
Meter Size Minimum Charge
Meter Size          Minimum Charge
5/8-inch - 3/4-inch $20.90
1-inch              $50.25

6-inch              $1,780.55
 
   (B)   For users of the sewage works that are unmetered water users, or
accurate meter readings are not available, the monthly charge shall be
determined by equivalent single-family dwelling units, except as herein
provided. Sewage service bills shall be rendered once each month (or period
equaling a month). The schedule on which said rates and charges will be
determined is as follows:
      (1)   The monthly residential rate for single-family residence/unit is
$43.70; and
      (2)   For users that do not meet the above category, their treatment rate
will be based on applying the metered rates to estimated usage as determined by
the Council on an individual basis.

   (A)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water, or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in
excess of 10,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of
the town that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does
not and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other
interested party shall install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring
devices, or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the
town for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water
supplied by the municipal water works, and the water used thereon or therein is
not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not acceptable
to the town, then the owner or other interested party, at the owner’s expense,
shall install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the town.
   (C)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the town
wastewater, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water supplied by the
Town Waterworks and, in addition, uses water from another source which is not
measured by a water meter or is measured by a meter not acceptable to the town,
then the owner or other interested party, at the owner’s expense, shall install
and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any adequate and
approved method of measurement acceptable to the town.

§ 51.103  CHARGES BASED ON STRENGTH AND CHARACTER OF DISCHARGES.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered to users, the town shall base its charges not
only on the volume, but also on the strength and character of the stronger-
than-normal domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and
dispose of.  The town shall require the user to determine the strength and
content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly,
into the sanitary sewage system in such manner, by such method, and at such
times as the town may deem practicable in the light of the conditions and
attending circumstances of the case, in order to determine the proper charge. 
The user shall furnish a central sampling point available to the town at all
times.
   (B)   Normal domestic waste strength should not exceed a BOD of 250 mg/l
(milligrams per liter of fluid) or suspended solids in excess of 250 mg/l. 
Additional charges for treating stronger-than-normal industrial waste shall be
made on the following basis:
      (1)   Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids.  There shall be an
additional charge of $0.38 per pound of suspended solids in excess of 250 mg/l;
and
      (2)   Rate surcharge based upon BOD.  There shall be an additional charge
of $0.38 per pound of biochemical oxygen demand in excess of 250 mg/l.
   (C)   The determination of suspended solids and BOD, contained in the waste
shall be in accordance with the latest copy of Standard Methods for the
Elimination of Water, Sewage, and Industrial Wastes, as written by the American
Public Health Association, the American Water Works Association, and the Water
Pollution Control Federation, and in accordance with Guidelines Establishing
Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants, 40 C.F.R. part 136.

§ 51.104  COST STUDIES FOR USER CLASSES.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain
fair and equitable and be in proportion to the cost of providing services to
the various users or user classes, the town shall cause a study to be made
within a reasonable period of time following the first 12 months of operation,
subsequent to the completion of the improvement project.  The study shall
include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the costs associated with the
treatment of excessive strength effluents from industrial users, volume and
delivery flow rate characteristics attributed to the various users or user
classes, the financial position of the sewage works, and the adequacy of its
revenue to provide reasonable funds for operation and maintenance,
replacements, debt service requirements, and capital improvements to the waste
treatment systems.
   (B)   Thereafter, on an annual basis, within a reasonable period of time
following the normal accounting period, the town shall cause a similar study to
be made for the purpose of reviewing the fairness and equity of the rates and
charges for sewage services on a continuing basis.  The studies shall be
conducted by officers and/or employees of the town, or by a firm of certified
public accountants and/or a firm of consulting engineers, which firms shall
have experience in these studies.

(1995 Code, § 51.105)  (Ord. 2-1976, passed 3-18-1976)
§ 51.121  COST RECOVERY CHARGES.
   To comply with federal regulations, in the case of federal grant assistance
for the construction of waste treatment works, where it has been determined
that industrial users, as defined in §
51.120 of this subchapter, or as amended by appropriate federal regulations,
are required to reimburse a portion of the federal grant amount allocable to
the capital cost of construction facilities for the treatment of industrial
wastes.  Rates and charges shall be collected from each industrial user
connected to the municipal sewage works or who otherwise discharges sewage,
water, or liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the municipal waste
treatment system, which charges shall be payable as hereinafter provided, and
shall be in an amount determinable as follows.
   (A)   The industrial cost recovery charges for the treatment of industrial
wastes at the treatment plant shall be based upon the volume of sewage flow
billed to industrial users, as determined in accordance with appropriate
provisions for determining billed flow and the total strength and character of
industrial wastes which is introduced into the waste treatment system.  The
strength and character of industrial wastes shall be measured at the industrial
user’s expense and furnished to the town.  The owner or industrial user shall
furnish a central sampling point available to the town at all times.  In the
event that measurements of the strength and character of industrial wastes are
not provided to the town on a timely basis, the measurements of the strength
and character of industrial wastes shall be determined by the town on the basis
of a sample, authorized hereunder, to be taken by the town for the purpose of
appropriate billing.  The industrial cost recovery rates for the treatment of
wastes shall be as follows:
 
Industrial Cost Recovery Rates
Flow                                                   Rate
Monthly pounds of BOD in excess of 250 mg/l            $0.30 per pound
Monthly pounds of BOD of suspended solids in excess of $0.30 per pound
250 mg/l
Monthly volume flow, which includes normal domestic    $0.58 per 1,000 gallons
wastes BOD 250 mg/l and suspended solids 250 mg/l
 
   (B)   However, in the event an industrial user can and does show to the
satisfaction of the town that a portion of the total monthly billed sewage flow
is from sanitary conveniences, then the flow and pollutant loadings to which
the industrial cost recovery charge is applied shall be determined on the basis
of net flow and pollutant loadings, excluding sanitary conveniences.
   (C)   The industrial cost recovery charges for treatment services on or
after the effective date as stated in §
51.121 of this subchapter, shall be prepared and billed monthly.
(1995 Code, § 51.106)  (Ord. 2-1976, passed 3-18-1976)
§ 51.122  USERS SUBJECT TO COST RECOVERY CHARGES.
   The town shall determine which users are subject to paying the industrial
cost recovery charges in the following manner:
   (A)   The town shall require appropriate employees of the sewage works to
review billing records and prepare a list of all potential industrial users, as
defined in §
51.120 of this subchapter.
   (B)   The list of all potential industrial users shall be analyzed on the
basis of data available at the sewage works billing office (that is, type of
business, volume charges, excessive loading charges, estimated number of
employees, and the like) for the purpose of developing preliminary lists of
probably “industrial” and probably “nonindustrial” users.
   (C)   The town shall conduct an immediate survey of all probable
“industrial” users in order to substantiate the validity of classifying a
particular user as an “industrial” user.  Each user initially classified as an
industrial user shall be notified as to the classification.
   (D)   After completing the survey of all probable “industrial” users, the
town shall review the list of probable “nonindustrial” users to determine if
the initial classification of any of these users should be reconsidered. Where
appropriate, individual users will be contacted in order to determine the
proper classification.
   (E)   After an industrial user has been notified of a user classification,
the user may request reconsideration by furnishing data and measurements
acceptable to the town for the determination of sewage discharge.  The town
shall have the right to measure and determine the strength and content of all
sewage and waste discharges, either directly or indirectly, into the town’s
sanitary sewage system, in a manner and by a method as it may deem practicable
in the light of the conditions and attending circumstances of each case in
order to determine the proper user classification.
   (F)   Within a reasonable period of time following completion of the
wastewater construction project, the town shall have completed the initial
classification of all industrial users.  During the first calendar year of
operation, subsequent to completion of the construction project, and annually
thereafter, the town will review, classify and reclassify all users as either
industrial or non-industrial users based upon measurements and data obtained by
the town or furnished by individual uses. Normally, each user will retain a
user classification until the next succeeding classification period.  However,
if there is a substantial change in the strength, volume, or delivery flow rate
characteristics introduced into the treatment works by an individual user, then
the classification of that user may be reviewed and established during the year
in the light of the conditions and attending circumstances of each case.
(1995 Code, § 51.107)  (Ord. 2-1976, passed 3-18-1976)
§ 51.123  DETERMINING RATES.
   The basis for the industrial cost recovery rates and charges included in §
51.122 of this subchapter are as follows.
   (A)   Total estimated federal grant amount to be awarded for the
construction of the waste treatment facilities under Project Number C-180502
amounts to approximately $726,975.
   (B)   The assignment of treatment facilities cost to flow and loadings is in
accordance with EPA suggestions, where unit process cost studies are not
undertaken.  The percentage of cost identified with the various treatment
facilities are as follows:
      (1)   Treatment of waste volume: 40%;
      (2)   Treatment of suspended solids: 30%; and
      (3)   Treatment of BOD: 30%.
   (C)   The design capacity of the treatment plant is as follows:
      (1)   Flow: average daily flow of 180,000 gallons × 365 days = 65.7 mg
average annual design flow capacity;
      (2)   Suspended solids: design capacity of 250 (mg/l) × annual flow
capacity 65.7 mg × weight will result in 136,870 pounds average annual design
capacity; and
      (3)   BOD: design capacity 250 mg/l × annual flow capacity 65.7 mg ×
weight will result in 136,870 pounds average annual design capacity.
   (D)   The industrial cost recovery period will be 30 years.
   (E)   The average annual basis for the cost recovery charge will amount to
$24,232 ($726,975 federal grant, divided by 30 years recovery period).
   (F)   The total annual basis for the cost recovery charge allocated to
treatment functions is as follows:
      (1)   Treatment of waste volume ($24,232 × 40%): $9,692;
      (2)   Treatment of suspended solids ($24,232 × 30%): $7,270; and
      (3)   Treatment of BOD ($24,232 × 30%): $7,270.
   (G)    The industrial cost recovery rates for the treatment charges are
computed on the basis of the annual functional costs of treatment, divided by
average annual design capacity, in the following manner:
      (1)   Treatment of waste volume: annual functional cost $9,692 divided by
annual capacity 65.7 mg equals $0.15 per 1,000 gallons;
      (2)   Treatment of suspended solids: annual functional cost $7,270
divided by annual capacity 136,870 pounds equals $0.05 per pound; and
      (3)   Treatment of biochemical oxygen demand: annual functional cost
$7,270 divided by annual capacity 136,870 pounds equals $0.05 per pound.
   (H)   The rates computed in division (G) above would result in total
recovery of the federal grant amount if all users were subject to the
industrial cost recovery requirement, and provided that the treatment plant was
operated at capacity during the cost recovery period. Therefore, these rates
will ensure that each industrial user will pay only that portion of the federal
grant amount applicable to the costs of the treatment facilities actually
utilized to treat industrial wastes, as determined by each industrial user’s
flow and pollutant loadings.
   (I)   The above industrial cost recovery charges do not include any interest
component.
   (J)   An industrial user who discontinues use of the treatment works is not
subject to industrial cost recovery payments, beyond the period of use.
   (K)   Industrial users who commence to use the treatment works at some
future date are not subject to industrial cost recovery charges before the
period of use.
(1995 Code, § 51.108)  (Ord. 2-1976, passed 3-18-1976)
§ 51.124  ESTABLISHMENT OF FUND.
   The town shall account for all industrial cost recovery payments in the
following manner.
   (A)   All revenues derived from the industrial cost recovery rates and
charges shall be segregated
and kept in a special fund, separate and apart from all other funds of the
town.  The special fund shall be designated the Sewage Works Industrial Cost
Recovery Fund, and payment of this amount into this Fund shall be deemed a
reasonable expense of operation of the sewage works for the purpose of
computing net operating revenue.
   (B)   Within 120 days following the end of the first calendar year after
completion of construction and improvements to the treatment works, and
annually thereafter, the town shall return 50% of the amounts recovered through
the industrial cost recovery charges, together with any interest earned
thereon, to the U.S. Treasury.  The remaining 50% retained by the town shall be
invested in authorized obligations of the U.S. government, or any agency
thereof.
   (C)   Eighty percent of the funds retained by the town in the Sewage Works
Industrial Cost Recovery Fund, or authorized investments and the interest
earned thereon, shall be expended only for the purpose of eligible costs of
expansion or reconstruction of the treatment works.  All expansion or
reconstruction programs must be approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency prior to commitment or expenditure of the retained funds. The remaining
20% of the funds retained by the town may be utilized for any authorized use
associated with the sewage works.

records for the purpose of independently verifying the flow and characteristics
of industrial wastes which are introduced into the treatment works.  No waste
introduced into the waste treatment system shall interfere with the operation
or performance of the sewage treatment works.  All users are subject to the
requirements of pretreatment standards established by federal and state law.

    The town shall install and maintain at its expense that portion of the
service from the main to the lot or easement line, including the necessary tap,
fittings, and shut-off valve; and the customer shall install and maintain at
the customer’s expense that portion of the service from the meter setter to the
premises, including a stop and waste cock at the end of the house side of the
service.  The minimum earth cover of the customer’s service shall be 36
inches.  The customer shall determine the size and kind of service to be
installed.
(1995 Code, § 52.31)  (Ord. 1967-2, passed - -1967)
§ 52.32  CUSTOMER TO PROVIDE EASEMENT.
   Each customer shall grant or convey, or shall cause to be granted or

owned or controlled by the customer wherever the easement or right-of-way is
necessary for the municipal water facilities and lines, so as to be able to
furnish service to the customer.
(1995 Code, § 52.32)  (Ord. 1967-2, passed - -1967)
§ 52.33  METER ACCESSIBILITY.
    Piping on the premises of a customer must be so installed that connections
are conveniently located with respect to the municipal lines and mains.  The
customer shall provide a place of metering which is unobstructed and accessible
at all times.
(1995 Code, § 52.33)  (Ord. 1967-2, passed - -1967)
§ 52.34  CUSTOMER’S LINE.
   (A)   The customer’s service line shall be installed and maintained by the
customer at the customer’s expense in a safe and efficient manner and in
accordance with the municipal rules and regulations and with the regulations of
the State Board of Health.
   (B)   The customer is responsible for the water line from the meter tile to
his or her point of destination.  When a customer chooses to install the meter

1995)
§ 52.35  MAIN EXTENSIONS.
   (A)    The town will construct extensions to its water lines to points

the town shall not be required to make installations unless the customer pays
to the town the entire cost of the installation.
   (B)   All line extensions shall be evidenced by a contract signed by the
town and the person advancing funds for the extension.
   (C)   If refund of the advance is to be made the following method shall
apply:  20% of the total gross revenue of water sales per year for each service
connected to the new extension described in the agreement, for a period not to
exceed five years, provided that the aggregate payments do not exceed the total
amount deposited.
   (D)   No refund shall be made from any revenue received from any lines
leading up to or beyond the particular line extension covered by contract.
   (E)   All decisions in connection with the manner of installation of any
extension and maintenance thereof shall remain in the exclusive control of the
town and the extension shall be the property of the town and no other person
shall have any right, title, or interest therein.
   (F)   The Sunman Utility Department will not make line extensions into new
areas, unless it is economically feasible to the water utility in the judgment
of the Town Board and the Sunman Utility Department that a profitable return
can be made in a reasonable period of time.  This is thought to be
approximately four years.
(1995 Code, § 52.35)  (Ord. 1967-2, passed - -1967; Ord. 1995-3, passed 3-16-
1995)
§ 52.36  METERING EQUIPMENT; LINE REPAIR.
   (A)    At the most advantageous point for the utility, the Sunman Utility
Department shall furnish and maintain on or inside the customers’ property line
all metering equipment.  Metering equipment used to furnish water and to meter
water at the customers’ property remains the property of the Sunman Utility
Department and therefore cannot be altered or tampered with in any way or
manner.  The customer shall furnish and maintain the water line lateral from
the meter box to its destination.
   (B)   Whenever possible, meters must be placed on adjoining property lines
so that one tap can feed two meters in the same tile.  When this method is
used, a one-inch water tap will be made; therefore, each resident shall pay a
total tapping fee.
(1995 Code, § 52.36)  (Ord. 1995-3, passed 3-16-1995)
§ 52.37  MULTIPLE USAGE DEVELOPMENTS; INTERNAL METERING
    In any multiple usage development, such as an apartment complex, trailer
court, and the like, the cost of internal metering, (lateral lines, metering
boxes, valves, lids, saddles, and the like) will be at no expense to the Sunman
Utility Department.  The Sunman Utility Department will furnish the meter only.
(1995 Code, § 52.37)  (Ord. 1995-3, passed 3-16-1995)
Cross-reference:
   Multiple usage developments; general provisions, see §
52.19
§ 52.38  SHUT-OFF VALVE REQUIRED.
   The customer shall furnish, install, and maintain a shut-off valve in the
water line at a point that will protect his or her property in case of failure
of the water utility lines or equipment.  This valve shall be placed at a point
where the property owner’s line enters his or  her residence or building.  This
allows the customer to shut off the water source when needed repairs are
required.  At no time is the customer or property owner to shut off the source
of supply in the meter tile.  If the water utility is requested to shut off the
water at the meter tile, the customer will be required to pay a service fee.
(1995 Code, § 52.38)  (Ord. 1995-3, passed 3-16-1995)
§ 52.39  EXTENSIONS INTO SUBDIVISIONS.
   Whenever it becomes necessary to extend a main water line into a
subdivision, plot of ground, or group of lots owned or purchased by a builder
or contractor, the extension will be made at no expense to the Sunman Utility
Department.  Only C-900 cast iron size PVC line of required size will be used
in a new main construction.  The builder or contractor will also pay the Sunman
Utility Department a tap-in fee in the amount of the current rate reference of
non-recurring charges.  After this is installed and inspected and after one
year of maintenance-free service, the town will assume responsibility.
(1995 Code, § 52.39)  (Ord. 1995-3, passed 3-16-1995)
§ 52.40  PRE-CONSTRUCTION PLANNING.
   (A)   Prior to the beginning of any construction project, detailed scaled
maps and plans must be submitted to the Sunman Utility Department. Plans must
outline the proposed distribution system, showing all mains and fire hydrants,
as well as valve locations.  Further planning of the proposed project should
consist of, but not be limited to:
      (1)   Location of other utility service lines (gas and telephone
underground);
      (2)   Staking of line and grade;
      (3)   Determination of material quantities;
      (4)   The acquisition of all necessary material;
      (5)   Planning and arrangements for the necessary tool, equipment, and
personnel to effectively complete the installation;
      (6)   Obtaining necessary barricades, signs, and safety equipment for
safety on and around the project site; and
      (7)   Obtaining proper easements and permits from property owners and
governmental agencies.
   (B)   Failure to comply will delay construction.
(1995 Code, § 52.40)  (Ord. 1995-3, passed 3-16-1995)
§ 52.41  WATER MAIN SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   Size of water mains will not be less than six inches in diameter
(residential) and not less than eight inches in diameter (for commercial or
industrial zoned installations).  Material of all mains must be C-900 PVC or
cast iron.
   (B)   Depths of lines shall be not less than three and one-half feet but not
more than four feet.
   (C)   Loops rather than dead-ends are recommended.  Where dead-ends are
used, a two-inch minimum blow-off hydrant shall be installed.
   (D)   All material must be provided by the independent contractor from his
or her supplier.  All material is to be of standard quality and weight, and
mains are to be provided with properly serviced valves applicable to the size
of the main.
   (E)   Under the guidelines and rules of the state, as well as the advice and
instruction of the State Board of Accounts Examiner, the Sunman Utility
Department must not purchase for resale to contractors or reduce its inventory
by sales to contractors.  Such policies are unacceptable as they pertain to the
financial accountability of the Sunman Utility Department.
(1995 Code, § 52.41)  (Ord. 1995-3, passed 3-16-1995)
§ 52.42  INSTALLATION OF WATER MAINS.
   (A)   The bottom of the pipe trench shall be smooth and free of rocks or
other hard objects which would cause a bridge in the pipe support.
   (B)   The barrel of the pipe should be directly on the bottom of the trench
and the trench excavated a few additional inches in depth at the joints of the
pipe if a flat bottom trench is permissible.  The new main should be backfilled
with clean fill only.
   (C)   All bends, terminal points, and extended appendages not anchored
positively to the pipe line should be adequately blocked since pressures tend
to blow off non- anchored ending points.
   (D)   Blow-off valves in low areas and on the ends of pipes shall be
provided for cleaning of a main by flushing.
   (E)   Prior to cover-up of the main, inspection of the work must be made by
the Sunman Utility Department.
(1995 Code, § 52.42)  (Ord. 1995-3, passed 3-16-1995)
§ 52.43  FIRE HYDRANTS.
   Standard “Mueller” three-way hydrants are to have six-inch or larger
connection to mains with a minimum of five-inch valve opening.  Hydrants are to
be properly located so that there will be a fire hydrant every 300 feet in the
mercantile (commercial) and industrial areas and every 600 feet in residential
areas, thus providing every building in the town limits access to a standard
town fire hydrant within 500 feet.
(1995 Code, § 52.43)  (Ord. 1995-3, passed 3-16-1995)
§ 52.44  DISINFECTION AND BACTERIOLOGICAL TESTING.
   (A)   Because of the rules of the 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act, being 42
U.S.C. §§ 300f et seq., administered by the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management, strict water safety standards must be adhered to.  These rules
apply to and are the responsibility of both the contractor and the Sunman
Utility Department.
   (B)   Before disinfection, the new main must be thoroughly flushed by the
Sunman Utility Department with the supervision of the town.
   (C)   Bacteriological testing shall be done by the Sunman Utility
Department.
   (D)   During the process of disinfection, a solution of chlorine and water
is put into the main through a corporation stop on the upstream and near the
valve where water is introduced into the system.  A 50 ppm residual shall be
required.  After 24 hours, there should be a well-defined residual remaining in
the pipe.
   (E)   A subsequent test of a bacteriological sample taken after pipe is
refilled with system water must show no coliform organisms present.  The
service line must be tested two consecutive times, 24 hours apart.

(1995 Code, § 130.03) Penalty, see §
130.99
LOITERING
§ 130.15  LOITERING PROHIBITED.
   (A)   A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in a
place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if
it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled
the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a
loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspect’s escape.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a
police officer, or where a “no loitering” sign or signs have been posted, to
loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or quasi-public sidewalk,
street, curb, cross-walk, walkway area, mall or that portion of private
property utilized for public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the
free passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any
person to block, obstruct, or prevent free access to the entrance to any
building open to the public.
   (C)   It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter in or near any
thoroughfare or place open to the public for the purpose of inducing, enticing,
soliciting, or procuring another to commit an act of prostitution. Among the
circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such action is
consistent with the intent to induce, entice, solicit, or procure another to
commit an act of prostitution are that the person is a known prostitute or
panderer and repeatedly beckons, in the attempt to stop or engage male or
female passersby in conversation, or repeatedly stops or attempts to stop motor
vehicles by engaging their operators by hailing, waving of arms, or other
bodily gestures. The violator’s conduct must be such as to demonstrate a
specific intent to induce, entice, solicit, or procure another to commit an act
of prostitution. No arrest shall be made for a violation of this division
unless the arresting officer first affords the person an opportunity to explain
his or her conduct, and no one shall be convicted of violating this division if
it appears at trial that the explanation given was true and disclosed a lawful
purpose.
   (D)   For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACEhas the following
definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning:  an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles
(whether moving or not), and buildings open to the general public, including
those which serve food or drink or provide entertainment, and the doorways and
entrances to buildings or dwellings and the grounds enclosing them.
