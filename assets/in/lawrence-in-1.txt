§ 1-2-2-10. PARTICIPATION IN MEETINGS BY ELECTRONIC MEANS.
   The Council hereby establishes the following policy for participation in
meetings by electronic means of communication:
   (A)   A Councilmember may participate in a meeting by any electronic means
of communication that allows all participating members of the Council to
communicate with one another and allows the public to simultaneously attend and
observe the meeting, unless the meeting is an executive session.
   (B)   The minutes of the meeting shall identify whether members were
physically present, participated by electronic means, or were absent. The
minutes shall also indicate the electronic means by which the member
participated (e.g., Zoom or Microsoft Teams), and that the public attended and
observed the meeting, if the meeting was not held in executive session.
   (C)   All votes shall be taken by roll call vote when at least one member is
participating by electronic means of communication. A technological failure in
an electronic means of communication that prevents or disrupts simultaneous
communication by a Councilmember or member of the public who is participating
electronically does not prevent the Council from conducting the meeting or
affect the validity of an action taken by the Council, provided that the
members physically present and the members participating electronically without
technological failure still constitute a quorum and meet applicable Council
majority voting requirements.
   (D)   At least 50% of the members must be physically present at a meeting
(i.e., five members). To ensure that enough members are physically present to
meet this 50% requirement, members participating by electronic means shall
notify the Council President 48 hours in advance of a meeting of his or her
intent to participate in the meeting electronically.
   (E)   The electronic means of communication must allow:
      (1)   All of the participating members to simultaneously communicate with
one another; and
      (2)   The public to simultaneously attend and observe the meeting, unless
the meeting is held in executive session.
   (F)   A member who participates in the meeting by an electronic means of
communication shall be considered present for purposes of establishing a quorum
but may participate in any final action taken at the meeting only if the member
can be seen and heard.
   (G)   (1)   A member may not attend more than 50% of the meetings in a
calendar year by means of electronic communication, unless the member's
electronic participation is due to:
         (a)   Military service;
         (b)   Illness or other medical condition;
         (c)   Death of a relative; or
         (d)   An emergency involving actual or threatened injury to persons or
property.
      (2)   For example, if there are 24 Council meetings in a calendar year, a
member may not participate in more than 12 meetings electronically, unless one
of the above exceptions applies.
   (H)   A member may not participate in a meeting by electronic communication
if the governing body is attempting to take final action to:
      (1)   Adopt a budget;
      (2)   Make a reduction in personnel;
      (3)   Initiate a referendum;
      (4)   Establish or increase a fee;
      (5)   Establish or increase a penalty;
      (6)   Use the governing body's eminent domain authority; or
      (7)   Establish, raise, or renew a tax.
   (I)   (1)   A governing body may not prohibit a member of the governing body
from attending consecutive meetings by electronic communication. A member may
attend two consecutive meetings (a set of meetings) by electronic
communication. A member shall physically attend at least one meeting between
sets of meetings that the member attends by electronic communication, unless
the member's absence is due to:
         (a)   Military service;
         (b)   Illness or other medical condition;
         (c)   Death of a relative; or
         (d)   An emergency involving actual or threatened injury to persons or
property.
      (2)   For example, a member may electronically attend a committee meeting
and a Council meeting consecutively on the same day, but should attend the next
committee or Council meeting in person.
   (J)   Notwithstanding the above, Councilmembers are not required to be
physically present at a meeting until a disaster emergency declared by the
Governor and/or the Mayor is terminated. During such emergency, the Council
shall follow the meeting procedures set forth in I.C. 5-14-1.5-3.7.

appeals of a decision of the Lawrence Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) pursuant to

if it is a Board. The Common Council may accept into evidence the written
record of the hearing before the BZA, if any, along with other evidence
introduced by City staff or interested parties. The Common Council shall
consider the matter de novo (deciding the case without reference to any legal
conclusion or assumption made by the previous decision of the BZA). However,
the decision of the Lawrence BZA is considered affirmed unless at least two-
thirds of the Council members (six members) voting, vote to deny the
administrative appeal, special exception, variance or administrative decision.
   (B)   Time allowed and procedure for hearing of appeals. Petitioners and
remonstrators, respectively, shall be permitted a total of 15 minutes each for

      (1)   Petitioners and persons appearing in support of the petition being
heard by the Council shall first have ten minutes for the presentation of
evidence, statements and arguments in support of the matter being considered. A
reasonable additional time shall then be allowed by the Council for cross-
examination and redirect examination of petitioner's witnesses.
      (2)   Remonstrators (persons appearing in opposition to the petition)
shall then have ten minutes for the presentation of evidence, statements and
arguments in opposition to the matter being considered. A reasonable additional
time shall then be allowed by the Council for cross-examination and redirect
examination of remonstrator's witnesses.
      (3)   The City planning and zoning staff, in person, by agent or by
attorney, shall be given a reasonable time by the presiding officer for the
presentation of evidence, statements and arguments in support of or in
opposition to the matter being considered.
      (4)   The petitioner shall then have five minutes for rebuttal, which
shall include only evidence, statements and arguments in rebuttal of
remonstrator's or the City planning and zoning staff's evidence and a brief
closing statement.
      (5)   Remonstrators (persons appearing in opposition to the petition)
shall then have ten minutes for rebuttal, which shall include only evidence,
statements and arguments in rebuttal of petitioner's rebuttal evidence and a
brief closing statement.
      (6)   The presiding officer shall have the authority to cut off
repetitious and irrelevant testimony and shall, unless otherwise directed by a
majority of the Council in session at that time, have authority to extend the
time periods specified above, when it is appropriate in the interest of
affording to all interested parties a fair hearing.
      (7)   The presiding officer shall have authority to waive the
requirements of this section in order to conduct a hearing in a manner which
she or he feels more appropriate.
      (8)   If, by two-thirds of the Council members voting, the Council
overturns the decision of the Lawrence BZA, the Council shall issue written
findings of its decision.
   (C)   All testimony under oath. All testimony before the Council shall be
given under oath or affirmation, which shall be administered by a person
qualified to administer oaths.

to work in excess of his or her regularly scheduled hours on any day, that
employee may be paid overtime computed at one and one-half times his or her
full hourly rate (base rate plus tech pay, shift differential, longevity,
college incentive pay and other included compensation) of pay for all hours
worked over his or her regularly scheduled number of hours. Department heads,

from FLSA overtime laws shall not be entitled to overtime pay, but will receive
compensatory leave equal to one hour for every one hour worked.
   (D)   The following shall not be included in calculating overtime for all
employees except civilian paramedics and EMTs: vacation leave, holiday leave,

process.

travel time of no more than one hour when the shift begins or ends more than
one hour before or after the next shift or court time, mandatory training time

Public Works and Safety meetings, review board hearings and medical
examinations. Officers shall receive a minimum of two hours' compensation for
court sessions attended during non-working hours.
   (G)   Police officers who serve as canine handlers shall be paid for one
hour at their regular hourly rate for canine care on days when the officer is
off duty. If the officer works more than 171 hours in a 28-day payroll
reporting period, the officer shall be paid for any hours over 171 hours at a
rate one and one-half times the officer's regular hourly rate.
   (H)   Firefighters shall be paid one and one-half of their regular hourly
rate for all regularly scheduled hours worked in excess of 212 in a 28-day
period.
   (I)   As an alternative to overtime pay, non-exempt employees may elect to

overtime worked. All police officers and firefighters may accrue a maximum of
480 hours of compensatory leave. All other employees may accrue a maximum of
240 hours of compensatory leave. The City reserves the right to substitute
payment for accrued compensatory leave, at its sole discretion, at the rate
earned by the employee at the time of payment. Compensatory leave may be
utilized by the employee, at a time mutually agreeable to the employee and the
employee's department head or supervisor, within a reasonable period after the
employee so requests, provided it does not unduly disrupt normal operations.
   (J)   Upon termination of employment, any compensatory leave accrued but
unused by a non-exempt employee will be paid to the employee at the employee's
final regular rate or the average regular rate received during the last three
years, whichever is higher. Compensatory leave accrued by an exempt employee
will not be paid upon termination.

accessibility of City programs and facilities or in the solicitation of bids or

subcontractors not to discriminate against any employee or applicant for
employment in the performance of the contract, with respect to hire, tenure,
terms, conditions or privileges of employment, or any matter directly or
indirectly related to employment, because of race, sex, sexual orientation,

("ADA"), as that Act may be amended from time to time, and as that definition
may be interpreted by the federal courts. To the extent that the ADA would
require a person to be a "qualified individual with a disability" in order to
be protected from a specific form or type of discrimination under the ADA, then
the same is true with respect to this section.

equal opportunities or any difference in the treatment of any person by reason
of race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, color, national
origin or ancestry, disability, age, or United States military service veteran
status;
         (b)   The exclusion from or failure or refusal to extend to any person
equal opportunities or any difference in the treatment of any person, because
the person filed a complaint alleging a violation of this section, testified in
a hearing before any members of the Board or otherwise cooperated with the
office or Board in the performance of its duties and functions under this
section, or requested assistance from the Board in connection with any alleged
discriminatory practice, whether or not such discriminatory practice was in
violation of this section.
      GENDER IDENTITY. An individual having or being perceived as having a
gender-related self-identity, self-image, appearance, expression or behavior
different from those characteristics traditionally associated with the
individual's assigned sex at birth.
      SEXUAL ORIENTATION. An individual's actual or perceived identity or
practice as a lesbian woman, gay male, bisexual person or heterosexual person.

from duty shall result in loss of pay for that absence until the absence is
properly reported; provided that an employee shall not be penalized for failure
to report where such failure is due to emergency conditions or other conditions
beyond the control of the employee. The propriety of the reasons for failure to
report shall be determined solely by the employee's department head.

days he or she would have been scheduled to work in a 180-calendar day period
without any reduction of the employee's accumulated sick leave prior to the
date of the illness or injury. If the employee is cleared to return to duty by
a physician, and any restrictions may be accommodated by the police or fire
department, additional sick leave shall be taken from the employee's accrued
sick time. If 180 days have been exhausted, the city may take additional sick
leave from the employee's accumulated sick time or request that the employee be
placed on limited duty assignment if released by a licensed physician
designated by the city to perform such duties. The city may at any time while
the employee is on extended sick leave request that the employee be placed on
temporary or permanent disability in accordance with state law.
   (G)   Sick leave may only be used due to the illness or injury of an
employee or a member of that employee's immediate family or for bereavement in
accordance with §
1-2-5-5(C).

being 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601 et seq., employees who qualify for this type of leave
are eligible for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave each year for any of the
following reasons:
      (1)   The birth of a child or to care for a newborn child (the leave must
be taken within 12 months of the date of birth);
      (2)   Placement with the employee of a child by adoption or for foster
care (the leave must be taken within 12 months of the date of placement);
      (3)   To care for a spouse, child or parent who has a serious health
condition; or
      (4)   A serious health condition which makes the employee unable to
perform the functions of his or her job.
   (B)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   CHILD. A biological, adopted or foster child, a stepchild, a legal
ward or a child of a person standing in loco parentis, who is under 18 years of
age or who is older than 18 years of age and incapable of self-care because of
physical or mental disability.
      (2)   FAMILY OR MEDICAL LEAVE. Any leave taken pursuant to this section
or for any of the reasons listed in division (A) above.
      (3)   IN LOCO PARENTIS. An individual who has day-to-day responsibility
to care for and financially support a child.
      (4)   PARENT. The biological parent of an employee or an individual who
stood in loco parentis to an employee when the employee was a minor.
      (5)   SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION.
         (a)   Any illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental condition
that involves:
            1.   Inpatient care;
            2.   Continuing treatment by a health care provider for a long-term
health condition that is incurable or so serious that, if not treated, it would
likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three calendar days; or
            3.   Any period of incapacity requiring absence from regular daily
activities for more than three calendar days and that also involves continuing
treatment by a health care provider.
         (b)   Voluntary cosmetic treatments are not considered SERIOUS HEALTH
CONDITIONS unless inpatient care is required.
      (6)   SPOUSE. Either member of a married pair of the opposite gender in
relation to the other; husband or wife.
   (C)   An employee who has been employed for at least 12 months and who has
actually worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months immediately preceding
the date the leave is to begin is eligible for 12 weeks of family and medical
leave in a 12-month period. The 12-month period shall be measured backward from
the date the employee uses family and medical leave. If a husband and wife both
are employed by the City of Lawrence, they are permitted to take only a
combined total of 12 weeks of family and medical leave during a 12-month period
if the leave is taken for the birth of a child or after placement of an adopted
or foster child, or to care for the child after birth or placement or to care
for a parent with a serious health condition.
   (D)   An employee who desires an unpaid leave as described in this section
must notify his or her supervisor of his or her intent to take a leave 30
calendar days in advance of the date the leave is to begin, unless the need for
the leave cannot be anticipated, in which case notification must be given as
soon as practicable. If an employee will be using only paid leave during his or
her leave, departmental requirements for use of the leave time must be
fulfilled.
   (E)   If the leave is for the serious health condition of the employee, all
paid leave time must be exhausted prior to beginning the unpaid portion of the
leave. Once paid leave time has been exhausted, the remainder of the leave
shall be unpaid. An employee on family or medical leave due to his or her
serious health condition or the serious health condition of a parent, child or
spouse must submit a medical certification from a health care provider to his
or her supervisor. The City may require the employee to obtain additional
medical certifications at the City’s expense.
   (F)   An employee may take family and medical leave on an intermittent basis
or by reducing the number of hours worked if medically necessary and if the
leave is taken in order to care for a family member as defined in this section
who is suffering a serious health condition or for the employee’s own serious
health condition. Intermittent leave must be taken in increments of at least
one hour.
   (G)   An employee on family and medical leave is entitled to remain on the
City’s health insurance policy for the duration of the leave. To maintain
coverage, the employee must continue to make his or her contribution to health
insurance coverage. If the employee fails to make his or her contribution in a
timely manner, health insurance coverage will cease. If an employee on family
and medical leave notifies the City that he or she does not intend to return to
work for the City, the City’s obligation to provide continued health insurance
coverage shall cease.
   (H)   An employee will be required to provide a fitness for duty report
prior to returning to work if the leave was due to his or her own serious
health condition. At the end of his or her leave, an employee shall be restored
to the same position the employee held when leave commenced or to an equivalent
position with equivalent benefits, pay and other terms and conditions of
employment unless the employee has been affected by reorganization or reduction
in force. Upon reinstatement, an employee who has allowed his or her health
insurance coverage to lapse will be entitled to re-enroll. Certain key
employees (as defined by the Family and Medical Leave Act) may be denied
reinstatement if necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury
to the City.
   (I)   Upon the expiration of family and medical leave, additional leave may
be requested in accordance with §
1-2-5-11.
§ 1-2-5-8. TRAINING LEAVE POLICY.
   (A)   Employees can obtain training leaves without loss of pay for the
purpose of participating in training which will increase the knowledge or
efficiency of the employee in his or her position with the City. If the leave
is approved, it shall not exceed 90 days.
   (B)   If the training is directly related to the service of the City, the
costs of the training may be paid by the municipality.
   (C)   Long-term training leave without pay, but without loss of seniority,
may be obtained by employees for the purpose of seeking a degree or otherwise
furthering their education. If the leave is approved, it shall not exceed one
year, subject to review of circumstances and renewal in one-year increments.
   (D)   Any training leave must be recommended in writing by the employee’s
department head and approved by the Mayor.
   (E)   Payment by the City for any expenses relating to the training leave
must be recommended in writing by the employee’s department head and approved

§ 1-2-5-9. MILITARY LEAVE.
   (A)   Any City employee required to attend monthly training drills with
components of the Indiana National Guard or the United States Reserve must
notify his or her immediate supervisor in writing not less than ten days prior
to the training session whenever the training session dates conflict with the
employee’s normally assigned work schedule.
   (B)   Employees will be excused from their normal duties on the days of
their monthly training sessions. However, the employee must make arrangements
to work days off sufficient to compensate the City for the time lost. This must
be done in advance of the training session unless special permission is granted
by the employee’s supervisor. Failure to work compensatory days off in advance
of the training session will cause an automatic deduction in the employee’s
compensation commensurate with the time lost. The employee’s supervisor shall
notify the City Controller’s Office of the arrangements.
   (C)   I.C. 10-17-4 requires governmental employers to pay full-time,
permanent, public employees who are members of the Guard or Reserve for 15 days
military leave of absence annually. This refers to the annual summer camp
conducted by the reserve components. The employee will be paid his or her
normal wages or salary by the City during this training session.
   (D)   Any other military training, such as active duty for training, special
schools or any training in excess of 15 days, is not covered, and the employee
will not be compensated by the City during that training. Whenever an employee
is ordered to attend this type of training, the employee may work days off in
advance of the training session or may elect to take vacation time, if
available, to prevent loss of pay during the session.
   (E)   Employees shall notify their supervisors in writing not less than 30
days prior to training sessions of 15 days or more and a copy of military leave
orders shall be furnished to the supervisor prior to departure. Any leave in
excess of 15 days is not eligible for credit toward the accumulation of
employee benefits, except for longevity credit.
   (F)   Any employee who is a member of the reserve armed forces of the United
States or of the National Guard of the State of Indiana and is called to and
serving on active duty shall be paid compensation during the period of active
duty equal to the difference between the military pay received by the employee
and the straight time or base wages or salary which the employee would have
received if the employee were performing regular duties for the City. The City
shall also continue and maintain the regular health and dental benefits for the
employee and the employee’s dependents during the period of active duty as if
the employee were performing regular duties for the City.
§ 1-2-5-10. COURT AND JURY DUTY.
   (A)   Any full-time employee of the City may receive leave to serve on a
jury or as a subpoenaed witness in any county, state or federal court without
loss of pay. However, any pay other than for reimbursement of travel or other
expenses shall be remitted to the City.
   (B)   If the serving or appearing in court by an employee will be seriously
detrimental to the public interest due to the loss of the employee’s services,
it shall be the responsibility of the Corporation Counsel to seek exemption
from duty for the employee.
   (C)   Any employee required to serve or appear in court in connection with
his or her City duties and during a scheduled day off or beyond regularly
scheduled work hours shall either be paid his or her normal hourly wage or
salary or granted compensatory time off at a time mutually agreeable to the
employee and his or her department head.
   (D)   This chapter does not apply to police officers in connection with an
officer’s duties. Police officers shall be compensated as stated in §
1-2-4-11.
§ 1-2-5-11. EXTENDED LEAVES OF ABSENCE.
   (A)   An employee may, in certain extenuating, unusual or uncontrollable
circumstances, receive an authorized leave of absence without pay, but without
loss of seniority, for a period not to exceed one year.
   (B)   To qualify for an extended leave of absence, an employee must submit
an application in writing to the employee’s department head, stating the
circumstances and reasons for the request.
   (C)   The leave may be granted only upon approval of both the department
head and the Board of Public Works and Safety.
§ 1-2-5-12. TRAVEL EXPENSE POLICY.
   (A)   A vehicle shall, from time to time, be purchased or leased and
equipped for exclusive use by the Mayor. The Common Council hereby authorizes
payment for all costs and expenses reasonably related to the use of the vehicle
by the Mayor.
   (B)   Any City employee who is required, in the course of business for the
City or while attending an educational seminar, to travel outside the City is
hereby authorized to be reimbursed for any reasonable expenses incurred for the
purposes of meals and lodging; provided that the expenses were approved in
advance by the employee’s department head. Written evidence of the expenses
shall be provided to the City Controller at the conclusion of the trip.
   (C)   The Common Council hereby authorizes payment of all the employee
expenses which are reasonable, but in no case may the expenses exceed the
maximum amounts allowed for state employees. The amounts are published in the
rate tables of the Rules and Regulations Governing Travel for the State of
Indiana, promulgated jointly by the Indiana State Department of Administration
and the Indiana State Division of Management and Budget. These rates, set

§ 1-2-6-6. NEPOTISM AND CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
   (A)   Nepotism.

of conduct with regard to nepotism in employment and contracting with the City,
in order to continue to be able to provide local government services to its
residents, and to comply with new laws known as I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-
21, respectively, which become effective July 1, 2012.
      (2)   On July 1, 2012, the City shall have a nepotism and a contracting
with a unit policy that complies with the minimum requirements of I.C. 36-1-
20.2 (hereinafter “Nepotism Policy”) and I.C. 36-1-21 (hereinafter “Contracting
with a Unit by a Relative Policy”) and implementation will begin.
      (3)   The City Nepotism Policy is hereby established effective July 1,
2012, by adopting the minimum requirements provisions of I.C. 36-1-20.2, and
including all future supplements and amendments thereto that become law from

cannot act for the body to make work assignments, compensation, grievances,

authority over employees in the City cannot act for the governing body to make
work assignments, compensation, grievances, advancement or a performance
evaluation without prior authority of a majority of the body, when a statute
provides that a majority is needed to act, and, therefore, without such
authority by the majority, the single member will not be in the direct line of
supervision. See the cited statute; e.g., park board, merit commissions and
other such bodies.
      (8)   All elected and appointed officials and employees of the City are
hereby directed to cooperate fully in the implementation of the policies
created by Resolution 8, 2012 and maintain and demonstrate compliance with
these policies.

compliance and certifications connected with the Nepotism Policy is a violation
and may result in the discipline, including termination, of an employee, a
transfer from the direct line of supervision or other curative action. An
elected or appointed official of the City who fails to abide by or cooperate
with the implementation, with the compliance and with mandated certifications
of the Nepotism Policy may be subject to action allowed by law.
      (10)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation,
compliance and certifications connected with the Contracting with Unit by a

termination, of an employee or a curative action. An elected or appointed
official of the city who fails to abide by or cooperate with the
implementation, with the compliance and with mandated certifications of the
Contracting with Unit by a Relative Policy may be subject to action allowed by
law.
      (11)   (a)   The polices created by Resolution 8, 2012 are hereby
directed to be implemented by any of the following actions:

§ 1-2-6-11. SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   Any employee of the City of Lawrence who engages in sexual harassment,
who permits employees under his or her supervision to engage in sexual
harassment, or who retaliates or permits retaliation against an employee who
reports sexual harassment, is guilty of misconduct and shall be subject to
remedial action which may include the imposition of discipline up to and
including discharge. Retaliation against witnesses or persons who participate
in the investigation of sexual harassment is also misconduct, and offenders may
be subject to discipline up to and including discharge.
   (B)   Sexual harassment consists of unwelcome sexual advances, requests for
sexual favors and other verbal and physical conduct of a sexual nature when:
      (1)   Submission to this conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly
a term or condition of the individual’s employment;
      (2)   Submission to or rejection of this conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting the individual; or
      (3)   This conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering
with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   (C)   Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Unwelcome or unwanted sexual advances, including patting, pinching,
brushing against, hugging, cornering, kissing, fondling or any other similar
physical conduct considered unacceptable by another individual;
      (2)   Verbal abuse or kidding that is sexually oriented and considered
unacceptable by another individual, including commenting about an individual’s
body or appearance where the comments go beyond mere courtesy, telling sexual
jokes that are clearly unwanted and considered offensive by others, or any
sexually oriented comments, innuendos or actions that offend others;
      (3)   Engaging in any type of sexually oriented conduct that would
unreasonably interfere with another’s work performance, including extending
unwanted sexual attention to someone that reduces personal productivity or time
available to work at the assigned tasks; and/or
      (4)   Creating a work environment that is intimidating, hostile or
offensive because of unwelcome or unwanted sexually oriented conversations,
suggestions, requests, demands, physical contact or display of suggestive,
sexually explicit or obscene posters, photos, calendars or other graphic
material.
   (D)   Individuals who experience sexual harassment should make it clear to
the offending person that the behavior is offensive to them. In addition, upon
the occurrence of an act of sexual harassment, or upon repetition of the acts,
one who has experienced the harassment should immediately report the incident
to his or her supervisor, to the department head or to the City’s Personnel
Department. The employee has the right to speak in private with the person to
whom the sexual harassment complaint is made or to have a witness to the
harassment present. All employees may make these reports without retaliation or
reprisal by the City, department management or supervisors.
   (E)   Each complaint of sexual harassment will be fully and completely
investigated by the department head and/or by the Division of Personnel. All
investigations will be handled with discretion, sensitivity and due concern for
the dignity of those involved and will be as thorough as necessary. Anyone who
is alleged to have committed acts of sexual harassment will be contacted during
the investigation and permitted to make a statement. All persons named as
potential witnesses by the employee who has experienced the harassment will be
contacted during the course of the investigation. Any employee who has observed
the incident or incidents of sexual harassment shall cooperate in the
investigation. All employees shall cooperate in the investigation without
retaliation or reprisal by the City, department management or supervisors.
   (F)   An employee may invoke the City’s regular grievance procedure in
resolving the complaint. An employee may also file a complaint with the
Division of Personnel without going to a department head or supervisor. An
employee also may decline to use the City’s procedures and file a complaint
with the State Civil Rights Commission or with the United States Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission. The employee also may file with either of
these agencies while simultaneously pursuing the City’s complaint procedure.
The City shall seek to resolve all complaints of sexual harassment as promptly
as possible.
   (G)   All employees shall cooperate in investigating complaints of sexual
harassment. The nature of instances of alleged sexual harassment requires a
high degree of confidentiality and flexibility in approaches to investigation
and resolution. All employees shall keep their communications in an
investigation confidential and shall disclose them only to City officials,
employees and others who need the disclosure in order to perform their duties.

1-2-9-6.   Responsibilities of Controller’s Office
§ 1-2-9-1. GENERAL INFORMATION.
   (A)   The fixed asset policy is issued effective January 1, 2010. The new
policy will be referred to as the Capital Asset Policy. This policy is being
issued to document the minimum value of capital assets to be reported on our
financial reports and to include infrastructure assets. This issuance of a
policy document is related to the implementation of a new reporting model,
Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement 34. Statement 34 will require
the city to depreciate capital assets. The capital asset threshold will be
$5,000. An asset with a value under $5,000 will be expensed in the year of
purchase. The definition of "useful life" is the period of time over which an
investment is considered to meet its original objective.
   (B)   City utilities will follow this same definition of capital assets
except any item with a unit cost of $5,000 or more shall be capitalized. Assets
that are not capitalized (items < $5,000) are expensed in the year of
acquisition. City utilities will follow the capitalization guidelines of the
Indiana State Board of Accounts.
(Ord. 28, 2009, passed 12-7-2009)
§ 1-2-9-2. DEFINITION OF CAPITAL ASSETS.
   (A)   Capital assets include: land, land improvements, including monuments,
buildings, building improvements, construction in progress, machinery and
equipment, vehicles and infrastructure. All land will be capitalized but not
depreciated. All items with a useful life of more than one year, and having a
unit cost of $5,000 or more shall be capitalized (including acquisitions by
lease-purchase agreements and donated items). A capital asset meeting the
criteria will be reported and depreciated in the government-wide financial
statements.
   (B)   (1)   Assets that are not capitalized (items < $5,000) are expensed in
the year of acquisition. An inventory will be kept for all computers and other
equipment with a capitalized cost of < $5,000.
      (2)   Exceptions are items costing less than the above limits which are
permanently installed as a part of the cost of original construction or
installation of a larger building or equipment unit will be included in the
cost of the larger unit.
   (C)   Purchases made using grant funds must comply with grant requirements
or the above procedures, whichever are the most restrictive.
(Ord. 28, 2009, passed 12-7-2009)
§ 1-2-9-3. THRESHOLD LEVELS FOR CAPITAL ASSETS.
   The following schedule will be followed for the different types of capital
assets other than infrastructure assets:
                         Capitalize/Depreciate
Land                     All/capitalize only
Land improvements        $5,000 >
Building                 $5,000 >
Building improvements    $5,000 >
Construction in progress All/capitalize only
Machinery and equipment  $5,000 >
Vehicle                  $5,000 >
City utility assets      $5,000 >
 
(Ord. 28, 2009, passed 12-7-2009)
§ 1-2-9-4. ASSET DEFINITIONS BY MAJOR CATEGORY.
   It is important to the maintenance of accurate records that each asset
category be precisely defined and that all persons responsible for records
maintenance are fully aware of the categorization system. This section further
clarifies the asset definitions by major category.
   (A)   Land. Land is defined as specified land, lots, parcels or acreage
including rights-of-way, owned by the city, its various departments, boards or
authorities, regardless of the method or date of acquisition. Easements will
not be included as the city does not own them, but as an interest in land owned
by another (i.e. property owner) that entitles its holder to a specified
limited use.
   (B)   Improvements other than buildings.
      (1)   Examples of city-owned assets in this category are walks, parking
areas and drives, fencing, retaining walls, pools, fountains, planters,
underground sprinkler systems, and other similar items.
      (2)   Examples of city-owned utilities assets in this category are water
supply mains, collection sewers, wells, dams, fences, intake pipes, manholes,
and fire hydrants.
   (C)   Buildings.
      (1)   All structures designed and erected to house equipment, services,
or functions are included. This includes systems, services, and fixtures within
the buildings, and attachments such as porches, stairs, fire escapes, canopies,
areaways, lighting fixtures, flagpoles, and all other such units that serve the
building.
      (2)   Plumbing systems, lighting systems, heating, cooling, ventilating
and air handling systems, alarm systems, sound systems, surveillance systems,
passenger and freight elevators, escalators, built-in casework, walk-in coolers
and freezers, fixed shelving, and other fixed equipment are included with the
building. Communication antennas and/or towers are not included as buildings.
   (D)   Equipment. Equipment includes all other types of physical property
within the scope of the fixed asset management system not previously
classified. Included within this category are office mechanical equipment,
office furniture, appliances, furnishings, machinery items, maintenance
equipment, communication equipment, laboratory equipment, vehicles, road
equipment, emergency equipment, earth moving equipment, reproduction equipment,
civil defense equipment, and data processing equipment. All supplies are
excluded.
   (E)   Infrastructure.
      (1)   Infrastructure assets are long-lived capital assets that normally
can be preserved for a significantly greater number of years than most capital
assets and that are normally stationary in nature. Examples include roads,
streetlights, traffic signals, drainage systems, and water systems.
Infrastructure assets do not include buildings, drives, parking lots or any
other examples given above that are incidental to property or access to the
property above.
      (2)   Additions and improvements to infrastructure, which increase the
capacity or efficiency of the asset, will be capitalized. Maintenance/repairs
will be considered as necessary to maintain the existing asset, and therefore
not capitalized. For example, patching, resurfacing, snow removal and the like,
are considered maintenance activities and will be expensed. Also, normal
department operating activities such as feasibility studies, and preliminary
engineering and design, will be expensed and not capitalized as an element of
the infrastructure asset.
      (3)   Alleys will not be included as part of infrastructure for the
following reason: existing improved alleys will be maintained as gravel alleys,
and the city is responsible only for the maintenance, such as patching and
repairing. Any investments to upgrade the alleys will be done by homeowner
participation. Therefore, the city will not track and value alleys and the
patching/repairs will be expensed as they occur.
      (4)   The retroactive reporting requirements for infrastructure of GASB
34 requires the city to report items put into service from 1980 forward, and
gives the city the option to report items put into service prior to 1980. The
city will report only on items put into service after 1980. Retroactive
reporting is not mandated until fiscal years beginning after January 1, 2009
with which the city will comply.
(Ord. 28, 2009, passed 12-7-2009)
§ 1-2-9-5. DEPRECIATION METHODS.
   (A)   The city will be depreciating capital assets by using straight-line
depreciation methods. Salvage value will be determined on an asset-by-asset
basis. Depreciation will be calculated at fiscal year-end. Land is not
depreciated according to general accepted accounting principles.
   (B)   A network of assets is composed of all assets that provide a
particular type of service for government. A subsystem of a network of assets
is composed of all assets that make a similar portion or segment of a network
of assets. The following will be the breakdown of our networks and subsystems:
      Roads/Streets Network
         Subsystems: Types of Streets
                   Curbs and Gutters
      Traffic Components Network
         Subsystems: Traffic Signals (Controls, Loop Detectors & Sensors)
                   Street Lights
   (C)   Straight-line depreciation. All assets accounted for under the capital
asset policy will be depreciated using the straight-line method of
depreciation. A gain or loss on disposal will be recorded. Following is a list
of the most common useful lives:
Projected Useful Life Asset Table
 Item Description Useful Life
                           Item Description            Useful Life

Board of Public Works and Safety.
   (E)   Identification. The Building Commissioner shall carry proper
identification when inspecting structures or premises in the performance of
duties under this code.
   (F)   Right of entry. Where it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce
the provisions of this code, or where the Building Commissioner has reasonable
cause to believe that there exists in a structure or upon a premises a
condition that is contrary to or in violation of this code that makes the
structure or premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the Building Commissioner
or designee is authorized to enter the structure or premises at reasonable
times to inspect or to perform the duties imposed by this code, provided that
if such structure or premises is occupied that credentials be presented to the
occupant and entry requested. If such structure or premises is unoccupied, the

structure or premises and request entry. If entry is refused, the Building
Commissioner shall have recourse to the remedies provided by law to secure
entry.
   (G)   Department records. The Building Commissioner shall keep official
records of applications received, permits and certificates issued, fees
collected, reports of inspections, and notices and orders issued. Such records
shall be retained in the official records for the period required for the
retention of public records.
   (H)   Liability. The Building Commissioner, member of the Board of Public

the lawful discharge of duties and under the provisions of this code shall be
defended by legal representatives of the jurisdiction until the final
termination of the proceedings. The Building Commissioner or any subordinate

be reused unless approved by the Building Commissioner.
   (K)   Modifications. Where there are practical difficulties involved in
carrying out the provisions of this code, the Building Commissioner shall have
the authority to grant modifications for individual cases, provided the
Building Commissioner shall first find that special individual reason makes the
strict letter of this code impractical and the modification is in compliance
with the intent and purpose of this code and that such modification does not
lessen health, life and fire safety or structural requirements. The details of
action granting modifications shall be recorded and entered in the files of the
Department of Building Services.
   (L)   Alternative materials, design and method of construction and
equipment. The provisions of this code are not intended to prevent the
installation of any material or to prohibit any design or method of
construction not specifically prescribed by this code. The Building
Commissioner shall have the authority to approve an alternative material,
design or method of construction upon application of the owner or the owner's
authorized agent. The Building Commissioner shall first find that the proposed
design is satisfactory and complies with the intent of the provisions of this
code, and that the material, method or work offered is, for the purpose
intended, not less than the equivalent of that prescribed in this code in
quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability and safety.
Compliance with the specific performance-based provisions of the international,
state and local codes shall be an alternative to the specific requirements of
this code. Where the alternative material, design or method of construction is
not approved, the Building Commissioner shall respond in writing, stating the
reasons why the alternative was not approved.
   (M)   Tests. Where there is insufficient evidence of compliance with the
provisions of this code, or evidence that a material or method does not conform
to the requirements of this code, or in order to substantiate claims for
alternative materials or methods, the Building Commissioner shall have the
authority to require tests as evidence of compliance to be made at no expense
to the jurisdiction. Test methods shall be as specified in this code or by
other recognized test standards. In the absence of recognized and accepted test
methods, the Building Commissioner shall approve the testing procedures. Tests
shall be performed by an approved agency. Reports of such tests shall be

construction documents to be prepared by a registered design professional.
      (1)   Exception. The Building Commissioner is authorized to waive the
submission of construction documents and other data not required to be prepared
by a registered design professional if it is found that the nature of the work
applied for is such that reviewing of construction documents is not necessary
to obtain compliance with this code.
      (2)   Information on construction documents. Construction documents shall
be drawn upon suitable material. Electronic media documents are permitted to be
submitted where approved by the Building Commissioner. Construction documents
shall be of sufficient clarity to indicate the location, nature and extent of

data available from other sources.
      (6)   Site plan or plot plan. The construction documents submitted with
the application for permit shall be accompanied by a site plan showing the size
and location of new construction and existing structures on the site and
distances from lot lines. In the case of demolition, the site plans shall show
construction to be demolished and the location and size of existing structure
and construction that are to remain on the site or plot. The Building
Commissioner is authorized to waive or modify the requirement for a site plan
where the application for permit is for alteration or repair or where otherwise
warranted.
   (B)   Examination of documents. The Building Commissioner shall examine or
cause to be examined construction documents for code compliance.
      (1)   Approval of construction documents. Where the Building Commissioner
issues a permit, the construction documents shall be approved in writing or by

be open to inspection by the Building Commissioner or a duly authorized
representative.
      (2)   Previous approvals. This code shall not require changes in the
construction documents, construction or designated occupancy of a structure for
which a lawful permit has been heretofore issued or otherwise lawfully
authorized, and the construction of which has been pursued in good faith within
180 days after the effective date of this code and has not been abandoned.
      (3)   Phased approval. The Building Commissioner is authorized to issue a
permit for the construction of foundations or any other part of a building or
structure before the construction documents for the whole building or structure
have been submitted, provided that adequate information and detailed statements
have been filed complying with pertinent requirements of this code. The holder
of such permit for the foundation or other parts of a building or structure
shall proceed at the holder's own risk with the building operation and without
assurance that a permit for the entire structure will be granted.
   (C)   Amended construction documents. Work shall be installed in accordance
with the approved construction documents, and any changes made during
construction that are not in compliance with the approved construction
documents shall be resubmitted for approval as an emended set of construction
documents.

documents shall be retained by the building official for a period of not less
than 180 days from date of completion of the permitted work, or as required by

§ 2-1-2-1. TITLE.
   This chapter, and all ordinances supplemental or amendatory hereto, shall be
known as the “Unsafe Building Code of the City of Lawrence, Indiana,” may be
cited as such, and will be referred to herein as the “Unsafe Building Code.”
§ 2-1-2-2. STATUTORY AUTHORITY.
   (A)   The Unsafe Building Code is established pursuant to I.C. 36-7-9, and
the provisions of I.C. 36-7-9-1 through 36-7-9-28 are hereby adopted by
reference and made a part of the Unsafe Building Code.
   (B)   All proceedings within the City of Lawrence for the inspection,
repair, demolition and removal of unsafe buildings shall be governed by I.C.
36-7-9 and the provisions of this chapter. In the event that any provision of
this chapter conflicts with any provision of I.C. 36-7-9, then the provisions
of the state statute shall control.

   (C)   Wherever in the Building Code or the Unsafe Building Code of the City
of Lawrence it is provided that anything must be done to the approval of or
subject to the direction of the Building Commissioner or any other officer of
the City of Lawrence, this shall be construed to give the officer only the
discretion of determining whether the rules and standards established by the
particular code have been complied with; and no provisions shall be construed

standards shall be or power to require conditions not prescribed by the codes
or to enforce code provisions in an arbitrary or discretionary manner.
§ 2-1-2-4. RIGHT TO ENTER.
   (A)   The Building Commissioner shall have the power to make an entry into
any building, premises or structure that he or she has reasonable cause to
believe may be in violation of the Unsafe Building Code for the purpose of
inspecting the property to determine whether the property is, in fact, in
violation of any provision of the Unsafe Building Code.
   (B)   All buildings or portions thereof within the City of Lawrence, which
are determined after inspection by the Building Commissioner to be unsafe, as
defined in this chapter, are hereby declared to be public nuisances and shall
be abated by repair, rehabilitation, demolition or removal.
Penalty, see § 2-1-2-13
§ 2-1-2-5. UNSAFE BUILDING DEFINED.
   (A)   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definition shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      UNSAFE BUILDING. A building or structure, or any part of a building or
structure, that is:

person or property;
         (b)   A fire hazard;
         (c)   A hazard to public health;

   (B)   In addition to the conditions described in division (A) above, any
building or structure which has any or all of the conditions or defects
hereinafter described shall be deemed to be an UNSAFE BUILDING, provided that
the conditions or defects exist to the extent that life, health, property or
safety of the public or of its occupants are endangered:
      (1)   Whenever any door, aisle, passageway or other means of exit is not
of sufficient width or size or is not so arranged as to provide safe and
adequate means of exit in case of fire or panic;
      (2)   Whenever the stress in any materials, member or portion thereof,
due to all dead and live loads, is more than one and one-half times the working
stress or stresses allowed for new buildings of similar structure, purpose or
location;
      (3)   Whenever any portion thereof has been damaged by fire, earthquake,
wind, flood or by any other cause to the extent that the structural strength or
stability thereof is materially less than it was before the catastrophe and is
less than the minimum requirements for new buildings of similar structure,
purpose or location;
      (4)   Whenever any portion, member or appurtenance thereof is likely to
fail, to become detached or dislodged or to collapse and thereby injure persons
or damage property;
      (5)   Whenever any portion of a building, or any member, appurtenance or
ornamentation on the exterior thereof is not of sufficient strength or
stability or is not so anchored, attached or fastened in place so as to be
capable of resisting a wind pressure of one-half of that specified for new
buildings of similar structure, purpose or location without exceeding the
working stresses permitted for the buildings;
      (6)   Whenever any portion thereof has cracked, warped, buckled or
settled to the extent that walls or other structural portions have materially
less resistance to winds or earthquakes than is required in the case of similar
new construction;
      (7)   Whenever the building or structure, or any portion thereof, is
likely to partially or completely collapse because of:
         (a)   Dilapidation, deterioration or decay;
         (b)   Faulty construction;
         (c)   The removal, movement or instability of any portion of the
ground necessary for the purpose of supporting the building;
         (d)   The deterioration, decay or inadequacy of its foundation; or
         (e)   Any other cause.
      (8)   Whenever, for any reason, the building or structure, or any portion
thereof, is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is being used;
      (9)   Whenever the exterior walls or other vertical structural members
list, lean or buckle to the extent that a plumb line passing through the center
of gravity does not fall inside the middle one-third of the base;
      (10)   Whenever the building or structure, exclusive of the foundation,
shows 33% or more damage or deterioration of its supporting member or members,
or 50% damage or deterioration of its non-supporting members, enclosing or
outside walls or coverings;
      (11)   Whenever the building or structure has been so damaged by fire,
wind, earthquake or flood or has become so dilapidated or deteriorated so as to
become:
         (a)   An attractive nuisance to children; or
         (b)   Freely accessible to persons for the purpose of committing
unlawful acts.
      (12)   Whenever any building or structure has been constructed, exists or
is maintained in violation of any specific requirement or prohibition
applicable to the building or structure provided by the building regulations of
this City or by any law or ordinance governing the condition, location or
structure of buildings;
      (13)   Whenever any building or structure which, whether or not erected
in accordance with all applicable laws and ordinances, has in any non-
supporting part, member or portion less than 50%, or in any supporting part,
member or portion less than 66% of the strength, fire-resisting qualities or
characteristics, or weather-resisting qualities or characteristics required by
law, in the case of a newly constructed building of like area, height and
occupancy in the same location.
      (14)   Whenever a building or structure used or intended to be used for
dwelling purposes, because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, decay,
damage, faulty construction or arrangements, inadequate light, air or
sanitation facilities, or otherwise, is determined by a State Board of Health
Inspector to be unsanitary, unfit for human habitation or in a condition that
is likely to cause sickness or disease;
      (15)   Whenever any building or structure, because of obsolescence,
dilapidated condition, deterioration, damage, inadequate exits, lack of
sufficient fire-resistive construction, faulty electric wiring, gas connections
or heating apparatus, or other cause, is determined by a fire prevention
investigator to be a fire hazard; and/or
      (16)   Whenever any portion of a building or structure remains on a site
after the demolition or destruction of the building or structure, or whenever
any building or structure is abandoned for a period in excess of six weeks so
as to constitute the building or portion thereof an attractive nuisance or
hazard to the public.

the City if the work is being done in violation of any provision of the Unsafe
Building Code or any statute or ordinance relating thereto, or if the building
is found otherwise to be unsafe.
   (B)   The Building Commissioner may order the condition abated or the work
stopped by written notice stating the defects thereof served upon the owner and
occupants of the building, premises or structure or upon any persons engaged in
doing, allowing or causing the work to be done or condition to exist.
   (C)   Proper service of the notice shall be by personal service upon the

   The City of Lawrence hereby exercises the power of establishing a merit
system for the full-time, paid Fire Department of the City of Lawrence pursuant
to I.C. 36-1-4-14. The provisions contained herein shall apply only to the
full-time, paid Fire Department of the City of Lawrence and not to any
volunteer or reserve or other special component or components of the Fire
Department whose members are not full-time, paid members of the Fire
Department.
§ 3-1-3.5-2. ESTABLISHMENT OF MERIT COMMISSION.
   (A)   (1)   A Merit Commission shall be established consisting of five
Commissioners.
      (2)   The Commissioners are:
         (a)   Two persons, who must be of different political parties,
appointed by the Mayor;
         (b)   One person appointed by the Common Council; and
         (c)   Two persons, who must be of different political parties, elected
by the active members of the Department.
      (3)   Political affiliation shall be determined through the voters’
registration records of the three most recent primary elections.
   (B)   Each Commissioner must have been a legal resident of the City of
Lawrence for three consecutive years immediately preceding the Commissioner’s
term and must be a person of good moral character. A Commissioner must be at
least 21 years of age. A Commissioner may not be an active member of a Police
or Fire Department or agency and not more than two Commissioners may be past
members of a Police or Fire Department or agency. In addition, a person may not
serve on the Commission if the person receives any remuneration as salary from
the City.
   (C)   Each Commissioner shall take an oath of office to conscientiously
discharge the Commissioner’s duties.
   (D)   The term of a Commissioner is four years. If a vacancy occurs on the
Commission, it shall be filled within 30 days by the appointing or electing
authority. The selection shall be for the remainder of the unexpired term. A
Commissioner serves at the pleasure of the appointing or electing authority and
may be removed at any time. In the case of a Commissioner elected by the
Department, the Board of Public Works and Safety shall call a meeting of the
active members of the Department if a recall petition signed by a majority of
the active members is submitted to the Board.
   (E)   The Commission shall adopt rules to govern the Commission, including
the time and place of regular monthly meetings and special meetings that are
necessary to transact the business of the Commission. A majority of the
Commissioners constitutes a quorum, and a majority vote of all the
Commissioners is necessary to transact the business of the Commission. Each
year the Commissioners shall select from the Commission members a President,
Vice President and Secretary. The Commission shall keep a permanent record of
its proceedings which shall be kept in the Fire Department administrative
office.
   (F)   The Common Council may determine a per diem to be paid to each
Commissioner for each day of actual service for the Commission.
   (G)   (1)   The Commission shall adopt rules governing:
         (a)   The selection and appointment of persons to be employed as
members of the Department, subject to applicable pension statutes;
         (b)   Promotions and demotions of members of the Department; and
         (c)   Disciplinary action or dismissal of members of the Department.
      (2)   The rules currently in force and effect as heretofore adopted by
the existing Commission shall be and remain the rules of the Commission subject
to further addition, amendment or repeal as the Commission may from time to
time provide.
§ 3-1-3.5-3. APPOINTMENT AND REMOVAL OF MEMBERS OF THE DEPARTMENT.
   (A)   The Commission may appoint and remove members of the Department,
except for those positions identified in §§
3-1-3-2(A) through (D) of this code. The Mayor shall appoint and may remove a
member in an upper level policymaking position, and the Fire Chief shall
appoint the other chief officers.
   (B)   The Chief of the Department shall be selected from the members of the
Department and must have at least five years’ service in the Department before
the appointment. These requirements may be waived by a majority vote of the
Common Council upon request of the Mayor. However, the Chief must still have at
least five years’ service in a full-time, paid fire department or agency.
   (C)   The removal of a member from an upper level policymaking or chief
officer position is removal from rank only and not from the Department. When
the member is removed, the member shall be appointed by the Commission to the
rank in the Department which he or she held at the time of appointment to the
upper level policymaking position or chief officer position or to any other
rank to which he or she has been promoted during his or her tenure in the upper
level policymaking position or chief officer position. If the rank is not open
in either case, the member is entitled to the pay of that rank and shall be
promoted to that rank as soon as an opening is available.
(Am. Ord. 13, 2004, passed 8-11-2004)
§ 3-1-3.5-4. APPOINTMENT TO THE DEPARTMENT; HIRING PROCEDURES.
   (A)   (1)   To be appointed to the Fire Department, an applicant must be:
         (a)   A citizen of the United States;
         (b)   A high school graduate or equivalent; and
         (c)   At least 21 years of age, but under 36 years of age.
      (2)   However, the age requirements do not apply to a person who has been
previously employed as a member of the Department.
   (B)   A person may not be appointed, reappointed or reinstated if he or she
has a felony conviction on his or her record.
   (C)   All individuals appointed or reappointed to the Fire Department must
establish residency in Marion County or any contiguous county within six months
of the appointment.
   (D)   Applications for appointment or reappointment to the Department must
be obtained from the Fire Department administrative office and returned to the
same office when completed.
   (E)   (1)   Applicants must comply with the following requirements.
         (a)   Applicants must pass the general aptitude test required under
state law, which general aptitude test shall reflect the essential functions of
the job. The test shall be conducted according to procedures and standards
adopted by the Commission.
         (b)   The applicant must pass a physical agility test required under
state law. The test shall be conducted according to procedures and standards
adopted by the Commission.
         (c)   The applicant shall have an oral interview as established by the
Commission.
         (d)   The applicant must pass statutory medical examinations and
tests, and not exceed statutory age requirements, as required under state law
for participation in the applicable PERF fund.
      (2)   The results of the general aptitude test shall be filed with the
Commission. If the Commission finds that the applicant lacks the proper
qualifications, it shall reject the applicant.
   (F)   The applicants shall then be rated on the selection criteria and
testing methods adopted by the Commission, which may include mental alertness,
character, habits and reputation. The Commission shall adopt rules for grading
the applicants, including the establishment of a passing score. The Commission
shall place the names of applicants with passing scores on an eligibility list
by the order of their scores and shall certify the list to the Board of Public
Works and Safety.
   (G)   If an applicant for original appointment reaches his or her thirty-
sixth birthday, his or her name shall be removed from the eligibility list.
Applicants remain on the list for two years from the date of certification.
After two years a person may reapply as applicant.
   (H)   When a vacancy occurs in the Department, the Chief shall appoint the
applicant or applicants as are necessary to fill any vacancies that exist in
the Department. At least two-thirds of the vacancies to be appointed at one
time by the Chief shall be filled by taking the applicant or applicants having
the highest score or scores on the final eligibility list and proceeding down
the list in order. The Chief shall fill no more than one-third of any remaining
vacancies by selecting any person remaining on the final eligibility list. (For
example, if a total of four vacancies exist, the Chief could fill only one of
the vacancies with an applicant not having the highest score. Whereas, if six
vacancies exist, the Chief could fill two of the six vacancies with applicants
not having the highest scores.) In selecting all candidates, consideration
shall be given to I.C. 36-8-4-10. The Commission may approve deviation from
this procedure in the event the Chief establishes the need to hire individuals
with special certifications or qualifications to fill immediate needs for the
good of the Department, provided an interview and process has occurred for that
particular position. All applicants who are appointed shall successfully
complete the physical agility test required by I.C. 36-8-3.2-3 and division (E)
(1)(b) above, shall be determined to be still of good character and shall pass
the required examinations identified in I.C. 36-8-3.2-6 and 36-8-8-19.
Employment shall be offered only after successful completion of the necessary
requirements of and acceptance by the State PERF Board.
   (I)   All appointments are probationary for a period not to exceed one year.
If the Commission finds, upon the recommendation of the Department during the
probationary period, that the conduct or capacity of the probationary member is
not satisfactory, the Commission shall notify him or her in writing that he or
she is being reprimanded, that he or she is being suspended, or that he or she
will not receive a permanent appointment. If a member is notified that he or
she will not receive a permanent appointment, his or her employment immediately
ceases. Otherwise, at the expiration of the probationary period the member is
considered regularly employed.
(Am. Ord. 23, 2006, passed 11-6-2006)
   (J)   The appointment eligibility list, if any, in effect at the time of the
adoption of this chapter shall remain in effect according to its terms and
until its expiration as established.
   (K)   Seniority ranking for members appointed to the Department shall be
determined by the date of hire being approved by the State PERF Board. If
multiple appointments occur on the same date, seniority ranking then shall be
determined by the date of hire as well as the member’s relatively higher
ranking in the fire suppression portion of the recruit class testing.
(Am. Ord. 13, 2004, passed 8-11-2004)
§ 3-1-3.5-5. PROMOTIONS.
   (A)   The Commission shall use factors as determined and approved by the
Commission and in accordance with Indiana law. The Commission shall determine
the weight to be given to each of the factors.
   (B)   Promotions to a rank must be from the next lower rank. In addition,
the member being promoted must have served at the lower rank for a period
determined by the Commission.
   (C)   Only members who are qualified in rank and length of service may be
given the competitive examinations and placed on an eligibility list. The
eligibility list for a position consists of members who have been placed on the
list in order of their cumulative score on all rating factors. The eligibility
list shall be maintained for two years from the date of certification, after
which time the list shall be retired and a new list established. The retired
list shall be kept for five years and then destroyed.
   (D)   The promotion eligibility list, if any, in effect at the time of the
adoption of this chapter shall remain in effect according to its terms and
until its expiration as established.
   (E)   All merit ranks held by members of the Department at the time of the
adoption of this chapter shall continue and remain in effect.
(Ord. 12, 2018, passed 10-1-2018)
§ 3-1-3.5-6. COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION TO FILL VACANCY.
   (A)   Before a written competitive examination may be held to fill a current
or expected vacancy in the ranks, the members eligible to take the examination
must be notified of the written materials from which the questions will be
taken. The Commission may employ instructors, purchase materials and make other
expenditures to provide information for applicants for promotion examinations.
   (B)   The identity of a member taking the written examination shall be
withheld from the person or persons grading the examination, and all written
examinations are confidential. The Commission shall notify each member in
writing of the score that the member received on the examination. The score
received by a member on the written examination becomes a part of the permanent
file of the member, and the member is entitled to access to this file for
examination at any time.
   (C)   The examination papers shall be kept under the Commission’s
supervision. A member who is aggrieved with the score received on the written
examination may appeal to the Commission for review of the score. The appeal
must be filed within ten days after notice of the score has been sent to him or
her. He or she may review the questions incorrectly answered and challenge the
answer considered correct by the examiner. The Commission shall either affirm
the score or correct the score according to the findings of a review. The
examination papers shall be retired after the two-year period during which the
eligibility list is valid. The retired papers shall be kept for five years and
then destroyed.
§ 3-1-3.5-7. DETERMINATION OF PERFORMANCE RATING.
   (A)   The Commission shall adopt rules for determining a performance rating.
   (B)   A member who is aggrieved with the performance rating given to him or
her by his or her superior may appeal to the Commission for a review of the
rating. The appeal must be filed within ten days after notice of the rating has
been sent to him or her. The Commission shall either affirm or correct the
rating.
(Am. Ord. 4, 2013, passed 4-1-2013)
§ 3-1-3.5-8. VACANCY IN RANK.
   (A)   When a vacancy in rank occurs, the Commission shall certify to the
Chief of the Department the three members with the highest scores on the
eligibility list for that particular rank. The Commission, upon the
recommendation of the Chief, shall promote one of those members to fill the
vacant position.
   (B)   All promotions are probationary for a period not to exceed one year.
At the end of that period, a probationary member’s superior shall review the
member’s performance and recommend to the Commission that:
      (1)   The promotion be made permanent; or
      (2)   The promotion be revoked.
   (C)   The Commission shall prepare a rating chart for the superior’s use in
making the report. The Commission shall review the report and decide what
action should be taken. The probationary member is entitled to appear before
the Commission and be heard on any matter detrimental to him or her in his or
her superior’s report. He or she is also entitled to be represented by counsel
or another representative of his or her choice. If the promotion is finally
revoked, the member may not be returned to a rank lower than that he or she
held before the probationary promotion.
   (D)   Actions by the Commission other than making the promotion permanent
may be appealed within 30 days to the Marion Circuit or Superior Court, with
the City being named as the sole defendant.
   (E)   Seniority ranking for the merit ranks of lieutenant and captain shall
be determined by the date of appointment to that rank. If multiple appointments
to the same rank occur on the same date, seniority ranking then shall be
determined by the date of appointment as well as the individual’s relatively
higher ranking on the eligibility list for that rank.
(Am. Ord. 13, 2004, passed 8-11-2004)
§ 3-1-3.5-9. DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS.
   (A)   (1)   The Commission may take the following disciplinary actions
against a regular member of the Department:
         (a)   Suspension with or without pay;
         (b)   Demotion; or
         (c)   Dismissal.
      (2)   If a member is suspended under this division (A), the member is
entitled to the member’s remuneration and allowances for insurance benefits to
which the member was entitled before the suspension. In addition, the City may
provide the member’s allowances for any other fringe benefits to which the
member was entitled before the suspension. The Commission shall determine if a
member of the Department who is suspended in excess of five days shall continue
to receive the member’s salary during suspension.
   (B)   A member may be disciplined by the Commission if:
      (1)   The member is convicted of a crime; or
      (2)   The Commission finds the member guilty of a breach of discipline
including:
         (a)   Neglect of duty;
         (b)   Violation of Commission rules;
         (c)   Neglect or disobedience of orders;
         (d)   Continuing incapacity;
         (e)   Absence without leave;
         (f)   Immoral conduct;
         (g)   Conduct injurious to the public peace or welfare;
         (h)   Conduct unbecoming a member; or
         (i)   Furnishing information to an applicant for appointment or
promotion that gives that person an advantage over another applicant.
   (C)   If the Chief of the Department, after an investigation within the
Department, prefers charges against a member of the Department for an alleged
breach of discipline under division (B) above including any civilian complaint
of an alleged breach of discipline under divisions (B)(2)(f), (B)(2)(g), or (B)
(2)(h), a hearing shall be conducted upon the request of the member. If a
hearing is requested within five days of the Chief preferring charges, the
parties may by agreement designate a hearing officer who is qualified by
education, training or experience. If the parties do not agree within this
five-day period, the Commission may hold the hearing or designate a person or
board to conduct the hearing, as provided in the Commission’s rules. The
designated person or board must be qualified by education, training or
experience to conduct the hearing and may not hold an upper level policy making
position. The hearing conducted under this division (C) shall be held within 30
days after it is requested by the member.
   (D)   Written notice of the hearing shall be served upon the accused member
in person or by a copy left at the member’s last and usual place of residence
at least 14 days before the date set for the hearing. The notice must state:
      (1)   The time and place of the hearing;
      (2)   The charges against the member;
      (3)   The specific conduct that comprises the charges;
      (4)   That the member is entitled to be represented by counsel or another
representative of the member’s choice;
      (5)   That the member is entitled to call and cross-examine witnesses;
      (6)   That the member is entitled to require the production of evidence;
and
      (7)   That the member is entitled to have subpoenas issued, served and
executed.
   (E)   The Commission may:
      (1)   Compel the attendance of witnesses by issuing subpoenas;
      (2)   Examine witnesses under oath; and
      (3)   Order the production of books, papers and other evidence by issuing
subpoenas.
   (F)   If a witness refuses to appear at a hearing of the Commission after
having received written notice requiring the witness’s attendance, or refuses
to produce evidence that the Commission requests by written notice, the
Commission may file an affidavit in the Circuit Court of the county setting
forth the facts of the refusal. Upon the filing of the affidavit, a summons
shall be issued from the Circuit Court and served by the Sheriff of the county
requiring the appearance of the witness or the production of information or
evidence to the Commission.
   (G)   Disobedience of a summons constitutes contempt of the Circuit Court
from which the summons has been issued. Expenses related to the filing of an
affidavit and the issuance and service of a summons shall be charged to the
witness against whom the summons has been issued, unless the Circuit Court
finds that the action of the witness was taken in good faith and with
reasonable cause. In that case, and in any case in which an affidavit has been
filed without the issuance of a summons, the expenses shall be charged to the
Commission.
   (H)   A decision to discipline a member may be made only if the
preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing indicates such a course
of action.
   (I)   (1)   A member who is aggrieved by the decision of a person or board
designated to conduct a disciplinary hearing under division (C) above may
appeal to the Commission within ten days of the decision. The Commission shall
on appeal review the record and either affirm, modify or reverse the decision
on the basis of the record and the oral or written testimony that the
Commission determines, including additional or newly discovered evidence.
      (2)   The Commission, or the designated person or board, shall keep a
record of the proceedings in cases of suspension, demotion or dismissal. The

§ 3-2-3-1. SPEED REGULATIONS BASED ON ENGINEERING AND TRAFFIC STUDY.
   (A)   The state traffic laws regulating the speed of vehicles shall be
applicable upon all streets within the City, except where the Common Council,
as authorized by state law, properly declares and determines, upon the basis of
engineering and traffic investigation, that certain speed regulations shall be
applicable upon specified streets or in certain areas.
   (B)   On the basis of having performed an engineering and traffic
investigation of all public highways within the jurisdictional limits of the
City of Lawrence, and having thereby determined that certain speed regulations,
either more restricted or greater than the speeds specified generally by
statute for certain areas as set forth at I.C. 9-21-5-2, were necessary and
more reasonable upon specified streets or public ways, or portions thereof, the
Common Council of the City of Lawrence hereby declares that the reasonable,
safe and proper maximum speed limits to be permitted on all City streets,
alleys and public ways shall be not greater than as set forth and established
by this chapter.
   (C)   It shall be prima facie unlawful for any person operating or using a
motor vehicle on a public way within the City of Lawrence to drive the vehicle
at a speed in excess of the speed so declared and fixed for those locations
when signs are in place at all necessary locations giving notice thereof.
   (D)   Alteration of state prima facie speed limits is hereby declared to be
accomplished within the City of Lawrence through the establishment herein of
the below-specified speed limits on the following designated streets, or
portions thereof, all as authorized by law. Any violation thereof, in a manner
declared unlawful in division (C) above, shall subject the violator to the
terms, conditions and penalties for moving traffic violation offenses as
prescribed in §
3-2-8-5 of this code.
Penalty, see §§

Police or his or her designee. Vehicles parked in places where parking is
prohibited temporarily pursuant to this section, may be moved by or at the
direction of a City Police Officer. Such parking restrictions may also be
applied whenever any other dangerous or harmful conditions render vehicle
removal necessary for the public safety surrounding the special event.
   (C)   The Chief of Police, or his or her designee, is authorized to
temporarily allow for parking in areas where parking is normally not permitted
within the jurisdiction of the city, in an impending or existing emergency or

restrictions may also be applied whenever any other dangerous or harmful
conditions render vehicle removal necessary for the public safety surrounding
the event.
   (F)   Temporary signs shall be installed to notify the public when parking
is prohibited or otherwise altered due to an emergency. The signs shall be
removed when the emergency is over and parking is allowed.
   (G)   The provisions of these rules and regulations shall not apply to
drivers actually engaged in work upon a street or highway closed to travel or
under construction or repair, to police officers or other city employees when
engaged in the performance of public duties, nor to drivers of emergency
vehicles while operating in an emergency and in performance of public duties
when the nature of the work of any of these circumstances necessitates a
departure from any part of these rules and regulations. These exceptions shall
not, however, protect the driver of a vehicle from the consequence of a
reckless disregard of the safety of others.

the franchise holder shall obtain and maintain at its cost and expense, and
file with the City Attorney, a corporate surety bond issued by a company
licensed to do surety business in the State of Indiana and in an amount
required by the franchise agreement to guarantee the timely construction and

control of the franchise holder.
   (C)   Upon satisfactory completion of construction required by the franchise
agreement, the construction bond shall be reduced by the Mayor to a reasonable
amount, considering the nature and extent of any anticipated construction
during the remaining term of the franchise. The rights reserved to the City of
Lawrence with respect to the construction bond are in addition to all other
rights of the City, whether reserved by the franchise agreement or authorized
by law, and no action, proceeding, exercise or failure to exercise any right
with respect to the construction bond shall affect any other right the City may
have.
   (D)   The City of Lawrence may require the operator to obtain new
construction bonds throughout the franchise term as necessary for construction
of system extensions or upgrades.
§ 4-2-7-7. GENERAL MAINTENANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Subject to the other provisions of this chapter, the operator shall
establish a preventive maintenance policy directed toward maximizing the
reliability (mean time between malfunctions) and maintainability (mean time to
repair) of the system. The operator shall provide the City of Lawrence with a
copy of all written policies.
   (B)   The operator shall perform scheduled maintenance so that activities
likely to result in an interruption of service are performed so as to minimize

lowest system use. Except in emergency situations, service may be interrupted
only after a minimum of 48 hours’ advance notice to subscribers and the City of
Lawrence of the anticipated service interruption.
   (C)   In the course of maintaining its system, the operator shall use
replacement components of good and durable quality, with characteristics better

   (E)   The operator shall test the performance of its cable system as
required by the FCC. The operator shall promptly correct any defects in system
performance and shall retest the system. Copies of all test results shall be
provided to the Mayor. The City of Lawrence, at its own option and expense, may
conduct independent tests of the operator’s cable system, provided that the
operator is notified in advance and has an opportunity to be present. If, based
upon subscriber complaints or based upon its own investigation, the Mayor
believes that the system may not be operating in compliance with this section,
the City of Lawrence may require the operator to perform tests and to prepare a
report on the results of those tests, including a report identifying any
problem found and steps taken to correct the problem.
   (F)   The City of Lawrence shall have the right at any time upon reasonable
notice to make those inspections of the system and the operator’s equipment
used in the construction, operation or maintenance of the system as it shall
find necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of this chapter, the
franchise agreement and other pertinent provisions of law.
Penalty, see § 1-1-2-3
§ 4-2-7-8. SAFETY AND NON-INTERFERENCE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The operator shall at all times comply with all safety requirements of
the Municipal Code of the City of Lawrence. The operator shall at all times
employ reasonable care and shall install and maintain in use commonly accepted
methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents which are likely to
cause damage, injury or nuisance to the public. All cables and other equipment
within the public ways of the City of Lawrence shall at all times be kept and
maintained in as safe condition as can be reasonably accomplished using proven
technology generally used by the cable industry for comparable systems.
   (B)   Operation of the system shall not cause any interference to television
and radio reception, telephone communication or other similar operations within
the City of Lawrence.
Penalty, see § 1-1-2-3
§ 4-2-7-9. REQUIREMENTS AND NOTICES WHICH APPLY TO SUBCONTRACTS.
   The operator shall require any person performing contractual construction or
maintenance of the cable system or subscribers’ premises to have picture
identification on his or her person identifying him or her as authorized by the
operator. The operator shall provide to the Mayor the following information:
the name of each subcontractor, the subcontractor’s headquarters or main office
address, names of subcontractor’s officers or owner, a telephone number for
handling questions concerning the subcontractor’s work and evidence of both
worker’s compensation and general liability insurance. The operator agrees to
assume responsibility for any act or omission of its subcontractors and to hold
its subcontractors to the applicable standards in this chapter and the
franchise agreement. The City of Lawrence shall not be liable to or for any
subcontractor of the operator. Any review of the operator’s subcontractors or
failure to review the operator’s subcontractors by the City of Lawrence does
not in any way relieve the operator of its obligations under this chapter.
Penalty, see § 1-1-2-3
§ 4-2-7-10. PUBLIC SERVICE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The operator shall provide, upon request, one connection to its cable
system free of installation charge to all designated City of Lawrence
facilities, including the public library, and to all schools within the City
and shall provide without charge those services specified in the franchise
agreement. If the connection requires the extension of the operator’s cable
system by more than 150 feet from the operator’s existing system, the operator
may charge that portion of the extension costs required to extend the existing
system beyond 150 feet from the existing system. The operator shall provide a
governmental access channel using headed and system processing hardware and
techniques which will result in no significant deterioration in signal quality
in terms of carrier to noise (C/N), chroma delay, depth of modulation,
frequency stability or other system distortions as compared to the processing
quality utilized on the operator’s own entertainment channels.
   (B)   The operator shall install and maintain its cable system (including
cable, equipment and devices) so that the signal transmitted to each subscriber
at all outlets and on all channels, including the governmental channel, shall
be of adequate strength and quality to produce, without causing cross
modulation in the cable or interfering with other electrical or electronic
systems, pictures and sound as good as can be reasonably accomplished using
proven technology generally used by the cable industry for comparable systems.
   (C)   Except as preempted by federal or state law from doing so, the City of
Lawrence reserves the right to enforce Federal Communications Commission
technical standards regarding cable systems. Compliance with the regulations of
the Federal Communications Commission regarding signals transmitted, including
at a minimum the technical standards set forth in 47 C.F.R. § 76.601, as
amended from time to time, shall constitute compliance with division (A) above
so long as the regulations exist.
   (D)   The operator shall provide at least one channel to be allocated in
accordance with the franchise agreement for governmental access. The operator
shall interconnect its system with all other systems operating under a
franchise granted by the City of Lawrence so that the channel designated for
governmental access shall be transmitted on all systems simultaneously and on
the same channel. This obligation includes the provision of all devices
required to accomplish the interconnection.
   (E)   To the extent that an operator is providing programming for
educational or governmental access channels which another operator is required
to carry by interconnection, the interconnecting operator shall reimburse the
operator for a portion of its costs on a per subscriber basis in accordance
with rules and regulations adopted by the Mayor or on the terms as the affected
operators may agree.
   (F)   The Mayor may promulgate rules and procedures for the use of channels,
facilities, equipment and other support designated for governmental access. The
Mayor may promulgate rules and procedures under which the operator is permitted
to use the channel capacity for the provision of other services if the channel
capacity is not being used for designated purposes. The operator shall not
exercise any editorial control over any governmental use channel except as
federal law expressly provides otherwise and shall have no legal liability for
obscenity in accordance with the Act. The operator shall provide to the City of
Lawrence copies of any written and published policies concerning indecent
programming on leased access channels.
Penalty, see § 1-1-2-3
§ 4-2-7-11. PARENTAL CONTROL DEVICES.
   The operator shall provide to subscribers on request and at a reasonable
cost parental control devices to permit subscribers to block out the audio and
video of any channel. In addition, the operator shall install devices so that
access to pay-per-view programming is restricted through the use of a
confidential personal identification number or other confidential validating
information that can be assigned at the local business office or through the
mail upon subscriber request, and so that the sound and video portion of any
scrambled channel that carries programming can be blocked out on subscriber
request. The operator must notify all subscribers that this option is
available, when it first begins providing cable services to a subscriber and at
least annually thereafter.
Penalty, see § 1-1-2-3
§ 4-2-7-12. TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES.
   The operator, at its expense, shall at the request of the City of Lawrence,
but not more often than biennially, report to the Mayor on technological
advances in the industry and how the advances are being applied or could be
applied in the City. To the extent provided in a franchise agreement, the City
of Lawrence may periodically reopen negotiations with the operator to ensure
that the system is kept up to date.
§ 4-2-7-13. CONSUMER COMPLAINT AND SERVICE PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The City of Lawrence adopts the Federal Communications Commission
customer service standards, and the operator shall comply with these standards
and any modifications to the standards adopted by the Federal Communications
Commission during the term of its franchise.
   (B)   The operator shall maintain a local office within Marion County
staffed with at least one customer service representative and with normal
business hours, including evening hours at least two days a week. In addition,
the operator shall have a listed telephone, and be so operated that complaints
and requests for repairs or adjustments may be received at any time, whether
the office is open or closed.
   (C)   Maintenance service shall be immediately available to correct major
outages from 8:00 a.m. until 12:30 a.m. every day, including Saturdays, Sundays
and holidays. Investigative action shall be initiated in response to all
service calls, other than major outages, not later than the next business day
after the call is received. Corrective action shall be completed as promptly as
practicable.
   (D)   The operator shall provide consumer billing information at the time of
installation, at least annually to all subscribers and at any time upon
request. This information shall include written instructions that clearly set
forth procedures for placing a service call or requesting an adjustment. These
instructions shall also include a name, address and telephone number of the
franchise administrator and a reminder that the subscriber can call or write
for information regarding terms and conditions of the operator’s franchise if
the operator fails to respond to the subscriber’s request for installation,
service or adjustment within a reasonable period of time.
   (E)   In the event a subscriber does not obtain a satisfactory response or
resolution to his or her request for service or an adjustment within a
reasonable period of time, the subscriber may advise the Mayor of his or her
dissatisfaction in writing, and the Mayor shall advise the City Clerk of all
the complaints. The operator shall maintain records of customer complaints, of
responses to customer complaints and of service calls in a form adequate for
the Mayor to determine compliance with this article.
   (F)   All complaints and every rating filing (and supplementary filing)
shall become the sole property of the City of Lawrence and will be available
for public inspection unless otherwise properly designated as confidential by
the complainant or operator in accordance with applicable law. The complainant
or operator shall submit information which it believes is confidential
separately in a sealed envelope marked “confidential,” or the City of Lawrence
will treat the information as public. The complainant or operator cannot
designate information as confidential after a filing is made.
   (G)   The Clerk shall rule on requests for confidentiality. If the City of
Lawrence receives a request for information submitted by the operator as
confidential and the City Clerk determines that, in the City Clerk’s judgment,
the designation is inappropriate under applicable law, the City will treat the
information as public unless the operator agrees to defend and indemnify the
City from any and all losses, liabilities, claims, judgments and liens,
including costs and attorney’s fees, arising out of or resulting from the City
of Lawrence’s denial of a request for the information under Indiana’s public
records law (I.C. 5-14-3 and its successors). An operator may appeal any
decision that may result in release of information which the operator has
designated as confidential within timelines contemplated within FCC
regulations.
   (H)   The privacy of subscribers shall be protected in accordance with the
provisions of § 631 of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 (47 U.S.C. §
551).
Penalty, see § 1-1-2-3
§ 4-2-7-14. REGULATION OF CABLE TELEVISION RATES.
   (A)   The City of Lawrence will regulate cable rates as permitted by federal
law. The City of Lawrence has certification to regulate cable television rates
for basic service. All materials pertaining to the review of initial rates or
any proposed rate increase will be reviewed by the City of Lawrence. Final
determinations will be made by the Common Council based on the report from the
Mayor and public comment as required by federal law.
      (1)   All notices and supporting materials will be provided to the City
of Lawrence by filing with the City Clerk at least seven days before the
operator provides notice to subscribers as provided in division (A)(2) below.
The proposed rate increase then will be placed on the agenda of the next
regularly scheduled Common Council meeting.
      (2)   The operator will notify subscribers of any proposed rate increase
at the billing cycle that is at least 30 days in advance of the date the rate
increase is to become effective. Notice will list the FCC community identifier
for the cable system and the name, address and phone number of the Mayor so
that information regarding procedures for public participation is readily
available to the subscriber.
      (3)   Public comment will be taken by phone or in writing by the Mayor’s
office. Any comments will be filed with the City Clerk or Mayor up until the
day of the meeting at which the basic rate action is scheduled. The Common
Council has the option to accept oral comment at the aforementioned meeting.
      (4)   The Mayor will request further information if needed within one
week and the Common Council will issue a preliminary determination of the
reasonableness of the rate request within ten business days after the meeting.
Failure to provide reasonable requested material will automatically invoke
extended time periods for review.
      (5)   Determination of reasonableness of initial rates or any proposed
rate increase will be made pursuant to federal law. The City of Lawrence
reserves the right to prescribe a reasonable rate for the basic service tier or
associated equipment if it is determined that the proposed rate is
unreasonable.
      (6)   The City of Lawrence will order refunds to subscribers, including
interest computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service
for its tax refunds and additional tax payments. Notice and opportunity to
comment will be provided pursuant to the franchise agreement.
   (B)   All charges to subscribers and users shall be consistent throughout
the franchise area with a written schedule of fees for all services offered
available upon request. The operator shall be required to apprise in writing
each new subscriber of all applicable fees and charges for providing cable
television services. The operator shall not, with regard to fees, discriminate
or grant any preference or advantage to any person; provided, however, that the
operator may establish different rates for different classes of subscribers or
users based upon cost of service differentials; provided that the operator may
not discriminate between subscribers or users of the same class.
   (C)   Customer-requested disconnection shall be made as soon as practicable
and in no case shall billing continue longer than ten days following notice to
the operator of same by subscriber. The operator shall not enter into any
agreement with a subscriber which imposes any charge other than past due
balances and unreturned equipment charges following disconnection of service,
except for reconnection and subsequent monthly or periodic charges, and those
shall be no greater than the charges for new customers. This section shall not
prevent the operator from refusing service to any person because the operator’s
prior accounts with that person remain due and owing. Upon termination of
service to any subscriber, the operator shall promptly remove all its
facilities and equipment from the premises of the subscriber upon request.
   (D)   Except as may otherwise be provided in the franchise agreement, the
operator may offer service which requires advance payment of periodic service
charges for no more than one year in advance subject to the conditions
contained in this division (D). A subscriber shall have the right, at any time,
to have his or her service, or any portion thereof, disconnected with a refund
for unused service charges paid to the customer. Refund checks will be issued
promptly, but no later than either the customer’s next billing cycle following
resolution of the request or 30 days, whichever is earlier; or the return of
equipment supplied by the operator if service is terminated. Refunds of $5 or
more will be paid automatically. Refunds of less than $5 will be paid upon the
request of the subscriber.
§ 4-2-7-15. RESERVED.
§ 4-2-7-16. SECURITY FUND.
   (A)   Within 30 days after the execution of the franchise agreement, the
operator shall deposit with the City of Lawrence monies, a bond, a letter of
credit or a combination of these instruments in amounts specified in the
franchise agreement (the security fund) as security for the faithful
performance of all the provisions of the franchise agreement, for timely
completion of any construction required by the franchise agreement, for payment
of administrative fines described in §
4-2-7-19, and for payments by the operator of any claims, liens and taxes due
the City which arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of
the system. Any monies deposited pursuant to this section shall be placed by
the City Clerk of the City of Lawrence in an interest-bearing account at a bank
or local savings institution agreeable to both parties. Interest on this
account will accrue to the benefit of the operator upon completion and
activation of the system as required by the franchise agreement. Upon
completion of construction required by the franchise agreement, the security
fund shall be reduced to a reasonable amount by the Mayor, considering the
nature and extent of any anticipated liabilities during the remaining term of
the franchise, which amount shall be maintained during the period of the
franchise agreement.
   (B)   If the Mayor determines that City of Lawrence taxes are due from the
operator and are unpaid, that the City has been compelled to pay damages, cost
or expenses by reason of any act or default of the operator in connection with
the franchise agreement or that any other claims against the operator have
arisen by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the system,
so that the City may withdraw monies from the security fund, the City Clerk
shall make a written report to the Common Council outlining both the
circumstances which entitle the City to withdraw monies from the security fund
and the amount proposed to be withdrawn. The City Clerk shall provide a copy of
the report to the operator.
   (C)   The Common Council shall hold a hearing on the proposed withdrawal
during which the operator may respond to the City Clerk’s report. Following the
hearing, the Common Council shall vote on the City Clerk’s recommendation. If
the Council confirms recommendation, the City Clerk may immediately withdraw
the amount and, upon the withdrawal, the City Clerk shall notify the operator
of the amount and the withdrawal date.
   (D)   Within ten days after notice to the operator that any amount has been
withdrawn from the security fund, the operator shall pay to, or deposit with,
the City of Lawrence a sum of money or securities sufficient to restore the
security fund to the full amount required by division (A) above. If the
operator fails to restore the security fund within the specified ten-day
period, the City of Lawrence may withdraw the entire security fund deposit
remaining, which shall be forfeited.
   (E)   With respect to violations for which administrative fines are
specified in §
4-2-7-19, the Mayor or other authorized City official shall provide written
notice of the alleged violation to the operator and allow the operator 30 days
to comply. If the operator fails to comply or to notify the City of Lawrence
that corrective action is being actively and expeditiously pursued, the
authorized City official may initiate a proceeding before the Board of Public
Works and Safety, which is hereby designated pursuant to I.C. 36-1-6-9 as the
administrative board before which the violations may be enforced. Proceeding
shall be initiated by filing a complaint with the Board of Public Works and
Safety, which shall issue a summons to the operator setting a time and date at
which the Board will hold a hearing on the violations alleged in the complaint.
If after a hearing conducted in compliance with I.C. 36-1-6-9 the Board finds
that the operator has violated the ordinance as alleged, the Board shall enter
an order fixing the amount of the administrative fines. If the operator fails
to appeal the order of the Board within 60 days after the date of the order as
provided in I.C. 36-1-6-9(f), the City of Lawrence shall withdraw the amount of
administrative fines fixed in the order from the security fund.
   (F)   The security fund deposited pursuant to this section shall become the
property of the City of Lawrence in the event that the franchise agreement is
canceled by reason of the default of the operator. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the operator shall have the right to contest the Common Council’s or
Board of Public Works and Safety’s decision to authorize a withdrawal from the
security fund by filing an action in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the
operator prevails in the action, the City of Lawrence shall repay to the
operator the amount so withdrawn together with interest at the statutory rate
which applies to judgments from the date of the withdrawal.
   (G)   The operator shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or
portion thereof, and interest as remains on deposit with the City of Lawrence
at the expiration of the term of its franchise, provided that there is then no
outstanding default on the part of the operator.
   (H)   The rights reserved by the City of Lawrence with respect to the
security fund are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved
by this chapter, the franchise agreement or authorized by law; and no action,
proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to the security fund shall
affect any other right the City may have.
§ 4-2-7-17. LIABILITY, INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.
   (A)   The operator shall indemnify the City of Lawrence and its officers,
employees and agents for all expenses and costs, including reasonable
attorney’s fees and other out-of-pocket expenses, arising out of or resulting
from the grant of a franchise to the operator, provided that the operator shall
have the right to agree to the selection of counsel and the fees to be charged
for the defense and shall have the right, together with the City, to give
direction to counsel in the defense.
   (B)   The operator shall pay all damages and penalties which the City of
Lawrence may legally be required to pay as a result of the grant of its
franchise, including all damages arising out of the installation, operation or
maintenance of the system, whether or not any act or omission complained of is
authorized, allowed or prohibited by the ordinances of the City. The operator’s
payment shall include all amounts expended by the City of Lawrence in defending
itself in the action, including, but not limited to, attorney’s fees and out-
of-pocket expenses.
   (C)   In order for the City of Lawrence to assert its rights to be
indemnified, defended and held harmless, the City shall:
      (1)   Notify the operator of any claim or legal proceeding which gives
rise to the right;
      (2)   Afford the operator the opportunity to participate in any
compromise, settlement or other resolution or disposition of the claim or
proceeding and to fully control the financial terms of any payments to be made
in the final disposition;
      (3)   Fully cooperate with the reasonable request of the operator in its
participation in, and control, compromise, settlement, resolution or
disposition of the claim or proceeding; and
      (4)   The operator and the City shall act reasonably under all
circumstances so as to mutually protect each other against liability and to
refrain from compromising the rights of each other. The City of Lawrence shall
inform the operator of any offers to compromise, settle or otherwise resolve or
dispose of any claim or proceeding. If the operator is willing to accept the
offer and make all payments required by its terms, but the City of Lawrence
refuses to agree to the offer within 15 days of notice from the operator, the
operator’s obligation for indemnification shall be limited to the amount that
would have been due if the offer had been accepted.
   (D)   (1)   The operator shall purchase and maintain throughout the term of
the franchise agreement such commercial general liability and other insurance
as is appropriate and as will protect the operator and the City of Lawrence,
and their employees, officers or agents, from:
         (a)   Claims under worker’s compensation, disability benefits and
other similar employee benefit acts;
         (b)   Claims for damages because of bodily injury, occupational
sickness or disease or death of the operator’s employees;
         (c)   Claims for damages because of bodily injury, sickness or disease
or death of any person other than the operator’s employees;

which are sustained by any person as a result of an offense directly or
indirectly related to the employment of that person by the operator, or by any
other person or entity for any other reason;
         (e)   Claims for damages because of physical injury to or destruction
of tangible property wherever located, including loss of use resulting
therefrom;
         (f)   Claims arising out of operation of any laws or regulations for
damages because of bodily injury or death of any person or for damages to
property; and
         (g)   Claims for damages because of bodily injury or death of any
person or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of
any motor vehicle, which may arise out of or result from the operator’s other
obligations under the franchise agreement, whether it is to be performed or
furnished by the operator, by any subcontractor, by anyone directly or
indirectly employed by any of them to perform or furnish any of the work under
the franchise agreement, or by anyone for whose acts any of them may be liable.
      (2)   Written evidence of payment of premiums and copies of the insurance
certificates shall be filed with the Clerk within 30 days of the date the
franchise agreement is fully executed.
   (E)   The insurance required by this section shall be written for not less
than the limits of liability and coverages as provided herein or as required by
law, whichever is greater. The commercial general liability insurance shall
include coverage of premises and operations; contractual liability as
applicable to any indemnification or hold harmless agreement in the franchise
agreement; products and completed operations; broadform property damage,
including completed operations; fellow employee claims under personal injury;
and independent contractors. The insurance shall specifically include coverage

of any structure or removal or rebuilding of any structural support of a
building or structure. The insurance shall further include coverage for damage
to wires, conduits, pipes, mains, sewers or other similar apparatus encountered
below the surface of the ground when the damage is caused by any occurrence
arising out of work performed by the operator or by any of the operator’s
subcontractors or anyone directly or indirectly employed by either. The
commercial general liability insurance required by this section shall include
contractual liability insurance applicable to the indemnity and hold harmless
obligations under the franchise agreement.
   (F)   (1)   The operator’s insurance shall be written for not less than the
following limits of liability:

conducting franchise audits and performance evaluations, if specifically
required by the franchise agreement.
§ 4-2-7-23. SCOPE OF FRANCHISE RIGHTS.
   (A)   No privilege or power of eminent domain is bestowed by the grant of a
franchise under this chapter. The grant of franchise does not confer any rights
other than as expressly provided by this chapter or the franchise agreement.
   (B)   The franchise and the right it grants to use and occupy the public
ways shall not be exclusive and do not explicitly or implicitly preclude the
issuance of other franchises to operate cable systems or other communications
systems with the City of Lawrence, affect the City’s right to authorize the use
of public ways by other persons or entities to operate cable systems or other
communications systems or for other purposes as it determines appropriate for
the same or a different franchise territory, or affect the City’s right to
itself construct, operate or maintain a cable system or other communications
system, with or without a franchise as permitted by federal or state law.
§ 4-2-7-24. TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   Prior approval of the City of Lawrence shall be required before a
franchise granted by the City shall be assigned or transferred, either in whole
or in part, or leased or sublet in any manner, nor shall title thereto, either
legal or equitable, or any right, interest or property therein, pass to or vest
in any person or entity until prior approval is granted.
   (B)   The proposed transferee shall make a written verified application for
approval of the transfer. The application shall provide complete information
regarding the proposed transfer, including:
      (1)   Documents embodying the transaction;
      (2)   Financing documents, if any;
      (3)   Documents describing the proposed transferee;
      (4)   Documents identifying any person or entity who will be responsible,
through any arrangement, for managing or controlling the system;
      (5)   Documents showing that the proposed transferee has the financial,
technical and legal ability to operate the system after the transfer so as to
satisfy all its obligations under the franchise without adversely affecting
subscribers; and
      (6)   Other information as may be required in any ordinance governing
applications for a franchise.
   (C)   The City of Lawrence shall render a final decision on the operator’s
request in writing within 120 days of the date the City receives the
information specified above and information required by federal law. The City
of Lawrence may seek additional information from the operator or the proposed
transferee and both will cooperate to provide the information to the City. The
City of Lawrence shall be under no obligation to transfer the franchise if the
operator’s acts or omissions make the franchise subject to revocation, nor
shall the City be required to transfer unless it is fully satisfied that past
nonperformance will be corrected, claims that could be considered as part of
any renewal proceeding are fully preserved to the extent permitted by law, and
the proposed transferee has the ability and is likely to comply with the
franchise agreement for the future. By way of illustration and not limitation,
under no circumstances will the franchise be transferred unless the proposed
transferee agrees to accept all the terms and conditions of the franchise
agreement except to the extent that the City of Lawrence may be willing to
expressly modify the terms and conditions as part of the approval of the
transfer. Approval of transfer does not constitute a waiver of any rights by
the City of Lawrence or indicate that the operator is or has been in compliance
with the franchise agreement or applicable law. The City of Lawrence may
conduct the public hearings as it deems appropriate to consider the transfer
request.
   (D)   The operator, upon transfer, shall within 60 days file with the City
of Lawrence a copy of the deed, agreement, mortgage, lease or other written
instrument evidencing transfer of ownership control or lease of the system,
certified and sworn to as correct by the operator.
   (E)   A transfer shall include any sale of system assets, a transfer of the
franchise itself or a change in control or ownership of the operator. The term
“control” includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised, and
there shall be a rebuttable presumption that a transfer shall have occurred
upon acquisition or accumulation by any person or entity of 5% of the shares or
interest in the operator or any entity which owns or controls the operator.

upon the City Controller’s own motion, a hearing shall be conducted by the City
Controller during which evidence shall be presented under oath by both the
licensee and those inspectors or others knowing the reasons why the license
should be revoked. Upon the completion of the hearing the City Controller shall
reinstate the license, rescind or modify the provisional order or temporary
suspension or revoke the license.
   (F)   At any time during the ten-day period, the licensee may request in
writing a reasonable extension of the time to remedy the reasons for which the
provisional order or temporary suspension was issued. The City Controller may
grant or deny the request in the discretion of the City Controller or the City
Controller may order a continuance or extension of time on the City
Controller’s own motion.
   (G)   In all cases where the license is revoked or suspended, the decision
of the City Controller shall be reported in writing to the licensee affected
and a certified copy of the decision shall be filed in the City Controller’s
office within 24 hours from the time of the decision. The decision shall become

direct or indirect control of the hotel.
   (I)   If after a hearing a license is revoked or suspended and not
reinstated on appeal, the licensee shall pay to the City the cost of hearings
in connection with the revocation or suspension. The City Controller shall

   These provisions shall be known as the Special Events Code of the City of
Lawrence and shall be cited as such and will be referred to herein as “this
code.”
(Ord. 8, 2024, passed 7-17-2024)
§ 4-2-11-2. PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   It is the purpose of the Common Council (the “Common Council”) of the
City of Lawrence (the “City”) to establish a comprehensive framework for the
issuance of special events permits, facilitating a wide array of public
activities including, but not limited to, vehicle/boat shows, auctions,
concerts/live music, festivals/carnivals, mass participation sports,
exhibitions, outdoor markets, community gatherings, games of chance such as
bingo, lotteries, food and beverage sales, displays involving fireworks, lasers
or pyrotechnics, and closures of public rights-of-way. Recognizing the vital
role these events play in enhancing the cultural, social and economic fabric of
our community, the City is committed to promoting a vibrant communal life.
These events not only enrich the lifestyle of the City’s residents by offering
diverse experiences and fostering community engagement but also attract
visitors, showcasing what the City has to offer.
   (B)   Furthermore, acknowledging the invaluable contributions of tax-exempt,
non-profit organizations to the welfare and quality of life in the City, this
code aims to support these entities in their efforts to organize events that
generate the necessary resources to deliver essential services to the City’s
residents. By delineating special event venues, this code seeks to complement
existing land use regulations, ensuring a well-coordinated approach to managing
the various activities associated with special events. This includes
safeguardingthe health and safety of event attendees, prohibiting unlawful
activities within event venues and upholding the rights and privileges of
special event permit holders.
Additionally, this code is designed to institute a fair and efficient mechanism
for the recovery of costs and sharing of revenues derived from certain special
events. In doing so, it aims to minimize any potential negative financial
impacts on events that play a pivotal role in enriching the community’s
cultural and social landscape. Through the thoughtful regulation and support of
special events, the City endeavors to foster a dynamic, inclusive and thriving
community for all its residents and visitors.

§ 4-2-11-6. ISSUANCE OF A SPECIAL EVENT PERMIT DOES NOT OBLIGATE CITY SERVICES.
   This section establishes the framework within which the City manages its
involvement in special events, clarifying that the issuance of a permit does
not guarantee City support services. It also outlines the process through which
services can be provided, ensuring that such decisions are made transparently
and with due consideration for the City’s interests.
   (A)   No obligation for services. The issuance of a special event permit by
the City, in accordance with this chapter, does not create an obligation or
requirement for the Department of Public Works or any other City department to
provide city services, equipment, or personnel in support of a special event.
The granting of a permit is primarily for authorization and coordination
purposes and does not automatically entail support services from the City.
   (B)   Provision of services. Subject to the approval of the Common Council,
the Department of Public Works may provide City services, equipment, or
personnel to support special events. Such support is discretionary and must be
considered on a case-by-case basis, weighing the benefits to the community
against the cost and logistical implications for the City. Approval from the
Common Council is not mandated for the Department of Public Works to offer City
services, equipment, or personnel for a special event, provided that
arrangements have been made with the event organizer for cost recovery or
revenue sharing, or both. This ensures that while the City can support special
events that contribute positively to the community, it does so in a manner that
is financially responsible and sustainable.
(Ord. 8, 2024, passed 7-17-2024)
§ 4-2-11-7. PRIORITY OF SPECIAL EVENT PERMIT ISSUANCE.
   Scheduling priority for special event permits within the City shall be
determined according to the following order of precedence, with Group 1 being
afforded the highest priority and Group 3 the lowest. Permit issuance will be
conducted on a first-come, first-served basis within each group. Upon approval
by the Department of Public Works, changes to the approved event date may be
considered.
   (A)   Eligible user groups.
      (1)   Group 1: Civic-Sponsored Events. These events are directly
sponsored by the City and/or involve significant partnership with civic
organizations that have a long-standing tradition of serving the City’s
community.
      (2)   Group 2: Non-Commercial Special Events. These include events
organized by non-profit organizations or community groups that do not have a
primary commercial purpose and are aimed at providing services, entertainment,
or benefits to the citizens of the City without a significant commercial
objective.
      (3)   Group 3: Commercial Special Events. These events are primarily
commercial in nature, organized by businesses or commercial entities with the
intent of profit-making. While these events can also offer cultural,
recreational, or community benefits, their primary aim is commercial success.
   (B)   In cases where multiple applications are received for the same event

(Ord. 8, 2024, passed 7-17-2024)
§ 4-2-11-12. CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE ISSUANCE OF A SPECIAL EVENT PERMIT.
   (A)   The issuance of a special event permit by the City’s Special Event
Permit Administrator is contingent upon the fulfillment of specific conditions
aimed at ensuring public safety, minimizing disruptions to daily life, and
maintaining the quality of life within the community. A special event permit
may be issued when all the following conditions are satisfactorily met:
      (1)   Minimal disruption to traffic and public transport. The event must
be planned in such a manner that it does not significantly interrupt the flow
of public transportation, vehicular, and pedestrian traffic within and around
the event area.
      (2)   No conflict with public works. The event should not interfere with
ongoing construction, development activities in the public right-of-way or
operations at public facilities.
      (3)   Avoidance of peak traffic hours. The scheduling of the event must
avoid blocking traffic lanes or street closures during the peak commute hours
on weekdays, to minimize impact on the City’s traffic flow.
      (4)   Limited impact on police and fire resources. The event should not
necessitate the diversion of a large number of police or fire personnel from
their normal duties, ensuring that the City can continue to provide reasonable
protection and services to all areas.
      (5)   Emergency vehicle access. There must be adequate planning to ensure
that the concentration of people, animals or vehicles does not impede the
movement of public safety and emergency vehicles.
      (6)   Efficient movement. The event must progress from its starting point
to its conclusion without unnecessary stops, ensuring it does not unduly
obstruct the area for an extended period.
      (7)   Consideration of community impact. The event should be planned with
an understanding of its potential effects on local residents, businesses, and
traffic patterns, taking steps to mitigate adverse impacts.
      (8)   Sporting event limitations. If the event involves a participatory
sport, it should not be scheduled within 30 days of another similar sporting
event in the area, to avoid overburdening local resources and infrastructure.
      (9)   Adequate health facilities. The event provides sufficient means of
sanitation and utilizes the appropriate recycling or waste collection services
to be available in or adjacent to any public assembly areas, as necessary.
   (B)   To ensure compliance with these conditions, the Special Event Permit
Administrator reserves the right to impose specific stipulations on the permit.
Additionally, if the event necessitates significant alterations to vehicular
traffic patterns, including the closure of streets or public rights-of-way,
final approval from the Common Council will be required.
(Ord. 8, 2024, passed 7-17-2024)
§ 4-2-11-13. REASONS FOR DENIAL OF A SPECIAL EVENT PERMIT.
   (A)   The City's Special Event Permit Administrator is vested with the
authority to assess and either approve or deny applications for special event
permits. A special event permit may be denied under the following
circumstances:
      (1)   Incomplete application. If an applicant has not fulfilled all the
necessary requirements for submitting a complete application for a special
event permit.
      (2)   Public safety concerns. If the proposed event is deemed likely to
incite violent or disorderly conduct, posing an imminent threat to public
safety or likely to result in significant property damage.
      (3)   Violation of laws. If the event is found to potentially violate
existing public health or safety laws.
      (4)   Non-compliance with legal or policy requirements. If the event does
not adhere to applicable laws or established council policies.
      (5)   Past non-compliance. If the applicant has previously demonstrated
an inability or unwillingness to conduct an event in accordance with the
chapter’s terms and conditions, or if a past event authorized to the applicant
did not comply with legal or permit requirements.
      (6)   Unreasonable use or access restriction. If the event would
necessitate the exclusive use of a public area in a way that adversely affects
the general public’s reasonable use or access to that area.
      (7)   Lack of necessary approvals or permits. If the applicant has not
obtained required approvals or permits from other relevant public agencies
whose jurisdictions would be affected by the event.
      (8)   Inadequate emergency plans. If the applicant has failed to provide
a satisfactory first aid or emergency medical services plan, taking into
account the risk factors associated with the event.
      (9)   Late application. Applications submitted less than 45 days prior to
the event date are subject to denial.
      (10)   Non-compliance with chapter terms or previous permit conditions.
If the applicant has not adhered to any chapter term or condition stipulated in
a previously issued special event permit.
      (11)   Substantial adverse impacts. The proposed special event will
substantially interfere with any other event, parade, City sponsored event,
street or right-of-way closure or other special event for which a license has
already been granted, or substantially interfere with the provision of public
safety or other City services in support of such other previously scheduled
event or events, or will have an immitigable adverse impact upon residential or
business access and traffic circulation in the area in which it is to be
conducted.
   (B)   These criteria ensure that events conducted within the City limits are
safe, lawful, and in harmony with the community's standards and regulations.

arise, and in such instances, the Special Event Permit Administrator may extend

repair obligations under an issued permit, the City may require a deposit of
adequate surety, either in cash or bond form, as a precondition for future

wastewater collection system which will occupy capacity reserved for community
growth; and

designed and constructed according to sound minimum engineering standards and
to accommodate for future growth of the City of Lawrence infrastructure.
   (C)   This

collection system through the issuance of industrial discharge and building
permits, the execution of special agreements and the enforcement of
administrative regulations.
   (D)   In furtherance of these objectives, this
Article 1 details the general regulation of discharges to public sewers, the
issuance of connecting permits for building sewers, the inspection of building
sewers, the issuance of construction permits for sewer expansions, the issuance
of discharge permits for industrial users of the system, the establishment of a
system of rates, charges and billings for the use of the system, and

school kitchens; or other establishments where grease may be introduced into
the drainage or sewage system in quantities that can affect line stoppage or
hinder sewage treatment. The characteristics, size and method of installation
of the grease interceptor shall meet the requirements imposed by the City Civil
Engineer and shall be reviewed and approved by the City Civil Engineer prior to
the commencement of installation. Approval of proposed facilities or equipment
does not relieve the person of the responsibility of enlarging or otherwise
modifying the facilities to accomplish the intended purpose. On a showing of
good cause, the City Civil Engineer may waive this requirement. A grease
interceptor is not required for individual dwelling units or for any private
living quarters.
   (H)   No user shall change substantially the character or volume of
pollutants discharged to the City’s POTW without prior written notification to
the City.
Penalty, see § 5-1-1-16
§ 5-1-1-5. [RESERVED].
   Reserved for future expansion.
§ 5-1-1-6. STATE AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   Federal categorical pretreatment standards or state requirements and
limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent
than those in this chapter. To the extent the federal regulations contain
stricter standards, the categorical pretreatment standards, found in 40 C.F.R.
Chapter I, Subchapter N, pts. 405 through 471, are hereby incorporated by
reference into this chapter. To the extent the state regulations contain
stricter standards, the pretreatment standards found in 327 I.A.C. 5-12-6 are
hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter.
§ 5-1-1-7. CITY’S RIGHT OF REVISION.
   The City reserves the right to establish by ordinance or other legal means
more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater
collection system than those in this chapter if deemed necessary to comply with
the objectives presented in §
5-1-1-1 or to comply with federal or state laws.
§ 5-1-1-8. BASELINE REPORT.
   Within 180 days after the effective date of a federal categorical
pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made
on a category, whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to the
categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to
discharge to the City’s POTW will be required to submit to the Director a
report containing the following information as required by 40 C.F.R. § 403.12
(b):
   (A)   Identifying information. The user shall submit the name and address of
the facility including the name of the operator and owners;
   (B)   Permits. A list of all environmental control permits held by or for
the facility;
   (C)   Description of operations. The user shall submit a brief description
of the nature, average rate of production and standard industrial
classification of the operation(s) carried out by the industrial user. This
description shall include a schematic process diagram, which indicates points
of discharge to the wastewater works from the regulated processes;
   (D)   Flow measurement.
      (1)   Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily
flows, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following:
         (a)   Regulated process streams; and
         (b)   Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste
stream formula of 40 C.F.R.§ 403.6(e).
      (2)   The Director may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows
where justified by cost or feasibility considerations.
   (E)   Measurement of pollutants. The pretreatment standards applicable to
each regulated process and concentration and nature (or mass) as measured
according to 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)(5); and
   (F)   Report. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment
standards or regulations are being met on a consistent basis. If not, then the
report shall state what operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is
necessary to bring the user into compliance and the shortest schedule by which
the user will provide the additional operation and maintenance and/or
pretreatment, provided that the completion date shall not be later than the
compliance date established for the applicable categorical pretreatment
standard. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the
industrial user and certified by a professional engineer licensed in the State
of Indiana.
Penalty, see § 5-1-1-16
§ 5-1-1-9. EXCESSIVE DISCHARGE; DILUTION PROHIBITED.
   It shall be prohibited for an industrial user to increase the use of process
water or other flows to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute
for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in
the federal categorical pretreatment standards or in any other pollutant-
specific limitation developed by the City or state.
Penalty, see § 5-1-1-16
§ 5-1-1-10. ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE.
   (A)   Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental
discharge of substances regulated by this chapter. Facilities to prevent
accidental discharge shall be provided and maintained at the owner’s or user’s
own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating
procedures to provide this protection shall be available to the City for
review. All existing industrial users shall complete the plan within six months
after the effective date of this chapter. No industrial user who commences
contribution to the City’s POTW after the effective date of this chapter shall
be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge
procedures are available. The plans and operating procedures shall not relieve
the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the industrial user’s
facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of
the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the Director of the
incident. The notification shall include:
      (1)   Name of company;

the industrial user shall submit to the Director a detailed written report
describing the accidental discharge, including:
      (1)   The cause of the accidental discharge;
      (2)   The period of the accidental discharge, including exact dates and
times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected
to continue; and
      (3)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate or prevent
recurrence of the accidental discharge.
   (E)   The notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
wastewater works or aquatic life, fish kills or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall the notification relieve the user of any fines, civil
penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other
applicable law.
   (F)   An affirmative defense of upset may be available to an industrial user
in an enforcement proceeding. In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial
user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of
proof.
   (G)   (1)   An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative
defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous
operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
         (a)   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the
specific cause(s) of the upset;
         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
         (c)   The industrial user has submitted to the City the information
required in divisions (C) and (D) above; and
         (d)   The industrial user complied with any reasonable remedial
measures to minimize or prevent any discharge or sludge use or disposal in
violation of this chapter, which has a reasonable likelihood of adversely
affecting human health or the environment.
      (2)   An upset defense is only available for violations of categorical
pretreatment standards or technology-based permit effluent limitations.
   (H)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or
other prominent place advising affected employees whom to call in the event of
a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause
or suffer a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.
Penalty, see § 5-1-1-16
§ 5-1-1-11. LIABILITY FOR DAMAGE.
   (A)   If any person discharges or causes to be discharged a waste which
causes interference, pass- through, obstruction, damage or any other impairment
to the City’s POTW or the City of Indianapolis’ POTW, the Director may assess a
charge against the person for:
      (1)   The work required to clean or repair the City’s POTW;
      (2)   Any civil penalty, fine or cost of compliance with injunctions or
other orders of a court or governmental authority imposed against the City as a
result of the interference, obstruction, damage or impairment; and
      (3)   All other costs or damages incurred by the City as a result of the
interference, pass-through, obstruction, damage or impairment including but not
limited to expert, consultant and attorney’s fees; and add the charges to the
person’s regular charge.
   (B)   A person shall have an affirmative defense to any charge assessed
against it under this section where the person can demonstrate that he, she or
it did not know or have reason to know that his, her or its discharge, alone or
in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other sources, would cause
pass-through or interference:
      (1)   A local limit designed to prevent pass-through and/or interference,
as the case may be, has been developed for each pollutant in the person’s
discharge that caused pass-through or interference, and the person was in
compliance with the local limit directly prior to and during the pass-through
or interference; or
      (2)   If a local limit designed to prevent pass-through and/or
interference, as the case may be, has not been developed for the pollutant(s)
that caused the pass-through or interference, the person’s discharge directly
prior to and during the pass-through or interference did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the person’s prior discharge
activity when the POTW was regularly in compliance with the POTW’s NPDES permit
requirements and, in the case of interference, applicable requirements for
sewage sludge use or disposal.
Penalty, see § 5-1-1-16
§ 5-1-1-12. SPECIAL AGREEMENTS.
   Special agreements and arrangements between the Department and any person
may be established when, in the opinion of the Director, unusual or
extraordinary circumstances compel special terms and conditions. The Director
shall consider the total cost of application of technology in relation to the
pollutant reduction benefits to be achieved from the application, the quality
of pollutants that will be included in the discharge, the impact of those
pollutants on the City’s POTW, the City of Indianapolis’ POTW and the receiving
stream and other factors as the Director deems appropriate. A violation of a
term of a special agreement shall be considered a violation of this chapter.
There cannot be special agreements and arrangements where federal categorical
pretreatment standards and requirements apply.
§ 5-1-1-13. MONITORING DEVICES; METERING EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   The Director may require any industrial user or private sewer owner or
person to construct, at his or her own expense, monitoring facilities to allow
inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building drain or sewer and
may also require sampling or metering equipment to be provided, installed and
operated at the user’s expense. The monitoring facility should normally be
situated on the user’s premises, but the Director may, when that location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship, upon his or her approval, allow the
facility to be constructed in the public right-of-way; provided, however, that
approval of the exact location of the facility in the public right-of-way on or
below which the monitoring device and facility shall be placed is first
obtained from all applicable City departments or other governmental agencies
having jurisdiction of that public right-of-way.
   (B)   The owner of the property abutting the public right-of-way to be used
for the installation of the monitoring device shall submit to the City Civil
Engineer or other governmental agency having jurisdiction a temporary right-of-
way use permit request.
   (C)   Industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall
have the option to designate a sampling location at a point containing only
regulated process wastewaters or at a point containing the combined waste
stream to demonstrate compliance with the applicable standard. The industrial
user shall prove to the satisfaction of the Director that the selected self-
monitoring location contains all regulated waste streams. This option does not
relieve the industrial user of the requirements specified in division (A)
above.
   (D)   An industrial user shall obtain written approval of the Director prior
to changing the point of self-monitoring activities.
Penalty, see § 5-1-1-16
§ 5-1-1-14. RIGHT TO INSPECT.
   Whenever required to carry out the objectives of this
Article 1, the Director or his or her authorized representative, upon
presentation of his or her credentials, shall have a right of entry to, upon or
through any premises for purpose of reviewing relevant records or inspecting,
measuring and sampling of the discharges. This right of entry shall include,
but not be limited to, any equipment necessary to conduct the inspections,
measuring and sampling. It shall be the duty of the person to provide all
necessary clearance before entry and not to unnecessarily delay or hinder the
Director in carrying out the review of relevant records, inspection, measuring
and sampling. The right of entry shall exist at any time.
Penalty, see § 5-1-1-16
§ 5-1-1-15. RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   After the passage of this
Article 1, and from time to time thereafter as may be needed, the Department,
by and through the Board of Public Works and Safety, may promulgate rules and
regulations necessary to implement and carry out the provisions of this
Article 1.
§ 5-1-1-16. PENALTIES.
   (A)   Notwithstanding any other section, any person who violates any
provision or discharge limit of this
Article 1 may be fined an amount not to exceed $2,500. A violation of any
permit issued under this
Article 1 or special agreement entered into under the authority of this
Article 1 shall constitute a violation of this
Article 1. Each day’s violation shall constitute a separate offense.
   (B)   Nothing in this
Article 1 shall restrict any right which may be provided by statute or common
law to the City to bring other actions, at law or at equity, including
injunctive relief.
§ 5-1-1-17. RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENT.
   (A)   Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements established
in this
Article 1 shall maintain records of all information resulting from any
monitoring activities required by this chapter. The records shall include for
all samples:
      (1)   The date, exact place, method and time of sampling and the name(s)
of the person or persons taking the samples;
      (2)   The dates analyses were performed;
      (3)   Who performed the analyses;
      (4)   The analytical techniques/methods used; and
      (5)   The results of the analyses.
   (B)   Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements established
in this
Article 1 shall be required to retain for a minimum of three years any records

local time, Monday through Friday, except for observed City holidays. The
building sewer, in its entirety from the foundation to the connection with the
public sewer or existing lateral, must be exposed for inspection and be
properly bedded in accordance with the City’s standard specifications to one-
half the diameter of the building sewer. It is further the duty of the permit
holder to install safety barricades, fences or other safety measures while
waiting for an inspection. The permit holder may backfill the building sewer
trench if the Department has not made an inspection within a 48-hour period
after notice has been given to the Department. In the event the building sewer
is not completed and ready for inspection upon the inspector’s arrival, the
permit holder shall pay a reinspection fee in the amount imposed under §
5-1-4-5 and provide a new notification as described above. An inspection may be
waived with or without conditions with the approval of the Director.

of Indianapolis’ POTW’s consistent removal of pollutants otherwise subject to
federal pretreatment standards; and
      (6)   Other fees as the City may deem necessary to carry out the
requirements contained herein.
§ 5-1-4-7. BILLING ESTIMATES AND REPORTS.
   (A)   In the event a non-industrial user subject to these charges and fees
is not served by a public water supply or water used is not completely metered,
the Director shall have the authority to estimate the volume and strength of
the waste and use the estimate for the purposes of billing rates and charges or
require the installation of monitoring facilities in accordance with §
5-1-1-13(A). The estimates shall be based upon analyses and volumes of a
similar installation or the volume and analysis as determined by measurements
and samples taken by the Director or an estimate determined by the Director or
by any combination of the foregoing or other equitable method.
   (B)   Unless otherwise established by the Director, each industrial user
subject to these charges and fees shall report to the Director by the twenty-
fifth day of the following month on a form prescribed by the Director an
estimate of the volume discharged in the prior month and a representative value
of the strength of the waste, including but not limited to BOD, SS and
(ammonia) nitrogen. All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics
of the waste shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of
Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewage as published jointly
by the American Public Health Association and the Water Pollution Control
Federation consistent with 40 C.F.R. pt. 136 or by other methods generally
accepted under established sanitary engineering practices and approved by the
Director. The reports submitted shall be subject to verification by the
Director but may serve as the basis for billing with all necessary adjustments
in the amounts to be made after verification. In the event an analysis and
volume of the industrial waste is not furnished to the Director by the
aforementioned time, the charges shall be based upon estimates made by the
Director, as provided in division (A) above.
   (C)   (1)   In the event that an industrial user fails to submit the report
required by this section by the twenty-fifth day of the following month, the
industrial user shall pay late reporting charges according to the following
schedule.
 
Late Reports Filed in Any Year Late Charge
First late report              No charge
Second late report             $100
Each subsequent late report    $500
 
      (2)   These late reporting charges shall be due and payable as provided
in this chapter. The imposition of the late reporting charges shall in no way
limit the operation of penalties provided elsewhere in this
Article 1.
   (D)   The Director shall have the right to enter upon the land of the
industrial user and to set up equipment as is necessary to certify the reports
submitted. It shall be the duty of the industrial user to provide all necessary
clearance before entry and not to unnecessarily delay or hinder the Director in
carrying out the measuring and sampling. The right of entry shall exist during
any time the industrial user is operating or open for business.
   (E)   In cases where measurements are difficult to make, or the industrial
waste composition changes frequently, or representative samples are difficult
to get, or where other methods of measurement are necessitated for other sound
engineering reasons as determined by the Director, the Director shall have the
authority to use such other basis for determining the charges as shall be
reliably indicative of volume and BOD, SS and (ammonia) nitrogen strengths of
particular industrial waste, such as, but not limited to, water purchase or
usage, character of products, comparisons between the industrial user data and
collected data from like industries.
   (F)   The cost of all tests, measurements and analyses taken by the Director
pursuant to the City’s responsibility to perform industrial monitoring
programs, defined and directed by local, state and federal agencies, shall be
charged to the industrial user tested in an amount equal to the actual average
cost of the test, measurement or analysis as determined at the close of each
calendar year. These costs shall be due and payable as provided in this
chapter.
§ 5-1-4-8. CONTRACT FOR BILLING BY THIRD PARTIES.
   (A)   The City, after approval by the Board of Public Works and Safety and
the Lawrence Common Council, shall be authorized to enter into a contract with
any third party service provider for the services of ascertaining water volume
to be utilized in determining charges imposed by this chapter, billing and
collecting charges and fees, other services reasonably related to billing and
collecting charges and fees, and for the payment of just and reasonable
compensation for these services.
   (B)   If applicable, billings for charges and fees provided for by this
chapter shall be made in a cycle, which coincides with the billing cycle of the
third party service provider, or in the case where the person subject to the
charges and fees is not a customer of the third party, the billing cycle shall
be determined by the Director.
   (C)   Billings for charges and fees provided for by this chapter may be
combined with billings for other services rendered by the third party service
provider, where applicable, and presented as a single document. The combined
billing document shall set forth separately the charges and fees provided for
by this chapter.
   (D)   Charges and fees shall be due upon mailing of billings. Accounts shall
be delinquent if not paid within 17 days after mailing of billings, with the
exception that charges and fees assessed against or to be paid by a federal,
state, county or municipal governmental unit shall be delinquent if not paid
within 60 days after mailing of billings.
§ 5-1-4-9. USE BY OTHER POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   No use of the City’s POTW shall be allowed by any other political
subdivision of the state unless and until the Director shall have determined
that all rates and charges, including industrial cost recovery of the political
subdivision, are consistent with this chapter, the laws of the United States
and regulations of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
§ 5-1-4-10. UNDERPAYMENT AND OVERPAYMENT OF CHARGES AND BILLING ADJUSTMENTS.
   Underpayment or overpayment of charges and fees based on inaccuracies of
reports or estimates provided in this chapter, or arising from any other cause,
shall be adjusted as provided in regulations promulgated by the Director and
approved by the Board of Public Works and Safety.
§ 5-1-4-11. RULES AND REGULATIONS AUTHORIZED.
   After the effective date of this chapter, the Board of Public Works and
Safety may, by resolution, promulgate rules and regulations necessary to
implement and carry out the provisions of this chapter. Before any rules and
regulations shall become effective, the Board of Public Works and Safety shall
follow the procedures provided in I.C. 36-9-25.
§ 5-1-4-12. APPEALS.
   (A)   Any person subject to this chapter who has good cause to believe that
charges and fees have been assessed against him or her in error may appeal to
an Account Review Officer (ARO) appointed by the Director. Employees of a third
party service provider described in §
5-1-4-8 may be appointed ARO. Procedures and time periods for initiating and
deciding the appeals shall be set forth in regulations promulgated by the
Board.
   (B)   Any person who has properly appealed to an ARO and is dissatisfied
with the determination may appeal to the Board of Public Works and Safety.
Procedures and time periods for initiating and deciding the appeals shall be
set forth in regulations promulgated by the Board.
   (C)   The Board of Public Works and Safety is directed to notify the person
making appeal of the time and place when his or her appeal will be heard. Upon
evidence sufficient to the Board submitted at the hearing establishing that the
charges are in error, the Board shall make adjustments in the charges and fees.
Adjustments may be in the form of a refund or a credit against subsequent
assessments of the charges and fees provided for in this chapter.
§ 5-1-4-13. SUMMER RESIDENTIAL RATE ADJUSTMENT.
   The residential sewage service billing based upon metered water usage
readings which occur in each of the months June, July, August and September and
which are billed in the months of July, August, September and October,
respectively, of each year shall be based upon the average quantity of water
metered during the water billing cycles ending in the months of March, April
and May preceding the months of June, July, August and September. Averages
resulting in fractions of 1,000 gallons shall be raised to the next whole
thousand gallons in computing the billings for the months of June, July, August
and September. There must have been metered water usage during each of the
months of February, March, April and May for this average to become the
baseline usage for the Summer Residential Rate Adjustment to be effective. For
those residential sewage service users who do not have a water usage average
for the cycles ending in the months of February, March, April and May, the
sewage service billing for the months of June, July, August and September shall
be based upon actual water usage, or at the option of the user, their base
water usages for June, July, August and September shall be based upon 2,000
gallons usage per person upon authenticated representation being made to the
Utility Billing Office of the number of persons then residing at the billing
address.

§ 5-1-4-14. RATE TRACKING FACTOR.
   (A)   The rate tracking factor is a pass through of those costs assessed to
the City of Lawrence by the City of Indianapolis pursuant to contract or rate
tariff. The rate tracking factor shall be determined as follows;
      (1)   Increased costs (assessed by City of Indianapolis)
      (2)   Divided by total gallons billed/1,000 gallons
      (3)   Equals cost per 1,000 gallons.
   (B)   The rate tracking factor will be applied upon notice by the City of
Indianapolis of a rate increase or upon annual review in January. Any necessary
increase or decrease shall be recommended by the Utility Service Board to the
Common Council for approval.

§ 5-1-6-1. PURPOSE AND TERRITORIAL APPLICATION.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the safety, health and
general welfare of the citizens of the City of Lawrence by requiring compliance
with standards and practices which will result in proper sanitary sewer and
sanitary sewer lift station design and construction within the boundaries of
the City.
   (B)   The provisions of this chapter shall be applicable throughout the City
of Lawrence including areas outside of the City of Lawrence where agreements
are executed to provide sanitary sewer service.
§ 5-1-6-2. REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION PERMITS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to cause or allow the construction
or modification of any sanitary sewer or sanitary sewer lift station without
first obtaining a valid construction permit issued by the Director and IDEM;
provided, however, a sanitary sewer construction permit shall not be required
for maintenance work performed by or on behalf of the City.
   (B)   The Department may deny permits to any applicant who is currently in
violation of this
Article 1 or any applicable regulations.
Penalty, see § 5-1-6-19
§ 5-1-6-3. APPLICATION PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Applications shall be submitted in accordance with procedures
established by the Department and revised from time to time. Design plans and
specifications for the construction of sanitary sewers shall be developed by or
under the direction of a professional engineer registered in accordance with
I.C. 25-31-1 and shall have a title sheet which includes the professional
engineer’s seal and signature.
   (B)   An application fee of $50 shall be submitted to cover the
administrative cost of processing the application. The applicant shall also pay
a plan review fee as provided for in §
5-1-6-16.
   (C)   Applications for construction permits shall be submitted at least 60
days in advance of the proposed start of construction; provided, however, that
a shorter time period may be approved by the Director.
   (D)   Applications shall include a certificate of sufficiency of plan filed
by a professional engineer registered in accordance with I.C. 25-31-1.
   (E)   The Director may, as a prerequisite to the issuance of a construction
permit, require developers, wherever applicable, to send written notification
to property owners whose properties abut the route of the proposed sewer.
   (F)   Applications shall include any additional information deemed necessary
by the Director to carry out the provisions of this chapter.
§ 5-1-6-4. CAPACITY AND DEPTH MAINTAINED.
   Sewer lines that are to be extended from existing sewer lines shall have the
same hydraulic capacity and be constructed on the same grade line as the
existing sewers unless the Department determines that a reduction of capacity
is justified. Sewers shall be sized with capacity for the contiguous service
area, which is defined as the undeveloped and/or unsewered land capable of a
gravity connection to the proposed sanitary sewer or lift station, unless it is
shown that the contiguous area may be equally served by an alternate existing
sewer.
Penalty, see § 5-1-6-19
§ 5-1-6-5. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS FOR LIFT STATIONS.
   A construction permit shall not be issued for a sanitary sewer lift station
until an economic analysis identifies to the satisfaction of the Director that
the lift station exhibits a lower 50-year life cycle cost than a gravity sewer,
both of which shall be sized to serve the service area as described in §
5-1-6-4. Where undue hardship is imposed by this requirement, the Director may
waive the economic analysis.
§ 5-1-6-6. RIGHT TO LIMIT SEWER CAPACITY.
   Except to the extent that it may be preempted by state or federal laws,
rules or regulations, the Department may deny the issuance of a construction
permit if it is demonstrated that there is insufficient dry or wet weather
capacity in any or all downstream sewers, lift stations, force mains and
treatment plants, including capacity for pollutants, to accommodate the waste
load expected to be generated as a result of the proposed development.
§ 5-1-6-7. POSTING OF BOND.
   (A)   The Director may, as a prerequisite to the issuance of a construction
permit, require the posting of a performance bond from a company licensed by
the State of Indiana to provide the surety. The bond shall be equal to 100% of
the contract amount or an amount established by the Director to provide surety
for the satisfactory completion of the improvements required by the
construction permit and shall name the City of Lawrence as the party who can
enforce the obligations thereunder. The bond may be a part of the total bonding
required by other agency, department or private entity requiring bonding.
   (B)   The Director may, as a prerequisite to acceptance of a sanitary sewer
or lift station, require the posting of a maintenance bond in an amount not to
exceed 20% of the contract amount or, subject to the approval by the Director,
provision for maintenance, for a period of three years from the date of
acceptance by the Department. The bond shall name the City of Lawrence as the
party which can enforce the obligations thereunder.
   (C)   In instances where the Director has required a bond pursuant to this
section, the Director may, as an alternative to the posting of the bond, accept
other appropriate security, such as a properly conditioned irrevocable letter
of credit, which meets the same objectives as the bonds described in this
section, subject to approval of any other agency, department or private entity
whose interests are protected by the same bonding requirement.
   (D)   If the surety on any bond furnished to the Department becomes a party
to a supervision, liquidation, rehabilitation action pursuant to I.C. 27-9 et
seq., or its right to do business in the state is terminated, it shall be
required that, within 30 days thereafter, a substitute bond and surety be
provided, both of which must be acceptable to the City. Failure to obtain a
substitute bond within the stated timeframe shall be cause for revocation or
suspension of the construction permit until the time that the bond is furnished
to the Department.
§ 5-1-6-8. EXECUTION OF COVENANT.
   (A)   The Director may, as a prerequisite to the issuance of a construction
permit, require the execution of covenants and/or easements in favor of the
City by the owner or owners of the parcel. As a minimum in those cases, the
Director shall require that the following covenant be executed by the owner or
owners of the parcel which shall be included in a recorded plat:
   “It shall be the responsibility of the owner of any lot or parcel of land
within the area of this plat to comply at all times with the provisions of the
sanitary sewer construction plan approved by the Director of the City of
Lawrence Sewer Utility and the requirements of all sanitary sewer construction
permits for this plan issued by the City of Lawrence.
   “Owner further covenants that no building, structure, tree or other
obstruction shall be erected, maintained, or allowed to continue on the portion
of the owner’s real estate in which the easement and right-of-way is granted
without express written permission from the City of Lawrence. Such permission,
when duly recorded, shall run with the real estate. The City of Lawrence and
its agents shall have the right to ingress and egress, for temporary periods
only, over the owners’ real estate adjoining the easement and right-of-way,
when necessary to construct, repair or maintain sanitary sewer facilities.”
   (B)   Any person who violates a covenant required under this section, and/or
the owner of any parcel of land who permits the violation, who is notified in
writing by the Department that a violation exists, shall be given a reasonable
period of time, not to exceed 30 days, in which to correct the violation. The
notice shall specify the nature of the violation and shall stipulate a required
correction date.
§ 5-1-6-9. DEDICATION OF EASEMENT.
   Whenever possible, sanitary sewers shall be constructed in the public right-
of-way. When sewers are proposed to be constructed in easements and when
unsewered or undeveloped property adjoins the applicant’s property, the
applicant may be required to extend the sewer and/or an easement dedicated to
the City or its assignee, to the upstream property line. The easements shall be
accessible to vehicular traffic. Easements along public rights-of-way shall be
contiguous with the rights-of-way.
§ 5-1-6-10. DURATION OF CONSTRUCTION PERMIT AND CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION AND
COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   The sanitary sewer construction permit shall be valid for one year
from the date of issuance, or the date of expiration of the applicant’s permit
issued by IDEM.
   (B)   Within 14 days after satisfactory completion of tests on the sanitary
sewer or lift station for which a construction permit was obtained, the
professional engineer contracted in accordance with §
5-1-6-11 shall execute and file with the Department a certificate of completion
and compliance, in a form prescribed by the Department.
§ 5-1-6-11. INSPECTION OF CONSTRUCTION OF SANITARY SEWERS.
   (A)   Execution of inspection agreement. Prior to the commencement of
construction, the applicant shall execute an agreement with the Department,
which will provide that:
      (1)   The Department will contract for construction inspection services
to ensure that the construction meets the requirements of the approved
construction plans;
      (2)   The installing contractor will be responsible for submitting and
certifying air pressure or infiltration test results for all pipe and
deflection test results for all flexible pipe. All air pressure and
infiltration tests shall be observed by an inspector from the Department;
      (3)   The applicant will reimburse the Department for the cost of the
inspection services, which shall be determined at the time of execution of the
agreement and verified by the applicant or his or her representative throughout
construction, with 50% of the estimated cost to be paid in advance on or before
the date of approval of the permit, and the remaining balance to be paid when
construction is completed;
      (4)   Upon completion of construction, the installing contractor shall
execute and file with the Department a certificate of completion and compliance
certifying to the Department and the applicant as to the compliance of the
construction with the requirements of the approved construction plans and/or
approved change orders; and
      (5)   No action with regard to the acceptance of the construction and
release of the improvement bond pursuant to this chapter shall be taken until
the applicant has reimbursed the Department in full for the inspection
services.
   (B)   Inspection of construction.
      (1)   All construction of sanitary sewers, whether intended for
dedication to the City or not, shall be inspected and certified pursuant to the
agreement executed under division (A) above.
      (2)   The applicant shall furnish the Department necessary copies of the
approved construction plans.
Penalty, see § 5-1-6-19
§ 5-1-6-12. REQUIREMENTS FOR PROJECT ACCEPTANCE AND DEDICATION TO THE CITY.
   Sanitary sewers and lift stations will not be accepted and building sewer

regulations promulgated by the Board of Public Works and Safety. The Director

construction permit submits the request in writing and makes a substantial
showing:
      (1)   That a minimum sanitary sewer design standard or regulation is
unfeasible or unreasonably burdensome; and
      (2)   That an alternate plan submitted by the applicant will achieve the
same objective and purpose as compliance with minimum sewer design standards

amount of the bond, incurred by the City of Lawrence for the cleanup and
removal of any hazardous wastes at the facility or for the cleanup and removal
of any substances which are proved to be the cause of contamination or
pollution of the land, ground water or air in or around the facility.
Determination of substances as hazardous wastes, or the finding that solid
waste is causing the contamination or pollution of the land, ground water or
air in or around the facility shall be made by the Indiana Environmental
Management Board based upon tests conducted pursuant to then applicable federal
and state statutes and standards for solid or hazardous waste disposal
facilities.

§ 5-2-5-1. PURPOSE AND TERRITORIAL APPLICATION.
   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the safety, health and general
welfare of the citizens of Lawrence by requiring compliance with standards,
specifications, regulations and practices established by the Board which will
result in proper sanitary sewer and sanitary sewer lift station design and
construction in the City of Lawrence.
§ 5-2-5-2. REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION PERMITS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful to cause or allow the construction or
modification of any sanitary sewer or sanitary sewer lift station without first
obtaining a valid construction permit issued by the Board and the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management; provided, however, a sanitary sewer
construction permit shall not be required for maintenance work performed by or
on behalf of the Board.
   (B)   The Board may deny permits to any applicant who is currently in
violation of this chapter or any applicable regulations.
Penalty, see § 5-2-5-19
§ 5-2-5-3. APPLICATION PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Applications shall be submitted in accordance with procedures
established by the Board and revised from time to time.
   (B)   An application fee of $50 shall be submitted to cover the
administrative cost of processing the application. The applicant shall also pay
a plan review fee as provided by §
5-2-5-16.
   (C)   Applications for construction permits shall be submitted at least 60
days in advance of the proposed start of construction; provided, however, that
a shorter time period may be approved by the Board.
   (D)   Applications shall include a certificate of sufficiency of plan filed
by a professional engineer or, for internal subdivision sites, a certificate of
sufficiency of plan filed by a land surveyor registered in accordance with I.C.
25-31-1.
   (E)   The Board may, as a prerequisite to the issuance of a construction
permit, require developers, wherever applicable, to send written notification
to property owners whose properties abut the route of the proposed sewer. The
notice shall not be given when Indiana Department of Environmental Management
provides the notice.
   (F)   Applications may include any additional information deemed necessary
by the Board to carry out the provisions of this chapter.
§ 5-2-5-4. CAPACITY AND DEPTH MAINTAINED.
   Sewer lines that are to be extended shall have the same hydraulic capacity
and be constructed on the same grade line as the existing sewers unless the
Board determines that a reduction of capacity is justified. Sewers shall be
sized with capacity for the contiguous service area which is defined as the
undeveloped and/or unsewered land capable of a gravity connection to the
proposed sanitary sewer or lift station, unless it is shown that the contiguous
area may be equally served by an alternate existing sewer.
Penalty, see § 5-2-5-19
§ 5-2-5-5. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS FOR LIFT STATIONS.
   A construction permit shall not be issued for a sanitary sewer lift station
until an economic analysis identifies to the satisfaction of the Board that the
lift station exhibits a lower 50-year life cycle cost than a gravity sewer,
both of which shall be sized to serve the service area as described in this
chapter. Where undue hardship is imposed by this requirement, the Board may
waive the economic analysis.
§ 5-2-5-6. RIGHT TO LIMIT SEWER CAPACITY.
   Except to the extent that it may be preempted by state or federal laws,
rules or regulations, the Board may deny the issuance of a construction permit
if it is demonstrated that there is insufficient dry or wet weather capacity in
any or all downstream sewers, lift stations, force mains and treatment plants,
including capacity for pollutants, to accommodate the waste load expected to be
generated as a result of the proposed development.
§ 5-2-5-7. POSTING OF BOND.
   (A)   The Board may, as a prerequisite to the issuance of a construction
permit, require the posting of a performance bond from a company licensed by
the State of Indiana to provide the surety. The bond shall be equal to 100% of
the contract amount or an amount established by the Board to provide surety for
the satisfactory completion of the improvements required by the construction
permit and shall name the City of Lawrence as a party who can enforce the
obligations hereunder. The bond may be a part of the total bonding required by
the Plat Committee of Marion County Metropolitan Development Commission.
   (B)   The Board may, as a prerequisite to acceptance of a sanitary sewer or
lift station, require the posting of a maintenance bond in an amount not to
exceed 20% of the contract amount or, subject to the approval by the Board,
covenants of the applicant making provision for maintenance of the sanitary
sewer by the applicant for a period of three years from the date of acceptance
by the Board. The bond shall name the City of Lawrence as a party who can
enforce the obligations hereunder.
   (C)   In instances where the Board has required a bond pursuant to this
section, the Board may as an alternative to the posting of the bond accept
other appropriate security, such as a properly conditioned irrevocable letter
of credit, which meets the same objectives as the bonds described in this
section.
   (D)   If the surety on any bond furnished to the Board becomes a party to a
supervision, liquidation or rehabilitation action pursuant to I.C. 27-9 et seq.
or its right to do business in the state is terminated, it shall be required
that, within 30 days thereafter, substitute bond and surety be provided, both
of which must be acceptable to the City. Failure to obtain a substitute bond
within the stated timeframe shall be cause for revocation or suspension of the
construction permit until the time that the bond is furnished to the Board.
§ 5-2-5-8. EXECUTION OF COVENANT.
   (A)   The Board may, as a prerequisite to the issuance of a construction
permit, require the execution of covenants and/or easements running in form to
the City of Lawrence by the owner or owners of the parcel. As a minimum in
those cases, the Board shall require that the following covenant be executed by
the owner or owners of the parcel which shall be included in a recorded plat:
   “It shall be the responsibility of the owner of any lot or parcel of land
within the area of this plat to comply at all times with the provisions of the
sanitary sewer construction approved by the Board and the requirements of all
sanitary sewer construction permits for this plan issued by the Board.
   “Owner further covenants that no building, structure, tree or other
obstruction shall be erected, maintained or allowed to continue on the portion
of the owner’s real estate in which the easement and right-of-way is granted
without express written permission from the Board. The permission, when duly
recorded, shall run with the real estate. The Board and its agents shall have
the right to ingress and egress, for temporary periods only, over the owner’s
real estate adjoining the easement and right-of-way, when necessary to
construct, repair or maintain sanitary sewer facilities.”
   (B)   Any person who violates a covenant required under this section, and/or
the owner of any parcel of land who permits a violation, who is notified in
writing by the Board that a violation exists, shall be given a reasonable
period of time, not to exceed 30 days, in which to correct the violation. The
notice shall specify the nature of the violation and shall stipulate a required
correction date.
§ 5-2-5-9. DEDICATION OF EASEMENT.
   Whenever possible, sanitary sewers shall be constructed in the public right-
of-way. When sewers are proposed to be constructed in easements and when
unsewered or undeveloped property adjoins the applicant’s property, the
applicant may be required to extend the sewer and/or an easement dedicated to
the City or its assignee, to the upstream property line. The easements shall be
accessible to vehicular traffic. Easements along public rights-of-way shall be
contiguous with the rights-of-way.
Penalty, see § 5-2-5-19
§ 5-2-5-10. DURATION OF CONSTRUCTION PERMIT AND CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION AND
COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   The sanitary sewer construction permit shall be valid for the later of
one year from the date of issuance or the date of expiration of the applicant’s
SPC-15 permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management.
   (B)   Within 14 days after satisfactory completion of tests on the sanitary
sewer or lift station for which a construction permit was obtained, the
professional engineer or land surveyor contracted in accordance with §
5-2-5-11 shall execute and file with the Board a certificate of completion and
compliance, in a form prescribed by the Board.
§ 5-2-5-11. OBSERVATION OF CONSTRUCTION OF SANITARY SEWERS.
   (A)   Execution of construction observation agreement. Prior to the
commencement of construction, the applicant shall execute an agreement with the
Board, which will provide that:
      (1)   The Board shall employ an observer of its choosing to observe the
construction work to ensure that the construction meets the requirements of the
approved construction plans;
      (2)   The observer will be responsible for submitting and certifying air
pressure or infiltration test results for all pipe and deflection test results
for all flexible pipe;
      (3)   The applicant will reimburse the City of Lawrence for the cost of
the observation services which shall be determined at the time of execution of
the agreement, with 50% of the estimated cost to be paid in advance on or
before the date of approval of the permit, and the remaining balance to be paid
when construction is completed;
      (4)   Upon completion of construction, the observer shall execute and
file with the Board a certificate of completion and compliance certifying to
the Board and the applicant as to the compliance of the construction with the
requirements of the approved construction plans and/or approved change orders;
and
      (5)   No action with regard to the acceptance of the construction and
release of the improvement bond pursuant to this chapter shall be taken until
the applicant has reimbursed the Board in full for the observation services.
   (B)   Observation of construction.

City shall be inspected and certified pursuant to the agreement executed under
division (A) above.
      (2)   The applicant shall furnish the Board necessary copies of the
approved construction plans.
      (3)   If construction has already commenced on the effective date of this
chapter, the applicant must then furnish, along with a written request for
acceptance, a certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor
registered in the State of Indiana that the construction has met the
requirements of the approved construction plans; further, the construction will
be observed by the City Civil Engineer and all deficiencies shall be corrected
prior to acceptance by the Board.
Penalty, see § 5-2-5-19
§ 5-2-5-12. REQUIREMENTS FOR PROJECT ACCEPTANCE AND DEDICATION TO THE CITY.
   Sanitary sewers and lift stations will not be accepted and building sewer
connection permits shall not be issued until all documents, as required by the
Board’s standard specifications, are submitted to the Board including the
following:
   (A)   Maintenance bond as required in §

   (F)   Construction record drawings of the project as constructed.
§ 5-2-5-13. DEDICATION AND REHABILITATION OF EXISTING SEWERS.
   (A)   The owner of a sanitary sewer may apply to the Board for dedication of
the sewer, provided that the application is made in writing.
   (B)   Dedication of the sewer may be subject to the requirements outlined in
§§
5-2-5-8 and
5-2-5-9 of this chapter; and, further, at the discretion of the Board, may
require the following:
      (1)   Proof of legal ownership;
      (2)   Flow monitoring results;
      (3)   Television results; and
      (4)   Any other requirements as may be deemed reasonable and necessary by
the City Civil Engineer.
   (C)   In addition, the owner may, at his or her expense, be required to

determining whether the construction has been accomplished in a manner
consistent with the approved plans and specifications and the minimum
requirements of the Board.
   (D)   Persons working on or having control of the construction shall
cooperate fully with the inspectors and shall have available a copy of the
approved plans and specifications used to obtain the construction permit.
§ 5-2-5-15. VARIANCE PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The Board shall have the power to modify or waive any minimum sanitary
sewer design standard or any regulations promulgated and adopted by the Board.
The Board may grant a modification or waiver if an applicant for a construction
permit submits the request in writing and makes a substantial showing that:
      (1)   A minimum sanitary sewer design standard or regulation is
unfeasible or unreasonably burdensome; and
      (2)   An alternate plan submitted by the applicant will achieve the same
objective and purpose as compliance with minimum sewer design standards and
regulations of the Board.
   (B)   If the Board shall fail to respond to the request for variance within
30 days from the written request, it shall be deemed to be denied.
   (C)   An applicant may appeal to the Board any decision denying or partially
approving a requested variance. The appeal of a decision shall be filed with
the Board within 30 days of the decision. The Board shall hear the request for
the variance de novo and in making a decision shall apply the standards set
forth above.
§ 5-2-5-16. PLAN REVIEW FEE.
   Application fees are intended to compensate only for the administrative cost
of the processing of the application. The applicant shall reimburse the City of
Lawrence for all time of the City Civil Engineer or his or her designee
utilized in all phases of the review of the construction plans. The
reimbursement shall be at the rate of $80 per hour. The City Civil Engineer
shall provide a detailed itemization of the time utilized in the plan review.
The plan review fee shall be paid prior to issuance of the construction permit.
In the event no construction permit is issued, the plan review fee shall be due
upon demand. The City of Lawrence may recover costs of collection and
reasonable attorney’s fees if referred to an attorney for collection. Issuance
of a construction permit relative to plans which do not comply with the Board’s
minimum requirements shall not relieve the applicant of the responsibility of
complying with all Board standards and specifications.
§ 5-2-5-17. EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL UNITS.
   This chapter shall not apply to sanitary sewer construction accomplished by
an employee or contractor on behalf of the City.
§ 5-2-5-18. STOP-WORK ORDER.
   The Board is empowered to issue an order requiring suspension of work
(“stop-work order”) whenever it determines that:
   (A)   Construction is proceeding in an unsafe manner;
   (B)   Construction is occurring in violation of the Board’s standard
specifications and requirements and in a manner so that if construction is
allowed to proceed, there is a probability that it will be substantially
difficult to correct the violation; or
   (C)   Sewer construction for which a construction permit is required is
proceeding without a construction permit being in force. In that instance, the
stop-work order shall indicate that the effect of the order terminates when the
required permit is obtained. The stop-work order shall be in writing and shall
state to what construction it is applicable and the reason for its issuance.
One copy of the stop-work order shall state the conditions under which
construction may be resumed.
§ 5-2-5-19. PENALTIES.
   Any person found guilty of violating any provision of this chapter may, at
the discretion of the Board:
   (A)   Be fined an amount not to exceed $1,000 for each day work was
conducted in violation of this chapter; and/or
   (B)   Be denied construction permits for a period of time not to exceed one
year.
§ 5-2-5-20. APPEALS.
   (A)   Any person affected by authority delegated by this chapter to any
official of the Board and who objects to the decision made or the action taken
by the official, shall be entitled to a hearing before the Board upon that
objection. The person desiring a hearing shall file a written statement of his
or her objections with the Board. The hearing shall be scheduled before the
Board within 30 days after the objection is filed. Notice shall be given to the
objector identifying the time, place and date of the hearing at least ten days
prior to the scheduled date.
   (B)   After hearing testimony of the objector and the official who made the
decision or took the action objected to, the Board may confirm, reverse or
modify the decision or action. The order of the Board shall be final. Within
ten days of the Board’s decision, a written notice shall be given to the
objector confirming the decision.
§ 5-2-5-21. DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY.
   The Board authorizes the Building Commissioner of the City of Lawrence to
administer and carry out the duties of §
5-2-5-3. The Board delegates to the City Civil Engineer of the City of Lawrence
the authority to administer all further sections of this chapter.

§ 5-2-6-1. GENERAL INFORMATION.
   (A)   Authority and title.
      (1)   This chapter is adopted in accordance with statutory authority
granted to City of Lawrence under “Home Rule” and further is required by Phase
II of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Stormwater program
(40 CFR Parts 9, 122, 123, and 124; December 8, 1999) authorized by the 1987
amendments to the Clean Water Act, the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management’s (IDEM) Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) draft General
Permit (MS4 GP), and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management’s draft
Construction Stormwater General Permit (CSGP). Based on this authority and
these requirements, this chapter regulates:
         (a)   Discharges of prohibited non-stormwater flows into the storm
drain system.
         (b)   Stormwater drainage improvements related to development of lands
located within the corporate boundaries of the City of Lawrence.
         (c)   Drainage control systems installed during new construction and
grading of lots and other parcels of land.
         (d)   Stormwater, including stormwater runoff, snowmelt runoff, and
surface runoff and drainage, associated with construction activity.
         (e)   Stormwater discharges from construction support activities
directly related to construction sites subject to this chapter.
         (f)   Erosion and sediment control systems installed during new
construction and grading of lots and other parcels of land.
         (g)   The design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater drainage
facilities and systems.
         (h)   The design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater quality
facilities and systems.
      (2)   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the City of
Lawrence Stormwater Management Ordinance. Once adopted, this chapter will
supersede any conflicting ordinances previously adopted by the City of
Lawrence.
   (B)   Design standard. This chapter adopts the City of Indianapolis
Stormwater Design and Construction Specifications Manual, latest edition, as
the design standard for the City of Lawrence.
   (C)   Applicability and exemptions.
      (1)   This chapter shall regulate all development and redevelopment
occurring within the City of Lawrence. No building permit shall be issued, and
no land disturbance started for any construction in a development, as defined
in Appendix A of Ord. 18, 2024, incorporated herein by reference, until the
plans required by this chapter for such construction have been released in
writing by the City of Lawrence. With the exception of the requirements of §§
5-2-6-2 and 5-2-6-6(D), single-family dwelling houses and duplexes in accepted
subdivisions, and land-disturbing activities affecting less than 200 square
feet of area shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter. Also exempt
from this chapter shall be agricultural land-disturbing activities.
      (2)   In addition to the requirements of this chapter and the City of
Indianapolis Stormwater Design and Construction Specifications Manual
compliance with all applicable ordinances of the City of Lawrence as well as
with applicable federal, State of Indiana, and other local statues and
regulations shall also be required. Unless otherwise stated, all other
specifications referred to in this chapter shall be the most recent edition
available. City of Lawrence capital improvement projects shall be exempt from
obtaining a permit but are expected to meet all applicable technical
requirements of this chapter and the City of Indianapolis Stormwater Design and
Construction Specifications Manual. If the project site is located within a
Marion County regulated dams, floodplain, or waterway, the applicant will need
to check with the Marion County Stormwater Department to learn if additional
requirements specific to that regulated drain would apply to the site. In case
there are conflicts between the requirements contained in this chapter and
applicable requirements contained in other regulatory documents referenced
above, the most restrictive shall prevail.
      (3)   Any construction project which has had its final drainage plan
accepted by the City of Lawrence within 180 days prior to the effective date of
this chapter shall be exempt from all requirements of this chapter that are in
excess of the requirements of ordinances in effect at the time of acceptance.
Such an exemption is not applicable to the requirements detailed in § 5-2-6-2.
      (4)   The City of Lawrence has the authority to modify, grant exemptions,
and/or waive any and all the requirements of this chapter and its associated
technical standards document. A pre-submittal meeting with the City of Lawrence
may be requested by the applicant to discuss the applicability of various
provisions of this chapter and its associated technical standards document with
regards to unique or unusual circumstances relating to a project. However, any
initial determination of such applicability shall not be binding on future
determinations of the City of Lawrence that may be based on the review of more
detailed information and plans.
   (C)   Findings. The City of Lawrence finds that:
      (1)   Water bodies, roadways, structures, and other property within the
City of Lawrence or its planning jurisdiction boundary are at times subjected
to flooding;
      (2)   Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is
also a danger to the natural resources of the region;
      (3)   Land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds,
resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, increased flooding,
increased stream channel erosion, and increased sediment transport and
deposition;
      (4)   Soil erosion resulting from land-disturbing activities causes a
significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to be transported off-site
and deposited in ditches, streams, wetlands, lakes, and reservoirs;
      (5)   Increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments
and pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development
projects within the City of Lawrence will, absent reasonable regulation and
control, adversely affect the City of Lawrence’s water bodies and water
resources;
      (6)   Pollutant contributions from illicit discharges within the City of
Lawrence will, absent reasonable regulation, monitoring, and enforcement,
adversely affect the City of Lawrence’s water bodies and water resources;
      (7)   Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, non-point source pollution, and
illicit sources of pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation
of stormwater management;
      (8)   Adopting the standards, criteria, and procedures contained and
referenced in this chapter and implementing the same will address many of the
deleterious effects of stormwater runoff and illicit discharges;
      (9)   Adopting this chapter is necessary for the preservation of the
public health, safety, and welfare, for the conservation of natural resources,
and for compliance with state and federal regulations.
   (D)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health,
safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Lawrence through the
regulation of stormwater and non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage
system and to protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land and
water resources within the City of Lawrence. This chapter establishes methods
for managing the quantity and quality of stormwater entering into the storm
drain system. The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To reduce the hazard to public health and safety caused by
excessive stormwater runoff.
      (2)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain
system from construction site
runoff.
      (3)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain
system from runoff from new development and re-development.
      (4)   To prohibit illicit discharges into the storm drain system.
      (5)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection,
monitoring, and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this
chapter.
   (F)   Responsibility for administration. The City of Lawrence shall
administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Any powers
granted or duties imposed upon the authorized enforcement agency may be
delegated in writing by the City of Lawrence to qualified persons or entities
acting in the beneficial interest of or in the employ of the City of Lawrence.
   (G)   Interpretation. Words and phrases in this chapter shall be construed
according to their common and accepted meanings, except that words and phrases
defined in Appendix A of Ord. 18, 2024, incorporated herein by reference, shall
be construed according to the respective definitions given in that section.
Technical words and technical phrases that are not defined in this chapter, but
which have acquired particular meanings in law or in technical usage shall be
construed according to such meanings.
   (H)   Severability. The provisions of this chapter are hereby declared
severable, and if any court of competent jurisdiction should declare any part
or provision of this chapter invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or
unenforceability shall not affect any other part or provision of this chapter.
   (I)   Disclaimer of liability.
      (1)   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on historical records,
engineering, and scientific methods of study. Larger storms may occur or
stormwater runoff amounts may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that land uses permitted will be free from stormwater
damage. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of
Lawrence or any officer, representative, or employee thereof, for any damage
that may result from reliance on this chapter or on any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
      (2)   The words RELEASE, APPROVE and ACCEPT, and their common derivations
as used in this chapter in relation to plans, reports, calculations, and
permits shall mean that the City of Lawrence has reviewed the material produced
and submitted by the applicant or his or her agents for general compliance with
this chapter and the City of Indianapolis Stormwater Design and Construction
Specifications Manual, and that such compliance would qualify the applicant to
receive a stormwater management release or permit. Such a “release” or
“acceptance” is based on the assumption that the project engineer has followed
all appropriate engineering methods in the design. Any stormwater quantity
(drainage) or water quality problems associated with the project caused by poor
construction by the contractor and/or poor engineering design or judgment,
either on-site or off-site, are the responsibility of the developer and the
project engineer.
      (3)   Consideration, design, construction, and maintenance of safety
measures for proposed or existing stormwater facilities shall be the
responsibility of the developer, applicant and/or the property owner. The City
of Lawrence and its officials and representatives shall not be responsible for
maintenance nor liability for any accidents.
(Ord. 18, 2024, passed 12-18-2024)
§ 5-2-6-2. PROHIBITED DISCHARGES AND CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   Applicability and exemptions.
      (1)   This section shall apply to all discharges, including illegal
dumping, entering the storm drain system under the control of the City of
Lawrence, regardless of whether the discharge originates from developed or
undeveloped lands, and regardless of whether the discharge is generated from an
active construction site or a stabilized site. These discharges include flows
from direct connections to the storm drain system, illegal dumping, and
contaminated runoff.
      (2)   Stormwater runoff from agricultural, timber harvesting and mining
activities is exempted from the requirements of this section unless determined
to contain pollutants not associated with such activities or in excess of
standard practices. Farm residences are not included in this exemption.
      (3)   Any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit,
waiver (unless the waiver is solely based on point source considerations, still
allowing non-point source discharge of a pollutant) or waste discharge order
issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal
Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full
compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver or order and other
applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been
granted for the subject discharge to the storm drain system, is also exempted
from this section.
      (1)   No person shall discharge to a MS4 conveyance, watercourse, or
waterbody, directly or indirectly, any substance other than stormwater or an
exempted discharge. Any person discharging stormwater shall effectively
minimize pollutants from also being discharged with the stormwater, through the
use of best management practices (BMPs).
      (2)   Concrete washout material must be properly contained within an
appropriate practice and any waste material properly disposed of.
      (3)   The City of Lawrence is authorized to require dischargers to
implement pollution prevention measures, utilizing BMPs necessary to prevent or
reduce the discharge of pollutants into the City of Lawrence’s stormwater
drainage system.
   (C)   Exempted discharges and connections. Notwithstanding other
requirements in this chapter, the following categories of non-stormwater
discharges or flows are exempted from the requirements of this section:
      (1)   Water line flushing;
      (2)   Landscape irrigation;
      (3)   Diverted streamflows;
      (4)   Rising ground waters;
      (5)   Uncontaminated groundwater infiltration;
      (6)   Uncontaminated pumped ground water;
      (7)   Discharges from potable water sources;
      (8)   Foundation drains;
      (9)   Air conditioning condensation;
      (10)   Irrigation water;
      (11)   Springs;
      (12)   Water from crawl space pumps;
      (13)   Footing drains;
      (14)   Lawn watering;
      (15)   Individual residential car washing;
      (16)   Flows from riparian habitats and wetlands;
      (17)   Dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;
      (18)   Street wash water;
      (19)   Discharges from firefighting activities;
      (20)   Naturally introduced detritus (e.g., leaves and twigs).
   (D)   Storage of hazardous or toxic material. Storage or stockpiling of
hazardous or toxic material within any watercourse, or in its associated
floodway or floodplain, is strictly prohibited. Storage or stockpiling of
hazardous or toxic material, including sewage treatment plant stockpiles, on
active construction sites must include adequate protection and/or containment
so as to prevent any such materials from entering any temporary or permanent
stormwater conveyance or watercourse.
   (E)   Private property maintenance duties. Every person owning property
through which a watercourse passes, or such person’s lessee, shall keep and
maintain that part of the watercourse located within their property boundaries,
free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation and other obstacles that would
pollute, contaminate or significantly retard the flow of water through the
watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately
owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures
will not become a hazard to the use, function or physical integrity of the
watercourse.
   (F)   Spill reporting.
      (1)   Any discharger who accidentally discharges into a waterbody any
substance other than stormwater or an exempted discharge shall immediately
inform the City of Lawrence concerning the discharge. A written report
concerning the discharge shall be filed with the City of Lawrence and IDEM, by
the dischargers, within five days. The written report shall specify:
         (a)   The composition of the discharge and the cause thereof;
         (b)   The date, time, and estimated volume of the discharge;
         (c)   All measures taken to clean up the accidental discharge, and all
measures proposed to be taken to prevent any recurrence;
         (d)   The name and telephone number of the person making the report,
and the name and telephone number of a person who may be contacted for
additional information on the matter.
      (2)   A properly reported accidental discharge shall be an affirmative
defense to a civil infraction proceeding brought under this chapter against a
discharger for such discharge. It shall not, however, be a defense to a legal
action brought to obtain an injunction, to obtain recovery of costs or to
obtain other relief because of or arising out of the discharge. A discharge
shall be considered properly reported only if the discharger complies with all
the requirements of this section. This requirement does not relieve discharger
from notifying other entities as required by state or federal regulations.
   (G)   Inspections and monitoring.
      (1)   Storm drainage system. The City of Lawrence has the authority to
periodically inspect the portion of the storm drainage system under the City of
Lawrence’s control, in an effort to detect and eliminate illicit connections
and discharges into the system. This inspection will include a screening of
discharges from outfalls connected to the system in order to determine if
prohibited flows are being conveyed into the storm drainage system. It could
also include spot testing of waters contained in the storm drainage system
itself to detect the introduction of pollutants into the system by means other
than a defined outfall, such as dumping or contaminated sheet runoff.
      (2)   Potential polluters. If, as a result of the storm drainage system
inspection, a discharger is suspected of an illicit discharge, the City of
Lawrence may inspect and/or obtain stormwater samples from stormwater runoff
facilities of the subject discharger, to determine compliance with the
requirements of this chapter. Upon request, the discharger shall allow the City
of Lawrence’s properly identified representative to enter upon the premises of
the discharger at all hours necessary for the purposes of such inspection or
sampling. The City of Lawrence or its properly identified representative may
place on the discharger’s property the equipment or devices used for such
sampling or inspection. Identified illicit connections or discharges shall be
subject to enforcement action as described in § 5-2-6-7.
      (3)   New development and re-development. Following the final completion
of construction and the receipt of as-built drawings by the City of Lawrence,
the City of Lawrence has the authority to inspect new development and
redevelopment sites to verify that all on-site stormwater conveyances and
connections to the storm drainage system are in compliance with this section.
(Ord. 18, 2024, passed 12-18-2024)
§ 5-2-6-3. STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Applicability and exemptions. The storage and controlled release of
excess stormwater runoff shall be required for all new business, institutional
developments, commercial and industrial developments, residential subdivisions,
planned development, rural estate subdivisions and any redevelopment or other
new construction located within the City of Lawrence. The City of Lawrence,
after thorough investigation and evaluation, may waive the requirement of
controlled runoff for minor subdivisions and parcelization. Additional
potential exemptions regarding the detention requirements are provided under
division (B) below.
   (B)   Policy on stormwater quantity management.
      (1)   It is recognized that most streams and drainage channels serving
the City of Lawrence do not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey
stormwater runoff resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, the
storage and controlled release of excess stormwater runoff as well as
compensation for loss of floodplain storage shall be required for all
developments and redevelopments (as defined in Appendix A of Ord. 18, 2024,
incorporated herein by reference) located within the City of Lawrence.
      (2)   Due to unknowns regarding the future development patterns and the
associated proposed stormwater quantity management systems within a watershed,
it is the policy of the City of Lawrence to discourage direct release of runoff
from a new development or redevelopment without providing detention. However,
in rare circumstances, where a comprehensive watershed-wide hydrologic study or
watershed plan of a major stream (not a “beat the peak” analysis) adopted by
the City of Lawrence substantiates the benefits of (or allows for) direct
release for a proposed development located adjacent to a major stream, the
detention requirements set in this chapter may be waived. Other special
circumstances when such a waiver may be considered by City of Lawrence include
situations where the design of a regional pond has already taken into account
the provision of direct release in certain areas in the watershed.
   (C)   Calculations and design standards and specifications. The calculation
methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of all stormwater facilities
shall meet the design criteria, standards and specifications outlined in the
City of Indianapolis Stormwater Design and Construction Specifications Manual
current edition.
   (D)   Drainage easement requirements.
      (1)   All stormwater systems, including detention or retention basins,
conveyance systems, structures and appurtenances, located outside of the right-
of-way shall be placed within a drainage easement. There shall be no trees or
shrubs planted, nor any structures or fences erected in any drainage easement,
unless otherwise accepted by the City of Lawrence. All drainage improvements
performed relative to the conveyance of stormwater runoff and the perpetual
maintenance thereof, within the latter easements, shall be the responsibility
of the owner or homeowner association.
      (2)   Any outlet to, crossing, and/or encroachment of a county regulated
drainage easement requires application and acceptance from the City of
Indianapolis/Marion County DPW in accordance with the Indiana Drainage Code.
   (E)   Placement of utilities. No utility company may disturb existing storm
drainage facilities without the consent of the City of Lawrence staff, whose
decision may be appealed to the City of Lawrence’s Stormwater Advisory Board.
All existing drainage facilities shall have senior rights and damage to the
facilities shall result in penalties as prescribed in § 5-2-6-7.
   (F)   Structures near county regulated drains. For regulated drains not
located in platted subdivisions, unless otherwise accepted by the City of
Indianapolis/Marion County DPW, no permanent structure (including fences) shall
be erected within 75 feet measured at right angles from 1) the existing top
edge of each bank of a regulated open drain, as determined by the City of
Indianapolis/Marion County DPW; or 2) the center line of a piped regulated
drain. The Indiana Drainage Code may be consulted for further details.
   (G)   Inspection, maintenance, record keeping, and reporting.
      (1)   After the release of the stormwater permit by the City of Lawrence
and the commencement of construction activities, the City of Lawrence has the
authority to conduct inspections of the work being done to ensure full
compliance with the provisions of this section, the City of Indianapolis
Stormwater Design and Construction Specifications Manual, and the terms and
conditions of the released permit.
      (2)   The City of Lawrence also has the authority to perform long-term,
post-construction inspection of all public or privately owned stormwater
quantity facilities. The inspection will cover physical conditions, available
storage capacity and the operational condition of key facility elements.
Stormwater quantity facilities shall be maintained in good condition, in
accordance with the designed and released performance specifications for the
facilities, in addition to any prescribed operation and maintenance procedures,
and shall not be subsequently altered, revised or replaced except as released
by the City of Lawrence. If deficiencies are found during the inspection, the
owner of the facility will be notified by the City of Lawrence and will be
required to take all necessary measures to correct such deficiencies. If the
owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the allowed time period, as
specified in the notification letter, the City of Lawrence will undertake the
work and collect from the owner using lien rights if necessary.
      (3)   Assignment of responsibility for maintaining facilities serving
more than one lot or holding shall be documented by appropriate covenants to
property deeds, unless responsibility is formally accepted by a public body,
and determined before the final stormwater permit is released.
(Ord. 18, 2024, passed 12-18-2024)
§ 5-2-6-4. STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION FOR CONSTRUCTION SITES.
   (A)   Applicability and exemptions.
      (1)   The City of Lawrence will require a stormwater pollution prevention
plan (SWPPP), which includes erosion and sediment control measures and
materials handling procedures, to be submitted as part of a project’s
construction plans and specifications. Any project located within the corporate
boundaries of the City of Lawrence that includes clearing, grading, excavation
or other land disturbing activities resulting in the disturbance of 200 square
feet or more of total land area is subject to the requirements of this section.
This includes both new development and redevelopment. This section also
applies to disturbances of land that are part of a larger common plan of
development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb 200
square feet or more of total land area. Division (C) below provides guidelines
for calculating land disturbance. Projects meeting the coverage requirements of
IDEM’s draft CSGP shall also be in compliance with the requirements contained
in that permit.
      (2)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion and sediment control
measures:
         (a)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10.
         (b)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34.
         (c)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste
pursuant to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management under 329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements,
including the expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells
either within or outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
      (3)   For an individual lot where land disturbance is expected to be one
acre or more, the individual lot owner must complete their own notice of intent
letter, apply for a stormwater permit from the City of Lawrence, and ensure
that a sufficient construction and stormwater pollution prevention plan is
completed and submitted in accordance with §
5-2-6-6, regardless of whether the individual lot is part of a larger permitted
project site. For an individual lot where land disturbance is 200 square feet
or more but less than one acre, a stormwater permit application is required
prior to receiving a building permit. Details of the permitting process are
contained in §
5-2-6-6.
      (4)   An individual lot with land disturbance less than 200 square feet,
located within a larger permitted project site, is considered part of the
larger permitted project site, and the individual lot operator must comply with
the terms and conditions of the stormwater permit released for the larger
project site. The stormwater permit application for the larger project site
must include detailed erosion and sediment control measures for individual
lots. In addition, these individual lots are required to submit stormwater
permit applications prior to receiving a building permit. Details of the
permitting process are contained in §
5-2-6-6 and additional requirements for individual lots may be found in the
City of Indianapolis Stormwater Design and Construction Specifications Manual.
      (5)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete
a stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan
is completed and submitted to the City of Lawrence in accordance with §
5-2-6-6. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure
compliance with this chapter during the construction activity and
implementation of the construction plan, and to notify the City of Lawrence
upon completion of the project and stabilization of the site, requesting a
termination inspection to be performed by the City of Lawrence. However, all
persons engaging in construction and land disturbing activities on a permitted
project site meeting the applicability requirements must comply with the
requirements of this section and this chapter.
   (B)   Policy on stormwater pollution prevention.
      (1)   Effective stormwater pollution prevention on construction sites is
dependent on a combination of preventing movement of soil from its original
position (erosion control), intercepting displaced soil prior to entering a
waterbody (sediment control) and proper on-site materials handling.
      (2)   For land disturbance of one acre or more, the developer must submit
to the City of Lawrence, a SWPPP with detailed erosion and sediment control
plans as well as a narrative describing materials handling and storage, and
construction sequencing. The SWPPP and the project management log must be
retained for at least three years from the date the project permit is
terminated. For land disturbances totaling 200 square feet or more but less
than one acre, appropriate erosion and sediment control measures that are
consistent with the City of Indianapolis Stormwater Design and Construction
Specifications Manual must be designed and shown on the plans.
   (C)   Calculations and design standards and specifications.
      (1)   In calculating the total area of land disturbance, for the purposes
of determining applicability of this section to a project, the following
guidelines should be used:
         (a)   Off-site construction activities that provide services (for
example, road extensions, sewer, water, offsite stockpiles, and other
utilities) to a land disturbing project site, must be considered as a part of
the total land disturbance calculation for the project site, when the activity
is under the control of the project site owner.
         (b)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by this
section, the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the total
area of land disturbance for improvements, such as, roads, utilities, or common
areas and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as determined
by the following:
            1.   For a single-family residential project site where the lots
are one-half acre or more, a minimum of one-half acre of land disturbance must
be used as the expected lot disturbance.
            2.   For a single-family residential project site where the lots
are less than one-half acre in size, the total lot must be calculated as being
disturbed.
            3.   To calculate lot disturbance on all other types of project
sites, such as industrial and commercial projects project sites, a minimum of
one acre of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance,
unless the lots are less than one acre in size, in which case the total lot
must be calculated as being disturbed.
      (2)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement
of all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction sites shall
meet the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the Indiana
Stormwater Quality Manual, the City of Indianapolis Stormwater Design and
Construction Specifications Manual and the product guidance/specifications of
the manufacturer. The methods and procedures included in these two references
are in keeping with the above stated policy and meet the requirements of the
draft IDEM’s CSGP. A copy of the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual may be
obtained online through IDEM.
      (3)   The design requirements that would apply to all land-disturbing
activities and shall be considered in the selection, design, and implementation
of all stormwater quality and management measures contained in the SWPPP are
contained in the City of Indianapolis Stormwater Design and Construction
Specifications Manual.
   (D)   Inspection, maintenance, record keeping, and reporting.
      (1)   Following release of the stormwater permit by the City of Lawrence
and commencement of construction activities, the City of Lawrence has the
authority to conduct inspections of the site to ensure full compliance with the
provisions of this section, the released stormwater pollution prevention plan,
the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual, and the terms and conditions of the
released permit.
      (2)   A self-monitoring program (SMP) must be-implemented by the project
site owner to ensure the stormwater pollution prevention plan is working
effectively. A trained individual, acceptable to the City of Lawrence, shall
monitor and manage project construction and stormwater activities.
      (3)   The stormwater pollution prevention plan shall serve as a guideline
for stormwater quality but should not be interpreted to be the only basis for
implementation of stormwater quality measures for a project site. The project
site owner is responsible for implementing, in accordance with this section,
all measures necessary to adequately prevent polluted stormwater runoff.
Recommendations by the trained individual for modified stormwater quality
measures should be implemented.
(Ord. 18, 2024, passed 12-18-2024)
§ 5-2-6-5. STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   Applicability and exemptions.
      (1)   In addition to the requirements of § 5-2-6-4, the stormwater
pollution prevention plan, which is to be submitted to the City of Lawrence as
part of the stormwater permit application, must also include post-construction
stormwater quality measures. These measures are incorporated as a permanent
feature into the site plan and are left in place following completion of
construction activities to continuously treat stormwater runoff from the
stabilized site. Any project located within the corporate boundaries of the
City of Lawrence that includes clearing, grading, excavation and other land
disturbing activities, resulting in the disturbance of 200 square feet or more
of total land area is subject to the requirements of this section. This
includes both new development and re-development, and disturbances of land less
than 200 square feet of total land area that are part of a larger common plan
of development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb 200
square feet or more of total land area. In addition, regardless of the amount
of disturbance, the City of Lawrence reserves the right to require pre-
treatment BMPs for proposed hot spot developments in accordance with provisions
contained in the City of Indianapolis Stormwater Design and Construction
Specifications Manual.
      (2)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the following
activities:
         (a)   Construction activities associated with a single-family
residential dwelling disturbing less than one acre, when the dwelling is not
part of a larger common plan of development or sale; or individual building
lots within a larger permitted project.
      (3)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures:
         (a)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10.
         (b)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34.
         (c)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste
pursuant to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management under 329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements,
including the expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells
either within or outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
      (4)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete
a stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan
is completed and submitted to the City of Lawrence in accordance with § 5-2-6-
6. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure proper
construction and installation of all stormwater BMPs (especially, the
protection of post-stormwater BMPs during construction phase) in compliance
with this chapter and with the released stormwater permit, and to notify the
City of Lawrence upon completion of the project and stabilization of the site,
requesting a termination inspection to be performed by the City of Lawrence.
However, all eventual property owners of stormwater quality facilities meeting
the applicability requirements must comply with the requirements of this
section and this chapter.
   (B)   Policy on stormwater quality management.
      (1)   It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to undeveloped
areas, generally have increased imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates,
increased runoff rates and increased concentrations of pollutants such as
fertilizers, herbicides, greases, oil, salts and other pollutants. As new
development and re-development continues within the corporate boundaries of the
City of Lawrence, measures must be taken to intercept and filter pollutants
from stormwater runoff prior to reaching regional creeks, streams and rivers.
Through the use of appropriate best management practices (BMPs), stormwater
runoff will be filtered and harmful amounts of sediment, nutrients, and
contaminants will be removed.
      (2)   The project site owner must submit to the City of Lawrence a
stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) that shows placement of
appropriate BMP(s) from a pre-approved list of BMPs specified in the City of
Indianapolis Stormwater Design and Construction Specifications Manual. The
SWPPP submittal shall include an operation and maintenance manual for all post-
construction BMP(s) included in the project and a notarized maintenance
agreement, providing for the long-term maintenance of those BMPs, both of which
shall be recorded with the deed for the property on which the project is
located. A sample maintenance agreement is available from the City of
Lawrence’s Department of Public Works. The noted BMP(s) must be designed,
constructed, and maintained according to guidelines provided or referenced in
the City of Indianapolis Stormwater Design and Construction Specifications
Manual. Practices other than those specified in the pre-approved list may be
utilized. However, the burden of proof, as to whether the performance and ease
of maintenance of such practices will be according to guidelines provided in
the City of Indianapolis Stormwater Design and Construction Specifications
Manual, would be placed with the applicant. Details regarding the procedures
and criteria for consideration of acceptance of such BMPs are provided in the
City of Indianapolis Stormwater Design and Construction Specifications Manual.
      (3)   Gasoline outlets and refueling areas must install appropriate
practices to reduce lead, copper, zinc, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in
stormwater runoff. These requirements will apply to all new facilities and
existing facilities that replace their tanks, regardless of the size of the
facility.
      (4)   Discharges from new development and redevelopment sites will not be
allowed directly into karst features without pre-treatment.
   (C)   Calculations and design standards and specifications.
      (1)   Calculation of land disturbance should follow the guidelines
discussed in § 5-2-6-3(C).
      (2)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement
of all stormwater quality management measures, or BMPs shall meet the design
criteria, standards and specifications outlined in the City of Indianapolis
Stormwater Design and Construction Specifications Manual. The methods and
procedures included in the referenced Standards is in keeping with the above
stated policy and meet or exceed the requirements of IDEM’s MS4 GP.
   (D)   Easement requirements. All stormwater quality management systems,
including detention or retention basins, filter strips, pocket wetlands, in-
line filters, infiltration systems, conveyance systems, structures and
appurtenances located outside of the right-of-way shall be incorporated into
permanent easements. For the purposes of monitoring, inspection, and general
maintenance activities, adequate easement width, as detailed in the City of
Indianapolis Stormwater Design and Construction Specifications Manual, beyond
the actual footprint of the stormwater quality management facility as well as a
20-foot wide access easement from a public right-of-way to each BMP shall be
provided.
   (E)   Inspection, maintenance, record keeping, and reporting.
      (1)   After the release of the stormwater permit by the City of Lawrence
and the commencement of construction activities, the City of Lawrence has the
authority to conduct inspections of the work being done to ensure full
compliance with the provisions of this section, the released stormwater
pollution prevention plan, the City of Indianapolis Stormwater Design and
Construction Specifications Manual, and the terms and conditions of the
released permit.
      (2)   Stormwater quality facilities shall be maintained in good
condition, in accordance with the operation and maintenance procedures and
schedules listed in the City of Indianapolis Stormwater Design and Construction
Specifications Manual, in addition to the designed and approved performance
specifications for the facilities and shall not be subsequently altered,
revised, or replaced except as approved by the City of Lawrence.
      (3)   The City of Lawrence also has the authority to perform long-term,
post-construction inspection of all public or privately owned stormwater
quality facilities. The inspection will cover physical conditions, available
water quality storage capacity and the operational condition of key facility
elements. Noted deficiencies and recommended corrective action will be included
in an inspection report.
(Ord. 18, 2024, passed 12-18-2024)
§ 5-2-6-6. PERMIT REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Conceptual drainage plan review. In order to gain an understanding of
the drainage requirements for a specific project, a developer may submit
conceptual drainage plans and calculations for review by the City of Lawrence.
The direction provided by the City of Lawrence during such a review is based on
preliminary data and shall not be construed as an acceptance or binding on
either party. The following is a general listing of minimum data requirements
for the review of conceptual drainage plans:
      (1)   Conceptual plans showing general project layout, including existing
and proposed drainage systems via electronic means (email or flash drive).
      (2)   General description of the existing and proposed drainage systems
in narrative form.
      (3)   Map showing on-site 100-year floodplain and floodway (please note
if none exists).

      (5)   Watershed boundaries with USGS contours or best information
possible.
      (6)   Drainage calculations detailing existing and proposed discharges
from the site.
      (7)   Existing watercourse or regulated drains.
   (B)   Permit procedures. This section applies to all development, or re-
development of land, that results in land disturbance of one acre or more.
Individual lots with land disturbance less than one acre shall refer to §§
5-2-6-4 and
5-2-6-5 and division (D) below for plan review requirements and procedures.
Figure 1 attached to Ord. 18, 2024 and adopted by reference is a flowchart
summarizing the plan review/permit approval/project termination compliance
process for land disturbance of one acre or more and can be found at the end of
this section.
      (1)   General procedures.
         (a)   The project site owner shall submit an application for a
stormwater permit to the City of Lawrence. The application will include a
completed application checklist, construction plan sheets, a stormwater
drainage technical report, a stormwater pollution prevention plan and any other
necessary support information. Specific information to be included in the
application can be found in division (C) below. Electronic plans must be
submitted to the City of Lawrence. The City of Lawrence may, at its discretion,
require one or more copies be submitted to any other entity deemed appropriate
by the City of Lawrence.
         (b)   After the City of Lawrence’s receipt of the application, the
applicant will be notified as to whether their application was complete or
insufficient. The applicant will be asked for additional information if the
application is insufficient. If the application is complete, it will be
reviewed in detail by the City of Lawrence and/or its plan review consultant
(s). Once all comments have been received and review completed, the City of
Lawrence will either release the project, request modifications or deny the
project. If the applicant does not agree with or accept the review findings and
wishes to seek an appeal, the City of Lawrence will place the project on the
agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the City Stormwater Advisory
Board, provided the agenda for the meeting has not yet been advertised or
published. If time for notification does not allow, the project shall be placed
on the following regularly scheduled meeting of the City Stormwater Advisory
Board. If the project must go through a scheduled meeting, the City of Lawrence
will furnish the applicant a complete list of comments and objections to the
plans and accompanying data prior to the scheduled meeting. After the scheduled
meeting, the City of Lawrence will either issue a permit, request modifications
to the construction plans or deny the project.
         (c)   The project site owner must notify the City of Lawrence and IDEM
before beginning construction. Notification to the City of Lawrence shall be in
the form of an email while the notification to IDEM shall be in the form of an
online IDEM NOI submittal. Once a permit has been issued and the pending
construction notifications submitted to the City of Lawrence and IDEM before
the beginning of construction, construction may commence. Once construction
starts, the project owner shall monitor construction activities and inspect all
stormwater pollution prevention measures in compliance with this chapter and
the terms and conditions of the released permit. Upon completion of
construction activities, a certification of completion and compliance and as-
built plans must be submitted to the City of Lawrence. Once the construction
site has been stabilized and all temporary erosion and sediment control
measures have been removed, a notification shall be sent to the City of
Lawrence, requesting a termination inspection. The City of Lawrence, or its
representative, shall inspect the construction site to verify that the
completed project is fully stabilized and meets the requirements of this
chapter and its technical standards and that the terms and conditions of the
permit. Once the applicant receives a signed copy of the termination inspection
checklist confirming compliance, they must forward a copy to IDEM along with
the required IDEM NOT form. Permits issued by the City of Lawrence under this
scenario will expire two years from the date of issuance. If construction is
not completed within two years, an updated permit application must be submitted
to the City of Lawrence and an updated NOI must be resubmitted to IDEM at least
90 days prior to expiration.
      (2)   SWPPP review time limits.
         (a)   Pursuant to I.C. 13-18-27, an MS4-designated entity or other
review authority such as SWCD must make a preliminary determination as to
whether the construction plan associated with SWPPP is substantially complete
before the end of the tenth working day after the day on which the construction
plan associated with SWPPP is submitted to the review authority, in the case of
a less than five acres construction activity site or the fourteenth working day
after the day on which the construction plan associated with SWPPP is submitted
to the review authority, in the case of a five acres or larger construction
activity site. Depending on the outcome of the SWPPP review, the following
scenarios may play out:
            1.   No SWPPP review notification received. If the review authority
does not notify of its preliminary determination as to whether the construction
plan is substantially complete within either ten or 14 days as noted above, the
project site owner may submit a notice of intent letter to IDEM including the
information required by this chapter and the City of Indianapolis Stormwater
Design and Construction Specifications Manual, and after submission of the
notice of intent letter to IDEM, may begin the construction project, including
the land disturbing activities of the construction project.
            2.   SWPPP not substantially complete. If the review authority

separate resolution.
   (G)   Required assurances. This section shall apply to all projects whether
the stormwater management system or portions thereof will be dedicated to the
City of Lawrence or retained privately. As a condition of approval and issuance
of the permit, the City of Lawrence shall require the applicant to provide
assurance in form of an irrevocable letter of credit or a bond when the
stormwater management plan has been accepted and before construction begins.
The assurance will guarantee a good faith execution of the stormwater drainage
plan, the stormwater pollution prevention plan, the stormwater quality
management plan and any permit conditions. The assurance shall be for an amount
equal to 125% of the total costs of all stormwater management measures for the
entire project. The above-mentioned costs shall be based on an estimate as
prepared by a registered engineer or land surveyor. The costs shall be for the
installation and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of erosion control measures
and the construction and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of storm drainage
infrastructure, detention/retention facilities and stormwater quality BMPs, as
regulated under this chapter, until the construction is completed, the site is
stabilized, and as-built plans are accepted by the City of Lawrence. Assurances
shall be for a minimum of $5,000. All other performance bonds, maintenance
bonds or other assurances required by the City of Lawrence in accordance with
any and all other ordinances shall also apply and so be required. Local
governmental jurisdictions may require additional performance and/or
maintenance assurances. The intent of this assurance is not only to complete
the installation of storm drain infrastructure for the project, but also to
assure that adequate stormwater pollution prevention measures are properly
installed and maintained. If adequate assurances are set aside by the project
site owner for the overall project, proof of total assurance can be submitted
in place of an individual stormwater assurance.
   (H)   Terms and conditions of permits.
      (1)   In granting a stormwater permit, the City of Lawrence may impose
such terms and conditions as are reasonably necessary to meet the purposes of
this chapter. The project site owner shall ensure compliance with such terms
and conditions. Non-compliance with the terms and conditions of permits will be
subject to enforcement as described in §
5-2-6-7.
      (2)   The project site owner shall inform all general contractor,
construction management firms, grading or excavating contractors, utility
contractors and the contractors that have primary oversight on individual
building lots of the terms and conditions of the stormwater permit and the
schedule for proposed implementation.
      (3)   In the event that a project site is determined to impact or
discharge to a sensitive area or is located in an impact drainage area, the
City of Lawrence may require more stringent stormwater quantity and quality
measures than detailed in this chapter or in the Indiana Stormwater Quality
Manual.
         (a)   Determination of sensitive areas. Sensitive areas include highly
erodible soils, wetlands, karst areas, threatened or endangered species
habitat, outstanding waters, impaired waters, recreational waters and surface
drinking water sources. Any discharge from a stormwater practice that is a
Class V injection well shall meet the Indiana groundwater quality standards and
be registered with the U.S. EPA as required by the IDEM. If wetlands are
suspected on a site, a wetland delineation should be completed in accordance
with the methodology established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE). The
need for the applicant to check for the presence of threatened or endangered
species habitat will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Special terms and
conditions for development determined to impact or discharge to any sensitive
area shall be included in the stormwater permit.
         (b)   Determination of impact drainage areas.
            1.   The following areas shall be designated as impact drainage
areas, unless good reason for not including them is presented to the City of
Lawrence:
               A.   A floodway or floodplain as designated by the most updated
FEMA Code dealing with floodplain regulation and/or by the best available data
through IDNR.
               B.   Land within 25 feet of each bank of any ditch within the
City of Lawrence’s system.
               C.   Land within 15 feet of the centerline of any stormwater
infrastructure or enclosed conduit within the City of Lawrence’s system.
               D.   Land within 75 feet of each bank of a county open regulated
drain.
               E.   Land within 50 feet of a natural drainageway.
               F.   Land within 75 feet of the centerline of any tiled
regulated drain.
            2.   The City of Lawrence or City of Lawrence Engineer is
authorized, but is not required, to classify certain geographical areas as
impact drainage areas. In determining impact drainage areas, the City of
Lawrence may consider such factors as topography, soil type, capacity of
existing drains and distance from adequate drainage facility.
            3.   Land that does not have an adequate outlet, taking into
consideration the capacity and depth of the outlet, may be designated as an
impact drainage area by the City of Lawrence. Special terms and conditions for
development within any impact drainage area shall be included in the stormwater
permit.
         (c)   Determination of designated drainage areas served by regional
facilities. The City of Lawrence is authorized, but is not required, to
classify certain geographical areas as designated drainage areas that are or
will be served by regional facilities, such as a regional pond. In such cases,
an infrastructure development fee (IDF) rate may be established for the
designated drainage area. The basis for determining such a fee for a proposed
development or re-development within a designated drainage area will be as
detailed in the City of Indianapolis Stormwater Design and Construction
Specifications Manual.
   (I)   Certification of as-built plans. This section shall apply to all
projects whether the stormwater management system or portions thereof will be
dedicated to the City of Lawrence or retained privately. After completion of
construction of the project and before the release of required performance
assurances referenced in division (G) above, a professionally prepared and
certified ‘as-built’ set of plans (record drawings) shall be submitted to the
City of Lawrence for review. These as-built plans/record drawings must be
prepared and certified by the engineer of record, i.e., the company/engineer
who originally prepared the construction plans. Additionally, a digital copy of
the ‘as-built’ plans (record drawings) as well as finalized digital versions of
all analyses, models, manuals and reports that are consistent with the as-built
conditions are required in a format acceptable to the City of Lawrence. These
plans shall include all pertinent data relevant to the completed storm drainage
system and stormwater management facilities, and shall include:
      (1)   Pipe size and pipe material.
      (2)   Invert elevations.
      (3)   Top rim elevations.
      (4)   Elevation of the emergency overflow (spillway) for ponds.
      (5)   Grades along the emergency flood routing path(s).
      (6)   Pipe structure lengths.
      (7)   BMP types, dimensions and boundaries/easements.
      (8)   “As-planted” plans for BMPs, as applicable.
      (9)   Data and calculations showing detention basin storage volume.
      (10)   Data and calculations showing BMP treatment capacity.
      (11)   Certified statement on plans stating the completed storm drainage
system and stormwater management facilities substantially comply with
construction plans and the stormwater permit as released by the City of
Lawrence. (See certificate in the Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.)
   (J)   Post-project maintenance bond and verifications.
      (1)   In addition to as-built plans and the certification of completion
and compliance, following the release of performance assurances, the property
owner, developer, or contractor shall be required to file a three-year
maintenance bond or other acceptable guarantee with the City of Lawrence in an
amount not to exceed 25% of the cost of the stormwater management system
located outside the public road rights-of-way, and in a form satisfactory to
the City of Lawrence in order to assure that such stormwater system
installation was done according to standards of good workmanship, that the
materials used in the construction and installation were of good quality and
construction, and that such project was done in accordance with the accepted
plans, and this chapter and that any off-site drainage problems that may arise,
whether upstream or downstream of such project, will be corrected if such
drainage problems are determined by the City of Lawrence to have been caused by
the development of such project. The bond or other acceptable guarantee shall
be in effect for a period of two years after the date of the release of
required performance assurances referenced in division (G) above. The
beneficiary of all maintenance bonds shall be the City of Lawrence.
      (2)   To verify that all stormwater infrastructure is functioning
properly, visual recordings (via closed circuit television) of such
infrastructure, including all subsurface drains, shall be required twice, once
following the completion of installation of the stormwater management system
and submittal of as-builts, and the second time before release of maintenance
bonds. These visual recordings will be scheduled by the City of Lawrence and
paid for by the developer. Notices shall be provided to the City of Lawrence
within 72 hours following the completion of installation and again at least 60
days prior to the expiration date of the maintenance bond so that the noted
recordings may be scheduled. Reports summarizing the results of the noted
visual recordings shall be reviewed and accepted by the City of Lawrence before
the plat is recommended for recording and again before the maintenance bond
shall be recommended to be released.
      (3)   Additional requirements for transfer of any applicable stormwater
BMP maintenance agreement, O&M maintenance manual, and maintenance escrow
accounts to subsequent owners prior to release of the maintenance bond is
discussed in §
5-2-6-5.
(Ord. 18, 2024, passed 12-18-2024)
§ 5-2-6-7. COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Compliance with this chapter. In addition to the requirements of this
chapter, compliance with the requirements set forth in the local zoning
ordinances is also necessary. Compliance with all applicable ordinances of the
City of Lawrence as well as with applicable State of Indiana statues and
regulations shall also be required. Unless otherwise stated, all other
specifications referred to in this chapter shall be the most recent edition
available. Violations of the requirements of this chapter are subject to the
penalties listed below.
      (1)   Violations. Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of
this chapter, the requirements of an approved stormwater management design plan
or permit and/or the requirements of a recorded stormwater maintenance
agreement may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section.
Any such action or inaction is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated
by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of any of the penalties
described below shall not prevent such equitable relief.
      (2)   Warning notice. When the City of Lawrence finds that any person has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order
issued hereunder, the City of Lawrence may serve upon that person a written
warning notice, specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred
and requesting the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek
a resolution whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or
resolution of the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves
the alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the warning notice. Nothing in this division (A) shall limit the
authority of the City of Lawrence to take any action, including emergency
action or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a warning notice.
   (B)   Enforcement of this chapter.
      (1)   Notice of violation/citation.
         (a)   If the City of Lawrence determines that an applicant or other
responsible person has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a
permit, an approved stormwater management design plan, a recorded stormwater
management maintenance agreement, or the provisions of this chapter, it shall
issue a written notice of violation to such applicant or other responsible
person and the owner of the property. Where a person is engaged in activity
covered by this chapter without having first secured a permit therefor, the
notice of violation shall be served on the owner or the responsible person in
charge of the activity being conducted on the site.
         (b)   The notice of violation can be in the form of a citation ticket
and/or a written letter that would contain detailed inspection findings,
conclusions of law, disposition of warning or fines assessed, stipulated
remedial actions as discussed with the responsible party representative,
reasonable deadlines for those remedial actions and the date of re-inspection.
      (2)   Compensatory action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties,
and remedies authorized by this chapter, the City of Lawrence may impose upon a
violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling,
attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, public education and the
like.
      (3)   Civil penalties for violations.
         (a)   Any person found in violation of any provision of this chapter
shall be responsible for a civil infraction and subject to a maximum fine of
$2,500 for each offense, plus costs, damages and expenses. Each day such
violation occurs or continues shall be deemed a separate offense and shall make
the violator liable for the imposition of a fine for each day. The rights and
remedies provided for in this section are cumulative and in addition to any
other remedies provided by law. An admission or determination of responsibility
shall not exempt the offender from compliance with the requirements of this
chapter.
         (b)   Any person who aids or abets a person in a violation of this
chapter shall be subject to the penalties provided in this section.
         (c)   For purposes of this section, SUBSEQUENT OFFENSE means a
violation of the provisions of this chapter committed by the same person within
12 months of a previous violation of the same provision of this chapter for
which the person admitted responsibility or was adjudicated to be responsible.
         (d)   The City of Lawrence has established an enforcement response
schedule that standardizes the approach the City of Lawrence may take in
dealing with stormwater regulations offenses subject to this chapter and the
associated technical standards document. The enforcement response schedule is
as noted in the following table:
   
Violation # Type of Response Anticipated
Violation #   Type of Response Anticipated
1st violation Verbal telephone notice, letter of violation or written warning
              and administrative penalty

         (f)   The City of Lawrence reserves the right to issue a maximum fine
for any violation deemed sufficiently egregious or otherwise determined by the
City of Lawrence to warrant a maximum penalty.
      (4)   Stop work order.
         (a)   In addition to the penalties listed above, if land disturbance
activities are conducted contrary to the provisions of this chapter or accepted
final stormwater management plans, the City of Lawrence may order the work
stopped by notice in writing served on any person engaged in the doing or
causing of such work to be done, and any such persons shall forthwith stop such
work until authorized by the City of Lawrence to proceed with the work. A stop
work order will be posted on the site by the City of Lawrence and it is
unlawful for any person to remove the notice or continue any work on the site
without permission from the City of Lawrence. The City of Lawrence may also
undertake or cause to be undertaken, any necessary or advisable protective
measures to prevent violations of this chapter or to avoid or reduce the
effects of noncompliance herewith. The cost of any such protective measures
shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property upon which the work is
being done and the responsibility of any person carrying out or participating
in the work.
         (b)   The City of Lawrence may bring actions in the Superior or
Circuit Courts of Marion County, Indiana, for mandatory or prohibitory
injunctive relief in the enforcement of, and to secure compliance with, any
stop work order pursuant to this chapter, and any action for mandatory or
injunctive relief may be joined with an action to recover the penalties
provided for in this chapter. A permit reinstatement fee may also be assessed
by the City of Lawrence against any person who neglects or fails to comply with
a stop work order.
         (c)   For construction projects that are operating under a SWPPP
approved by the City of Lawrence, if a stop work order is issued on the grounds
that the erosion and sediment control measures included in the construction
plan are not adequate, the project site owner must be notified in writing of
the inadequacies in the erosion and sediment control measures and the project
site owner has 72 hours after receiving written notice to resolve the
identified inadequacies before the stop work order can take effect.
         (d)   The 72-hour period to resolve identified inadequacies on a
construction project does not apply if the stop work order is issued to a
construction project where the project site owner is creating a public health
hazard or safety hazard.
      (5)   Withhold certificate of occupancy. The City of Lawrence may refuse
to issue a certificate of occupancy for the building or other improvements
constructed or being constructed on the site until the applicant or other
responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of
violation or has otherwise satisfied the requirements of this chapter as
determined by the City of Lawrence.
      (6)   Suspension, revocation or modification of permits. The City of
Lawrence may suspend, revoke or modify any existing permit that the violator
may also have been previously granted. A suspended, revoked or modified permit
may be reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the
remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured
the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated upon
such conditions as the City of Lawrence may deem necessary to enable the
applicant or other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures
to cure such violations.
      (7)   Suspension of access to the stormwater drainage system.
         (a)   Emergency cease and desist orders.
            1.   When the City of Lawrence finds that any person has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued
hereunder, or that the person’s past violations are likely to recur, and that
the person’s violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or
threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably
appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons or to the environment, the City of Lawrence may issue an
order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the violator to immediately comply with all chapter
requirements and take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
            2.   Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under
this division (B)(7) shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its
endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger’s failure to immediately
comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the City of Lawrence may take such
steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the stormwater
drainage system or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to persons
or to the environment, including immediate termination of a facility’s water
supply, sewer connection or other municipal utility services.
            3.   The City of Lawrence may allow the person to recommence its
discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City of Lawrence
that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination
proceedings are initiated against the discharger under this chapter. A person
that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes
of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence, to the City of Lawrence within five days of receipt of the
emergency order. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a
bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
violator.
         (b)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations.
The City of Lawrence may, without prior notice, suspend stormwater drainage
system discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop
an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons,
or to the stormwater drainage system or waters of the state if the violator
fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the City of
Lawrence may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage
to the stormwater drainage system or waters of the state, or to minimize danger
to persons.
         (c)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the stormwater drainage system in violation of this chapter may
have their stormwater drainage system access terminated if such termination
would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The City of Lawrence will notify a
violator of the proposed termination of its stormwater drainage system access.
The violator may petition the City of Lawrence for a reconsideration and

bidder, additional verification of any of the information provided by the
bidder, and may also conduct random inquiries of the bidder's current and prior
customers.
(Ord. 5, 2023, passed 3-22-2023)
§ 5-4-1-3. POST-BID SUBMISSIONS FROM SUBCONTRACTORS.
   Post-bid submissions must be submitted in accordance with the following:
   (A)   All bidders shall provide a written list that discloses the name,
address, and type of work for each first-tier subcontractor from whom the
bidder has accepted a bid and/or intends to hire on any part of the public work
project, including individuals performing work as independent contractors,
within five business days after the date the bids are due.
   (B)   In addition, each such first-tier subcontractor shall be required to
adhere to the requirements of §
5-4-1-2 as though it were bidding directly to the City, except that first-tier
subcontractors shall submit the required information (including the name,
address, and type of work for each of their first-tier subcontractors) to the
successful bidder no later than five business days after the subcontractor's
first day of work on the public work project and the bidder shall then forward
said information to the City. Payment shall be withheld from any first-tier
subcontractor who fails to timely submit said information until such
information is submitted and approved by the City.
   (C)   Upon request, the City may require any second and lower-tier
subcontractors to provide the required information (including name, address,
type of work on the project and the name of the higher-tier subcontractor).
Payments shall be withheld from any second or lower-tiered contractor who fails
to timely submit this information until this information is submitted and
approved by the City. Additionally, the City may require the successful bidder
and relevant subcontractor to remove the second or lower-tier subcontractor
from the project and replace it with a responsive and responsible
subcontractor.
   (D)   Failure of a subcontractor to submit the required information shall
not disqualify the successful bidder from performing work on the project and
shall not constitute a contractual default and/or breach by the successful
bidder. However, the City may withhold all payments otherwise due for work
performed by a subcontractor, until the subcontractor submits the required
information and the City approves such information. The City may also require
that successful bidder to remove the subcontractor from the project and replace
it with a responsive and responsible subcontractor.
   (E)   The disclosure of a subcontractor ("Disclosed Subcontractor") by a
bidder or a subcontractor shall not create any rights in the Disclosed
Subcontractor. Thus, a bidder and/or subcontractor may substitute another
subcontractor ("Substitute Subcontractor") for a Disclosed Subcontractor by
giving the City written notice of the name, address, and type of work of the
Substitute Subcontractor. The Substitute Subcontractor is subject to all of the
obligations of a subcontractor under this chapter.
(Ord. 5, 2023, passed 3-22-2023)
§ 5-4-1-4. VALIDITY OF PRE-QUALIFICATION CLASSIFICATION.
   (A)   Upon designation by the City that a contractor's or subcontractor's
submission in anticipation of a bid is complete and timely, and upon any
further consideration deemed necessary by the City, the contractor or
subcontractor may be pre-qualified for future City public works projects. A
contractor's classification as "qualified" shall exempt the contractor or sub-
contractor from the comprehensive submission requirements contained herein for
a period of 12 months. Thereafter, contractors or subcontractors who are pre-
qualified must submit a complete application for continuation of "pre-
qualified" standing, on a form provided by the City, (also referred to as the
"short form") by December 31 for the upcoming calendar year. Failure by any
pre-qualified contractor or subcontractor to timely submit its complete
application for continuation of "pre-qualified" standing shall result in
automatic removal of the designation, effective January 1 of the upcoming year.
However, the "removed" contractor or subcontractor shall still be permitted to
bid on City public works projects.
   (B)   Any material changes to the contractor's status, at any time, must be
reported in writing within ten days of its occurrence to the City. The pre-
qualification designation is solely within the discretion of the City and the
City specifically reserves the right to change or revoke the designation for a
stated written reason(s).
   (C)   Denial of pre-qualification shall be in writing and shall be forwarded
to the contractor within seven working days of such decision. Any contractor
denied or losing pre-qualification status may request reconsideration of the
decision by submitting such request in writing to the City within five business
days of receipt of notice of denial.

§ 5-4-1-5. INCOMPLETE SUBMISSIONS BY BIDDERS.
   Submissions deemed inadequate, incomplete, or untimely by the City may
result in the automatic disqualification of the bid.
(Ord. 5, 2023, passed 3-22-2023)
§ 5-4-1-6. RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE BIDDER DETERMINATION.
   The City, after review of complete and timely submissions, shall, in its
sole discretion, after taking into account all information in the submission
requirements, determine whether a bidder is responsive and responsible. The
City specifically reserves the right to utilize all information provided in the
contractor or subcontractor's submission or any information obtained by the
City through its own independent verification of the information provided by
the contractor.
(Ord. 5, 2023, passed 3-22-2023)
§ 5-4-1-7. CERTIFIED PAYROLL.
   (A)   The successful bidder and all subcontractors working on a public work
project shall submit a certified payroll report utilizing the U.S. Department
of Labor's form commonly known as "WH-347" which must be prepared on a weekly
basis and submitted to the City within ten calendar days after the end of each
week in which the bidder or subcontractor performed its work on the public work
project. These certified payroll reports shall identify the job title and craft
of each employee on the project, e.g. journeyman electrician or apprentice
electrician. In the event any contractor or subcontractor uses independent
contractors to perform work on the project, such individual must be identified
on the WH-347 form with the same information as is required for employees.
   (B)   The City may withhold payment due for work performed by a bidder if
the bidder fails to timely submit its certified payroll reports until such time
as such certified payroll reports are submitted. The City may also withhold
payment due for work performed by a subcontractor if the subcontractor fails to
timely submit its certified payroll reports until such time as such certified
payroll reports are submitted. The City shall not withhold payment to a bidder
for work performed by the bidder or for work performed by subcontractors who
have submitted their certified payroll reports, because one or more other
subcontractors failed to timely submit their certified payroll reports.
(Ord. 5, 2023, passed 3-22-2023)
§ 5-4-1-8. PUBLIC RECORDS.
   All information submitted by a bidder or a subcontractor pursuant to this
chapter, including certified payrolls, are public records subject to review
pursuant to the Indiana Access to Public Records law (I.C. 5-14-3).
(Ord. 5, 2023, passed 3-22-2023)
§ 5-4-1-9. PENALTIES FOR FALSE, DECEPTIVE, OR FRAUDULENT STATEMENTS OR
INFORMATION.
   Any bidder that willfully makes, or willfully causes to be made, a false,
deceptive or fraudulent statement, or willfully submits false, deceptive or
fraudulent information in connection with any submission made to the City shall
be disqualified from bidding on all City projects for a period of three years.
