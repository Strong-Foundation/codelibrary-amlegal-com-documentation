   (B)   Conservation districts. The Commission may recommend, and the Town

moving of any building; and any new construction of a principal building or
accessory building or structure subject to view from a public way.
      (1)   At the expiration of the initial three-year period, the first phase
of a conservation district continues and the second phase does not become

which identifies historic buildings, structures, and sites located within the
town.
      (2)   A district may be limited to the boundaries of a property
containing a single building, structure, or site.
      (3)   The map may divide the district into primary and secondary areas as

§ 36.11 EQUITABLE IMPACT FEE.
   (A)   Limitation on imposition of impact fee. This section shall expire and
become void five years after its effective date as required by IC 36-7-4-1340,
however, the town may adopt a replacement impact fee ordinance consistent with
IC 36-7-4-1300 et seq.
   (B)   Establishment of impact zone.
      (1)   There is hereby established one park and recreational
infrastructure impact zone ("Impact Zone"), the boundaries of which are co-
terminus with the existing corporate boundaries of the town, as such boundaries
may be extended from time to time through annexation, and over any boundaries
for which the town exercises planning and zoning jurisdiction. In this regard,
the Town Council specifically finds: there is a functional relationship between
the components of the park and recreational infrastructure type in the impact
zone; the park and recreational infrastructure type provides a reasonably
uniform benefit to all citizens throughout the impact zone; that all areas
within the impact zone are contiguous as required by IC 36-7-4-1316. Except as
provided herein, this section shall apply uniformly to single-family detached,
duplex/condo and townhouse, and multi-family apartment residential developments
within the impact zone for which the town may require an Improvement Location
Permit, and which creates a need for new and additional park and recreational
infrastructure.
      (2)   This section shall not apply to:
         (a)   Development meeting the requirements set forth in IC 36-7-4-1322
(g);
         (b)   Improvements which do not require an Improvement Location
Permit;
         (c)   Improvements which do not create a need for new and additional
infrastructure, including the erection of a sign, construction of accessory
buildings, structures or fences, or the alteration, renovation or expansion of
an improvement where the use, or intensity thereof, has not changed;
         (d)   The replacement of a destroyed or partially destroyed
improvement, provided that the replacement improvement does not create a need
for new and additional infrastructure over and above the infrastructure needed
by the original improvement prior to the destruction or partial destructions
thereof;
         (e)   Non-residential development; and
         (f)   "Qualified property" as that term is defined in IC 36-1-8-18,
except that, upon request of the owner of qualified property, an impact fee may
be imposed on the qualified property.
   (C)   Zone Improvement Plan. As a precondition of the adoption of this
section, the town engaged Baker Tilly to prepare a comprehensive and detailed
park and recreational infrastructure impact analysis, referred to as a "special
purpose report" by Baker Tilly . The Town Council hereby adopts the Special
Purpose Report prepared by Baker Tilly dated February 1, 2022, as its Zone
Improvement Plan. Additionally the Town Council hereby adopts specifically the
Zone Improvement Plan as part of the Comprehensive Plan for the Town of
Pendleton, Indiana, pursuant to IC 36-7-4-500 et seq.
   (D)   Establishment of Park and Recreation Infrastructure Impact Fee
Schedule.
      (1)   Based on the Zone Improvement Plan, the Town Council determines
that the park and recreational infrastructure impact fee for each residential
dwelling unit is as follows:
         Detached Single-family home:   $3,854
         Attached Single-family home:   $3,854
         Multi-Family home:         $2,852
      (2)   The Town Council hereby makes all of the data collected, the
calculations made and the conclusions reached by Baker Tilly in the process of
developing and drafting the Zone Improvement Plan a part of the official record
considered by the Town Council in enacting this section, and specifically
instructs the employees of the town to make such data and other information
available to the public for review during regular business hours.
   (E)   Credit in lieu of payment; exemptions.
      (1)   Pursuant to IC 36-7-4-1335, any person obligated to pay an impact
fee pursuant to the terms of this section may have the option of constructing,
providing, and dedicating park and recreational infrastructure owned and
operated by a neighborhood association for the public benefit, all as described
and defined in the Zone Improvement Plan and in accordance with the
specifications for such park and recreational infrastructure to be improved,
instead of paying all or part of any impact fee to the town. The fee payer, or
other person or entity constructing and providing the infrastructure or
improvement, shall be given credit for the actual costs of constructing and
providing such park and recreational infrastructure for the town, provided that
the park and recreational infrastructure meets the requirements of IC 36-7-4-
1335. A request for credit shall be presented prior to the issuance of the
Improvement Location Permit. In the event the actual cost of such
infrastructure does not equal the amount of the impact fee pursuant to the
calculation provided for in division (D) of this section, the remaining balance
shall be due in accordance with the provisions stated hereafter.
      (2)   Credits against impact fees otherwise due shall be allowed pursuant
to this section for all park and recreational infrastructure improvements
constructed or provided in accordance with IC 36-7-4-1313 and IC 36-7-4-1335.
In addition, a fee payer or other person or entity responsible for constructing
the infrastructure or improvements shall be allowed to designate in writing a
reasonable and administratively feasible method of allocating its credits to
future fee payers who may be successors in interest to the credits earned by
the fee payer or others, as part of the certification provided for above.
      (3)   Any person or entity otherwise obligated to pay the impact fee
established by this section whose property was totally or partially destroyed
by fire, storm, or other casualty beyond his or her control, shall be exempt
from said impact fee if such person or entity repairs or replaces the destroyed
structure without creating a burden on infrastructure greater than the burden
imposed by the destroyed infrastructure. In the event of such additional
burden, the impact fee shall be calculated based only on the increased burden
created by the structure.
      (4)   The person providing the infrastructure or improvement may waive
the person's right to a credit under this section.
   (F)   Impact Fee upon issuance of Improvement Location Permit.
      (1)   The impact fee imposed pursuant to the terms of this section shall
be due and payable upon the issuance of an Improvement Location Permit by the
town. It is understood that the Improvement Location Permit is synonymous with
the term "structural building permit" as that term is used in IC 36-7-4-1323,
in that the issuance of an Improvement Location Permit authorizes the applicant
to commence construction activities, structural or otherwise.
      (2)   The entire impact fee which is calculated pursuant to the terms of
this section shall be due upon the issuance of an Improvement Location Permit
unless the aggregate amount of the impact fee is greater than $5,000, in which
case an installment plan may be requested by the applicant in accordance with
the terms set forth in IC 36-7-4-1324(a) through (d). The Pendleton Impact Fee
Review Board shall establish specific rules consistent with IC 36-7-4-1324(a)
through (d) for installment payments. The interest rate on any installment plan
shall not exceed the pre-judgment rate as established by Indiana law, as
amended, and shall only accrue on the outstanding portion of the impact fee
beginning on the date the Improvement Location Permit is issued.
      (3)   If all or part of an installment is not paid when due and payable,
the amount of the installment shall be increased on the first day after the
installment is due and payable by a penalty amount equal to 10% of the
installment amount that is overdue, and interest shall be charged on the
penalty amount.
      (4)   If a fee payer requests, the amount of the impact fee shall be
assessed upon the voluntary submission of a development plan or upon the
issuance of the Improvement Location Permit, whichever is earlier. The town
shall make the assessment within 30 days of the date of such voluntary request
or upon the issuance of the Improvement Location Permit with or without the
request. For purposes of this section, "assessment" means the act of
calculating the amount of the impact fee which shall be due.
   (G)   Lien rights established. Pursuant to IC 36-7-4-1325, on the date of
issuance of an Improvement Location Permit, the town acquires a lien against
the real estate on which the impact fee is assessed. The town may, in its
discretion, file a specific instrument setting forth its lien rights with
respect to a parcel of real estate which is the subject of an installment
payment of an impact fee, and such instrument shall constitute actual notice in
addition to the constructive notice provided for by the recording of this
section.
   (H)   Form of receipt. The Pendleton Clerk-Treasurer shall issue a receipt
for any and all impact fees collected and the form of such receipt shall be as
follows:
   Received of  (fee payer) , this        day of         , 20    the sum of
$                  in (full)(partial) satisfaction of Park and Recreation
Impact Fees due pursuant to Pendleton Town Council Ordinance No.           
relating to improvements to be constructed on the real estate described on
Exhibit A, attached hereto, made part hereof, and subject to the collection
remedies and lien rights in favor of the Town of Pendleton in the event or
partial payment with payments remaining due pursuant to IC 36-7-4-1325. The
remaining balance due (if any) is in the following amount: $              .
This impact fee is dedicated to the creation of the following infrastructure
element in accordance with the Zone Improvement Plan:                 .
                                                
                            , Clerk-Treasurer
   Town of Pendleton, Indiana
   (I)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any fee payer who is aggrieved by the calculation of the impact
fee, by the rejection of an application for a refund of an impact fee, by the
approval of only a partial refund of an impact fee, or by a determination of
the amount of a credit, may appeal from such calculation, rejection, partial
approval, or determination to the Pendleton Impact Fee Review Board, and the
Pendleton Impact Fee Review Board shall conduct a hearing with regard thereto.
At such hearing, the fee payer shall bear the burden of going forward with the
evidence and shall present evidence addressing either of the following
propositions:
         (a)   A fact assumed in determining the amount of the impact fee is
incorrect; or
         (b)   The amount of the impact fee is greater than the amount allowed
under IC 36-7-4-1320, 36-7-4-1321 and 36-7-4-1322.
      (2)   Upon conclusion of the hearing, the Pendleton Impact Fee Review
Board shall make a determination based upon the facts presented, and may
reverse, affirm, modify or make such adjustments in the impact fee as it
believes are appropriate under the circumstances, if any, including
establishing the amount of an impact fee, a credit, a refund or any combination
of fees, credits or refunds.
      (3)   The Pendleton Impact Fee Review Board shall provide a copy of its
decision to the town and the fee payer involved in the appeal within five days
after making its decision, and shall make written findings of fact to support
its decision.
      (4)   An appeal under this section must be filed no later than 30 days
after the issuance of the Improvement Location Permit, or not later than 60
days after the rejection or partial approval of an application for a refund of
an impact fee, as applicable. The appeal shall be initiated with the filing of
a Petition for Review with the Pendleton Clerk-Treasurer, together with a
filing fee in the amount of $100. The filing fee shall be refunded in full if:
         (a)   The Petition for Review is granted and the impact fee is
eliminated, reduced or adjusted by the Pendleton Impact Fee Review Board, by
independent action of the town or by a court having jurisdiction; and
         (b)   The reviewing body determines that the amount of the fees,
reductions, or credits were arbitrary or capricious.
      (5)   The Petition for Review shall be in a form calculated to inform the
Pendleton Impact Fee Review Board of the nature of the complaint, the parties
to the action and the relief requested. In addition, the petition shall
describe the new development on which the impact fee has been assessed, all
facts related to the assessment of the impact fee and the reasons the
petitioner believes that the amount of the impact fee assessed is erroneous or
is greater than the amount allowed by the fee limitation set forth in the
enabling statute.
      (6)   The town shall not deny the issuance of an Improvement Location
Permit on the basis that the impact fee has not been paid, or condition
issuance of the permit on the payment of the impact fee; however, if the impact
fee is $1,000 or less, the town may require the fee payer to pay the impact fee
or initiate an appeal under this section before the Improvement Location Permit
is issued.
   (J)   Establishment of Pendleton Impact Fee Review Board.
      (1)   The Town Council hereby establishes an Impact Fee Review Board
("Board"), which shall consist of three citizen members appointed by the

the same manner as the original appointee, and each such succeeding member
shall serve for a term of five years. Each member shall continue to serve until
his or her successor is appointed and qualified.
         (c)   In the event any person appointed as a Board member shall fail
to qualify as provided within ten days after the mailing to him or her of
notice of his or her appointment, or if any member after qualifying shall die,
resign, vacate office, or in the event a member is unable to hear a petition
due to a conflict of interest, the Pendleton Town Council President shall fill
such vacancy with a new or temporary (in the event of a conflict of interest)
member meeting the qualifications of the member being replaced. A new member
shall serve out the remainder of the vacated term, while a temporary member
shall serve for the period necessary to dispose of the petition giving rise to
the conflict.
         (d)   The Board shall be governed by IC 36-7-4-1338(c) and all other
applicable provisions of Indiana's Impact Fee Statute.
   (K)   Establishment of Park and Recreation Impact Fee Fund.
      (1)   The Town Council hereby establishes the Park and Recreation Impact
Fee Fund ("Fund") for the town. This Fund shall be a non-reverting fund and
shall receive any and all sums collected pursuant to this section to be
utilized in connection with the purposes set forth herein. The Fund shall
consist initially of one account, based upon the current existence of one
impact zone. In the event, and only in the event, an additional impact zone is
created hereafter, a separate account shall be maintained for each separate
impact zone established within the town. Interest earned on the Fund, or on any
account with the Fund, shall be deposited and maintained within the Fund or the
separate account. The Pendleton Department of Finance and Records shall

and shall make an annual report of the Fund to the Pendleton Plan Commission
and to the Pendleton Town Council, which report shall be available to the
public, in general, and fee payers, upon request.
      (2)   Pursuant to IC 36-7-4-1332(e), the Pendleton Clerk-Treasurer is
designated as the town official responsible for accepting, rejecting and paying
on refund requests. In order to facilitate refunds when they may be due, the
Pendleton Clerk-Treasurer is directed to identify the purpose of any impact fee
paid in order that a refund, if any, may be paid from the Fund or account into
which the impact fee was originally deposited.
   (L)   Use of Impact Fees collected pursuant to this section. Any and all
fees collected pursuant to the provisions of this section may be utilized for
the following purposes only by the town, acting by and through its Town
Council, which for the purposes of this section is identified as the
"infrastructure agency" contemplated by IC 36-7-4-1317:
      (1)   Providing funds to be utilized by the town for the purpose of
paying the capital costs of new park and recreational infrastructure that is
necessary to serve the new development within the corporate limits of the town

the existence of House Enrolled Act 1467 ("Act") adopted by the General
Assembly of the State of Indiana which regulates the imposition of impact fee
ordinances by municipal corporations within the State of Indiana. It is the
intent of the town to comply with the Act, and this section shall be construed
in all respects to be consistent with the Act. The substantive and procedural
requirements of IC 36-7-4-1300 et seq. shall control in the event of conflicts
between this section and the Act, which conflicts are unintended by the Town
Council.
   (N)   Amendment and review. The impact fee provided for herein is based upon
data which, in large part, is subject to inflation and other economic and
market forces over which the town has no control. The Town Council may, not
less than once each year, cause a review to be made by town staff or
consultants, as may be required, to determine the continuing validity of the
impact fee, the Impact Fee Zone and the Zone Improvement Plan. The Town Council
shall consider and adopt such amendments as are necessary to cause substantive
compliance with all constitutional and statutory requirements. To the extent
required by the facts and circumstances, this process shall include all steps
necessary to update the Zone Improvement Plan and the Comprehensive Plan.
   (O)   Effective date. This section shall be in full force and effect six
months after its adoption by the Town Council in accordance with IC 36-7-4-

DISABILITIES
§ 39.01 ADA COORDINATOR.
The ADA Coordinator for the town shall be the Town Manager and/or the Town
Council President.
(Ord. 1993-10, passed 7-20-93)
§ 39.02 COMPLAINTS.
The town employs less than 50 employees and therefore is not required to adopt
a formal grievance procedure; however, any complaint shall be handled by a
Coordinator in a cordial and expedient manner.
(Ord. 1993-10, passed 7-20-93)
§ 39.03 AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT.
In accordance with the requirements of Title II of the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), the town will not discriminate against
qualified individuals with disabilities on the basis of disability in its
access to services, programs or activities.
   (A)   Employment. The town does not discriminate on the basis of disability
in its hiring or employment practices and complies with all regulations as
outlined by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under Title I of
the ADA.
   (B)   Effective communication. The town will, upon request, provide
appropriate aids and services leading to effective participation for people
with disabilities to participate equally in the town’s programs, services and
activities. Anyone who requires an auxiliary aid or service for effective
participation or modification of policies or procedures to participate in a
service, program, or activity, contact the office of the ADA Coordinator as
soon as possible but no later than 48 hours before the scheduled event.
   (C)   Modifications to policies and procedures. The town will make all
reasonable modifications to policies and programs to ensure that people with
disabilities have an equal opportunity to enjoy all of its programs, services
and activities. The Americans with Disabilities Act does not require the town
to take any action that would fundamentally alter the nature of its services or
programs or impose an undue financial or administrative burden to the town.
Complaints regarding a service, program or activity of the town that is not
accessible to persons with disabilities should be directed to the ADA
Coordinator.
   (D)   The town will not place a surcharge on a particular individual with a
disability or any group of individuals with disabilities to cover the cost of
providing auxiliary aids/services or reasonable modifications of policy, such
as retrieving items from locations that are open to the public but are not
accessible to persons who use wheelchairs.
   (E)   Procedures. The town has adopted an internal grievance procedure
providing for prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action
prohibited by the U.S. Department of Justice regulations implementing Title II
of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). Title II states, in part, that
"no otherwise qualified disabled individual shall, solely by reason of such
disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of,
or be subjected to discrimination in programs, services or activities sponsored
by a public entity".
      (1)   (a)   File the grievance. Complete the town’s grievance form.
Grievance forms can be found on the town website (www.town.pendleton.in.us) or
in the ADA Coordinator's office. A grievance may be communicated in writing, by
e-mail, by fax or by telephone, but must follow the format of the town’s
grievance form.
         (b)   A grievance concerning the accessibility of the town's services,
programs or activities should be addressed to: the Town Manager and/or Town
Council President.
      (2)   Acknowledgment. A grievance should be filed within 90 days after
the grievant party becomes aware of the alleged violation. The ADA Coordinator
will send an acknowledgement of receipt of the grievance within 12 working
days.
      (3)   Informal resolution. Following the filing of a grievance, the ADA
Coordinator shall determine whether, and to what extent, an investigation of
the grievance is warranted. Any resulting investigation shall be conducted by
the ADA Coordinator or his/her designee. In the case of a property or access
issue, the grievance will also be investigated by the town’s property manager.
A thorough investigation affords all interested persons and their
representatives an opportunity to submit evidence relevant to a grievance. The
ADA Coordinator will complete the investigation within 60 calendar days of
receipt of the grievance. If appropriate, the ADA Coordinator will arrange to
meet with the grievant to discuss the matter and attempt to reach an informal
resolution of the grievance. Any informal resolution of the grievance shall be
documented in the ADA Coordinator file and the case will be closed.
      (4)   Written determination. If an informal resolution of the grievance
is not reached in division (E)(3), within 60 calendar days of receipt of the
grievance, a written determination as to the validity of the complaint, and
description of the resolution, if appropriate, shall be forwarded by the ADA
Coordinator to the Executive Officer for approval.
      (5)   (a)   Final determination and resolution. The ADA Coordinator shall
communicate the determination and resolution to the grievant within 90 calendar
days of receipt of the grievance, unless the Executive Officer authorizes
additional time for further consideration of the grievance. Any authorized
extension of time will be communicated to the grieving. Any request for
reconsideration of the response to the grievance shall be at the discretion of
the Executive Officer.
         (b)   If the grievant is not satisfied with the town's handling of the
grievance at any stage of the process, or does not wish to file a grievance
through the town's ADA Title II grievance procedures, the grievant may file a
complaint directly with the U. S. Department of Justice or other appropriate
state or federal agency. Use of the town's grievance procedure is not a
prerequisite to the pursuit of other remedies.
         (c)   The resolution of any specific grievance will require
consideration of varying circumstances, such as the specific nature of the
disability; the nature of the access to services, programs, or facilities at
issue, the essential eligibility requirements for participation; the health and
safety of others; and the degree to which an accommodation would constitute a
fundamental alteration to the service, program or facility, or cause an undue
hardship to the town. Accordingly, the resolution by the town of any one
grievance does not constitute a precedent upon which the town is bound or upon
which other complaining parties may rely.
      (6)   File maintenance. The town’s ADA Coordinator shall maintain ADA
grievance files for three years.
(Ord. 2012-05, passed 5-3-12)
EXTENDED OPERATIONS POLICY
§ 39.10 EXTENDED OPERATIONS POLICY.
   (A)   Extended operations are defined as operations beyond normal work hours
and require intra-departmental and/or multi-jurisdictional coordination.
   (B)   The Town Manager or Town Council President determines when the Town of

   (D)   In most cases, after hours operations conducted by "on-call"
personnel, isolated water main breaks and limited power outages will not be
considered extended operations.
   (E)   The following procedures will be in place once extended operations are
declared:
      (1)   Depending on the type of operation, one of the Department
Supervisors may be designated as the "Lead Supervisor" and responsible for
prioritizing, assigning town equipment, and scheduling all necessary personnel.
Other departments and respective supervisors will be in direct support of the
Lead Supervisor.
      (2)   Department Supervisors shall maintain accurate work records for
each of their employees for possible reimbursement by state and federal
agencies. Records per employee shall include the following;
         (a)   Gas and purchases related to the operations;
         (b)   Types of activities (including breaks);
         (c)   Start and finish time of the activity; and
         (d)   The hours and type of equipment used during the activity.
      (3)   The Lead Supervisor may stager employee on-duty times to ensure the
necessary coverage during extended operations. Employees shall not be on duty
more than 16 hours without eight continuous hours off-duty without permission
from the Town Manager.
      (4)   Employees will be paid at 1.5 times their normal hourly rate during
extended operations under the following circumstances:
         (a)   Circumstances already designated in the town's Employee Manual;
         (b)   Any work hours beyond eight hours in a day;
         (c)   Any continuous work hours beyond eight hours;
         (d)   Any hours beyond 40 hours of normal pay in a one week period;
         (e)   Any hours outside of the normal 7:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m. work
hours; and
         (f)   Employees who have worked less than eight hours in a calendar
day, because the extended operations were terminated, the employee was placed
off duty to meet safety guidelines, or for other reasons approved by the Town
Manager, may be placed on standby and compensated the remaining hours of the
day at the normal pay rate.
      (5)   Personnel driving snow plows (or other licensed equipment)
continuously on public streets shall be restricted to the following safety
guidelines:
         (a)   Eleven hours of driving time within a 14 hour duty period;
         (b)   At least one ½ hour break in the first eight hours of driving
and a total of one hour in the 11 hours of driving time;
         (c)   Driving incidental to other types of activities shall not be
included in the "11-hour" or "14-hour" rule;
         (d)   Personnel may conduct other activities (other than continuous
driving) with supervisor approval once the “11-hour” or “14-hour” rule are
exceeded; and
         (e)   Driving shall not resume until the employee has been off duty
for at least ten continuous hours.
      (6)   Breaks (including lunch, dinner, etc.) will be considered "on the
clock" when an employee is on-duty during extended activities. If scheduled for
more than eight hours, employees must be offered at least one hour of total
break time after four hours on-duty and before eight hours on-duty, and at
least one ½ hour break for every scheduled four hours after the first eight
hours.
      (7)   The Town Manager may place all necessary personnel in an "on call
status" if the start time of the extended operations is undeterminable (ie.
snow accumulation, flash flooding). Personnel placed in an "on call status"
will receive on-call pay for that day.
      (8)   Scheduling shall be determined by the Supervisor of the Lead
Department. Scheduling priority shall be based on the following:
         (a)   Safety;
         (b)   Town policies and procedures;
         (c)   Needs of the operations; and
         (d)   Seniority of involved personnel.
      (9)   Only the Town Manager or the Town Council President may waive any
of the provisions of this policy.
      (10)   During extended operations, "take home" vehicles may be required
to be left at the town barn for use by on-duty personnel.
      (11)   Town employees are not allowed to plow private drives with ToP
equipment. The only times private drives may be plowed is when emergency
personnel (including volunteer firemen), medical personnel (ie., nurses,
doctors) and town employees can not otherwise make it to their place of duty or
respond to emergencies.

§ 39.32 DESIGNATION OF ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION AREAS.
   (A)   The Town Council may consider a declaratory resolution designating a

reasonable for a project of that nature, or whether the cost of the new
equipment is reasonable for equipment of that type;
      (2)   Whether the estimate of the number of jobs created and/or retained
is reasonable to expect;

or conglomeration of pieces to form a tool. The tool will stand alone and not
become a part of a basic structure or building.
      (2)   This town will capitalize and tag items with an individual value
equal to or greater than $100. Machinery combined with other machinery to form
one unit with a total value greater than the above-mentioned limit will be one
unit.
      (3)   Shipping charges, consultant fees, and any other costs directly
associated with the purchase, delivery, or set up (including contractors and/or
town workers (salary and benefits)), which makes such equipment operable for
its intended purpose will be capitalized.
      (4)   Improvements or renovations to existing machinery and equipment
will be capitalized only if the result of the change meets all of the following
conditions:
         (a)   Total costs exceed $100;
         (b)   The useful life is extended two or more years; and
         (c)   The total cost will be greater than the current book value and

it meets the required dollar amount.
         (c)   A department's computer (CPU, monitor, keyboard, and printer) is
considered one unit.
      (6)   A department will record donated machinery and equipment at fair
market value on the date of transfer with any associated costs.

      (2)   Examples are walks, parking areas and drives, golf cart paths,
fencing, retaining walls, pools, outside fountains, planter underground
sprinkler systems, and other similar items.
      (3)   Improvements do not include roads, streets, or assets that are of
value only to the public. For example, Main Street is a public street with
greatest value to the public. Roads or drives upon town-owned land that provide
support to our facilities are assets. A sidewalk down the road for public
enjoyment is an infrastructure improvement and is not capitalized. However,

"ENTERPRISE FUNDS." Those funds used to account for operations:
   (A)   That are financed and operated in a manner similar to private business
enterprise - where the intent of the governing body is that the costs
(expenses, including depreciation) of providing goods or services to the
general public on a continuing basis be financed or recovered primarily through
user charges; or
   (B)   Where the governing body has decided that periodic determination of
revenues earned, expenses incurred and/or net income is appropriate for capital
maintenance, public policy, management control, accountability and other
purposes.
The ENTERPRISE FUNDS of the town shall include the municipally owned water and
electric utilities. Operation of these utilities shall require enterprise fund
accounting and reporting.
"FIXED ASSET." Tangible assets of a durable nature employed in the operating
activities of the unit and that are relatively permanent and are needed for the
production or sale of goods or services are termed property, plant and
equipment or fixed assets. These assets are not held for sale in the ordinary
course of business. This broad group is usually separated into classes
according to the physical characteristics of the item (e.g. land, buildings,
improvements other than buildings, machinery and equipment, furniture and
fixtures).
"HISTORICAL COST." The cash equivalent price exchanged for goods or services at
the date of acquisition. Land, buildings, equipment and most inventories are
common examples of items recognized under the historical cost attribute.
"TANGIBLE ASSETS." Assets that can be observed by one or more physical senses.
They may be seen and touched and, in some environments, heard and smelled.
(Ord. 1998-08, passed 7-14-98)
§ 39.51 RECORDING AND ACCOUNTING.
   (A)   The town and its various departments shall classify capital
expenditures as capital outlays within the fund from which the expenditure was
made. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes all expenditures
necessary to put the asset into position and ready for use. For purposes of
recording fixed assets of the town and its departments, the valuation of assets
shall be based on historical cost or where the historical cost is
indeterminable, by estimation for those assets in existence.
   (B)   The town's municipally owned utilities shall record acquisition of
fixed assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. When
an asset is purchased for cash, the acquisition is simply recorded at the
amount of cash paid, including all outlays relating to its purchase and
preparation for intended use. Assets may be acquired under a number of other
arrangements including:
      (1)   Assets acquired for a lump-sum purchase price;
      (2)   Purchase on deferred payment contract;
      (3)   Acquisition under capital lease;
      (4)   Acquisition by exchange of nonmonetary assets;
      (5)   Acquisition by issuance of securities;
      (6)   Acquisition by self-construction;
      (7)   Acquisition by donation or discovery.
Some of these arrangements present special problems relating to the cost to be
recorded, for example, in utility accounting, interest during a period of
construction has long been recognized as a part of the asset cost. Reference to
an intermediate accounting manual will illustrate the recording of acquisition
of assets under the aforementioned acquisition arrangements. For purposes of
recording fixed assets of the utilities the valuation of assets shall be based
on historical cost.
   (C)   In addition, an asset register (prescribed form 211) or State Board of
Accounts approved computer program shall be maintained to provide a detail
record of the capital assets of the governmental unit.
(Ord. 1998-08, passed 7-14-98)
§ 39.52 SAFEGUARDING OF ASSETS.
Accounting controls are to be designed and implemented to provide reasonable
assurances that:
   (A)   Capital expenditures made by the town, its various departments and
utilities be in accordance with management's authorization.
   (B)   Transactions of the utilities be recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
principles.
   (C)   Adequate detail record be maintained to assure accountability for town
and utility owned assets.
   (D)   Access to assets be permitted in accordance with management's
authorization.
   (E)   The recorded accountability for assets be compared with the existing
assets at least every two years and appropriate action be taken with respect to
any differences.
(Ord. 1998-08, passed 7-14-98)
PURCHASING
§ 39.60 PURCHASING AGENCY.
   (A)   The town Purchasing Agency is established as the purchasing agency for
the town. The Town Council is the Purchasing Agency. The Pendleton/Fall Creek
Board of Parks and Recreation is established as the purchasing agency for Falls
Park.
   (B)   The Purchasing Agency shall have all the powers and duties authorized
under IC 5-22, as may be supplemented from time to time by ordinances adopted
by the Council and policies adopted by the Purchasing Agency.
   (C)   The Purchasing Agency shall act as the purchasing agency for every
agency, board, office, branch, bureau, commission, council, department or other
establishment of the town, except Falls Park.
   (D)   The Purchasing Agency may designate in writing any employee as a
purchasing agent. All full-time town employees are hereby designated as
purchasing agents. The Fire Chief, Town Marshal and the Town Manager shall have
full authority over their respective departments. Monthly reports shall be made
available to the Town Council. The Park Board shall designate purchasing agents

      (2)   Termination by Council. A public-private agreement may be
terminated by the Council in conformity with the terms of the public-private
agreement. The agreement may provide for the payment of money to either party
if the agreement is terminated. The payment may be used in the form of
liquidated damages to compensate the operator for demonstrated unamortized
costs, to retire or refinance indebtedness created to improve or construct
assets owned by the town, or for any other purpose mutually agreeable to the
operator and the town.
   (J)   Records. The records of an operator that is a party to a public-
private agreement are subject to inspection and copying to the same extent the
records would be subject to inspection and copying if the operator were a
public agency. This section is limited to records directly relating to the
public-private agreements. Records that are provided by an operator to the town
that relate to compliance by the operator with the terms of a public private

electric system, including, but not limited to, voltage sags or swells, system
faults, outages, loss of a single phase of supply, equipment failures, and
lightning or switching surges.
   (E)   The customer shall operate any interconnected renewable generation
facilities in such a manner as not to cause undue fluctuations in voltage,
intermittent load characteristics or otherwise interfere with the operation of
the town's electric system. At all times when the renewable generation
facilities are being operated in parallel with the town's electric system, the
customer shall operate the renewable generation facilities in a manner that no
disturbance will be produced to the service rendered by Pendleton Electric to
any of its other customers or to any electric system interconnected with the
town's electric system. The customer's control equipment for the renewable
generation facilities shall immediately, completely, and automatically
disconnect and isolate the renewable generation facilities from the town's
electric system in the event of a fault on the town's electric system, a fault
on the customer's renewable generation facilities, or loss of a source or
sources on the town's electric system. The automatic disconnecting device
included in such control equipment shall not be capable of reclosing until
after service is restored on the town's electric system. Additionally, if the
fault is with the customer's renewable generation facilities, such automatic
disconnecting device shall not be reclosed until after the fault is isolated
from the customer's renewable generation facilities.
   (F)   Upon reasonable advance notice to the customer, Pendleton Electric
shall have access to any interconnected renewable generation facilities to
perform on-site inspections to verify that the installation and operation of
the renewable generation facilities comply with the requirements of this
Ordinance and to verify the proper installation and continuing safe operation
of the renewable generation facilities. Pendleton Electric shall also have at
all times immediate access to breakers or any other equipment that will isolate
the renewable generation facilities from the town's electric system. Pendleton
Electric shall not be responsible for any costs the customer may incur as a
result of such inspection(s). Pendleton Electric shall have the right and
authority to isolate approved interconnected renewable generation facilities at
Pendleton Electric's sole discretion if Pendleton Electric believes that:
      (1)   Continued interconnection and parallel operation of the renewable
generation facilities with the town's electric system creates or contributes
(or will create or contribute) to a system emergency on either Pendleton
Electric's or the customer's electric facilities;
      (2)   The renewable generation facilities are not in compliance with the
requirements of this section; or
      (3)   The renewable generation facilities interfere with the operation of
the town's electric system. In non-emergency situations, Pendleton Electric
shall give the customer reasonable notice prior to isolating the renewable
generation facilities.
   (G)   Customer shall procure and keep in force during all periods of
parallel operation of the renewable generation facilities with the town's
electric system, homeowners, commercial, or other insurance to protect the
interests of Pendleton Electric as a named insured, with insurance carriers
acceptable to Pendleton Electric, and in amounts not less than those reasonably
determined by Pendleton Electric to be necessary taking into consideration the
nameplate capacity, configuration and type of the renewable generation
facilities. The customer shall indemnify and hold harmless Pendleton Electric,
the Town of Pendleton, its employees, representatives, agents and
subcontractors from and against all claims, liability, damages and expenses,
including attorney's fees, based on any injury to any person, including the
loss of life, or damage to any property, including the loss of use thereof,
arising out of, resulting from, or connected with, or that may be alleged to
have arisen out of, resulted from, or connected with, an act or omission by the
customer, its employees, agents, representatives, successors or assigns in the
construction, ownership, operation or maintenance of the customer's renewable
generation facilities. If Pendleton Electric is required to bring an action to
enforce its rights under this section, either as a separate action or in
connection with another action, and said rights are upheld, the customer shall
reimburse Pendleton Electric for all expenses, including attorney's fees,
incurred in connection with such action.
   (H)   It shall be unlawful for any person or entity to connect or maintain
the connection of a renewable generating facility to the town's electric grid
without obtaining Pendleton Electric's approval of an interconnection
application. Any person or entity found to be in violation of this section
shall be fined not less than $500, nor more than $2,500 for each such
violation, plus costs. In addition to the foregoing fines and at Pendleton
Electric's sole discretion, property where a renewable generating facility is
unlawfully connected to the town's electric grid may be disconnected from the
town's electric grid until an interconnection application is approved. Every
day that a violation of this section occurs shall constitute a separate
offense.
   (I)   Pendleton Electric is hereby authorized to charge a non-refundable
application fee of $150 which may be amended from time to time by the Town
Council to offset costs involved with reviewing the application, inspecting the
renewable generation facilities, and otherwise ensuring compliance with this
section.

GENERAL INFORMATION
§ 53.001 AUTHORITY AND TITLE.
   (A)   This chapter is adopted in accordance with statutory authority granted
to the town under “Home Rule” and further is required by Phase II of the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Stormwater program (40 CFR
Parts 9, 122, 123, and 124; December 8, 1999) authorized by the 1987 amendments
to the Clean Water Act, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management’s
(IDEM) Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) General Permit (MS4 GP), and
the Indiana Department of Environmental Management’s Construction Stormwater
General Permit (CSGP). Based on this authority and these requirements, this
chapter regulates:
      (1)   Discharges of prohibited non-stormwater flows into the storm drain
system.
      (2)   Stormwater drainage improvements related to development of lands
located within the corporate boundaries of the town.
      (3)   Drainage control systems installed during new construction and
grading of lots and other parcels of land.
      (4)   Stormwater, including stormwater runoff, snowmelt runoff, and
surface runoff and drainage, associated with construction activity.
      (5)   Stormwater discharges from construction support activities directly
related to construction sites subject to this chapter.
      (6)   Erosion and sediment control systems installed during new
construction and grading of lots and other parcels of land.
      (7)   The design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater drainage
facilities and systems.
      (8)   The design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater quality
facilities and systems.
      (9)   The design, construction, and maintenance of new dams.
      (10)   The development downstream of existing dams.
      (11)   Development within floodplains, floodways, fluvial erosion hazard
corridors, and bluff zones.
   (B)   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Town of Pendleton
Stormwater Management Ordinance.” This chapter will supersede any conflicting
ordinances previously adopted by the town.
(Ord. 23-36, passed 11-8-23)
§ 53.002 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   This chapter shall regulate all development and redevelopment
occurring within the town. No building permit shall be issued and no land
disturbance started for any construction in a development, as defined in §
53.005, until the plans required by this chapter for such construction have
been accepted in writing by the town. With the exception of the requirements of
§§ 53.020 through 53.026 and §
53.093, single-family dwelling houses and duplexes in accepted subdivisions,
and land-disturbing activities affecting less than 10,000 square feet of area
shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter. Also exempt from this
chapter shall be agricultural land-disturbing activities.
   (B)   In addition to the requirements of this chapter and its companion
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, compliance with all applicable
ordinances of the town as well as with applicable federal, State of Indiana,
and other local statues and regulations shall also be required. Unless
otherwise stated, all other specifications referred to in this chapter shall be
the most recent edition available. Town capital improvement projects shall be
exempt from obtaining a permit, but are expected to meet all applicable
technical requirements of this chapter and the town’s Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual. If the project site is located within a Madison County
Regulated Drain Watershed, the applicant will need to check with the Madison
County Surveyor’s Office to learn if additional Surveyor’s Office requirements
specific to that regulated drain would apply to the site. In case there are
conflicts between the requirements contained in this chapter and applicable
requirements contained in other regulatory documents referenced above, the most
restrictive shall prevail.
   (C)   Any construction project which has had its final drainage plan
accepted by the town within a two-year period prior to the effective date of
this chapter shall be exempt from all requirements of this chapter that are in
excess of the requirements of ordinances in effect at the time of acceptance.
Such an exemption is not applicable to the requirements detailed in §§ 53.020
through 53.026.
   (D)   The town has the authority to modify, grant exemptions, and/or waive
any and all the requirements of this chapter and its associated technical
standards document. A pre-submittal meeting with the town may be requested by
the applicant to discuss the applicability of various provisions of this
chapter and its associated technical standards document with regards to unique
or unusual circumstances relating to a project. However, any initial
determination of such applicability shall not be binding on future
determinations of the town that may be based on the review of more detailed
information and plans.
(Ord. 23-36, passed 11-8-23)
§ 53.003 FINDINGS.
   The town finds that:
   (A)   Water bodies, roadways, structures, and other property within the town
or its planning jurisdiction boundary are at times subjected to flooding;
   (B)   Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is
also a danger to the natural resources of the region;
   (C)   Land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds,
resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, increased flooding,
increased stream channel erosion, and increased sediment transport and
deposition;
   (D)   Soil erosion resulting from land-disturbing activities causes a
significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to be transported off-site
and deposited in ditches, streams, wetlands, lakes, and reservoirs;
   (E)   Increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments and
pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects
within the town will, absent reasonable regulation and control, adversely
affect the town’s water bodies and water resources;
   (F)   Pollutant contributions from illicit discharges within the town will,
absent reasonable regulation, monitoring, and enforcement, adversely affect the
town’s water bodies and water resources;
   (G)   Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, non-point source pollution, and
illicit sources of pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation
of stormwater management;
   (H)   Adopting the standards, criteria, and procedures contained and
referenced in this chapter and implementing the same will address many of the
deleterious effects of stormwater runoff and illicit discharges;
   (I)   Adopting this chapter is necessary for the preservation of the public
health, safety, and welfare, for the conservation of natural resources, and for
compliance with state and federal regulations.
(Ord. 23-36, passed 11-8-23)
§ 53.004 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the town through the regulation of
stormwater and non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system and to
protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land and water
resources within the town. This chapter establishes methods for managing the
quantity and quality of stormwater entering into the storm drain system. The
objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To reduce the hazard to public health and safety caused by excessive
stormwater runoff.
   (B)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain system
from construction site runoff.
   (C)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain system
from runoff from new development and re-development.
   (D)   To prohibit illicit discharges into the storm drain system.
   (E)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, monitoring,
and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.
(Ord. 23-36, passed 11-8-23)

may or may not be subsequently removed by surface runoff.
      “EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL.” A practice, or a combination of
practices, to minimize sedimentation by first reducing or eliminating erosion
at the source and then as necessary, trapping sediment to prevent it from being
discharged from or within a project site.
      “FILTER STRIP.” Usually a long, relatively narrow area (usually, 20 to 75

water from any natural source. The “FLOODPLAIN” includes both the floodway and
the floodway fringe districts.
      “FLOODWAY.” The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
      “FLOODWAY FRINGE.” That portion of the floodplain lying outside the
floodway, which is inundated by the regulatory flood.
      “FLUVIAL EROSION HAZARD (FEH) CORRIDOR.” Represents the areas along the
streams (including the channel and immediate overbanks areas) that are believed
to be subject to stream movement or streambank erosion. These corridors have
been delineated for most actively migrating and relatively stationary streams
in the state through an Indiana Silver Jackets initiative.
      “FOOTING DRAIN.” A drain pipe installed around the exterior of a basement
wall foundation to relieve water pressure caused by high groundwater elevation.
      “GARBAGE.” All putrescible animal solid, vegetable solid, and semisolid
wastes resulting from the processing, handling, preparation, cooking, serving,
or consumption of food or food materials.
      “GASOLINE OUTLET.” An operating gasoline or diesel fueling facility whose

§ 53.026 INSPECTIONS AND MONITORING.
   (A)   Storm drainage system. The town has the authority to periodically
inspect the portion of the storm drainage system under the town’s control, in
an effort to detect and eliminate illicit connections and discharges into the
system. This inspection will include a screening of discharges from outfalls
connected to the system in order to determine if prohibited flows are being
conveyed into the storm drainage system. It could also include spot testing of
waters contained in the storm drainage system itself to detect the introduction
of pollutants into the system by means other than a defined outfall, such as
dumping or contaminated sheet runoff.
   (B)   Potential polluters. If, as a result of the storm drainage system
inspection, a discharger is suspected of an illicit discharge, the town may
inspect and/or obtain stormwater samples from stormwater runoff facilities of
the subject discharger, to determine compliance with the requirements of this
chapter. Upon request, the discharger shall allow the town’s properly
identified representative to enter upon the premises of the discharger at all
hours necessary for the purposes of such inspection or sampling. The town or
its properly identified representative may place on the discharger’s property
the equipment or devices used for such sampling or inspection. Identified
illicit connections or discharges shall be subject to enforcement action as
described in §§
53.110 through
53.113 and §
53.999.
   (C)   New development and re-development. Following the final completion of
construction and the receipt of as-built drawings by the town, the town has the
authority to inspect new development and re-development sites to verify that
all on-site stormwater conveyances and connections to the storm drainage system
are in compliance with this subchapter.

STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT
§ 53.040 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   The storage and controlled release of excess stormwater runoff shall be
required for all new business, institutional developments, commercial and
industrial developments, residential subdivisions, planned development, rural
estate subdivisions, and any redevelopment or other new construction located
within the town. The town, after thorough investigation and evaluation, may
waive the requirement of controlled runoff for minor subdivisions and
parcelization. Additional potential exemptions regarding the detention
requirements are provided under § 53.041.
(Ord. 23-36, passed 11-8-23)
§ 53.041 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that most streams and drainage channels serving the
town do not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey stormwater runoff
resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, the storage and controlled
release of excess stormwater runoff as well as compensation for loss of
floodplain storage shall be required for all developments and redevelopments
(as defined § 53.005) located within the town. Release rate requirements,
downstream restriction considerations, acceptable outlet, adjoining property
impact considerations, policy on dams and levees, policy on fluvial erosion
hazard corridors, and compensatory floodplain storage rates are detailed in the
town’s Stormwater Technical Standards.
   (B)   Due to unknowns regarding the future development patterns and the
associated proposed stormwater quantity management systems within a watershed,
it is the policy of the town to discourage direct release of runoff from a new
development or redevelopment without providing detention. However, in rare
circumstances, where a comprehensive watershed-wide hydrologic study or
watershed plan of a major stream (not a “beat the peak” analysis) adopted by
the town substantiates the benefits of (or allows for) direct release for a
proposed development located adjacent to a major stream, the detention
requirements set in this chapter may be waived. Other special circumstances
when such a waiver may be considered by town include situations where the
design of a regional pond has already taken into account the provision of
direct release in certain areas in the watershed.
(Ord. 23-36, passed 11-8-23)
§ 53.042 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of all
stormwater facilities shall meet the design criteria, standards, and
specifications outlined in the town’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
The methods and procedures in the Stormwater Technical Standards Manual are
consistent with the policy stated above.
(Ord. 23-36, passed 11-8-23)
§ 53.043 DRAINAGE EASEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All stormwater systems, including detention or retention basins,
conveyance systems, structures and appurtenances, located outside of the right-
of-way shall be placed within a drainage easement. There shall be no trees or
shrubs planted, nor any structures or fences erected in any drainage easement,
unless otherwise accepted by the town. Additional easement requirements along
stormwater conveyance systems are contained in the town’s Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual. All drainage improvements performed relative to the
conveyance of stormwater runoff and the perpetual maintenance thereof, within
the latter easements, shall be the responsibility of the owner or homeowner
association.
   (B)   Any outlet to, crossing, and/or encroachment of a county regulated
drainage easement requires application and acceptance from the County Drainage
Board in accordance with the Indiana Drainage Code.

the commencement of construction activities, the town has the authority to
conduct inspections of the work being done to ensure full compliance with the
provisions of this subchapter, the Stormwater Technical Standards Manual,
Design and Construction Standards, and the terms and conditions of the approved
permit.
   (B)   The town also has the authority to perform long-term, post-
construction inspection of all public or privately owned stormwater quantity
facilities. The inspection will cover physical conditions, available storage
capacity, and the operational condition of key facility elements. Stormwater
quantity facilities shall be maintained in good condition, in accordance with
the designed and approved performance specifications for the facilities, in
addition to any prescribed operation and maintenance procedures, and shall not
be subsequently altered, revised or replaced except as approved by the town. If
deficiencies are found during the inspection, the owner of the facility will be
notified by the town and will be required to take all necessary measures to
correct such deficiencies. If the owner fails to correct the deficiencies
within the allowed time period, as specified in the notification letter, the
town will undertake the work and collect from the owner using lien rights if
necessary.
   (C)   Assignment of responsibility for maintaining facilities serving more
than one lot or holding shall be documented by appropriate covenants to
property deeds, unless responsibility is formally accepted by a public body,
and determined before the final stormwater permit is approved.
   (D)   Stormwater conveyance facilities may be donated to the town or other
unit of government designated by the town, for ownership and permanent
maintenance providing the town or other governmental unit is willing to accept
responsibility.

STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION FOR CONSTRUCTION SITES
§ 53.060 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   The town will require a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP),
which includes erosion and sediment control measures and materials handling
procedures, to be submitted as part of a project’s construction plans and
specifications. Any project located within the corporate boundaries of the town
that includes clearing, grading, excavation or other land disturbing activities
resulting in the disturbance of 10,000 square feet or more of total land area
is subject to the requirements of this subchapter. This includes both new
development and re-development. This subchapter also applies to disturbances of
land that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger
common plan will ultimately disturb 10,000 square feet or more of total land
area. Section
53.062 provides guidelines for calculating land disturbance. Projects meeting
the coverage requirements of IDEM’s CSGP shall also be in compliance with the
requirements contained in that permit.
   (B)   The requirements under this subchapter do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion and sediment control
measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10.
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under IC 14-34.
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under
329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the
expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or
outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
   (C)   For an individual lot where land disturbance is expected to be one
acre or more, the individual lot owner must complete their own notice of intent
letter, apply for a stormwater permit from the town, and ensure that a
sufficient construction and stormwater pollution prevention plan is completed
and submitted in accordance with §§ 53.090 through 53.099, regardless of
whether the individual lot is part of a larger permitted project site. For an
individual lot where land disturbance is 10,000 square feet or more but less
than one acre, an individual lot plot plan permit application is required prior
to receiving a building permit. Details of the permitting process are contained
in §§
53.090 through
53.099.
   (D)   An individual lot located within a larger permitted project site, is
considered part of the larger permitted project site, and the individual lot
operator must comply with the terms and conditions of the stormwater permit
approved for the larger project site. The stormwater permit application for the
larger project site must include detailed erosion and sediment control measures
for individual lots. In addition, the builders of these individual lots are
required to submit individual lot plot plan permit application along with a
SWPPP for that individual lot prior to receiving a building permit. Details of
the permitting process for individual lots and parcels are contained in §§
53.090 through
53.099 and additional requirements for individual lots may be found in the
town’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (E)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan is
completed and submitted to the town in accordance with §§
53.090 through
53.099. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure
compliance with this chapter during the
construction activity and implementation of the construction plan, and to
notify the town upon completion of the project and stabilization of the site,
requesting a termination inspection to be performed by the town. However, all
persons engaging in construction and land disturbing activities on a permitted
project site meeting the applicability requirements must comply with the
requirements of this subchapter and this chapter.

§ 53.061 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   In calculating the total area of land disturbance, for the purposes of
determining applicability of this subchapter to a project, the following
guidelines should be used:
      (1)   Off-site construction activities that provide services (for
example, road extensions, sewer, water, offsite stockpiles, and other
utilities) to a land disturbing project site, must be considered as a part of
the total land disturbance calculation for the project site, when the activity
is under the control of the project site owner.
      (2)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by this
subchapter, the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the
total area of land disturbance for improvements, such as, roads, utilities, or
common areas, and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as
determined by the following:
         (a)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
one-half acre or more, one-half acre of land disturbance must be used as the
expected lot disturbance.
         (b)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
less than one-half acre in size, the total lot must be calculated as being
disturbed.
         (c)   To calculate lot disturbance on all other types of project
sites, such as industrial and commercial projects project sites, a minimum of
one acre of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance,
unless the lots are less than one acre in size, in which case the total lot
must be calculated as being disturbed.
   (B)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction sites shall meet
the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the Indiana
Stormwater Quality Manual, the town’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual,
and the product guidance/specifications of the manufacturer. The methods and
procedures included in these two references are in keeping with the above
stated policy and meet the requirements of the IDEM’s CSGP. A copy of the
Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual may be obtained online through IDEM.

53.060 through
53.063, the stormwater pollution prevention plan, which is to be submitted to
the town as part of the Stormwater Management Permit application, must also
include post-construction stormwater quality measures. These measures are
incorporated as a permanent feature into the site plan and are left in place
following completion of construction activities to continuously treat
stormwater runoff from the stabilized site. Any project located within the
corporate boundaries of the town that includes clearing, grading, excavation,
and other land disturbing activities, resulting in the disturbance of 10,000
square feet or more of total land area is subject to the requirements of this
subchapter. This includes both new development and re-development, and
disturbances of land less than 10,000 square feet of total land area that are
part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan
will ultimately disturb 10,000 square feet or more of total land area. In
addition, regardless of the amount of disturbance, the town reserves the right
to require pre-treatment BMPs for proposed hot spot developments in accordance
with provisions contained in the town’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (B)   The requirements under this subchapter do not apply to the following
activities:
      (1)   Construction activities associated with a single-family residential
dwelling disturbing less than one acre, when the dwelling is not part of a
larger common plan of development or sale; or individual building lots within a
larger permitted project.
   (C)   The requirements under this subchapter do not apply to the following

§ 53.076 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to undeveloped
areas, generally have increased imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates,
increased runoff rates, and increased concentrations of pollutants such as
fertilizers, herbicides, greases, oil, salts and other pollutants. As new
development and redevelopment continues within the corporate boundaries of the
town, measures must be taken to intercept and filter pollutants from stormwater
runoff prior to reaching regional creeks, streams, and rivers. Through the use
of appropriate best management practices (BMPs), to treat the water quality
volume (WQv) or the water quality flow (Qwq) stormwater runoff will be filtered
and harmful amounts of sediment, nutrients, and contaminants will be removed.
   (B)   It is also recognized that another major source of pollution in many
Indiana streams, including those within the corporate boundaries of the town,
is the streambank erosion associated with urbanizing watersheds. Stream
channels develop their shape in response to the volume and rate of runoff that
they receive from their contributing watersheds. Research has shown that in
hydrologically stable watersheds, the stream flow responsible for most of the
shaping of the channel (called the bankfull flow) occurs between every one to
two years. When land is developed, the volume and rate of runoff from that land
increases for these comparatively small flooding events that are not normally
addressed by the detention practices and the stream channel will adapt by
changing its shape. As the stream channel works to reach a new stable shape,
excess erosion occurs. As new development
and re-development continues within the corporate boundaries of the town,
measures must be taken to minimize the impact of such development or re-
development on streambank erosion. Through the use of appropriate best
management practices (BMPs) to retain and/or detain and slowly release the
channel protection volume (CPv), the volume and rate of runoff for channel
forming flows will be reduced in an attempt to minimize increased streambank
erosion in the receiving streams and channels.
   (C)   The project site owner must submit to the town a stormwater pollution
prevention plan (SWPPP) that shows placement of appropriate BMP(s) from a pre-
approved list of BMPs specified in the town’s Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual. The SWPPP submittal shall include an Operation and Maintenance Manual
for all post-construction BMP(s) included in the project and a notarized
Maintenance Agreement, consistent with the sample agreement provided in the
town’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, providing for the long-term
maintenance of those BMPs, both of which shall be recorded with the deed for
the property on which the project is located. The noted BMP(s) must be
designed, constructed, and maintained according to guidelines provided or
referenced in the town’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. Practices other
than those specified in the pre-approved list may be utilized. However, the
burden of proof, as to whether the performance and ease of maintenance of such
practices will be according to guidelines provided in the town’s Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual, would be placed with the applicant. Details
regarding the procedures and criteria for consideration of acceptance of such
BMPs are provided in the town’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (D)   Gasoline outlets and refueling areas must install appropriate
practices (as noted under “Hot Spots” provision in the Technical Standards) to
reduce lead, copper, zinc, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in stormwater runoff.
These requirements will apply to all new facilities and existing facilities
that replace their tanks, regardless of the size of the facility.
   (E)   Discharges from new development and redevelopment sites will not be
allowed directly into karst features without pre-treatment.

      (2)   After the town’s receipt of the application, the applicant will be
notified as to whether their application was complete or insufficient. The
applicant will be asked for additional information if the application is
insufficient. If the application is complete, it will be reviewed in detail by
the town and/or its plan review consultant(s). Once all comments have been
received and review completed, the town will either approve the project,
request modifications or deny the project. If the applicant does not agree with
or accept the review findings and wishes to seek an appeal, the town will place
the project on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Town
Council provided the agenda for the meeting has not yet been advertised or
published. If time for notification does not allow, the project shall be placed
on the following regularly scheduled meeting of the Town Council. If the
project must go through a scheduled meeting, the town will furnish the
applicant a complete list of comments and objections to the plans and
accompanying data prior to the scheduled meeting. After the scheduled meeting,
the town will either issue a permit, request modifications to the construction
plans, or deny the project.
      (3)   The project site owner must notify the town and IDEM before
beginning construction. Notification to the town shall be in the form of an
email while the notification to IDEM shall be in the form of an online IDEM NOI
submittal. Once a permit has been issued and the pending construction
notifications submitted to the town and IDEM before the beginning of
construction, construction may commence. Once construction starts, the project
owner shall monitor construction activities and inspect all stormwater
pollution prevention measures in compliance with this chapter and the terms and
conditions of the approved permit. Upon completion of construction activities,
a certification of completion and compliance and as-built plans must be
submitted to the town. Once the construction site has been stabilized and all
temporary erosion and sediment control measures have been removed, a
notification shall be sent to the town, requesting a termination inspection.
The town, or its representative, shall inspect the construction site to verify
that the completed project is fully stabilized and meets the requirements of
this chapter and its Technical Standards and that the terms and conditions of
the permit. Once the applicant receives a signed copy of the termination
inspection checklist confirming compliance, they must forward a copy to IDEM
along with the required IDEM NOI form. Permits issued by the town under this
scenario will expire five years from the date of issuance. If
construction is not completed within five years, an updated permit application
must be submitted to the town and an updated NOI must be resubmitted to IDEM at
least 90 days prior to expiration.
   (B)   (1)   SWPPP review time limits. Pursuant to IC 13-18-27, an MS4-
designated entity or other review authority such as SWCD must make a
preliminary determination as to whether the construction plan associated with
SWPPP is substantially complete before the end of the tenth working day (for
sites with less than five acres of land disturbance) after the day on which the
SWPPP is submitted to the review authority or the fourteenth working day (for
sites with five acres or larger of land disturbance) after the day on which the
SWPPP is submitted to the review authority. Depending on the outcome of the
SWPPP review, the following scenarios may play out:
         (a)   No SWPPP review notification received. If the review authority
does not notify the applicant of its preliminary determination as to whether
the construction plan is substantially complete within either ten or 14 days as
noted above, the project site owner may submit a notice of intent letter to
IDEM including the information required by IDEM, or this chapter and the town’s
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and 48 hours after the NOI is submitted
to IDEM, may begin the construction project, including the land disturbing
activities of the construction project.
         (b)   SWPPP not substantially complete. If the review authority
notifies the applicant that the construction plan is not substantially
complete, the project site owner may not submit a notice of intent letter to
IDEM until the review authority makes a conclusive favorable determination
concerning the construction plan under the IDEM rule/permit, or this chapter
and the town’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
         (c)   Unfavorable SWPPP. If the review authority notifies the
applicant that the construction plan is substantially complete; and makes a
conclusive unfavorable determination concerning the construction plan under
IDEM rule/permit, or this chapter and the town’s Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual, the project site owner may not submit a notice of intent letter to
IDEM.
         (d)   Preliminary SWPPP review. If the review authority notifies the
applicant that the construction plan is substantially complete and a
preliminary review has been completed, the project site owner may submit a
notice of intent letter to IDEM including the information required by IDEM, or
this chapter and the town’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and 48 hours
after the NOI is submitted to IDEM, may begin the construction project,
including the land disturbing activities of the construction project. The plan
review authority reserves the right to perform a comprehensive review at a
later date, and revisions may be required at that time.
         (e)   Conditional SWPPP review. If the review authority notifies the
applicant that the construction plan is substantially complete and a
conditional review has been completed, the project site owner may submit a
notice of intent letter to IDEM including the information required by IDEM, or
this chapter and the town’s Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual, and 48 hours after the NOI is submitted to IDEM,
may begin the construction project, including the land disturbing activities of
the construction project provided that the requirements included in the
conditional review are fulfilled.
         (f)   Favorable SWPPP review. If the review authority notifies the
applicant that the construction plan is substantially complete and a
preliminary review has been completed, the project site owner may submit a
notice of intent letter to IDEM including the information required by IDEM, or
this chapter and the town’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and 48 hours
after the NOI is submitted to IDEM, may begin the construction project,
including the land disturbing activities of the construction project.
      (2)   Note that the above time limits only apply to the SWPPP portion of
the overall stormwater permit submittal and does not affect any official or
non-official permit review timelines set by the entity for other aspects of the
stormwater permit application.

§ 53.096 REQUIRED ASSURANCES.
   This section shall apply to all projects whether the stormwater management
system or portions thereof will be dedicated to the town or retained privately.
As a condition of approval and issuance of the permit, the town shall require
the applicant to provide assurance in form of an irrevocable letter of credit
or a bond when the stormwater management plan has been accepted and before
construction begins. The assurance will guarantee a good faith execution of the
stormwater drainage plan, the stormwater pollution prevention plan, the
stormwater quality management plan, and any permit conditions. The assurance
shall be for an amount equal to 125% of the total costs of all stormwater
management measures for the entire project. The above-mentioned costs shall be
based on an estimate as prepared by a registered engineer or land surveyor. The
costs shall be for the installation and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of
erosion control measures and the construction and ongoing monitoring and
maintenance of storm drainage infrastructure, detention/retention facilities,
and stormwater quality BMPs, as regulated under this chapter, until the
construction is completed, the site is stabilized, and as-built plans are
accepted by the town. Assurances shall be for a minimum of $5,000. All other
performance bonds, maintenance bonds or other assurances required by the town
in accordance with any and all other ordinances shall also apply and so be
required. Local governmental jurisdictions may require additional performance
and/or maintenance assurances. The intent of this assurance is not only to
complete the installation of storm drain infrastructure for the project, but
also to assure that adequate stormwater pollution prevention measures are
properly installed and maintained. If adequate assurances are set aside by the
project site owner for the overall project, proof of total assurance can be
submitted in place of an individual stormwater assurance.

53.999
§ 53.097 TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PERMITS.
   (A)   In granting a stormwater management permit, the town may impose such
terms and conditions as are reasonably necessary to meet the purposes of this
chapter. The project site owner shall ensure compliance with such terms and
conditions. Non-compliance with the terms and conditions of permits will be
subject to enforcement as described in §§
53.110 through
53.113 and §
53.999.
   (B)   The project site owner shall inform all general contractor,
construction management firms, grading or excavating contractors, utility
contractors, and the contractors that have primary oversight on individual
building lots of the terms and conditions of the stormwater management permit
and the schedule for proposed implementation.
   (C)   In the event that a project site is determined to impact or discharge
to a sensitive area or is located in an impact drainage area, the town may
require more stringent stormwater quantity and quality measures than detailed
in this chapter or in the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual.
      (1)   Determination of sensitive areas. Sensitive areas include highly
erodible soils, wetlands, karst areas, threatened or endangered species
habitat, outstanding waters, impaired waters, recreational waters, and surface
drinking water sources. Any discharge from a stormwater practice that is a
Class V injection well shall meet the state groundwater quality standards and
registered with the U.S. EPA as required by the IDEM. If wetlands are suspected
on a site, a wetland delineation should be completed in accordance with the
methodology established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE). The need for
the applicant to check for the presence of threatened or endangered species
habitat will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Special terms and
conditions for development determined to impact or discharge to any sensitive
area shall be included in the stormwater management permit.
      (2)   Determination of impact drainage areas.
         (a)   The following areas shall be designated as impact drainage
areas, unless good reason for not including them is presented to the town.
            1.   A floodway or floodplain as designated by the most updated
FEMA Code dealing with floodplain regulation and/or by the best available data
through IDNR.
            2.   Land within 25 feet of each bank of any ditch within the
town’s system.
            3.   Land within 15 feet of the centerline of any stormwater
infrastructure or enclosed conduit within the town’s system.
            4.   Land within 75 feet of each bank of a county open regulated
drain.
            5.   Land within 50 feet of a natural drainageway.
            6.   Land within 75 feet of the centerline of any tiled regulated
drain.
            7.   Land within the fluvial erosion hazard (FEH) corridor.
            8.   Land within the expected breach inundation zone of an existing
or proposed new dam, and areas protected from flooding by a levee.
         (b)   The town or Town Engineer is authorized, but is not required, to
classify certain geographical areas as impact drainage areas. In determining
impact drainage areas, the town may consider such factors as topography, soil
type, capacity of existing drains, and distance from adequate drainage
facility.
         (c)   Land that does not have an adequate outlet, taking into
consideration the capacity and depth of the outlet, may be designated as an
impact drainage area by the town. Special terms and conditions for development
within any impact drainage area shall be included in the stormwater management
permit.
      (3)   Determination of designated drainage areas served by regional
facilities. The town is authorized, but is not required, to classify certain
geographical areas as designated drainage areas that are or will be served by
regional facilities, such as a regional pond. In such cases, an infrastructure
development fee (IDF) rate may be established for the designated drainage area.
The basis for determining such a fee for a proposed development or re-
development within a designated drainage area will be as detailed in the town’s
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.

§ 53.098 CERTIFICATION OF AS-BUILT PLANS.
   This section shall apply to all projects whether the stormwater management
system or portions thereof will be dedicated to the town or retained privately.
After completion of construction of the project and before the release of
required performance assurances referenced in §
53.096 above, a professionally prepared and certified “as-built” set of plans
(record drawings) shall be submitted to the town for review. These as-built
plans/record drawings must be prepared and certified by the engineer of record,
i.e., the company/engineer who originally prepared the construction plans.
Additionally, a digital copy of the
“as-built” plans (record drawings) as well as finalized digital versions of all
analyses, models, manuals, and reports that are consistent with the as-built
conditions is required in a format acceptable to the town. These plans shall
include all pertinent data relevant to the completed storm drainage system and
stormwater management facilities, and shall include:
   (A)   Pipe size and pipe material;
   (B)   Invert elevations;
   (C)   Top rim elevations;
   (D)   Elevation of the emergency overflow (spillway) for ponds;

§ 53.099 POST-PROJECT MAINTENANCE BOND AND VERIFICATIONS.
   (A)   In addition to as-built plans and the certification of completion and
compliance, following the release of performance assurances, the property
owner, developer, or contractor shall be required to file a two-year
maintenance bond or other acceptable guarantee with the town in an amount not
to exceed 25% of the cost of the stormwater management system located outside
the public road rights-of-way, and in a form satisfactory to the town in order
to assure that such stormwater system installation was done according to
standards of good workmanship, that the materials used in the construction and
installation were of good quality and construction, and that such project was
done in accordance with the accepted plans, and this chapter and that any off-
site drainage problems that may arise, whether upstream or downstream of such
project, will be corrected if such drainage problems are determined by the town
to have been caused by the development of such project. The bond or other
acceptable guarantee shall be in effect for a period of two years after the
date of the release of required performance assurances referenced in §
53.096. The beneficiary of all maintenance bonds shall be the Town Council.
   (B)   To verify that all stormwater infrastructure is functioning properly,
visual recordings (via closed circuit television) of such infrastructure,
including all subsurface drains, shall be required twice, once following the
completion of installation of the stormwater management system and submittal of
as-builts, and the second time before release of maintenance bonds. These
visual recordings will be scheduled by the town and paid for by the developer.
Notices shall be provided to the town within 72 hours following the completion
of installation and again at least 60 days prior to the expiration date of the
maintenance bond so that the noted recordings may be scheduled. Reports
summarizing the results of the noted visual recordings shall be reviewed and
accepted by the town of Pendleton before the plat is recommended for recording
and again before the maintenance bond shall be recommended to be released.
   (C)   Additional requirements for transfer of any applicable stormwater BMP
Maintenance Agreement, O&M Maintenance Manual, and Maintenance Escrow accounts
to subsequent owners prior to release of the maintenance bond is discussed §§
53.075 through
53.079.

COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 53.110 COMPLIANCE WITH THIS CHAPTER.
   To secure compliance with the requirements of this chapter, violations
thereof shall be subject to the enforcement provisions set forth under §§
53.111 and
53.999. Additionally, compliance with the requirements set forth in the local
zoning ordinances is also necessary. Compliance with all applicable ordinances
of the town as well as with applicable state statutes and regulations shall
also be required. Unless otherwise stated, all other specifications referred to
in this chapter shall be the most recent edition available.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      “COMPLIANCE.” The act of correcting a violation or violations within the
time frame specified by the town.
      “OFFENSE.” Both a violation and a failure of compliance on a particular
project constitute an “OFFENSE.” If there are multiple violations or multiple
failures of compliance on the same project, each shall be considered a separate
offense as further stated in §
53.111 (C).
      “VIOLATION.” Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of this
chapter, the requirements of an approved stormwater management design plan or
permit, and/or the requirements of a recorded stormwater maintenance agreement
may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this subchapter. Any such
action or inaction is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated by
injunctive or other equitable relief, in addition to and separate from the
imposition of any of the enforcement actions described below.
   (B)   Warning notice. When the town finds that any person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued
hereunder, the town may serve upon that person a written warning notice,
specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting
the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution
whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of
the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the alleged
violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of
the warning notice. Nothing in this division (B) shall limit the authority of
the town to take any action, including emergency action or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a warning notice.
(Ord. 23-36, passed 11-8-23)
§ 53.111 ENFORCEMENT OF THIS CHAPTER.
   (A)   Notice of violation/citation.
      (1)   If the town determines that an applicant or other responsible
person has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a permit, an
approved stormwater management design plan, a recorded stormwater management
maintenance agreement, or the provisions of this chapter, it shall issue a
written notice of violation to such applicant or other responsible person and
the owner of the property. Where a person is engaged in activity covered by
this chapter without having first secured a permit therefor, the notice of
violation shall be served on the owner or the responsible person in charge of
the activity being conducted on the site.
      (2)   The notice of violation can be in the form of a citation ticket
and/or a written letter that would contain detailed inspection findings,
conclusions of law, disposition of warning or fines assessed, stipulated
remedial actions as discussed with the responsible party representative,
reasonable deadlines for those remedial actions, and the date of re-inspection.
   (B)   Compensatory action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties,
and remedies authorized by this chapter, the town may impose upon a violator,
alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at
compliance workshops, creek cleanup, public education, and the like.
   (C)   Stop work order.
      (1)   In addition to the penalties listed above, if land disturbance
activities are conducted contrary to the provisions of this chapter or accepted
final stormwater management plans, the town may order the work stopped by
notice in writing served on any person engaged in the doing or causing of such
work to be done, and any such persons shall forthwith stop such work until
authorized by the town to proceed with the work. A stop work order will be
posted on the site by the town and it is unlawful for any person to remove the
notice or continue any work on the site without permission from the town. The
town may also undertake or cause to be undertaken, any necessary or advisable
protective measures to prevent violations of this chapter or to avoid or reduce
the effects of noncompliance herewith. The cost of any such protective measures
shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property upon which the work is
being done and the responsibility of any person carrying out or participating
in the work.
The town may bring an action under IC 34-28-5-1(b), to be read together with IC
34-6-2-86(1)(B) and 13-21-3-12(a)(4), to enforce a stop work order against any
person who neglects or fails to comply with a stop work order.
      (2)   For construction projects that are operating under a SWPPP approved
by the town, if a stop work order is issued on the grounds that the erosion and
sediment control measures included in the construction plan are not adequate,
the project site owner must be notified in writing of the inadequacies in the
erosion and sediment control measures and the project site owner has 72 hours
after receiving written notice to resolve the identified inadequacies before
the stop work order can take effect.
      (3)   The 72-hour period to resolve identified inadequacies on a
construction project does not apply if the stop work order is issued to a
construction project where the project site owner is creating a public health
hazard or safety hazard.
   (D)   Withhold certificate of occupancy. The town may refuse to issue a
certificate of occupancy for the building or other improvements constructed or
being constructed on the site until the applicant or other responsible person
has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has
otherwise satisfied the requirements of this chapter as determined by the town.
   (E)   Suspension, revocation, or modification of permits. The town may
suspend, revoke, or modify any existing permit that the violator may also have
been previously granted. A suspended, revoked, or modified permit may be
reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the
remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured
the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated upon
such conditions as the town may deem necessary to enable the applicant or other
responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such
violations.
   (F)   Suspension of access to the stormwater drainage system.
      (1)   Emergency cease and desist orders.
         (a)   When the town finds that any person has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or
that the person’s past violations are likely to recur, and that the person’s
violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened
discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to
present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or to the environment, the town may issue an order to the violator
directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing
the violator to immediately comply with all chapter requirements and take such
appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing
or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or
terminating the discharge.
         (b)   Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under
this division (F) shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its
endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger’s failure to immediately
comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the town may commence court action
against such person under IC 34-28-5-1(b), to be read together with IC 34-6-2-
86(1)(B) and 13-21-3-12(a)(4), to enforce a stop work order.
         (c)   The town may allow the person to recommence its discharge when
it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the town that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated
against the discharger under this chapter. A person that is responsible, in
whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall
submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful
discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the town
within five days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency
cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the violator.
      (2)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The
town may, without prior notice, suspend stormwater drainage system discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
stormwater drainage system or waters of the state if the violator fails to
comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the town may take such
steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the stormwater
drainage system or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to persons.
      (3)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the stormwater drainage system in violation of this chapter may
have their stormwater drainage system access terminated if such termination
would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The town will notify a violator of
the proposed termination of its stormwater drainage system access. The violator
may petition the town for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an
offense if the person reinstates stormwater drainage system access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the town.
(Ord. 23-36, passed 11-8-23)
§ 53.112 COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION.
   (A)   In addition to any other remedies, should any owner fail to comply
with the provisions of this chapter, the town may, after giving notice and
opportunity for compliance, have the necessary work done, and the owner shall
be required to promptly reimburse the town for all costs of such work.
   (B)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the town from taking such other
lawful action as may be necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. All costs
connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. Costs
include, but are not limited to, repairs to the stormwater drainage system made
necessary by the violation, as well as those penalties levied by the EPA or
IDEM for violation of the town’s NPDES permit, administrative costs, attorney
fees, court costs, and other costs and expenses associated with the enforcement
of this chapter, including sampling and monitoring expenses.
   (C)   If the amount due for abatement of the violation is not paid within a
timely manner as determined by the decision of the town or by the expiration of
the time in which to file an appeal, the town may commence a court action to
recover the costs assessed under IC 34-28-5-1(b), to be read together with IC
34-6-2-86(1)(B) and 13-21-3-12(a)(4).
(Ord. 23-36, passed 11-8-23)
§ 53.113 APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeal of notice of violation. Any person to whom any provision of
this chapter has been applied may appeal in writing, not later than 30 days
after the action or decision being appealed from, to the Town Council the
action or decision whereby any such provision was so applied. Such appeal shall
identify the matter being appealed, and the basis for the appeal. The Town
Council shall consider the appeal and make a decision whereby it affirms,
rejects or modifies the action being appealed. In considering any such appeal,
the Town Council may consider the recommendations of the town staff and the
comments of other persons having knowledge of the matter. In considering any
such appeal, the Town Council may grant a variance from the terms of this
chapter to provide relief, in whole or in part, from the action being appealed,
but only upon finding that the following requirements are satisfied:
      (1)   The application of this chapter’s provisions being appealed will
present or cause practical difficulties for a development or development site;
provided, however, that practical difficulties shall not include the need for
the developer to incur additional reasonable expenses in order to comply with
this chapter; and
      (2)   The granting of the relief requested will not substantially prevent
the goals and purposes of this chapter, nor result in less effective management
of stormwater runoff.
      (3)   Any person who has appealed a violation to the Town Council may
appeal an adverse decision of the Board to the Madison County court within 60
days of the Boards order, all pursuant to IC 36-1-6-9(e) and (f).
   (B)   Enforcement measures after appeal. If the violation has not been
corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation,
or, in the event of an appeal, within five days of the decision of the Town
Council upholding the decision of the town, then representatives of the town
shall enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any
and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property,
including the commencing of a court action under IC 34-28-5-1(b),to be read
together with IC 34-6-2-86(1)(B) and 13-21-3-12(a)(4), to enforce the order of
the Town Council.
(Ord. 23-36, passed 11-8-23)
§ 53.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person who commits an offense under this chapter commits a civil
infraction subject to a fine not to exceed $2,500 for each offense, plus costs,
damages, and expenses. Each day such violation occurs or continues without a
compliance action that is satisfactory to the Town may be deemed a separate
offense and shall make the violator liable for the imposition of a fine for
each day. The rights and remedies provided for in this section are cumulative
and in addition to any other remedies provided by law. An admission or
determination of responsibility shall not exempt the offender from compliance
with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Any person who aids or abets a person in a violation of this chapter
shall be subject to the penalties provided in this section.
   (C)   The town has established an Enforcement Response Schedule as noted in
the table below that standardizes the approach that the town may, in its
discretion, employ in dealing with stormwater regulations offenses subject to
this chapter and the associated Technical Standards document. When so employed,
this Schedule shall apply separately to each offense in the following manner:
The first offense is the underlying violation itself, while the subsequent
offenses 2 thru 8 (as necessary) are failures of compliance.
OFFENSE # TYPE OF RESPONSE ANTICIPATED
OFFENSE #   TYPE OF RESPONSE ANTICIPATED
1st offense Verbal telephone notice, letter of violation or written warning and
            administrative penalty
2nd offense Letter of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit
3rd offense Letter of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit
4th offense Letter of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit
5th offense Agreed order, administrative penalty and/or site visit
6th offense Administrative order, administrative penalty and/or site visit
7th offense Compliance schedule, administrative penalty and/or site visit
8th offense Litigation and administrative penalty
 
   (D)   Likewise, in order to standardize the approach that the town may, in
its discretion, employ in the imposition of administrative penalties, the town
has established the following Schedule of Administrative Penalties. Again, the
penalty for the 1st offense would apply to the violation itself, while the
subsequent penalties 2 through 4 (as necessary) would apply to failures of
compliance. In its discretion, the town may impose penalties up to the amount
specified in this Schedule.
 
OFFENSE #   PENALTY
1st offense    $250
2nd offense    $500
3rd offense    $1,000
4th offense    $2,500

Zoning Appeals (BZA). This process is also the case for any lot that is not
occupied or leased, is considered abandoned, the owner is a nonresident of the

Department by cause of inability to make delivery thereof.
         (b)   In cases where public safety may be an issue, the Town Manager
may take immediate necessary action to prevent danger or to remove a dangerous
structure or condition, with the assistance of law enforcement as may be deemed
necessary or appropriate.
      (5)   Any directive for action to remedy the condition, under division
(C)(4) of this section, may be appealed by a responsible party to the BZA. One
responsible party who files a notice of appeal is a constructive request for
appeal on behalf of all responsible parties. An appeal may be procured by
submitting to the BZA, a written notice requesting appeal. The written notice
of appeal must:
         (a)   Identify the property and violation in question;
         (b)   Identify the responsible party by name, address, and telephone

date and place of a meeting at which a demolition order shall be considered.
      (2)   The owner must be given an opportunity to appear and be heard
before any demolition order can be made.
      (3)   The town must make application to a court for a declaration that a
property is dangerous and/or unsightly, and for an order specifying that the
condition be remedied by demolition.
      (4)   Efforts to remedy the violation by lesser means shall have been
exhausted or otherwise established as ineffective to remedy the violation.
   (E)   Failure to abate.
      (1)   If a responsible party of any lot or parcel of real estate shall
fail and/or refuse to remove or abate such violation(s) after receiving notice
for compliance, as provided in division (C) above, the Town Manager (or BZA if
the responsible party(ies) appeals the notice and the violation is upheld)
shall have the authority to cause the same to be removed or otherwise abated.
      (2)   Where the Town Manager or BZA does order a removal or abatement,
the town by its officers, employees, contractors, or agents may enter on the
property and effect the removal or clearance at the expense of the owner of
record of the property. The cost of the removal is due and payable immediately.
      (3)   When the town has effected the removal or abatement of the
violation, the Town Manager shall prepare a written and itemized statement
showing the actual cost of the work performed and the same shall be billed to
the property owner of record. The cost of the work shall include all
administrative costs, including but not limited to providing notice and
attorneys’ fees, incurred by the town in regards to such violation(s) and shall
be payable at the time of receiving statement of costs.
      (4)   When the full amount due is not paid by the owner within 30 days
after the receipt of the billing statement the Town Manager shall cause to be
recorded in the County Recorder’s Office a sworn statement showing the cost and
expense incurred for the work, the date the work was done, and the location of
the property on which the work was done.
         (a)   The recordation of such sworn statement shall constitute a lien
and privilege on the property, and shall remain in full force and effect for
the amount due on principal and interest, plus costs of court, if any, for
collection, until final payment has been made.
         (b)   The costs and expenses shall be collected in the manner fixed by
law for the collection of real estate taxes and further shall be subject to a
delinquency penalty the same as real estate taxes in the event same is not paid
in full on or before the date the tax bill on which the charges appear becomes
delinquent.
         (c)   Sworn statements recorded in accordance with the provisions
hereof shall be prima facie evidence that all legal formalities have been
complied with and that the work has been done properly and satisfactorily, and
shall be full notice to every person concerned of the property designated or
described in the statement and that the same is due and collectible as provided
by law.
         (d)   The Town Council may also pursue collection through any other
lawful means, including court proceedings, if it so desires, if the full amount
is not paid within 30 days.
   (F)   Penalties. In addition to the remedies provided above, any person
violating the provisions of this section shall be subject to a penalty of $100
for the first notice of violation. For subsequent notices of the same violation
within 365 calendar days, after the violation has been abated either by the
owner or the town, the initial penalty shall be increased by $100 for each
additional notice of the same violation - e.g., $200 for the second violation,
$300 for the third violation, and so on. In addition, there shall be an
additional penalty of $10 per day for each day of non-compliance after the
period for compliance has expired, up to a maximum fine of $2,500 payable to
the town. Such penalty shall bear the maximum interest allowed by law from the
date due.

Second violation                 $50 to $100
Third violation                  $100 to $250
Fourth violation                 $250 to $500
Each violation in excess of four $500 to $2,500
 
      (2)   These civil violation fines do not preclude the civil violator from
responsibility of payment of costs incurred by the town if it is necessary for
the town to enter onto the property to correct, terminate or cease a violation
in with §
93.03 of this chapter.
   (C)   In addition to the remedies provided above, any person violating the
provisions of §
93.08 shall be subject to a penalty of $100 for the first notice of violation.
For subsequent notices of the same violation, after the violation has been
abated either by the owner or the town, the initial penalty shall be increased
by $100 for each additional notice of the same violation - e.g., $200 for the
second violation, $300 for the third violation, and so on. In addition, there
shall be an additional penalty of $10 per day for each day of non- compliance
after the period for compliance has expired, up to a maximum fine of $2,500
payable to the town. Such penalty shall bear the maximum interest allowed by
law from the date due.

permits.
   (D)   The standards set forth in this section are intended to be minimum
standards. Variances from these standards may be considered by the Plan
Commission upon written application to the Commission citing unusual conditions
justifying changes based upon sound engineering practices. Proposed variances
shall have been reviewed the by Town Planning Department before consideration
by the Plan Commission.
   (E)   All improvements shall be constructed to conform to the current
edition of the following standards, except where deviations are hereinafter
allowed or variances granted:
      (1)   Street Standards - Town of Pendleton.
      (2)   Practices and Guidelines for Local Agency Roads - Indiana
Association of County Highway Engineers and Supervisors.
      (3)   INDOT Standard Drawings.
      (4)   INDOT Standard Specifications.
      (5)   Indiana Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
      (6)   AASHTO Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets.
   (F)   Construction Plans and Specifications. Change orders shall be
initiated by the design professional that certified the plans, and subject to
the written approval of the town. All road construction plans shall be prepared
on 24" x 36" plan sheets. All plans shall include the standards issued by the
town. All design shall be in accordance with these standards. When not
specifically addressed by these standards, the design shall be in accordance
with the current AASHTO Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets and
other accepted design guides.
   (G)   Construction inspection shall conform to the following items:
      (1)   Prior to beginning construction of any roads or bridges that are to
be dedicated to the town the plans and specifications for the roads and/or
bridges shall be approved by the engineer and the town. Three copies of the
plans shall be submitted to the town engineer.
      (2)   The town shall either approve or reject, specifying the reasons for
rejection. Initial review of the plans will be completed within 30 days. When
the plans are approved, they shall be stamped approved by the town. One copy
shall be returned to the developer, one copy shall be provided to the inspector
and one copy shall be retained by the town. Any amendments to the plans shall
also be submitted to the appropriate agencies in triplicate and must be
approved prior to the construction of any changes. The developer will be

conformance with these standards, the pavement or sidewalk will be cored as
part of the inspection process at the developer's expense. The average
thickness of the cores must equal or exceed the minimum required thickness, and
no single core can have a deficiency greater than one-half inch. All deficient
portions of pavement and sidewalks will be replaced at the developer's expense
before the pavements or sidewalks are accepted.
§ 95.02 STREET DESIGN STANDARDS.
The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets
shall conform to all of the elements of these regulations. Street
classifications are referred to as either major or minor streets in this
chapter. A major street includes the rural minor arterial, the rural major
collector, and the rural minor collector. A minor street includes the rural
local road, subdivision road and cul-de-sac.
   (A)   Whenever a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major
street, the town may require frontage roads, double frontage lots with
screening, a nonaccess easement along the property lines, deep lots, or such
other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential
properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. In those
instances where a non-access easement is proposed along a state or federal
highway, this easement shall be granted specifically to INDOT.
   (B)   In order to provide a functional town street system, the town shall
require a developer to construct access streets to adjoining vacant undeveloped
properties. The coordination of streets from one subdivision to another is
essential to the town in order to provide a continuation of not only vehicular
access, but also transportation and distribution lines for most utilities, such
as water, sewer, gas, electricity and telephone systems. However, the dead
ending of certain access streets to vacant undeveloped property may cause a
windfall profit. In cases where the owner of the vacant land would receive an
artificial profit because of another developer providing access, the town may
waive the requirement of constructing the access street to the vacant land. In
these cases, the developer shall be required to dedicate the necessary right-
of-way, but the person who develops the adjoining vacant property will be
required to construct the street. The town shall not consider waiving the
street construction requirement for any developer when the future access
streets do not provide the only means of access for the vacant adjoining
property. The town shall determine the need and location of these access
streets at the time of preliminary approval.
   (C)   All streets, including those proposed to provide the continuation of
streets to adjacent property, shall be constructed to the boundary lines of the
subdivision and in accordance with the standards of this chapter. If a
subdivision is approved contiguous to existing right-of-way dedicated for a
continuation street, but the street has not been constructed, the developer of
the new subdivision must construct the entire street including the portion that
is not contained within the developer's project.
   (D)   A proposed street shall provide for the continuation of existing,
planned or platted streets on adjacent property.
   (E)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or
limited access highway right-of-way the town may require a street approximately
parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance suitable for
the appropriate use of the intervening land. Such distances shall also be
determined with due regard for the requirements of the approach grade of any
future grade separation structure.
   (F)   A dead end street shall not be permitted except where a street is
proposed to be and should logically be extended but is not yet constructed. A
temporary cul-de-sac shall be constructed for any dead end street which exceeds
300 feet in length from the nearest intersection. Drainage details for the
temporary cul-de-sac shall be specified by the applicant and approved by the
town. A dead end street which does not require a temporary cul-de-sac shall
have adequate drainage provisions as approved by the town.
   (G)   A temporary cul-de-sac shall have an easement radius of not less than
50 feet and shall have a driving surface radius of not less than 40 feet. The
cross section of a temporary cul-de-sac shall be at least nine inches of
aggregate. If it is anticipated that the temporary cul-de-sac will be required
for longer than three years, an additional two inches of asphalt binder shall
be required. Any temporary cul-de-sac still with a stone surface at the end of
the maintenance period must be paved with two inches of asphalt binder prior to
release of the maintenance guarantee.
   (H)   An easement providing access to a street shall be prohibited except
where its control and maintenance is defined in a manner approved by the town.
   (I)   Actual R/W width shall be based on engineering design and shall
include the width of the through lanes, turn lane, parking lanes, shoulders,
side slope, side ditch and backslope. The street right-of-way shall be not less
than the following:

   (J)   The building setback line shall be regulated by the setback provisions
of the Zoning Ordinance applicable to the area proposed to be subdivided. The
minimum building setback line shall be measured from the street right-of-way
line but in no instance shall be less than the following:

   (K)   The paved width of all streets shall be adequate to serve the existing
and future estimated traffic load for the development. A new subdivision road
shall be surfaced to a minimum width of 30 feet measured back-to-back of curb.
A cul-de-sac turn around shall be paved to a diameter of 80 feet measured back-
to-back of curb. All other roads and streets shall be surfaced to a minimum
width that is determined by sound engineering design and with the concurrence
of the town. Where a proposed street is an extension of an existing paved
street that exceeds the minimum dimension set forth above, the town may require
the developer to match the width of the existing paved street.
      (1)   Where required by the Town Engineer, additional acceleration or
deceleration or right turn lanes shall be added. All lanes shall be 12'-0"
wide. Parking lanes shall be 10'-0", desirable, 8'-0", minimum, in width.
   (M)   A proposed subdivision street shall be designed to minimize through
traffic movement, however, this does not waive the requirement to construct an
access road to adjacent property boundary as required by divisions (C) or (D)
of this section.
   (N)   Acceptable limits for visibility, curvature, and maximum grade depend
on topography, functional classification, anticipated traffic volumes, number
and nature of access points, and the like. Road design specifications shall be
based on sound engineering judgement using the design speeds outlined in Table
3. The town must approve the design speeds selected for each project.

      (1)   The values for desirable stopping sight distance shall be met for
all street construction and at all intersections. Minimum stopping sight
distances shall only be used in those cases which, in the opinion of the town,
would cause undue hardship by use of the desirable stopping sight distance.
      (2)   The values for intersection sight distance shall be used at the
intersection of two new streets. Intersection sight distance should be used at
all other intersections. No new features such as signs, embankments, walls, or
landscaping, shall be constructed which reduce the sight distance below the
intersection sight distance.
      (3)   Where unusual or complex situations exist, decision sight distance
(per AASHTO Standards) may be required by the town to provide an added margin
of safety.
   (Q)   Horizontal curvature measured along the centerline shall comply with
the following:

   (R)   A reverse curve on a subdivision street shall have a straight tangent
between elements of the reserve curve of not less than 100 feet. A reverse
curve on any other street shall allow for one of the following conditions:
      (1)   The distance between the reverse curves shall achieve a normal
tangent section for a minimum of two seconds of travel time, and the
superelevation transition requirements shall be met for both curves; or
      (2)   The pavement shall be continuously rotated in a plane about its
axis. The minimum distance between the curves is that which will be needed to
meet the superelevation transition requirements for the two curves
(distribution of superelevation runoff between the tangent and curve).
   (S)   The sections above deal with minimum requirements. Individual
projects, particularly commercial and industrial subdivisions, may warrant
additional requirements dictated by sound engineering design. Such additional
requirements must be specified by the town at primary approval.
   (T)   Access roads from a proposed development onto an existing or proposed
town road may be denied or restricted. If in the sole opinion of the town, the
proposed access road presents a potential hazard to the motoring public, the
town may require the applicant to make improvements to an existing or proposed
town road as a condition of allowing access. An applicant may be required to
provide deceleration, acceleration, passing blisters or other improvements to
the road system based on the following criteria:
      (1)   Sight distance;
      (2)   Number of lots;
      (3)   Proposed use;
      (4)   Street classification;
      (5)   Traffic generation;
      (6)   Existing or proposed conditions; and
      (7)   Sound engineering design.
   (U)   The number of access roads required into a subdivision will be based
upon the number of lots, sound engineering design and continuity of the town
street system. If the town determines that an additional access road is
necessary, they will advise the applicant at the time of preliminary approval.
   (V)   A cul-de-sac street shall not exceed 1,000 feet in length measured
from the centerline of the nearest intersection to the center of the cul-de-
sac. A cul-de-sac shall be provided with a turnaround radius of not less than
50 feet at the right-of-way line and not less than 40 feet at the back of the
curb line. The cul-de-sac shall be paved in accordance with §
95.05.
   (W)   A half street shall be prohibited.
   (X)   The applicant shall dedicate additional right-of-way width as required
to meet these regulations in a subdivision that adjoins or includes an existing
street that does not conform to the minimum right-of-way requirements.
(Ord. 1999-06, passed 6-8-99)
§ 95.03 INTERSECTIONS.
   (A)   Street curbs shall be rounded by radii of sufficient length to permit
the smooth flow of traffic, but in no case shall the curb radii be less than 25
feet for a minor street, or 40 feet for a major street or a street in a
commercial or industrial development.
   (B)   Where a proposed street with curbs intersects an existing street
without curbs, the curb radius shall be designed so there is a minimum of 12
feet offset between the termination of the curb and edge of the existing street
pavement.
   (C)   Street right-of-way at intersections shall be designed to provide a
minimum of ten feet separating the street right-of-way and curb.
   (D)   Intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as is possible, and
no intersection shall be at an angle of less than 70 degrees.
   (E)   Intersections of more than two streets at one point shall not be
permitted.
   (F)   When a street of lesser functional classification intersects with a
street of greater functional classification, the radii arcs at the intersection
will comply with the standards for the street of greater functional
classification.
   (G)   There shall be at least 100 feet of tangent alignment before entering
an intersection.
   (H)   The placement of a driveway that is located near a street intersection
shall be based on sound engineering design.
   (I)   Street intersections shall not be closer than 200 feet centerline to
centerline for minor streets and 500 feet centerline to centerline for a major
street. This provision does not apply to a frontage road.
   (J)   When a street of lesser functional classification intersects with a
street of greater functional classification, the pavement thickness of all
improvements within the right-of-way of the intersection shall comply with the
standard for the greater street.
(Ord. 1999-06, passed 6-8-99)
§ 95.04 SIGHT DISTANCE AT INTERSECTIONS.
   (A)   Stopping sight distance shall be determined by measuring from a point
three and one-half feet above the roadway surface along a line of sight to a
point six inches above the roadway surface.
   (B)   Intersection sight distance shall be determined by measuring from a
point three and one-half feet above the roadway surface along a line of sight
to a point four and one quarter feet above the roadway surface.
   (C)   Sight distance values are included in Table 5.
   (D)   The following items shall be required and must be noted on the final
plat:
      (1)   No fence, wall, sign, hedge, tree or shrub planting or other
similar item which obstructs sight lines shall be placed or permitted to remain
on any corner lot within the triangular area formed by the street right-of-way
lines and a line connecting points 25 feet from the intersection of minor
street lines and 50 feet from the intersection of major street lines, or in the
case of a rounded property corner, from the intersection of the street right-
of-way lines extended.
      (2)   In the case of a driveway within ten feet of an intersection of a
street right-of-way or an alley, the same sight line limitation shall apply.
(Ord. 1999-06, passed 6-8-99)
§ 95.05 STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   In general, a street shall be completed to the grade shown on the plan
and profile sheet. A plan and profile sheet for each street shall be provided
by the developer and prepared by a registered professional engineer or
registered land surveyor.
   (B)   The minimum requirements for street construction shall be in

Section 213 of the Standard Specifications or compacted thoroughly by other
means. Any other means must be approved by the town prior to construction.
   (D)   Subsurface drains shall be installed parallel to the street curb at a
depth of at least three feet below the back of curb. Subsurface drains shall be
a minimum of six inch diameter perforated Polyethylene pipe. Four inch laterals
shall be provided for each lot, extended to the right-of-way line and capped.
The ends shall be marked by extending a board or other suitable material to the
surface and dimensioned on the as-built plans. No direct surface water
discharges will be allowed to connect to the subsurface drain.
   (E)   Stone aggregate base shall be placed under the curb and extended to
six inches beyond the outside edge of the curb. This aggregate base shall be
continuous and shall match the bottom of pavement (top of subgrade) or be four
inches thick, whichever is more.
   (F)   Wet spots or other unusual soil conditions may develop in streets.
These streets must comply with any or all of the following requirements:
      (1)   Four inch Polyethylene lateral underdrains which extend under the
subbase and connect directly to the subsurface drains shall be placed at
regular intervals through the wet areas.
      (2)   Four inches of aggregate (#53 stone) shall be added to the street
cross section in addition to the minimum base requirement.
      (3)   Soft spots may be over excavated and backfilled with compacted

   (I)   Commercial driveways (located within the right of way) and auxiliary
lanes shall be constructed to the equivalent thickness of the pavements they
are added to (as set out in Tables 7 and 8) or the entrances they are
constructed to serve, whichever is greater.
   (J)   Existing street pavements to be upgraded to applicable standards as
parts of improvements to be accepted by the town, will be tested and evaluated
by the design professional to determine the condition, quality and amount of
pavement and the condition of the subgrade. Existing pavements may be upgraded
by augmenting the existing pavement structure if elevations and grades are
compatible and if the resulting pavement meets the structural and geometric
requirements of Tables 7 and 8; or the existing pavement materials, if
suitable, may be incorporated into a new pavement structure.
(Ord. 1999-06, passed 6-8-99)
§ 95.06 JOINTS.
Rigid pavement shall be jointed in order to control cracking. Joints shall be
constructed in accordance with the type and dimensions and at the locations
required by Standard Specifications, these regulations, or as directed by the
Town Engineer's office.
   (A)   Spacing of weakened plane, transverse, or contraction joints shall not
exceed 20 feet. Closer spacing to average 15 feet is encouraged. A transverse
contraction joint may either be formed or sawed dummy groove, ribbon or pre-
molded strip type, and shall be one-fourth the thickness of the pavement.
   (B)   When a transverse joint is to be formed by sawing, care must be taken
to saw the grooves soon after placing the concrete to prevent the formation of
cracks due to contraction of the slab.
   (C)   One of the above named joints shall be placed at every catch basin and
manhole in the line of pavement. The location of manholes in the pavement shall
determine the exact location of the joints.
   (D)   All joints shall extend throughout the curb to the full width of the
pavement.
   (E)   A transverse expansion joint shall be placed at the intersections,
tangent points of sharp curves, and wherever else shown on the plans.
   (F)   Whenever the width between forms of the pavement under construction is
greater than ten feet, a longitudinal joint shall be constructed so as to
divide the pavement into strips not to exceed ten feet each. This may be
accomplished by sawing or by installing a slot or groove as herein described
for a contraction joint.
   (G)   White membrane curing compound AASHTO Number 2-M-14B must be properly
applied to give complete coverage immediately after finishing.
(Ord. 1999-06, passed 6-8-99)
§ 95.07 CURBS AND GUTTERS.
   (A)   A two foot concrete curb and gutter shall be required for all
residential subdivision streets. Streets with a design speed of 45 mph or less
shall have the option of using either a mountable or barrier curb. Streets with
a design sped greater than 45 mph should be designed without curbs. However, if
necessary, a four inch mountable curb may be used.
   (B)   Materials, concrete specifications and construction procedure shall
comply with Section 605 of the Standard Specifications.
   (C)   To prevent undermining by water, curbs shall be promptly and carefully
backfilled after application of curing protection, which shall take place
immediately after slipforming or removal of forms. Backfill shall be compacted
as soon as practical and maintained at an elevation slightly below the curb. As
the backfill settles, it shall be regraded as often as necessary to keep it
slightly below the curbs.
   (D)   Valley gutters which connect gutter drains across street intersections
are strictly prohibited.
(Ord. 1999-06, passed 6-8-99)
§ 95.08 PRIVATE STREETS.
It is the intent and purpose of this section to encourage streets and rights-
of-way to be dedicated to the town for ownership and maintenance whenever
possible. It is a long range benefit to the entire town for streets and rights-
of-way to be maintained publicly rather than privately. There may be, however,
a situation in which a privately owned and maintained street is a more
reasonable alternative. In any development in which a private street is
allowed, the street shall conform to the following requirements:
   (A)   A private street shall meet or exceed the minimum geometrics, width,
depth, and other construction standards and specifications for a similar street
classification.
   (B)   The right-of-way width of a private street shall not be less than 50
feet.
   (C)   Street classification standards and specifications greater than those
in divisions (A) and (B) above may be applied at the discretion of the town if
the street is of length or of design as to actually serve as a higher
classified street.
   (D)   The covenants of the final plat shall contain the following statement:
   "The streets and public rights-of-way shown hereon are to be privately owned
and maintained by the homeowners' association pursuant to the articles of
incorporation of said association. The streets and rights-of-way shown hereon
may become publicly owned and maintained streets only upon the express written
consent by the governmental body having jurisdiction and after having been
inspected and verified that they meet all current standards."
(Ord. 1999-06, passed 6-8-99)
§ 95.09 SIDEWALKS.
   (A)   Sidewalks are required along both sides of all proposed and existing
streets and along the development side of all existing town roads in all
proposed subdivisions.
   (B)   A plan for a sidewalk system shall be prepared that will provide every
lot within a subdivision, or portion thereof, with reasonable access to a
sidewalk connecting with all of the community facilities, commercial
enterprises and other residential subdivisions located near or adjacent to the
subdivision, and in a manner that will provide safe and convenient pedestrian
circulation throughout the neighborhood or area in which the subdivision is
located and which will avoid pedestrian and vehicular traffic conflict.
   (C)   Sidewalk materials and construction requirements shall conform to the
Standard Specifications, Section 604, and shall meet the following
requirements:
      (1)   Be constructed only of Portland Cement Concrete unless otherwise
expressly approved by the town.
      (2)   Have a minimum depth of four inches.
      (3)   Have a minimum depth of six inches, or the thickness of the
driveway being crossed, whichever is greater, when built in an area of proposed
vehicular crossing.
      (4)   Have a slope of no steeper than one-quarter inch per foot,
laterally, toward the street. Any longitudinal slope greater than 1:20 shall be
considered a ramp and must comply with Americans with Disabilities Act
requirements.
      (5)   Be located at least one foot inside the right-of-way lines.
      (6)   Have consistency, slump, and mixture specifications as established
by the Standard Specifications.
      (7)   Be jointed every four feet, with expansion joints every 40 feet to
prevent cracking and heaving.
      (8)   Have curb ramps installed at all intersections and at all other
locations where required for compliance with the Americans with Disabilities
Act.
      (9)   Have a minimum width as follows:

   (D)   In order to facilitate pedestrian access from the street to schools,
parks, playgrounds, or other nearby streets, the town may require a perpetual
unobstructed easement at least 20 feet in width. This easement shall be
indicated on both the preliminary and final plats. The construction details
shall be shown on the construction plans and must be specifically approved by
the town.
(Ord. 1999-06, passed 6-8-99)
§ 95.10 STREET IDENTIFICATION SIGNS AND REGULATORY SIGNS.
   (A)   The developer shall install street identification signs at each street
intersection within and on the perimeter of the subdivision. The sign shall be
located at the northeast corner of the intersection wherever possible. The
developer shall also install all appropriate regulatory signs as required by
the town.
   (B)   Street identification signs and regulatory signs shall comply with the
current issue of the Indiana Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices
regarding size, material, reflectivity and location.
   (C)   Street identification signs for public roads shall be white letters on
a green background. Street identification signs for private roads shall be
white letters on a blue background.
   (D)   Size of letters and sign dimensions shall comply with Town Highway
Department requirements.
   (E)   Regulatory signs shall be placed in accordance with the current issue
of the Indiana Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices and as directed by the
Town Engineer's office.
   (F)   Sign locations must be shown in the development plans. Sign
requirements will be coordinated with the town prior to completion of the
construction plans. A separate sheet showing only traffic controls, including
signs and pavement markings, shall be included in the construction drawings.
This sheet may be submitted for initial review as soon as the primary plat is
approved. One additional copy of this sheet shall be submitted to the County
Highway Department for transmittal to the County Sheriffs Department if
necessary and to the town or local Police Department for their review. The
engineer will be responsible for drafting necessary ordinance amendments or
official actions required to authorize the control signs' installations.
   (G)   The developer may install decorative type signs, provided the
covenants of the property specify that the residents will maintain the signs
through their homeowners association. The town will give written notification
to the homeowners association when maintenance of the decorative signs is
required. If not completed within the 30 days, the town will replace the signs
with standard signs at the homeowners association's expense. Decorative posts
shall not be greater than a 4" x 4" wood post or a 2" diameter steel tube
unless notified to meet breakaway standards and other safety characteristics as
approved by the town. All signs shall conform to all other applicable
ordinances.
   (H)   Decorative signs will not be allowed for use as regulatory or warning
signs.
   (I)   The developer shall furnish the signs prior to the release of the
performance bond or prior to the issuance of the first occupancy permit,
whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 1999-06, passed 6-8-99)
§ 95.11 ROADSIDE DITCHES.
   (A)   Roadside ditches are required for all existing or proposed roads that
will not have curbs and gutters.
   (B)   Roadside ditches shall be located so as to provide a shoulder width as
dictated by the road classification and sound engineering design. In no case
shall the shoulder width be less than seven feet.
   (C)   Ditch slopes greater than or equal to 1% and less than 3% grade shall
be sodded. Ditch slopes greater than or equal to 3% grade shall protected with
riprap.
   (D)   The ditches shall not be filled in by the property owner without
installing storm sewers at any time in the future. The covenants shall
specifically prohibit this.
   (E)   General Guidelines for Ditch Cross-sections:
      (1)   Traversable ditch cross sections are defined in Figures 10, 11, and
12. Two curves are shown on each figure. The area below the lower curve
represents ditch cross sections that can be traversed by a vehicle containing
unrestrained occupants and, thus, has a Severity Index of 1.0.
      (2)   The upper curve is for ditch cross sections that have a Severity
Index of 1.6, and thus, vehicle occupants must be restrained in order to safely
traverse the ditch. The use of Severity Index = 1.6 may be necessary because of
right-of-way restrictions or to avoid nominal changes to existing ditches. In
addition, the following items shall, be considered.
      (3)   Slopes of 3:1 shall be used only where site conditions do not
permit the use of flatter slopes;
      (4)   Embankment surfaces must be uniform to permit traversability of a
3:1 slope. Vehicle rollover can be expected if the embankment is soft or
rutted; and
      (5)   Foreslopes steeper than 4:1 are not desirable because their use
severely limits the range of backslopes producing a safe ditch configuration.
   (F)   Ditches In Fill Sections On Reconstruction Projects.
      (1)   If any part of the backslope of the ditch section falls within the
Clear Zone then the slopes shall be evaluated in accordance with Figures 10,
11, and 12. Existing ditch combinations that fall on or below the 1.6 Severity
Index may remain. Areas with ditch slope combinations that fall above the 1.6
Severity Index curve shall be evaluated for cost and accident history before
deciding to make an improvement. If improvement is warranted, the slope
combination should preferably fall below the SI = 1.0 curve, but at least below
the SI = 1.6 curve.
      (2)   If the ditch falls outside the Clear Zone, traversability may not
be considered.
   (G)   Ditches In Fill Sections On New Facilities. If the ditch falls within
the Clear Zone, the Designer shall select a front slope, backslope, and ditch
width that will fall within the 1.0 Severity Index curve on Figures 10, 11, and
12.
   (H)   Ditches In Cut Sections On Reconstruction Projects. Additional right-
of-way shall be obtained, if practical, when the ditch cross section can be
made traversable by flattening the slopes or by moving the ditch farther from
the road. Other means of making the ditch traversable, which shall be
evaluated, are as follows:
      (1)   Use of a pipe in the ditch;
      (2)   Raising the grade of the ditch; and
      (3)   Placing 4" rip rap in the ditch to change ditch contour, and such
that the projection of any one piece of rip rap does not exceed 2" above
surrounding area.
   (I)   Ditches In Cut Sections On New Facilities. The desirable section is
shown in Figures 10, 11, and 12. For minimum ditch sections, provide a section
which falls on or below the 1.6 Severity Index curves on Figures 10, 11, and
12.
