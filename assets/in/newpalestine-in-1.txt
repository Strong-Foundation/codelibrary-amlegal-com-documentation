FIXED ASSET CAPITALIZATION POLICY
§ 29.601 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   CAPITAL OUTLAYS. Expenditures which benefit both the current and future
fiscal periods. This includes costs of acquiring land or structures;
construction or improvement of buildings, structures or other fixed assets; and
equipment purchases having  an appreciable and calculable period of usefulness.
These are expenditures resulting in the acquisition of or addition to the
government's general fixed assets.
   FIXED ASSETS. Tangible assets of a durable nature employed in the operating
activities of the unit and that are relatively permanent and are needed for the
production or sale of goods or services are termed property, plant and
equipment of fixed assets. These assets are not held for sale in the ordinary
course of business. This broad group is usually separated into classes
according to the physical characteristics of the items (for example, land,
buildings, improvements other than buildings, machinery and equipment,
furniture and fixtures).
   TANGIBLE ASSETS. Assets that can be observed by one or more of the physical
senses. They may be seen and touched and, in some environments, heard and
smelled.

following conditions:
      (1)   The total cost exceeds $5,000; and

   (A)   The town and its various departments shall classify capital
expenditures as capital outlays within the fund from which the expenditure was
made in accordance with the Chart of Accounts of the Cities and Towns
Accounting Manual. For purposes of recording fixed assets of the town and its
departments, the valuation of assets shall be based on historical cost or where
the historical cost is indeterminable by estimation for those assets in
existence.
   (B)   The town's municipally owned utilities shall record acquisition of
fixed assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. When
an asset is purchased for cash, the acquisition is simply recorded at the
amount of cash paid. Assets may be acquired under a number of other
arrangements, including:
      (1)   Assets acquired for lump sum purchase price;
      (2)   Purchase on deferred payment contract;
      (3)   Acquisition under capital lease;
      (4)   Acquisition by exchange of nonmonetary assets;
      (5)   Acquisition by issuance of securities;
      (6)   Acquisition by self construction;
      (7)   Acquisition by donation or discovery.
   (C)   Some of these arrangements present special problems relating to the
cost to be recorded, for example, in utility accounting, interest during a
period of construction has long been recognized as a part of the asset cost.
Reference to an intermediate accounting manual will illustrate the recording of
acquisition of assets under the aforementioned acquisition arrangements. For
purposes of recording fixed assets of the utilities, the valuation of assets
shall be based on historical cost.
   (D)   In addition, assets shall be recorded and maintained to provide a
detailed record of the capital assets of the governmental unit.
(Ord. 122000B, passed 1-17-2001)
§ 29.606 SAFEGUARDING OF ASSETS.
   Accounting controls shall be designed and implemented to provide reasonable
assurances that: the recorded accountability for assets are to be compared with
the existing assets at least every 2 years and appropriate action be taken with
respect to any differences.
(Ord. 122000B, passed 1-17-2001)
CAPITAL ASSET POLICY
§ 29.615 GENERAL.
   (A)   The Fixed Asset Policy is being issued effective January 1, 2005. The
new policy will be referred to as the Capital Asset Policy. This policy is
being issued to document the minimum value of capital assets to be reported on
our financial reports and to include infrastructure assets. This issuance of a
policy document is related to the implementation of a new reporting model,
Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement 34. Statement 34 will require
the town to depreciate capital assets. The capital asset threshold will be
$5,000. An asset with a value under $5,000 will be expensed in the year of
purchase. The infrastructure portion of this policy is also effective January
1, 2005.
   (B)   Town utilities will follow this same definition of capital assets
except any item with a unit cost of $5,000 or more shall be capitalized. Assets
that are not capitalized (items < $5,000) are expensed in the year of
acquisition. Town utilities will follow the capitalization guidelines of the
Indiana State Board of Accounts.
   (C)   The Town of New Palestine is, by this subchapter, establishing a
Capital Asset Policy in order to provide a higher degree of control over its
considerable investment in capital assets, and to be able to demonstrate
accountability to its various constituencies: citizens, rate-payers, oversight
bodies and regulators. All public information pertaining to capital assets will
be made available in the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CTAR).
   (D)   The purpose of establishing a Capital Policy is fivefold:
      (1)   To safeguard the investments of the citizens of New Palestine;
      (2)   To fix responsibility for the custody of equipment;
      (3)   To provide a basis for formulating capital asset acquisition,
maintenance and retirement polices;
      (4)   To provide data for financial reporting; and
      (5)   To demonstrate appropriate stewardship responsibility for public
assets.
   (E)   This policy will only serve to classify capital assets, including
fixed and infrastructure, for accuracy in financial reporting through the
Indiana State Board of Accounts. It does not include data processing,
programming requirements, or computer operations procedures.
(Ord. 011905, passed 1-19-2005)
§ 29.616 DEFINITION OF CAPITAL ASSETS.
   (A)   Capital assets include: land, land improvements, including monuments,
buildings, building improvements, construction in progress, machinery and
equipment, vehicles and infrastructure. All land will be capitalized but not
depreciated. All items with a useful life of more than one year, and having a
unit cost of $5,000 or more shall be capitalized (including acquisitions by
lease-purchase agreements and donated items). A capital asset meeting the
criteria will be reported and depreciated in the government-wide financial
statements.
   (B)   Assets that are not capitalized (items < $5,000) are expensed in the
year of acquisition. An inventory will be kept on all computers and other
equipment with a capitalized cost of < $5,000. (See §
29.622)
   (C)   Exceptions are:
      (1)   Items costing less than the above limits which are permanently
installed as a part of the cost of original construction or installation of a
larger building or equipment unit will be included in the cost of the larger
unit;
      (2)   Modular equipment added subsequent to original equipment
construction of a larger building or equipment unit which may be put together
to form larger units costing more than the prescribed limits will be charged to
capital assets even though the cost of individual items is less than such
units; and
      (3)   Cabinets, shelving, bookcases, and similar items, added subsequent
to original construction, which are custom made for a specific place and
adaptable elsewhere, will be capitalized.
   (D)   Purchases made using grant funds must comply with grant requirements
or the above procedures, whichever are the most restrictive.
(Ord. 011905, passed 1-19-2005)
§ 29.617 THRESHOLD LEVELS FOR CAPITAL ASSETS.
   The following schedule will be followed for the different types of capital
assets other than infrastructure assets:
                         Capitalize/Depreciate
Land                     All/capitalize only
Land improvements        $5,000
Building                 $5,000
Building improvements    $5,000
Construction in progress All/capitalize only
Machinery and equipment  $5,000
Vehicle                  $5,000
Town utility assets      $5,000
 
(Ord. 011905, passed 1-19-2005)
§ 29.618 VALUATION OF CAPITAL ASSETS.
   (A)   Capital assets must be recorded at actual cost. Normally the cost
recorded is the purchase price or construction costs of the asset, but also
included is any other reasonable and necessary costs incurred to place the
asset in its intended location and intended use. The costs could include the
following:
      (1)   Legal and title fees, closing costs;
      (2)   Appraisal and negotiation fees, surveying fees;
      (3)   Damage payments;
      (4)   Land preparation costs, demolition costs;
      (5)   Architect, engineering and accounting fees;
      (6)   Insurance premiums during construction;
      (7)   Transportation charges; and
      (8)   Interest costs during construction.
   (B)   Donated or contributed assets should be recorded at their fair market
value on the date donated.
(Ord. 011905, passed 1-19-2005)
§ 29.619 ASSET DEFINITIONS BY MAJOR CATEGORY.
   (A)   It is important to the maintenance of accurate records that each asset
category be precisely defined and that all persons responsible for records
maintenance be fully aware of the categorization system. This section further
clarifies the asset definitions by major category.
      (1)   Land. Land is defined as specified land, lots, parcels or acreage
including rights-of-way, owned by the town, its various departments, boards or
authorities, regardless of the method or date of acquisition. Easements will
not be included as the town does not own them, but as an interest in land owned
by another (such as property owner) that entitles its holder to a specified
limited use.
      (2)   Improvements other than buildings.
         (a)   Examples of town assets in this category are walks, parking
areas and drives, fencing, retaining walls, pools, fountains, planters,
underground sprinkler systems, and other similar items.
         (b)   Examples of town utilities assets in this category are water
supply mains, collection sewers, wells, dams, fences, intake pipes, manholes,
and fire hydrants.
      (3)   Buildings.
         (a)   All structures designed and erected to house equipment services,
or functions are included. This includes systems, services, and fixtures within
the buildings, and attachments such as porches, stairs, fire escapes, canopies,
areaways, lighting fixtures, flagpoles, and all other such units that serve the
building.
         (b)   Plumbing systems, lighting systems, heating, cooling,
ventilating and air handling systems, alarm systems, sound systems,
surveillance systems, passenger and freight elevators, escalators, built-in
casework, walk-in coolers and freezers, fixed shelving, and other fixed
equipment are included with the building, if owned. Communication antennas and/
or towers are not included as buildings. These are parts of the equipment units
that they serve.
      (4)   Equipment. Equipment includes all other types of physical property
within the scope of the Fixed Asset Management System not previously
classified. Included within this category are office mechanical equipment,
office furniture, appliances, furnishings, machinery items, maintenance
equipment, communication equipment, police, fire, sanitation and park
department, laboratory equipment, vehicles, road equipment, aircraft, emergency
equipment, earth moving equipment, text equipment, civil defense equipment, and
data processing equipment. All supplies are excluded.
      (5)   Infrastructure.
         (a)   Infrastructure assets are long-lived capital assets that
normally can be preserved for a significant greater number of years than most
capital and that are normally stationary in nature. Examples include roads,
streetlights, traffic signals, drainage systems, and water systems.
Infrastructure assets do not include buildings, drives, parking lots or any
other examples given above that are incidental to property or access to the
property above.
         (b)   Additions and improvements to infrastructure, which increase the
capacity or efficiency of the asset, will be capitalized. Maintenance/repairs
will be considered as necessary to maintain the existing asset, and therefore
not capitalized. For example, patching, resurfacing, snow removal and the like
are considered maintenance activities and will be expensed. Also, normal
department operating activities such as feasibility studies, and preliminary
engineering and design, will be expensed and not capitalized as an element of
the infrastructure asset.
         (c)   Alleys will not be included as part of infrastructure for the
following reason: existing improved alleys will be maintained as gravel alleys,
and the town is responsible only for the maintenance, such as patching and
repairing. Any investments to upgrade the alleys will be done by homeowner
participation. Therefore, the town will not track and value alleys, and the
patching/repairs will be expensed as they occur.
         (d)   The retroactive reporting requirements for infrastructure of
GASB 34 requires the town to report items put into service from 1980 forward,
and gives the town the option to report items put into service prior to 1980.
The town will report only on items put into service after 1980. Retroactive
reporting is not mandated until fiscal years beginning after January 1, 2006
which the town will comply with.
   (B)   At the network level, the asset will be classified as major if the
cost of the network item is at least 10% of the cost of all capital assets in
fiscal year 1999. A network will be defined as a group of similar assets that
serve a particular function or purpose for the town.
   (C)   At the subsystem level, the asset will be classified as major if the
cost of the subsystem item is at least 5% of the cost of all capital assets in
fiscal year 1999. A will subsystem will be defined as a segment of a network of
assets that serve a similar function for the town.
(Ord. 011905, passed 1-19-2005)
§ 29.620 DEPRECIATION METHODS.
   (A)   Depreciating capital assets.
      (1)   The town will be depreciating capital assets by using either
composite/group method depreciation or the straight-line method. Salvage value
will be determined on an asset-by-asset basis. Depreciation will be calculated
at year-end. Land is not depreciated according to general accepted accounting
principles.
      (2)   A network of assets is composed of all assets that provide a
particular type of service for government. A subsystem of a network of assets
is composed of all assets that make a similar portion or segment of a network
of assets. The following will be the breakdown of our networks and subsystems:
         Roads/Streets Network
            Subsystems:   Types of streets
                  Curbs
         Traffic Components Network
            Subsystems:   Traffic Signals
                  Street Lights
   (B)   Composite/group network.
      (1)   Composite depreciation refers to calculating depreciation for a
collection of similar assets. A single composite rate is applied annually to
the acquisition cost of the collection as a whole. At year-end an adjustment
will be made to the total cost to account for any additions/disposals
throughout the year. The accumulated depreciation associated with it will also
be adjusted. A gain or loss will never be reported on the asset when using the
composite method. A full year's depreciation will be taken when the asset is
placed in service and no depreciation recorded in the year it is sold or
disposed of. Dissimilar assets will be grouped by useful lives and the town's
similar assets by networks. To determine the appropriate depreciation rate for
the composite group, divide one by the number of years the assets are
depreciated. For instance, a group of assets with a 25-year life will be
depreciated at 4% each year (1/25).
      (2)   Following is the list of groups the town will use for depreciation:
         Composite/group depreciation.
         (a)   Street lights - 35 years.
         (b)   Traffic signals - 25 years.
         (c)   Flood walls/gates - 50 years.
         (d)   Roads.
            1.   Cement - 10 years.
            2.   Gravel - 15 years.
            3.   Concrete - 30 years.
            4.   Asphaltic concrete - 20 years.
            5.   Brick or stone - 50 years.
   (C)   Straight-line depreciation. All assets accounted for under the Capital
Asset Policy will be depreciated using the straight-line method of
depreciation. A gain or loss on disposal will be recorded. Following is a list
of the most common useful lives:
      (1)   Vehicles - 5 years.
      (2)   Office equipment - 5 years.
      (3)   Office furniture - 20 years.
      (4)   Heavy equipment - 10 years.
      (5)   Fire trucks - 15 years.
      (6)   Buildings - 50 years.
      (7)   Building components (HVAC systems, roofing) - 20 years.
      (8)   Leasehold improvements - useful life of asset or lease term
(whichever is shorter).
      (9)   Land improvements - structure (parking lots, athletic courts,
swimming pools) - 20 years.
      (10)   Land Improvements - ground work (golf course, athletic fields,
landscaping, fencing) - 20 years.
      (11)   Outdoor equipment - (playground equipment, radio towers) - 15
years.
      (12)   Grounds equipment - (mowers, tractors, attachments) - 15 years.
      (13)   Computer hardware - 3 years.
      (14)   Computer software - 5 years.
   (D)   Town utilities' useful lives are as follows:

         (f)   Reservoirs/tanks - 50 years.
         (g)   Furniture and equipment - 10 years.
         (h)   Other equipment - 10 years.
         (i)   Transportation equipment - 10 years.
         (j)   Shop and lab equipment - 10 years
         (k)   Computer equipment - 3 years.

meets any one of the following criteria:
         (a)   The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by
the end of the lease term.
         (b)   The lease contains a bargain purchase option.
         (c)   The lease term is equal to 75% of the estimated economic life of
the leased property.
         (d)   The present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception
of the lease, excluding executory costs, equals at least 90% of the fair value
of the leased property.
      (2)   Leases that do not meet any of the above criteria should be
recorded as an operating lease and reported in the notes of the financial
statements.
(Ord. 011905, passed 1-19-2005)
§ 29.622 ASSET TRANSFERS AND DISPOSITIONS.
   (A)   Property should not be transferred, turned-in for auction, or disposed
of without prior approval of the department head. A vehicle/equipment out-
processing checklist should be sent to the Town Controller's Office in all
cases. This form is a dual-purpose form for transfer (defined as any movement
of an asset by virtue of change in location, either by account, department,
building, floor, or room) or retirement (disposal) of property.
   (B)   The main points to be remembered when using this form are:
      (1)   Always provide sufficient detail to properly identify the asset,
most importantly the asset's tag number or town ID.
      (2)   Be accurate and do not overlook any of the needed entries.
      (3)   Write legibly.
      (4)   Complete each column for every asset listed on the form.
      (5)   Enter information in correct row, depending on whether you are
transferring or deleting an asset.
      (6)   Have department head sign at the bottom of the form.
      (7)   Return the form to the Town Controller's Office.
   (C)   If an asset is stolen, the department should notify the Safety Manager
as well as the Town Controller's Office.
(Ord. 011905, passed 1-19-2005)
§ 29.623 PERIODIC INVENTORIES.
   A physical inventory of all capital assets (any item over $5,000) will be
conducted in each department on or about December 31 of every year. The Town
Controller's Office will conduct spot checks on a random basis. Department
heads will be accountable for the capital asset inventory charged to their
departments by verifying a list of their capital assets at year-end.
(Ord. 011905, passed 1-19-2005)
§ 29.624 RESPONSIBILITIES OF CONTROLLER'S OFFICE.
   The Fiscal Officer will ensure that accounting for capital assets is being
exercised by establishing a capital asset inventory, both initially and
periodically in subsequent years. The Fiscal Officer will further ensure that
the capital asset report will be updated annually to reflect additions,
retirements, and transfers and to reflect the new, annual capital asset balance
for financial reporting purposes and the annual and accumulated depreciation
calculation.
(Ord. 011905, passed 1-19-2005)
§ 29.625 RESPONSIBILITIES OF DEPARTMENT HEADS.
   (A)   It is the responsibility of the department head to act as or designate
a steward for each piece of property. The steward will become the focal point
for questions regarding the availability, condition, and usage of the asset, as
well as the contact during the physical inventory process.
   (B)   The steward shall be designated as the person to record the receipt of
the asset, to examine the asset to make sure that no damage was incurred during
shipment and to make sure that the asset was received in working order.
   (C)   The steward is also responsible for arranging for the necessary
preventative maintenance and any needed repairs to keep the asset in working
condition. It is necessary to have a responsible person available for questions
that arise during a physical inventory or when someone wants to borrow the
asset. The steward ensures that the asset is used for the purpose for which it
was acquired and that there is no personal or unauthorized use. In addition,
the steward should report any property damage or theft.

the receiving waters.
   (E)   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged, to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or
possess the characteristics enumerated in division (D) of this section, and
which in the judgment of the Superintendent may have a deleterious effect upon
the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise
create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent
may:
      (1)   Reject the wastes;
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers;
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      (4)   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions
of division (J) of this section. If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment

equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the Superintendent and
subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
   (F)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes,
sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall
be of a type and capacity approved by the Superintendent and shall be located
as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   (G)   When preliminary treatment of flow-equalizing facilities are provided
for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
   (H)   When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a
suitable control manhole, together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense
and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (I)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public Health Association and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided or upon suitable samples
taken at the control manhole. In the event that no suitable manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24 hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24 hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from
periodic grab samples.)
   (J)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the town and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the town for treatment, subject to payment therefore, by the
industrial concern.
   (K)   The town is authorized to prohibit dumping of wastes into the town's
sewage system which, in its discretion, are deemed harmful to the operation of
the sewage treatment works of the town, or to require methods affecting
pretreatment of said wastes to comply with the pretreatment standards included
in the NPDES Permit issued to the sewage works. In furtherance of this section,
the Superintendent of the wastewater treatment plant and/or the Town Manager is
authorized to issue an order prohibiting further acceptance of effluent from
any user who refuses to comply with the terms, conditions and provisions of
this chapter as well as to rescind or terminate the users permit to discharge
effluent into the collection treatment or discharge sewer treatment facilities
of the town.

domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose of. The
town shall require the user to determine the strength and content of all sewage
and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly into the sanitary sewage
system, in such manner and by such method as the town may deem practicable in
the light of the conditions and attending circumstances of the case, in order
to determine the proper charge. The user shall furnish a central sampling point
available to the town at all times.
   (A)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a biochemical
oxygen demand of 200 milligrams per liter of fluid or suspended solids in
excess of 200 milligrams per liter of fluid. Additional charges for treating
stronger-than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis.
      (1)   Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids. There shall be an
additional charge of ten cents per pound of suspended solids for suspended
solids received in excess of 200 milligrams per liter of fluid.
      (2)   Rate surcharge based upon BOD. There shall be an additional charge
of ten cents per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for BOD received in excess
of 200 milligrams per liter of fluid.
   (B)   The determination of suspended solids and 5 day biochemical oxygen
demand contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the latest copy of
"Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage and Industrial Wastes,"
as written by the American Public Health Association, the American Water Works
Association and the Water Pollution Control Federation, and in conformance with
the "Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants,"

   (A)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed
monthly and at the end of each year user shall be given notice of that amount
of money charged for operation, maintenance and replacement for that user
during the next preceding year.
   (B)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying
the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but
such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in the event
payment is not made as herein required. The owners of properties served, which
are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to examine the
collection records of the town for the purpose of determining whether bills
have been paid by such tenant or tenants, provided that such examination shall
be made at the office at which the records are kept and during the hours that
such office is open for business.
   (C)   As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when due are
declared to be delinquent and a penalty of 10% of the amount of the rates or
charges shall thereupon attach thereto. The time at which such rates or charges
shall be paid is now fixed at 15 days after the date of mailing of the bill.
   (D)   Any rates and charges not paid within 30 days of the date of billing
are subject to an interest rate charge of 1-1/2% per month for any month or
portion of a month such charges are not paid in full.
    (E)   Any rates and charges not paid within 30 days of the date of billing
are subject to litigation in a Court of Competent jurisdiction and any
attorney's fees, administrative costs, and/or court costs required to collect
any unpaid bills for rates and charges will be added to the bill and the amount
requested in any litigation.
   (F)   A $10 charge will be made or any check returned for insufficient funds
or for any other reason.

§ 31.07 INTEREST CHARGES.
   In order to produce an amount sufficient to meet the interest on the revenue
bonds and other expenses payable prior to the completion of the works after the
contract for construction of the sewer system has been let and actual work
commenced thereunder, the owners of each and every lot, parcel of real estate
or building to be connected with the town's sanitary sewage system, as a result
of construction of the works, shall pay each month 55% of the rates and charges
established above for each month after the sanitary sewers are available for
connection and use to any lot, parcel of real estate or building, the full
rates and charges shall become effective for such lot, parcel of real estate or
building; but in any event, the full rates and charges shall become effective
no later than 12 months following the closing of the sale of the revenue bonds.
(1989 Code, § 31.07) (Ord. SR-83, passed 10-11-1983)
§ 31.08 RATE REVIEW STUDY.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain
fair and equitable and be in proportion to the cost of providing services to
the various users or user classes, the town shall cause a study to be made
within a reasonable period of time following the first 2 years of operation,
following the date on which this chapter goes into effect. Such study shall
include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the costs associated with the
treatment of excessive strength effluents from industrial users, volume and
delivery flow rate characteristics attributed to the various users or user
classes, the financial position of the sewage works and the adequacy of its
revenue to provide reasonable funds for the operation and maintenance,
replacements, debt service requirements and capital improvements to the waste
treatment systems.
   (B)   Thereafter, on a biennial basis, within a reasonable period of time
following the normal accounting period, the town shall cause a similar study to
be made for the purpose of reviewing the fairness and equity of the rates and
charges for sewage services on a continuing basis. The studies shall be
conducted by officers or employees of the town, or by a firm of certified
public accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers, which firms shall have
experience in such studies, or by such combination of officers, employees,
certified public accountants, or engineers as the town shall determine to be
best under the circumstances.
(1989 Code, § 31.08) (Ord. SR-83, passed 10-11-1983)
§ 31.09 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   The town shall make and enforce such by-laws and regulations as may be
deemed necessary for the safe, economical and efficient management of the
town's sewage system, pumping stations and sewage treatment works, for the
construction and use of house sewers and connections to the sewage system, and
for the regulations, collection, rebating and refunding of such rates and
charges.
   (B)   The town is authorized to prohibit dumping of wastes into the town's
sewage system which, in its discretion, are deemed harmful to the operation of

   The rules and regulations promulgated by the town, after approval of the
Town Council, shall, among other things, provide for an appeal procedure
whereby a user shall have the right to appeal a decision of the Administrator
of the user charge to the Town Council and that any decision concerning user
charges of the Town Council may be appealed to the Circuit Court of Hancock
County, Indiana, under the appeal procedures provided for in the Indiana
Administrative Adjudication Act.

the cost thereof, the collection, segregation and distribution of the revenues
of said works, the safeguarding of the interests of the holders of said bonds,
and other matters connected therewith," and in strict compliance with the
provisions of I.C. 369-23, and all acts supplemental thereto.
   Pursuant to the provisions of said Act and said ordinance, the principal and
interest of this bond and all other bonds of said issue, and any bonds ranking
on a parity therewith, are payable solely from the Sewage Works Sinking Fund
(created by said ordinance) to be provided from the net revenues (herein
defined as gross revenues after deduction only for the payment of the
reasonable expenses of operation, repair and maintenance) of the sewage works
of the Town, including the works constructed or acquired by the use of the
proceeds of this bond and the issue of which it is a part, and all additions
and improvements thereto and replacements thereof subsequently constructed or
required. This bond shall not constitute an indebtedness of the Town of New
Palestine within the meaning of the provisions and limitations of the
constitution of the State of Indiana, and the Town shall not be obligated to

   The Town of New Palestine irrevocably pledges the entire net revenues of

bonds issued on account of the construction of said sewage works, of which this
bond is one, and any bonds ranking on a parity therewith, to the extent

provided for in said I.C. 36-9-23, and the acts supplemental thereto, including
the right to have a receiver appointed to administer the works and to charge
and collect rates sufficient to provide for the payment of this bond and the
interest thereon.
   The Town further covenants that it will set aside and pay into its Sewage
Works Sinking Fund a sufficient amount of the net revenues of said works to
meet (a) the interest on this bond and all other bonds which, by their terms,
are payable from the revenues of said sewage works, as such interest shall fall
due, (b) the necessary fiscal agency charges for paying the bonds and interest,
(c) the principal of this bond and all other bonds payable from the revenues of

   There is hereby created a fund to be known as the "Operation and Maintenance
Fund," to which Fund there shall be credited as of the last day of each
calendar month a sufficient amount of the revenues of the sewage works so that

repair and maintenance for the then next succeeding 2 calendar months. The
monies credited to this Fund shall be used for the payment of the reasonable
and proper operation, repair and maintenance expenses of the sewage works on a
day-to-day basis, but none of the monies in such Fund shall be used for
depreciation, replacements, improvements, extensions or additions. Any balance
in the Fund in excess of the expected operation, repair and maintenance for the
next succeeding month may be transferred to the Sewage Works Sinking Fund if
necessary to prevent a default in the payment of principal or interest on the
outstanding bonds.
(1989 Code, § 32.10) (Ord. SB-83, passed 9-21-1983)
§ 32.11 SINKING FUND.
   (A)   Fund created. There is created a sinking fund for the payment of the
principal of and interest on revenue bonds which by their terms are payable
from the revenues of the sewage works, and the payment of any fiscal agency
charges in connection with the payment of bonds and interest, which fund shall
be designated the "Sewage Works Sinking Fund." There shall be set aside and
deposited in the Sinking Fund, as available, and as hereinafter provided, a
sufficient amount of the net revenues of said sewage works (defined as gross
revenues of the sewage works after deduction only for the payment of the
reasonable expenses of operation, repair and maintenance) to meet the
requirements of the Bond and Interest Account and of the Debt Service Reserve
Account created in the Sewage Works Sinking Fund. Such payments shall continue
until the balance in the Bond and Interest Account, plus the balance of the
Debt Service Reserve Account hereinafter created, equal the principal of and
interest on all of the then outstanding bonds to the final maturity thereof.
   (B)   Bond and Interest Account. As soon as the sewage works becomes revenue
producing, there shall be credited on the first day of each calendar month to
the Bond and Interest Account an amount equal to the sum of one-tenth of the
interest on all then outstanding bonds payable on the then next succeeding
interest payment date, and one-tenth of the amount of principal payable on the
then outstanding bonds which will be payable on the then next succeeding
principal payment date, until the amount of interest and principal payable on
the then next succeeding respective principal and interest payment dates shall
have been so credited. There shall similarly be credited to the account the
amount necessary to pay any bank fiscal agency charges for paying principal and
interest on the bonds as the same become payable. The town shall, from the sums
deposited in the Sewage Works Sinking Fund and credited to the Bond and
Interest Account, remit promptly to the bond holders or the bank fiscal agency
sufficient monies to pay the principal and interest on the due dates thereof
together with the amount of bank fiscal agency charges.
   (C)   Debt Service Reserve Account. On the first day of each calendar month,
after making the credits to the Bond and Interest Account, there shall be
credited from available net revenues to the Debt Service Reserve Account the
sum of $580, or such higher amount as may be fixed from time to time by the
Town Council of the town. The credits to the Debt Service Reserve Account shall
continue until the balance therein shall equal not less than the maximum annual
principal and interest requirements of the then outstanding bonds payable from
the Sewage Works Sinking Fund. The Debt Service Reserve Account shall
constitute the margin for safety and as a protection against default in the
payment of principal of and interest on the bonds, and the monies in the Debt
Service Reserve Account shall be used to pay current principal and interest on
the bonds to the extent that monies in the Bond and Interest Account are
insufficient for that purpose. Any deficiencies in credits to the Debt Service
Reserve Account shall be promptly made up from the next available net revenues
remaining after credits into the Bond and Interest Account. In the event monies
in the Debt Service Reserve Account are transferred to the Bond and Interest
Account to pay principal and interest on bonds, then such depletion of the
balance in the Debt Service Reserve Account shall be made up from the next
available net revenues after the credits into the Bond and Interest Account
hereinbefore provided for. Any monies in the Debt Reserve Account in excess of
the maximum annual principal and interest requirements of the then outstanding
bonds may be used for the redemption of bonds which are then callable, or for
the purchase of outstanding bonds at a price not exceeding the then applicable
redemption price or the first redemption price if the bonds are not callable,
or may be transferred to the Sewage Works Improvement Fund.

the Sewage Works Sinking Fund, any excess revenues may be transferred or
credited to a fund designated the "Sewage Works Improvement Fund," and said
Fund shall be used for improvements, replacements, additions and extensions of
the sewage works. Moneys in the Sewage Works Improvement Fund shall be
transferred to the Sewage Works Sinking Fund if necessary to prevent a default
in the payment of principal and interest on the then outstanding bonds or if
necessary to eliminate any deficiencies in credits to or minimum balance in the
Debt Service Reserve Account of the Sewage Works Sinking Fund.

obligations of the United States of America in accordance with the applicable
laws, including particularly Chapter 9 of the Acts of the Indiana General
Assembly for the year 1945, as codified or supplemented, and in the event of

any and all use of such works by and service rendered to the town and all
departments thereof as the charges accrue.

   (D)   The Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner has
the authority to modify, grant exemptions, and/or waive any and all the
requirements of this chapter and its associated technical standards document. A
pre-submittal meeting with the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building
Commissioner may be requested by the applicant to discuss the applicability of
various provisions of this chapter and its associated technical standards
document with regards to unique or unusual circumstances relating to a project.
However, any initial determination of such applicability shall not be binding
on future determinations of the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or
Building Commissioner that may he based on the review of more detailed
information and plans.
(Ord. 051805, passed 5-18-2005)
§ 33.003 BACKGROUND.
   (A)   The Town Council of the Town of New Palestine, State of Indiana,
adopted Ordinance No. 1997-3D in 1997, as amended by Ordinance No. 2001-10E in
October 2001, which established "Storm Drainage, Erosion, and Sediment Control
Ordinance of Town of New Palestine", commonly known as the "Town of New
Palestine Drainage Code", in order to govern the control of runoff of
stormwater and to protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of the
land in the town and its water resources. This code was primarily targeted at
stormwater discharge quantity, and erosion and sediment control.
   (B)   On December 8, 1999, Phase II of the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit program, was published in the Federal
Register. The NPDES program, as authorized by the 1972 amendments to the Clean
Water Act, controls water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge
pollutants into waters of the United States. Phase II of NPDES requires permit
coverage for stormwater discharges from regulated small municipal separate
storm sewer systems (MS4s) and for small construction activity that results in
the disturbance of equal to or greater than 1 acre. This Federal regulation
went into affect March 10, 2003. In response to Phase II of NPDES, the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management enacted Rule 13 (327 IAC 15-13) and
revised Rule 5 (327 IAC 15-5).
   (C)   Under these new state and federal regulations, the town is required to
establish a regulatory mechanism for regulating stormwater quality management.
Therefore, the "Hancock County Drainage Code" was replaced with a new drainage
code to include stormwater quality in addition to quantity and the town
believes it to be in the best interest of the health, safety, and welfare of
the citizens of the town that a similar ordinance be adopted by said town.
(Ord. 051805, passed 5-18-2005)
§ 33.004 FINDINGS.
   The Town Council finds that:
   (A)   Water bodies, roadways, structures, and other property within, and
downstream of town are at times subjected to flooding;
   (B)   Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is
also a danger to the natural resources of the region;
   (C)   Land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds,
resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, increased flooding,
increased stream channel erosion, and increased sediment transport and
deposition;
   (D)   Soil erosion resulting from land-disturbing activities causes a
significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to be transported off-site
and deposited in ditches, streams, wetlands, lakes, and reservoirs;
   (E)   Increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments and
pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects
within the town will, absent reasonable regulation and control, adversely
affect the town's water bodies and water resources;
   (F)   Pollutant contributions from illicit discharges within the town will,
absent reasonable regulation, monitoring, and enforcement, adversely affect the
town's water bodies and water resources;
   (G)   Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, non-point source pollution, and
illicit sources of pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation
of stormwater management;
   (H)   Adopting the standards, criteria, and procedures contained and
referenced in this chapter and implementing the same will address many of the
deleterious effects of stormwater runoff and illicit discharges;
   (I)   Adopting this chapter is necessary for the preservation of the public
health, safety, and welfare, for the conservation of our natural resources, and
for compliance with state and federal regulations.
(Ord. 051805, passed 5-18-2005)
§ 33.005 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the town through the regulation of
stormwater and non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system and to
protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land and water
resources within the town. This chapter establishes methods for managing the
quantity and quality of stormwater entering into the storm drain system in
order to comply with state and federal requirements. The objectives of this
chapter are:
   (A)   To reduce the hazard to public health and safety caused by excessive
stormwater runoff.
   (B)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain system
from construction site runoff.
   (C)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain system
from runoff from new development and re-development.

33.106
§ 33.028 PRIVATE PROPERTY MAINTENANCE DUTIES.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse located
within their property boundaries, free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation,
and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard
the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee
shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a
watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use,
function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 051805, passed 5-18-2005)
§ 33.029 SPILL REPORTING.
   (A)   Any discharger who accidentally discharges into a waterbody any
substance other than stormwater or an exempted discharge shall immediately
inform the hazardous response team through the dispatcher at telephone number
911 concerning the discharge. A written report concerning the discharge shall
be filed with the Town Manager's office and IDEM, by the dischargers, within 5
days. The written report shall specify:
      (1)   The composition of the discharge and the cause thereof;
      (2)   The date, time, and estimated volume of the discharge;
      (3)   All measures taken to clean up the accidental discharge, and all
measures proposed to be taken to prevent any recurrence;
      (4)   The name and telephone number of the person making the report, and
the name and telephone number of a person who may be contacted for additional
information on the matter.
   (B)   A properly reported accidental discharge shall be an affirmative
defense to a civil infraction proceeding brought under this chapter against a
discharger for such discharge. It shall not, however, be a defense to a legal
action brought to obtain an injunction, to obtain recovery of costs or to
obtain other relief because of or arising out of the discharge. A discharge
shall be considered properly reported only if the discharger complies with all
the requirements of this section. This requirement does not relieve discharger
from notifying other entities as required by state or federal regulations.
(Ord. 051805, passed 5-18-2005) Penalty, see §
33.106
§ 33.030 INSPECTIONS AND MONITORING.
   (A)   Storm drainage system. The Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or
Building Commissioner has the authority to periodically inspect the portion of
the storm drainage system under the town's control, in an effort to detect and
eliminate illicit connections and discharges into the system. This inspection
will include a screening of discharges from outfalls connected to the system in
order to determine if prohibited flows are being conveyed into the storm
drainage system. It could also include spot testing of waters contained in the
storm drainage system itself to detect the introduction of pollutants into the
system by means other than a defined outfall, such as dumping or contaminated
sheet runoff.
   (B)   Potential polluters. If, as a result of the storm drainage system
inspection, a discharger is suspected of an illicit discharge, the Town Council
and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner may inspect and/or obtain
stormwater samples from stormwater runoff facilities of the subject discharger,
to determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter. Upon request,
the discharger shall allow the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building
Commissioner's properly identified representative to enter upon the premises of
the discharger at all hours necessary for the purposes of such inspection or
sampling. The Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner or
its properly identified representative may place on the discharger's property
the equipment or devices used for such sampling or inspection. Identified
illicit connections or discharges shall be subject to enforcement action as
described in §§
33.105 through
33.111.
   (C)   New development and re-development. Following the final completion of
construction and the receipt of as-built drawings by the Town Manager's office,
the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner has the
authority to inspect new development and re-development sites to verify that
all on-site stormwater conveyances and connections to the storm drainage system
are in compliance with this chapter.
(Ord. 051805, passed 5-18-2005)
STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT
§ 33.045 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   The storage and controlled release rate of excess stormwater runoff shall be
required for all new business, commercial and industrial developments,
residential subdivisions, planned development, rural estate subdivisions, and
any redevelopment or other new construction located within town. The Town
Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner, after thorough
investigation and evaluation, may waive the requirement of controlled runoff
for minor subdivisions and parcelization. Additional exemptions regarding the
detention requirements are provided under §
33.046(A)(5).
(Ord. 051805, passed 5-18-2005)
§ 33.046 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Detention policy. It is recognized that most streams and drainage
channels serving the town do not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey
stormwater runoff resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, except
for situations provided in divisions (A)(1) and (4) below, the storage and
controlled release of excess stormwater runoff shall be required for all
developments and redevelopments (as defined in
Appendix A) located within the town.
      (1)   General release rates. In general, the post-development release
rates for developments up to and including the 10-year return period storm may
not exceed 0.1 cfs per acre of development. The post-development release rate
for developments for the 10 - 100-year return period storms shall not exceed
0.3 cfs per acre of development. For sites where the pre-developed area has
more than 1 outlet, the release rate should be computed based on pre-developed
discharge to each outlet point. The computed release rate for each outlet point
shall not be exceeded at the respective outlet point even if the post developed
conditions would involve a different arrangement of outlet points.
      (2)   Site-specific release rates for sites with depressional storage.
         (a)   For sites where depressional storage exists, the general release
rates provided above may have to be further reduced. If depressional storage
exists at the site, site-specific release rates must be calculated according to
methodology described in the town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual,
accounting for the depressional storage by modeling it as a pond whose outlet
is a weir at an elevation that stormwater can currently overflow the
depressional storage area. Post developed release rate for sites with
depressional storage shall be the 2-year pre-developed peak runoff rate for the
post-developed 10-year storm and 10-year pre-developed peak runoff rate for the
post-developed 100-year storm. In no case shall the calculated site-specific
release rates be larger than general release rates provided above.
         (b)   Also note that for determining the post-developed peak runoff
rate, the depressional storage must be assumed to be filled unless the Town
Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner can be assured,
through dedicated easement, that the noted storage will be preserved in
perpetuity.
      (3)   Management of off-site runoff.  
         (a)   Runoff from all upstream tributary areas (off-site land areas)
may be bypassed around the detention/retention facility without attenuation.
Such runoff may also be bypassed through the detention/retention facility
without attenuation, provided that a separate outlet system or channel is
incorporated for the safe passage of such flows, such as, not through the
primary outlet of a detention facility. Unless the pond is being designed as a
regional detention facility, the primary outlet structure shall be sized and
the invert elevation of the emergency overflow weir determined according to the
on-site runoff only. Once the size and location of primary outlet structure and
the invert elevation of the emergency overflow weir are determined by
considering on-site runoff, the 100-year pond elevation is determined by
routing the entire inflow, on-site and off-site, through the pond.
         (b)   Note that the efficiency of the detention/retention facility in
controlling the on-site runoff may be severely affected if the off-site area is
considerably larger than the on-site area. As a general guidance, on-line
detention may not be effective in controlling on-site runoff where the ratio of
off-site area to on-site area is larger than 5:1. Additional detention (above
and beyond that required for on-site area) may be required by the Town Council
and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner when the ratio of off-site
area to on-site area is larger than 5:1.
      (4)   Downstream restrictions.
         (a)   In the event the downstream receiving channel or storm sewer
system is inadequate to accommodate the post-developed release rate provided
above, then the allowable release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted
by the capacity of the receiving downstream channel or storm sewer system.
Additional detention, as determined by the Town Council and/or Town Manager
and/or Building Commissioner, shall be required to store that portion of the
runoff exceeding the capacity of the receiving sewers or watercourses. When
such downstream restrictions are suspected, the Town Council and/or Town
Manager and/or Building Commissioner may require additional analysis to
determine the receiving system's limiting downstream capacity.
         (b)   If the proposed development makes up only a portion of the
undeveloped watershed upstream of the limiting restriction, the allowable
release rate for the development shall be in direct proportion to the ratio of
its drainage area to the drainage area of the entire watershed upstream of the
restriction.
      (5)   Exemptions for detention requirements detention will not be
required for the following:
         (a)   Notwithstanding the requirements for an individual lot plot plan
permit in this chapter, land alterations where the primary basis on which a
stormwater drainage permit is required is the construction, enlargement, or
location (on a permanent foundation) of a one-family dwelling, two-family
dwelling, or accessory structure appurtenant to either a one- or two-family
dwelling.
         (b)   Accepted fill areas or one-time addition to existing commercial
buildings that do not increase the amount of impervious area on-site by more
than a total of 0.5 acres, provided the existing runoff patterns and flow
capacity within the property will not be altered by the filling operations.
         (c)   Not withstanding the provisions of division (A)(4) above, those
site developments where the stormwater management system has been designed such
that:
            1.   After combining flows from both the off-site and on-site
drainage areas, there will be no increase in the total peak discharge from the
developing site during the 2-, 10-, and 100-year storm events;
            2.   The volume of runoff for each project site outlet has not been
increased for the 2-, 10-, and 100-year storm events; and
            3.   The flow width and velocity at the property boundary line for
each sub-basin is less than or equal to that flow width and velocity which
existed prior to the development for the 2-, 10-, and 100-year storm events.
         (d)   Where the direct release of runoff from the proposed development
meets the conditions set forth in division (A)(6) below.
      (6)   Direct release provisions. It is the policy of the Town Council
and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner to allow the direct release
(no detention) of runoff from a proposed development to an adjacent stream with
more than 100 square miles of contributing drainage area at the direct release
point. Therefore, direct release may be allowed for parcels adjacent to the
following stream reaches in the town.
   (B)   Grading and building pad elevations.
      (1)   Maximum yard slopes are 3:1 where soil has been disturbed during
construction processes. Finished floor elevation must be no less than 18 inches
above finished grade and a minimum of 24 inches above an adjacent road
elevation unless a written variance is granted by the Town Council and/or Town
Manager and/or Building Commissioner.
      (2)   For all structures located in the Special Flood Hazards Area (SFHA)
as shown on the FEMA maps, the lowest finished floor elevations of all
residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, shall be such that lowest
finished floor elevation, including basement, shall be at the flood protection
grade and therefore have 2 feet of freeboard above the 100-year flood
elevation.
      (3)   The lowest adjacent grade for residential, commercial, or
industrial buildings outside a FEMA or IDNR designated floodplain shall have 2
feet of freeboard above the flooding source's 100-year flood elevation under
proposed conditions, unless the flooding source is a rear-yard swale. When the
flooding source is a rear-yard swale, the lowest adjacent grade for
residential, commercial, or industrial buildings shall have 2 feet of freeboard
above the 100-year flood elevation under proposed conditions or be separated by
a minimum distance of 50 feet from the proposed condition 100-year flood
boundary.
      (4)   For areas outside a FEMA or IDNR designated floodplain, the lowest
adjacent grade (including walkout basement floor elevation) for all
residential, commercial, or industrial buildings adjacent to ponds shall be set
a minimum of 2 feet above the 100-year pond elevation or 2 feet above the
emergency overflow weir elevation, whichever is higher. In addition to the
lowest adjacent grade requirements, any basement floor must be at least 1 foot
above the permanent water level (normal pool elevation).
      (5)   The 100-year flood flow paths throughout the development, whether
shown on FEMA maps or not, must be shown as hatched area on the plans and 15
feet (measured perpendicularly to) each side of the centerline of the flow path
shall be contained within permanent drainage easements. A statement shall be
added to the plat that would refer the viewer to the construction plans to see
the entire extent of overflow path as hatched areas. No fences or landscaping
can be constructed within the easement areas that may impede the free flow of
stormwater. These areas are to be maintained by the property owners or be
designated as common areas that are to be maintained by the homeowners
association. The lowest adjacent grade for all residential, commercial, or
industrial buildings shall be set a minimum of 1 foot above the noted 100-year
overflow path/ponding elevation.
      (6)   It shall be the property owners' responsibility to maintain the
natural features on their lots and to take preventive measures against any and
all erosion and/or deterioration of natural or manmade features on their lots.
   (C)   Acceptable outlet and adjoining property impacts policies.
      (1)   Design and construction of the stormwater facility shall provide
for the discharge of the stormwater runoff from off-site land areas as well as
the stormwater from the area being developed (on-site land areas) to an
acceptable outlet(s) (as determined by the Town Council and/or Town Manager
and/or Building Commissioner) having capacity to receive upstream (off-site)
and on-site drainage. The flow path from the development outfall(s) to a
regulated drain or natural watercourse (as determined by the Town Council and/
or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner) shall be provided on an exhibit
that includes topographic information. Any existing field tile encountered
during the construction shall also be incorporated into the proposed stormwater
drainage system or tied to an acceptable outlet.
      (2)   Where the outfall from the stormwater drainage system of any
development flows through real estate owned by others prior to reaching a
regulated drain or watercourse, no acceptance shall be granted for such
drainage system until all owners of real estate and/or tenants crossed by the
outfall consent in writing to the use of their real estate through a recorded
easement. In addition, no activities conducted as part of the development shall
be allowed to obstruct the free flow of flood waters from an upstream property
– including the upstream property's tile system.
      (3)   If an adequate outlet is not located on site, then off-site
drainage improvements may be required. Those improvements may include, but are
not limited to, extending storm sewers, clearing, dredging and/or removal of
obstructions to open drains or natural water courses, and the removal or
replacement of undersized culvert pipes as required by the Town Council and/or
Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner.
   (D)   No net loss floodplain storage policy.
      (1)   Floodplains exist adjacent to all natural and man-made streams,
regardless of contributing drainage area or whether they have been previously
identified or mapped. Due to potential impacts of floodplain loss on peak flows
in streams and on the environment, disturbance to floodplains should be
avoided. When the avoidance of floodplain disturbance is not practical, the
natural functions of floodplain should be preserved to the extent possible.
      (2)   In an attempt to strike a balance between the legitimate need for
economic development within town and the need to preserve the natural functions
of floodplains to the extent possible, compensatory excavation equivalent to
the floodplain storage lost shall be required for all activities within
floodplain of streams located in Hancock County where drainage area of the
stream is equal or larger than 1 square mile. This requirement shall be
considered to be above and beyond the minimum requirements provided in the
applicable flood hazard areas ordinance currently in effect in the town. The
Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner may alter the
compensation ratio, based on extenuating circumstances, for a specific project.
      (3)   Note that by definition, compensatory storage is the replacement of
the existing floodplain and, in rare exceptions, the floodway storage lost due
to fill. Compensatory storage is required when a portion of the floodplain is
filled, occupied by a structure, or when as a result of a project a change in
the channel hydraulics occurs that reduces the existing available floodplain
storage. The compensatory storage should be located adjacent or opposite the
placement of the fill and maintain an unimpeded connection to an adjoining
floodplain area.
      (4)   Computations must show no net loss of floodplain storage for 2-
year, 10-year, 50-year, and 100-year storm events. That is, the post-
development 2-year floodplain storage along a stream shall be the same as 2-
year pre-development floodplain storage along the stream within the property
limits, the post-development 10-year floodplain storage along a stream shall be
the same as 10-year pre-development floodplain storage along the stream within
the property limits, and so on.
      (5)   Calculations for floodplain volume shall be submitted in tabular
form showing calculations by cross-section. The volume of floodplain storage
under the without-project conditions and the with-project conditions should be
determined using the average-end-area method with plotted cross-sections at a
horizontal to vertical ratio of between 5:1 and 10:1, with 2- through 100-year
flood elevations noted on each cross section. The scale chosen should be large
enough to show the intent of proposed grading. Cross-sections should reflect
both the existing and proposed conditions on the same plot. The location and
extent of the compensatory storage area as well as the location and orientation
of cross-sections should be shown on the grading plan.

§ 33.047 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS SPECIFICATIONS.
   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of all
stormwater facilities shall meet the design criteria, standards, and
specifications outlined in the town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. The
methods and procedures in the Stormwater Technical Standards Manual are
consistent with the policy stated above.
(Ord. 051805, passed 5-18-2005)
§ 33.048 DRAINAGE EASEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   There shall be no trees or shrubs planted, nor any structures or
fences erected in any drainage easement, unless otherwise accepted in writing
by the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner. All
stormwater systems, including detention or retention basins, conveyance
systems, structures and appurtenances, located outside of the right-of-way may
be incorporated into the town's system at the discretion of the Town Council
and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner. The developer shall petition
to incorporate the storm system into the town's system. The stormwater
management permit shall not be approved until such petition is submitted in a
form accepted by the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building
Commissioner.
   (B)   The following specific areas shall be included in a petition:
      (1)   Subdivisions.
         (a)   All new channels, drain tiles equal to or greater than 8 inches
in diameter, inlet and outlet structures of detention and retention ponds, and
appurtenances thereto as required by this chapter, that are installed in
subdivisions requiring a stormwater management permit from the town shall be
petitioned to become incorporated into the town's system upon completion,
proper inspection, and acceptance by the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/
or Building Commissioner. New drain tiles refer to all sub-surface stormwater
piping, tubing, tiles, manholes, inlets, catch basins, risers and the like.
         (b)   New drain tile, 8 inches to 24 inches in diameter, shall be
placed in a minimum 20-foot easement (10 feet from centerline on each side) and
shall be designated on the record plat as 20-foot Regulated Drain Easement
(RDE). Pipes that are 24 inches or larger in diameter shall be placed in a 30-
foot easement (15 feet from centerline on each side) and shall be designated on
the record plat as 30-foot Regulated Drain Easement. Wider easements may be
required by the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner
when the depth of pipe is greater than 6 to 10 feet, depending on the pipe
size.
         (c)   A minimum of 25 feet from top of the bank on each side of a new
channel shall be designated on the record plat as a regulated drain easement.
         (d)   Rear-yard swales and emergency overflow paths associated with
detention ponds shall not be included in petition for incorporation. However, a
minimum of 30 feet width (15 feet from centerline on each side) needs to be
designated as drainage easement.
         (e)   A minimum of 30 feet beyond the actual footprint (top of the
bank) of stormwater detention facilities shall be designated as drainage
easement. A minimum 30-foot width easement shall also be required as access
easement, unless the pond is immediately next to a public right-of-way.
         (f)   The statutory 75-foot (each side) drainage easement for
regulated drains already within the town's system may be reduced if the drain
is re-classified by the County Surveyor as an urban drain.
         (g)   An annual maintenance assessment shall be set up on each new
regulated drain established in a new subdivision. The amount of the assessment
will be determined by the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building
Commissioner and so certified.
         (h)   If the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building
Commissioner accepts the petition for incorporation into their system, the
following statement shall become part of the restrictive covenants of every
platted subdivision and shown on recorded plat: "Channels, tile drains 8-inch
or larger, inlets and outlets of detention and retention ponds, and
appurtenances thereto within designated drain easements are extensions of the
town's stormwater drainage system and are the responsibility of the Town
Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner. Drainage swales and
tile drains less than 8-inch in inside diameter shall be the responsibility of
owner or homeowner association."
         (i)   The following statement shall be put on each subdivision plat:
"A petition addressed to the Town Council has been filed in duplicate with the
County Surveyor, requesting that the subdivision's storm drainage system and
its easements be accepted into the town's regulated drainage system. The storm
drainage system and its easements that are accepted into the town's regulated
drainage system are delineated on the plat as Regulated Drainage Easements
(RDEs). Regulated Drainage Easements are stormwater easements and drainage
rights of way that are hereby dedicated to the public and to the Hancock
County, Indiana, Drainage Board for the sole and exclusive purpose of
controlling surface water and/or for the installation, operation, and
maintenance of storm sewers and tile drains as defined in
Appendix A of this chapter. These drainage easements are established under
authority of the Indiana Drainage Code and the said Board may exercise powers
and duties as provided in said code (e.g., annual drainage assessment per lot).
All other storm drainage easements have not been accepted into the town's
system. All drainage improvements performed relative to the conveyance of
stormwater runoff and the perpetual maintenance thereof, within the latter
easements, shall be the responsibility of the owner or homeowner association.
The Town Council assumes no responsibility relative to said improvements or the
maintenance thereof. This subdivision contains           linear feet of open
ditches and            linear feet of subsurface drains that will be included
in the town's regulated drainage system." The noted regulated drain lengths,
broken down by the length of open and tile drains, shall also be shown in
tabular form in a prominent position on the plat.
         (j)   Any crossing and/or encroachment of a regulated drainage
easement requires application and acceptance from the Town Manager's office.
      (2)   Non-subdivisions. Where the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or
Building Commissioner is responsible for maintenance of the drainage system,
regulated drainage easements of 75 feet from the top of bank on each side of
the channel or each side of the tile centerline must be dedicated to town. In
addition, a minimum of 25-foot width of vegetative filter strip must be
provided and maintained along top-of-bank, on each side, by the applicant
within these easements.
      (3)   Establishment of new regulated drain. When the Town Council and/or
Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner determines it is necessary to
establish a new regulated drain, each developer shall provide the necessary
information and meet the requirements of the 1965 Indiana Drainage Code, as
amended, for the establishment of a new regulated drain. Necessary easements
for adequate maintenance of any new regulated drain shall be determined by the
Town Manager if not already established in this chapter.
      (4)   Municipalities and schools. All new channels, swales, drain tiles,
inlet and outlet structures of detention and retention ponds, and appurtenances
thereto as required by this chapter, that are installed on the municipal or
school property will be maintained, repaired, and constructed by the entity and
will not become county-regulated drains. The design must meet the standards of
this chapter for sizing and installation. Any off-site portion of the drainage
system must be within easements and have clearly defined maintenance
agreements.

33.106
§ 33.049 PLACEMENT OF UTILITIES.
   No utility company may disturb existing storm drainage facilities without
the consent of the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building
Commissioner, whose decision may be appealed to the Town Council. All existing
drainage facilities shall have senior rights and damage to said facilities
shall result in penalties as prescribed in §§
33.105 through
33.111.
(Ord. 051805, passed 5-18-2005)
§ 33.050 STRUCTURES NEAR COUNTY-REGULATED DRAINS.
   For regulated drains not located in platted subdivisions, unless otherwise
accepted by the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner,
no permanent structure (including fences) shall be erected within 75 feet
measured at right angles from: (1) the existing top edge of each bank of a
regulated open drain, as determined by the Town Council and/or Town Manager
and/or Building Commissioner; or (2) the center line of a tiled regulated
drain. The Indiana Drainage Code may be consulted for further details.
(Ord. 051805, passed 5-18-2005)
§ 33.051 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING AND REPORTING.
   (A)   After the approval of the stormwater management permit by the Town
Council and the commencement of construction activities, the Town Council and/
or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner has the authority to conduct
inspections of the work being done to insure full compliance with the
provisions of this chapter, the Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and the
terms and conditions of the approved permit.
   (B)   The Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner also
has the authority to perform long-term, post-construction inspection of all
public or privately owned stormwater quantity facilities. The inspection will
cover physical conditions, available storage capacity, and the operational
condition of key facility elements. Stormwater quantity facilities shall be
maintained in good condition, in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the approved stormwater management permit, and shall not be subsequently
altered, revised or replaced except in accordance with the approved stormwater
permit, or in accordance with approved amendments or revisions to the permit.
If deficiencies are found during the inspection, the owner of the facility will
be notified by Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner
and will be required to take all necessary measures to correct such
deficiencies. If the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the allowed
time period, as specified in the notification letter, the Town Council and/or
Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner will undertake the work and collect
from the owner using lien rights if necessary.
   (C)   Assignment of responsibility for maintaining facilities serving more
than 1 lot or holding shall be documented by appropriate covenants to property
deeds, unless responsibility is formally accepted by a public body, and
determined before the final stormwater permit is approved. Stormwater
detention/retention basins may be donated to the Town of or other unit of
government designated by the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building
Commissioner, for ownership and permanent maintenance providing the Town
Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner or other governmental
unit is willing to accept responsibility.

STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION FOR CONSTRUCTION SITES
§ 33.065 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   The Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner will
require a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP), which includes erosion
and sediment control measures and materials handling procedures, to be
submitted as part of the construction plans and specifications. Any project
located within town that includes clearing, grading, excavation, and other land
disturbing activities, resulting in the disturbance of 1 acre or more of total
land area, is subject to the requirements of this chapter. This includes both
new development and re-development. This chapter also applies to disturbances
of less than 1 acre of land that are part of a larger common plan of
development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb 1 or more
acres of land, within the MS4 area. Section
33.067 of this chapter provides guidelines for calculating land disturbance.
Projects meeting the coverage requirements of 327 IAC 15-5 (Rule 5) shall also
be in compliance with 327 IAC 15-5.
   (B)   The requirements under this chapter do not apply to the following
activities:
      (1)   Agricultural land disturbing activities; or
      (2)   Forest harvesting activities.
   (C)   The requirements under this chapter do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10;
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34; or
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under
329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the
expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or
outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
   (D)   For an individual lot where land disturbance is expected to be 1 acre
or more, the individual lot owner must complete their own notice of intent
letter, apply for a stormwater permit from the Town Council (Board's designee –
Town Manager), and ensure that a sufficient construction and stormwater
pollution prevention plan is completed and submitted in accordance with §§
33.085 through
33.093; regardless of whether the individual lot is part of a larger permitted
project site.
   (E)   An individual lot with land disturbance less than 1 acre, located
within a larger permitted project site, is considered part of the larger
permitted project site, and the individual lot operator must comply with the
terms and conditions of the stormwater permit approved for the larger project
site. The stormwater permit application for the larger project site must
include detailed erosion and sediment control measures for individual lots. In
addition, these individual lots are required to submit individual lot plot plan
permit applications prior to receiving a building permit. Details of the
permitting process are contained in §§
33.085 through
33.093.
   (F)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan is
completed and submitted to Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building
Commissioner in accordance with §§
33.085 through
33.093. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure
compliance with this chapter during the construction activity and
implementation of the construction plan, and to notify the Town Council and/or
Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner with a sufficient notice of
termination letter upon completion of the project and stabilization of the
site. However, all persons engaging in construction and land disturbing
activities on a permitted project site meeting the applicability requirements
must comply with the requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 051805, passed 5-18-2005)
§ 33.066 POLICY ON STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION.
   Effective stormwater pollution prevention on construction sites is dependent
on a combination of preventing movement of soil from its original position
(erosion control), intercepting displaced soil prior to entering a waterbody
(sediment control), and proper on-site materials handling. The developer must
submit to the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner, a
SWPPP with detailed erosion and sediment control plans as well as a narrative
describing materials handling and storage, and construction sequencing. The
following principles apply to all land-disturbing activities and should be
considered in the preparation of a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan within
the town.
   (A)   Minimize the potential for soil erosion by designing a development
that fits the topography and soils of the site. Deep cuts and fills in areas
with steep slopes should be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours
should be followed as closely as possible.
   (B)   Existing natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever
possible. Areas immediately adjacent (within 35 feet of top of bank) to
watercourses and lakes also should be left undisturbed wherever possible.
Unvegetated or vegetated areas with less than 70% cover that are scheduled or
likely to be left inactive for 15 days or more must be temporarily or
permanently stabilized with measures appropriate for the season to reduce
erosion potential. Alternative measures to site stabilization may be acceptable
if the project site owner or their representative can demonstrate they have
implemented and maintained erosion and sediment control measures adequate to
prevent sediment discharge from the inactive area.
   (C)   All activities on a site should be conducted in a logical sequence so
that the smallest practical area of land will be exposed for the shortest
practical period of time during development.
   (D)   The length and steepness of designed slopes should be minimized to
reduce erosion potential. Drainage channels and swales must be designed and
adequately protected so that their final gradients and resultant velocities
will not cause erosion in the receiving channel or at the outlet. Methods for
determining acceptable velocities are included Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual.
   (E)   Sediment-laden water which otherwise would flow from the project site
shall be treated by erosion and sediment control measures appropriate to
minimize sedimentation. A stable construction site access shall be provided at
all points of construction traffic ingress and egress to the project site.
   (F)   Appropriate measures shall be implemented to prevent wastes or unused
building materials, including, garbage, debris, packaging material, fuels and
petroleum products, hazardous materials or wastes, cleaning wastes, wastewater,
concrete truck washout, and other substances from being carried from a project
site by runoff or wind. Identification of areas where concrete truck washout is
permissible must be clearly posted at appropriate areas of the site. Wastes and
unused building materials shall be managed and disposed of in accordance with
all applicable state statutes and regulations. Proper storage and handling of
materials such as fuels or hazardous wastes, and spill prevention and cleanup
measures shall be implemented to minimize the potential for pollutants to
contaminate surface or ground water or degrade soil quality.
   (G)   Public or private roadways shall be kept cleared of accumulated
sediment that is a result of runoff or tracking. Bulk clearing of accumulated
sediment shall not include flushing the area with water. Cleared sediment shall
be redistributed or disposed of in a manner that is in accordance with all
applicable statutes and regulations.
   (H)   Collected runoff leaving a project site must be either discharged
directly into a well-defined, stable receiving channel, or diffused and
released to adjacent property without causing an erosion or pollutant problem
to the adjacent property owner.
   (I)   Natural features, including wetlands, shall be protected from
pollutants associated with stormwater runoff.
(Ord. 051805, passed 5-18-2005)
§ 33.067 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   In calculating the total area of land disturbance, for the purposes of
determining applicability of this chapter to the project, the following
guidelines should be used:
      (1)   Off-site construction activities that provide services (for
example, road extensions, sewer, water, and other utilities) to a land
disturbing project site, must be considered as a part of the total land
disturbance calculation for the project site, when the activity is under the
control of the project site owner.
      (2)   Strip developments will be considered as 1 project site and must
comply with this chapter unless the total combined disturbance on all
individual lots is less than 1 acre and is not part of a larger common plan of
development or sale.
      (3)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by this rule,
the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the total area of
land disturbance for improvements, such as, roads, utilities, or common areas,
and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as determined by the
following:
         (a)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
0.5 acre or more, 0.5 acre of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot
disturbance.
         (b)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
less than 0.5 acre in size, the total lot must be calculated as being
disturbed.
         (c)   To calculate lot disturbance on all other types of projects
sites, such as industrial and commercial projects project sites, a minimum of 1
acre of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance, unless
the lots are less than 1 acre in size, in which case the total lot must be
calculated as being disturbed.
   (B)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction sites shall meet
the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the "Indiana
Stormwater Quality Manual" or the town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
The methods and procedures included in these 2 references are in keeping with
the above stated policy and meet the requirements of IDEM's Rule 5.
(Ord. 051805, passed 5-18-2005)
§ 33.068 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING AND REPORTING.
   (A)   Following approval of the stormwater management permit by the Town
Council and commencement of construction activities, the Town Council and/or
Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner has the authority to conduct
inspections of the site to ensure full compliance with the provisions of this
chapter, the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual, and the terms and conditions of
the approved permit.
   (B)   A self-monitoring program must be implemented by the project site
owner to ensure the stormwater pollution prevention plan is working
effectively. A trained individual, acceptable to Town Council and/or Town
Manager and/or Building Commissioner, shall perform a written evaluation of the
project site by the end of the next business day following each measurable
storm event. If there are no measurable storm events within a given week, the
site should be monitored at least once in that week. Weekly inspections by the
trained individual shall continue until the entire site has been stabilized and
a notice of termination has been issued. The trained individual should look at
the maintenance of existing stormwater pollution prevention measures, including
erosion and sediment control measures, drainage structures, and construction
materials storage/containment facilities, to ensure they are functioning
properly. The trained individual should also identify additional measures,
beyond those originally identified in the stormwater pollution prevention plan,
necessary to remain in compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations.
   (C)   The resulting evaluation reports must include the name of the
individual performing the evaluation, the date of the evaluation, problems
identified at the project site, and details of maintenance, additional
measures, and corrective actions recommended and completed.
   (D)   The stormwater pollution prevention plan shall serve as a guideline
for stormwater quality, but should not be interpreted to be the only basis for
implementation of stormwater quality measures for a project site. The project
site owner is responsible for implementing, in accordance with this chapter,
all measures necessary to adequately prevent polluted stormwater runoff.
Recommendations by the trained individual for modified stormwater quality
measures should be implemented.
   (E)   Although self-monitoring reports do not need to be submitted to Town
Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner, the Town Council and/
or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner has the right to request complete
records of maintenance and monitoring activities involving stormwater pollution
prevention measures. All evaluation reports for the project site must be made
available to Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner, in
an organized fashion, within 48 hours upon request.
(Ord. 051805, passed 5-18-2005)
STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION
§ 33.075 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   In addition to the requirements of §§
33.065 through
33.068, the stormwater pollution prevention plan, which is to be submitted to
the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner as part of
the stormwater management permit application, must also include post-
construction stormwater quality measures. These measures are incorporated as a
permanent feature into the site plan and are left in place following completion
of construction activities to continuously treat stormwater runoff from the
stabilized site. Any project located within the town that includes clearing,
grading, excavation, and other land disturbing activities, resulting in the
disturbance of 1 acre or more of total land area, is subject to the
requirements of this chapter. This includes both new development and re-
development, and disturbances of less than 1 acre of land that are part of a
larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan will
ultimately disturb 1 or more acres of land, within the MS4 area.
   (B)   The requirements under this chapter do not apply to the following
activities:
      (1)   Agricultural land disturbing activities;
      (2)   Forest harvesting activities;
      (3)   Construction activities associated with a single family residential
dwelling disturbing less than 5 acres, when the dwelling is not part of a
larger common plan of development or sale;
      (4)   Single-family residential developments consisting of 4 or less
lots;
      (5)   A single-family residential strip development where the developer
offers for sale or lease without land improvements and the project is not part
of a larger common plan of development of sale; or
      (6)   Individual building lots within a larger permitted project.
   (C)   The requirements under this chapter do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10;
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34; or
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under
329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the
expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or
outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
   (D)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan is
completed and submitted to the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building
Commissioner in accordance with §§
33.085 through
33.093 of this chapter. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner
to ensure proper construction and installation of all stormwater BMPs in
compliance with this chapter and with the approved stormwater management
permit, and to notify the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building
Commissioner with a sufficient notice of termination letter upon completion of
the project and stabilization of the site. However, all eventual property
owners of stormwater quality facilities meeting the applicability requirements
must comply with the requirements of this chapter and this chapter.
(Ord. 051805, passed 5-18-2005)
§ 33.076 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to undeveloped
areas, generally have increased imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates,
increased runoff rates, and increased concentrations of pollutants such as
fertilizers, herbicides, greases, oil, salts and other pollutants. As new
development and re-development continues in the town, measures must be taken to
intercept and filter pollutants from stormwater runoff prior to reaching
regional creeks, streams, and rivers. Through the use of Best Management
Practices (BMP), stormwater runoff will be filtered and harmful amounts of
sediment, nutrients, and contaminants will be removed. The town has adopted a
policy that the control of stormwater quality will be based on the management
of Total Suspended Solids (TSS).
   (B)   The project site owner must submit to the Town Council and/or Town
Manager and/or Building Commissioner, a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWPPP) that would show placement of appropriate BMP(s) from a pre-approved

(Ord. 051805, passed 5-18-2005)
§ 33.079 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING AND REPORTING.
   (A)   After the approval of the stormwater management permit by the Town
Council and the commencement of construction activities, the Town Council and/
or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner has the authority to conduct
inspections of the work being done to ensure full compliance with the
provisions of this chapter, the Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and the
terms and conditions of the approved permit.
   (B)   Stormwater quality facilities shall be maintained in good condition,

PERMIT REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES
§ 33.085 CONCEPTUAL DRAINAGE PLAN REVIEW.
   In order to gain an understanding of the drainage requirements for a
specific project, a developer may submit conceptual drainage plans and
calculations for review by the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building
Commissioner. The direction provided by the Town Council and/or Town Manager
and/or Building Commissioner during such a review is based on preliminary data
and shall not be construed as an approval or binding on either party. The
following is a general listing of minimum data requirements for the review of
conceptual drainage plans:
   (A)   Two complete sets of conceptual plans showing general project layout,
including existing and proposed drainage systems (plan sheets must be larger
than 11 inches by 17 inches, but not to exceed 24 inches by 36 inches).
   (B)   General description of the existing and proposed drainage systems in
narrative form.
   (C)   Watershed boundaries with USGS contours or best information possible.
   (D)   Existing watercourse or regulated drains.
(Ord. 051805, passed 5-18-2005)
§ 33.086 PERMIT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   This section applies to all development, or re-development of land,
that results in land disturbance of 1 acre or more. Individual lots with land
disturbance less than 1 acre that are developed within a larger permitted
project site, should refer to §
33.088 for plan review requirements and procedures.
   (B)   Figure 1 is a flowchart summarizing the plan review/permit approval
process and can be found at the end of this subchapter. For projects located
within the MS4 area boundary, as shown in
Appendix B, the project site owner shall submit an application for a stormwater
management permit to the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building
Commissioner. The application will include an Initial Notice of Intent letter
(NOI) (that would also act as permit application form), proof of public notice,
construction plan sheets, stormwater drainage technical report, a stormwater
pollution prevention plan, and any other necessary support information.
Specific information to be included in the application can be found in §
33.087 below. Four copies of each application must be submitted to the Town
Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner. Additionally, a
digital copy of the construction plans is required in a format accepted by the
Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner.
      (1)   After the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building
Commissioner receipt of the application, the applicant will be notified as to
whether their application was complete or insufficient. The applicant will be
asked for additional information if the application is insufficient. If the
application is complete, the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building
Commissioner will forward 1 copy of the application to the Soil and Water
Conservation District (SWCD) for its review and comment within a 10-day period.
The remaining 3 copies will be reviewed in detail by the Town Council and/or
Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner and/or its plan review consultant(s).
Once all comments have been received and review completed, the Town Council
and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner will either accept the
project, request modifications, or place the project on the agenda of the next
scheduled meeting of the Town Council. If the project must go through a
scheduled meeting, the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building
Commissioner will furnish the applicant a complete list of comments and
objections to the plans and accompanying data prior to the scheduled meeting.
After the scheduled meeting, the Town Council will either issue a permit, or
request modifications to the construction plans.
      (2)   The project site owner must notify the Town Council and/or Town
Manager and/or Building Commissioner and IDEM 48 hours before beginning
construction. Notification shall be in the form of an updated IDEM NOI form.
Once a permit has been issued and the updated NOI submitted to the Town Council
and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner and IDEM 48 hours before
beginning construction, construction may commence. Once construction starts,
the project owner shall monitor construction activities and inspect all
stormwater pollution prevention measures in compliance with this chapter and
the terms and conditions of the approved permit. Upon completion of
construction activities, as-built plans must be submitted to the Town Council
and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner. A Notice of Termination (NOT)
shall be sent to the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building
Commissioner once the construction site has been stabilized and all temporary
erosion and sediment control measures have been removed. The Town Council and/
or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner, or representative, shall inspect
the construction site to verify the requirements for an NOT have been met. Once
the applicant receives a "verified" copy of the NOT, they must forward a copy
to IDEM. Permits issues under this scenario will expire 5 years from the date
of issuance. If construction is not completed within 5 years, the NOI must be
resubmitted at least 90 days prior to expiration. No Rule 5 (327 IAC 15-5)
permit is required from IDEM for projects within the MS4 area boundary, since
the Town Council is the permitting authority.
      (3)   For projects located outside the MS4 area boundary, the procedure
to be followed by the applicant is similar to that described under division (B)
(2). However, unless the IDEM's Rule 5 (327 IAC 15-5) arrangement with the
local SWCD is delegated to the county through a MOA, the SWCD shall have a
total of 28 days (the 10-day comment period noted under division (B)(2) plus an
additional 18 days) to provide a detail review of the plans. If the project
site owner/applicant does not receive notification within 28 days after the
plan is received by the SWCD stating that the SWCD finds the plan is deficient,
the project site owner may submit the updated NOI letter information. Also,
again unless the IDEM's Rule 5 (327 IAC 15-5) arrangement with the local SWCD
is delegated to the County through a MOA, the SWCD would conduct an independent
inspection of the construction site and will work with the contractor to ensure
that erosion control measures are implemented according to the accepted plans
and that site is satisfactorily stabilized.
      (4)   Note that in these "outside the MS4" areas, both county and IDEM
exercise authority over the erosion and sediment control aspects of
construction projects. Again, unless the IDEM's Rule 5 (327 IAC 15-5)
arrangement with the local SWCD is delegated to the county through a MOA, the
applicant is responsible to independently satisfy the requirements imposed by
IDEM and SWCD. Any review and inspection of construction and post-construction
pollution prevention measures by the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or
Building Commissioner in these "outside the MS4" areas would be above and
beyond that of SWCD under Rule 5.

§ 33.091 REQUIRED ASSURANCES.
   As a condition of approval and issuance of the permit, the Town Council and/
or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner shall require the applicant to
provide assurance in form of an irrevocable letter of credit or a bond when the
stormwater management plan has been accepted, all applicable fees paid, and
before construction begins. Said assurance will guarantee a good faith
execution of the stormwater drainage plan, the stormwater pollution prevention
plan, the stormwater quality management plan, and any permit conditions. The
assurance shall be for an amount equal to 110% of the total costs of all
stormwater management measures for the entire project. The above mentioned
costs shall be based on an estimate as prepared by a registered engineer or
land surveyor. Said costs shall be for the installation and ongoing monitoring
and maintenance of erosion control measures and the construction and ongoing
monitoring and maintenance of storm drainage infrastructure, detention/
retention facilities, and stormwater quality BMPs, as regulated under this
chapter, until the construction is completed, site is stabilized, and as-built
plans are accepted by the Town Council and/or Town Manager and/or Building
Commissioner. Assurances shall be for a minimum of $5,000. Local governmental
jurisdictions may require additional performance and/or maintenance assurances.
The intent of this assurance is not only to complete the installation of storm
drain infrastructure for the project, but also to assure that adequate
stormwater pollution prevention measures are properly installed and maintained.
If adequate assurances are set aside by the project site owner for the overall
project, proof of total assurance can be submitted in place of an individual
stormwater assurance.

as are reasonably necessary to meet the purposes of this chapter. The project
site owner shall insure compliance with such terms and conditions. Non-
compliance with the terms and conditions of permits will be subject to
enforcement as described in §§
33.105 through
33.111.
   (B)   The project site owner shall inform all general contractor,
construction management firms, grading or excavating contractors, utility
contractors, and the contractors that have primary oversight on individual
building lots of the terms and conditions of the stormwater management permit
and the schedule for proposed implementation.
   (C)   In the event that a project site is determined to impact or discharge
to a sensitive area or is located in an impact drainage area, the Town Council
and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner may require more stringent
stormwater quantity and quality measures than detailed in this chapter or in
the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual.
      (1)   Determination of sensitive areas. Sensitive areas include highly
erodible soils, wetlands, threatened or endangered species habitat, outstanding
waters, impaired waters, recreational waters, and surface drinking water
sources. A listing of highly erodible soils, outstanding water, impaired water,
recreation water and surface drinking water sources can be found in the
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. If wetlands are suspected on a site, a
wetland delineation should be completed in accordance with the methodology
established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE). The presence of
threatened or endangered species habitat will be determined by the Town Council
and/or Town Manager and/or Building Commissioner during the permit review
process. Special terms and conditions for development determined to impact or
discharge to any sensitive area shall be included in the stormwater management
permit.
      (2)   Determination of impact drainage areas.
         (a)   The Town Council is authorized, but is not required, to classify
certain geographical areas as impact drainage areas. In determining impact
drainage areas, the Town Council shall consider such factors as topography,

§ 33.121 FEE STRUCTURE.
   (A)   A stormwater utility user fee shall be imposed on all residential and
non-residential property within the town, including those classified as non-

utility. This user fee is deemed reasonable and is necessary to pay for the
repair, replacement, planning, improvement, operation, regulation and
maintenance of the existing and future stormwater system for the town.
   (B)   For the purposes stated herein, there is hereby assessed a stormwater
utility user fee to each stormwater utility user within the corporate limits of
the town in an amount determined below. For purposes of imposing the stormwater
utility user fee, all lots and parcels within the town are classified as either
residential or non-residential.
      (1)   Residential. Each residential property is hereby assigned one ERU.
A monthly user fee of $5 for each residential lot within the town shall be
charged.
      (2)   Non-residential properties. A monthly user fee shall be charged for
each non-residential property in a manner as set forth below.
         (a)   Large non-residential properties. Large non-residential
properties constituting the usage of more than three ERUs shall be charged a
monthly rate of $30 per month.
         (b)   Small non-residential properties. Properties utilizing three or
less ERUs shall be charged a fee of $15 per month.
   (C)   The non-residential stormwater utility user fee shall be based on the
relative contribution of surface and stormwater runoff from a given parcel to
the town's stormwater system and shall be assessed per ERU per month. Any
billings for stormwater service outside this time shall be on a per diem basis.
This stormwater utility user fee rate is designed to recover and be able to pay
the cost of rendering stormwater service to the users of the stormwater system,
and shall be the basis for assessment of the town's stormwater utility user
fee. This rate is established so as to maintain adequate fund reserves to
provide for reasonably expected variations in the cost of providing services,
as well as variation in the demand for services. This rate shall be evaluated
annually as to its sufficiency to satisfy the needs of the stormwater utility.
The following methods may be used to determine the non-residential user
factors:
      (1)   Computation of the impervious area using on-site measurements of
the apparent outside boundaries in or on such developed property made by the
town or on its behalf; or
      (2)   Computation of the impervious area using the dimensions which are
set forth and contained in the records of the office of the Hancock County
Assessor or Sugar Creek Township Assessor; or
      (3)   Estimation, calculation and computation of the impervious area
using aerial photography or photogrammertry, or as contained in the records of
the town or county; or
      (4)   Computation of impervious area using data provided by the owner,
tenant or developer. The authorized official may require additional information
as necessary to make the determination.
   (D)   Residential erosion control plot plan review fees. It is hereby
acknowledged that Ordinance No. 051805, the New Palestine Stormwater Management
Ordinance, has heretofore been duly passed, Chapter 6, Section 4 of which
(codified herein as §

(1989 Code, § 51.04)
§ 51.05 WHAT CONSTITUTES UNWHOLESOME CONDITION.
   (A)   An UNWHOLESOME ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION exists on private or
governmental property whenever any vegetation growing on such property, or
easement appurtenant thereto, is abandoned, neglected, disregarded or not cut,
mown, or otherwise removed and which has attained a height of 8 inches or more,
or violates any valid law, ordinance or regulation of the state, Hancock
County, the town, or any departments or agencies thereof.
   (B)   An UNWHOLESOME ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION also exists whenever any
vegetation exists on private property in close proximity to any governmental
property or governmental right-of-way or easement which because of its
location, size or condition, interferes with the public safety or lawful use of
such property, right-of-way or easement, or is in violation of any law of the
state or any ordinance of the town, or any regulation of any of its departments
or agencies. Specifically, the owner, or person in control of any lot or parcel
of land in the town, upon which any tree, shrub, vine or plant may be standing
adjacent to any public way shall trim or cause to be trimmed either at the
property line or to a clear height of at least 8 feet above the surface of such
public way, all branches thereof which overhang any portion of such public way,
or which obstruct or interfere with the passage of light from any street
lighting system and shall not plant or maintain any thereof so close to any
property line as to obstruct thereby the vision of travelers along the streets.
The town, or its contractual agent, may enter upon any such private premises to
do such trimming, as it determines to be necessary, or to remove any such
obstruction herein prohibited. The owner shall remove from such tree, shrub,
vine or plan, all dead, decayed, unsightly, broken or dangerous limbs and
branches that overhand, or are close to the public way; and when any such tree,
shrub, vine or plant is dead, the owner shall completely remove the same.
   (C)   An UNWHOLESOME ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION exists whenever any private
property, governmental property, right-of-way, or easement is abandoned,
neglected or disregarded so as to permit the same to become a health hazard or
nuisance, with an accumulation of litter or waste thereon, including but not
solely limited to wastepaper, rags, cans, bottles, boxes, lumber, metal,
garbage, disused or inoperable motor vehicles, trailers or any other machinery,
appliances or furniture thereon, unless specifically authorized under existing
laws and regulations.
(1989 Code, § 51.05) (Ord. 111578, passed 11-15-1978)

§ 51.08 PRELIMINARY NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   If the unwholesome environmental condition exists upon private or
governmental property which is occupied, the responsible party may give a
preliminary notice to the owner or occupant thereof, either verbally, or by
posting the notice upon such property. Such preliminary notice shall state the
nature of the alleged unwholesome environmental condition, the action deemed
necessary to correct the condition, and fix a date not sooner than 2 calendar
weeks thereafter, when the property will be reinspected to determine if
compliance has been effected. If, upon reinspection in accordance with the
preliminary notice, it is determined that the unwholesome environmental
condition has been corrected, the owner or occupant shall not be liable for any
charges by reason of the preliminary notice procedure.
(1989 Code, § 51.08) (Ord. 111578, passed 11-15-1978)
§ 51.09 FORMAL NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   If the unwholesome environmental condition is not corrected as a result of
the preliminary notice, or no preliminary notice is given, or the condition
exists on a vacant lot or unoccupied improved real estate, the responsible
party shall be given by certified mail, return receipt requested, directed to
the owner at his or her last and usual place of residence as determined either
by resort to the most recent edition of the County Directory or the records of
the Sugar Creek Township Assessor's office. The notice shall state the nature
of the unwholesome environmental condition, describe the real estate upon which
the condition exists, demand the abatement of the condition and set a date upon
which the condition exists, demand the abatement of the condition and set a
date not sooner than 2 calendar weeks after the date of such notice when the
property will be reinspected to ascertain if abatement has been effected. If
the certified mail is not returned within 30 calendar days or if the address of
the owner is unknown and cannot be ascertained upon due diligence, it shall be
sufficient to give notice to any offending owner by publication, once in a
newspaper of general circulation in Hancock County, Indiana. The owner(s) shall
have 10 calendar days from the date of such published notice to abate the
offending condition.
(1989 Code, § 51.09) (Ord. 111578, passed 11-15-1978)

shall enter upon such private or governmental property and abate the offending
condition.

§ 51.13 REPEAT OFFENDERS.
   If the town determines that the same tract or parcel of real estate is in
violation of this subchapter a second time in the same mowing season, then the
landowner and tenant, if there is a tenant, shall be deemed by landowner or
tenant’s lack of action, a repeat offender. In this event the Town Building
Inspector or the Street Department shall issue a written notice (repeat
offender notice) to the owner and tenant of the real estate, which notice shall
contain the same identifying and abatement information as the original
violation notice, but shall also state that if the violation continues unabated
throughout the mowing season, the town will continue to enter upon the property
and have the violation abated without further notice to either the landowner or
tenant; and that the landowner and tenant, if applicable, shall be liable to
the town for its costs and expense incurred in taking each remedial action. If
the repeat offender fails to timely abate the violation within 10 days after
service of the repeat offender notice, employees of the town or the town’s
agents or independent contractors may enter upon the real estate and abate the
violation each time during the remainder of the mowing season that it is
determined a violation occurs. The town shall prepare a statement or invoice as
to its costs and expenses incurred in taking such action and shall mail the
statement or invoice by ordinary mail to the last known address of the
landowner and tenant. The landowner or tenant shall within 30 days from date of
the mailing pay the amount shown on the invoice to the Clerk- Treasurer of the
town.

place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if
it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled
the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a
loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspect's escape.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a
police officer, or where a "no loitering" sign or signs have been posted, to
loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or quasi-public sidewalk,
street, curb, cross-walk, walkway area, mall or that portion of private
property utilized for public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the
free passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any
person to block, obstruct, or prevent free access to the entrance to any
building open to the public.
   (C)   For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACE has the following
definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles
(whether moving or not), and buildings open to the general public, including
those which serve food or drink or provide entertainment, and the doorways and

and general welfare of the community.
      (5)   To protect the natural environment.
      (6)   To require a reasonable amount of landscaping materials in order to

   (H)   Perimeter planting standards. This division applies to all residential
projects requesting an Improvement Location Permit or approval of a development
plan or primary plat that abut a major or minor collector, primary or secondary
arterial street or road. It is the intent of this section to buffer the public
right-of-way from developments, to provide a soft barrier between pedestrians
and developments, to better define the edge of roads for vehicular safety and
flow, and to maintain community character goals and enhance aesthetics along
public streets.
      (1)   Residential properties that abut a road or external right-of-way
along rights of way other than that which the main residence faces shall have a
20-foot landscaping area adjacent to the road or right-of-way as shown on the
New Palestine Zoning Code. The landscaping shall be located in an area
designated as "common area" or "landscape easement" and shall not overlap any
other easement which prohibits the placement of landscape materials. The
landscape area shall be labeled as common area and shall not be counted as open
space.
      (2)   (a)   A single- and/or multi-family residential development that
abuts a major or minor collector, primary or secondary arterial must install
the following landscape elements.
         (b)   Trees and shrubs. Trees provided at a rate of six trees per 100
lineal feet and shrubs provided at a rate of ten per 100 lineal feet of
perimeter planting. Trees and shrubs shall be prorated and rounded up to the
nearest whole number for every foot over the initial 100 feet. It is suggested
that the required trees and shrubs be at least 50% evergreen, planted in
clusters or irregular patterns, and be combined with either fencing or mounding
as described below.
            1.   Development perimeter fences shall be combined with plant
material and shall be constructed of masonry, stone, wood, or metal. Fences
constructed of synthetic materials that simulate natural materials will also be

described above, and may include fencing. Mounds shall be located in an area
designated as "common area" or "landscape easement". Mounds shall be a minimum
of three feet in height. Maximum side slope shall not exceed 3:1 ratio.
Engineering design requirements shall determine the setback from the right-of-
way line of a public or private street and from the property line of an
adjoining property. Continuous mounds are not permitted.
            3.   Where a common area is designated on the plat or development
plan of a commercial or residential project, a property or Homeowner's
Association shall be formed and shall be required to provide all necessary
maintenance to said common areas as set forth in this section under division
(G).
   (I)   Residential subdivision lot and foundation planting standards. This
division applies to all single-family detached uses located in a residential
subdivision requesting an Improvement Location Permit or approval of a

materials as the primary structure and be supplemented with landscaping.
   (K)   Parking lot planting standards. This division applies to projects in
all zoning districts requesting an Improvement Location Permit or approval of a
development plan or primary plat. The intent is to require a reasonable amount
of plant materials around parking lots such to reduce glare, reduce heat
buildup, enhance visual quality of developments, screen and mitigate potential
conflict between land uses, reduce noise pollution, reduce erosion, minimize
stormwater runoff, and improve air quality.
      (1)   Perimeter landscaping. Parking lots with six or more spaces shall
have the following perimeter planting.
         (a)   Parking lots shall be screened from streets and adjacent uses
using a combination of plant materials, decorative fences, decorative walls,
and/or earthen mounds.
         (b)   Shrubs shall be planted at a maximum ratio of one shrub per four
lineal feet around the perimeter and be maintained at a height of at least 36
inches tall at maturity in order to minimize headlights projecting onto
adjacent properties.

have half of the above landscaping requirement.
      (2)   Interior parking lot landscaping. Parking lots with 20 or more
parking spaces are required to have the following. The portion of an
institutional use's parking lot used primarily for bus circulation and staging
is not required to install the landscape islands required in this section for
that portion of the parking area.
         (a)   One landscape island shall be provided per 20 spaces and the
islands shall be distributed equally throughout the parking lot.
         (b)   Each island shall be at least 180 square feet in size and
contain at least one tree. One-third of trees planted in islands shall be
canopy trees.
         (c)   Each landscape island shall be designated such that any tree
when planted is not within three and one half feet of a curbed or paved edge.
         (d)   Parking lot landscape areas shall not be filled with gravel or
impervious surface. They must be free of litter and be maintained with plant
materials and mulch.
      (3)   The Planning Commission may require a graphic depiction
(perspective sketch or elevation) of the parking lot screening and islands as
seen from the street.
      (4)   Parking lots may project into the perimeter landscaping areas by up
to ten feet. When a parking lot extends into any portion of a perimeter
landscape area, the requirements in division (K)(1) above are no longer
required in those areas. However, fencing (as noted in division (H)) shall be
used instead of mounding within the perimeter landscaping area.
   (L)   Bufferyard standards. This division applies to projects in all zoning
districts requesting an Improvement Location Permit or approval of a
development plan or primary plat. The intent is to soften the potential
conflicts between uses in one zoning district from the uses in an adjacent
district by using distance, plantings, fences, walls and mounds. The degree of
conflict (or potential conflict) between two zoning districts will determine
the extent of buffering required.
      (1)   The bufferyard standards only apply along the property lines (side
and rear property lines included) where the two conflicting zoning districts
meet.
      (2)   The property which is zoned for higher intensity uses is
responsible for installing the bufferyard.
      (3)   A natural or irregular row and spacing of trees is preferred.
However, trees shall be planted no more than 20 feet apart. A plant list
including a "living fence" category is included in Exhibit A. Plant material
shall be installed within the bufferyard within the setback.
      (4)   If the applicant can produce evidence that the planting area is too
wet for evergreen trees, the applicant may substitute another type of tree as
approved by the Planning Commissioner.
      (5)   The following small sized bufferyard is required where single-
family uses abut either a multi-family, institutional or B-1 commercial use.
The following quantities are minimums.

feet. Trees shall be prorated and rounded up to the nearest whole number for
every foot over the initial 100 feet of contiguous boundary with the
conflicting district.
         (b)   All trees must be planted in the setback between five and 15
feet from the property line that is contiguous to the conflicting property.
         (c)   A reasonable attempt to screen the most obnoxious, noise
producing, unsightly, tallest, most intrusive or most visible parts of
buildings on the subject property should be made.
         (d)   Undulating mounds with a minimum height of three feet must be
installed for a distance equivalent to 60% of the distance contiguous to the
conflicting property. Maximum height of undulating mounds is eight feet.
      (6)   The following medium sized bufferyard is required where single-
family, multi-family, or institutional uses abut B-2 and B-3 district. The
following quantities are minimums.
         (a)   Four canopy trees and four evergreen trees must be planted for
every 100 feet of contiguous boundary with the conflicting district. Each
evergreen tree may not be spaced more than 25 feet from one another. Trees
shall be prorated and rounded up to the nearest whole number for every foot
over the initial 100 feet.
         (b)   All trees must be planted in the setback within 25 feet from the
property line that is contiguous to the conflicting property.
         (c)   Ten shrubs shall be planted for every 100 feet of contiguous
boundary with the conflicting district.
         (d)   A reasonable attempt to screen the most obnoxious, noise
producing, unsightly, tallest, most intrusive or most visible parts of building
on the subject property should be made.
         (e)   Undulating mounds with a minimum height of four feet must be
installed for a distance equivalent to 80% of the distance contiguous to the
conflicting property. Maximum height of undulating mounds is eight feet.
      (7)   The following large sized bufferyard is required where single-
family, multi-family, or institutional uses abut an I-1 or 1-2 industrial
district. The following quantities are minimums.
         (a)   Five canopy trees must be planted for every 100 feet of
contiguous boundary with the conflicting district; and
         (b)   Five evergreen trees must be planted for every 100 feet of
contiguous boundary with the conflicting district. Trees shall be prorated and
rounded up to the nearest whole number for every foot over the initial 100
feet.
         (c)   All trees must be planted within 25 feet from the property line
that is contiguous to the conflicting property.
         (d)   Twenty shrubs shall be planted for every 100 feet of contiguous
boundary with the conflicting district.

Bufferyard (residential abuts I-1 or I-  10 trees and 20 shrubs per 100' plus
2 districts)                             minimum 4' mound for 60% distance.
 
   (M)   Optional natural area protection.
      (1)   This division is presented as an option for the development
community in all zoning districts applying for an Improvement Location Permit
or approval of a development plan or primary plat. The intent is to prevent the
unnecessary cutting, removal or killing of trees in wooded areas, to prevent
the unnecessary cutting, removal or killing of specimen trees, to promote and
maintain a high level of community aesthetics through the conservation and
planting of trees. Other areas to be given priority to protection are: critical
habitats which contain rare, threatened or endangered species, wooded 100-year
floodways, wooded wetlands and wooded slopes, wooded or partially wooded stream
corridors with drainage areas greater than 50 acres, and riparian areas.
      (2)   An in kind credit toward meeting the landscaping requirements of
this section may be available in order to encourage the preservation of an
existing healthy tree. Development density increases could be granted by the
Town Council as an additional incentive. Greater open space credit could be
granted due the preservation of quality in natural areas as well. A credit
shall be given per tree that contributes to and satisfies similarly the intent
of a particular provision of this section. The following credits shall be
granted for an existing tree as follows:
         (a)   For each preserved deciduous tree over four inches but less than
eight inches DBH a credit for three deciduous trees shall be granted.
         (b)   For each preserved deciduous tree over eight inches but less
than 12 inches DBH a credit for four deciduous trees shall be granted.
         (c)   For each preserved deciduous tree over 12 inches DBH a credit
for five deciduous trees shall be granted. The Planning Commissioner may grant
larger credits for trees over 12 inches DBH upon request.
         (d)   For each preserved evergreen tree over six feet tall but less
than ten feet tall shall be granted credit for two evergreen trees.
         (e)   For each preserved evergreen tree over ten feet tall shall be
granted credit for three evergreen trees. The Planning Commissioner may grant
larger credits for evergreen trees over ten feet tall upon request.
      (3)   If preserving the natural landscape is chosen, prior to
construction on or removal of trees from a wooded area, the following standards
apply:
         (a)   Provide a tree conservation plan outlining strategies for
retaining, protecting and replanting trees on a site. DNR can provide guidance.
Prepare a tree conservation map that outlines existing tree cover, priority
protection areas, proposed grading, and proposed protective devices.
         (b)   Within the designated conservation areas, no trees with a DBH in
excess of six inches or evergreens eight feet or more in height shall be
removed from any lot unless trees are: 1. within the building site pad; 2.
within 15 feet of the perimeter of the primary structure or accessory
structures; 3. between the front of the primary structure and the interior
roadway of the subdivision; and/or 4. required to be removed in order to comply
with safety requirements of any governmental agency.
         (c)   Tree retention areas shall be a minimum of 35 feet wide and
minimum contiguous area of 10,000 square feet.
         (d)   A builder who violates the tree conservation plan once
established and improperly removes trees shall be required to reestablish such
trees consistent with the trees removed. For example, if a six-inch caliper
tree is removed, the builder may reestablish such tree by installing three 2-
inch caliper trees or two 3-inch caliper trees to total this caliper of the
trees removed.
      (4)   Prior to construction around a specimen tree in a tree conservation
area, the following standards apply.
         (a)   Install highly visible (orange) construction fencing at least
three feet outside the dripline of the trees.
         (b)   Avoid injuring roots when installing anchoring posts for
fencing.
         (c)   Signs should be posted clearly identifying the plant protection
zone.
         (d)   If a portion greater than 30% of the area within the dripline is
unavoidably impacted, applicant shall install a root aeration system, tree
well, retaining wall or raised boardwalk as appropriate permanent protection.
      (5)   Prior to construction in a riparian area:
         (a)   The petitioner shall work with the Town of New Palestine
Planning Commissioner regarding conservation of riparian areas on site.
         (b)   Establish or enhance forest buffers of at least 50 feet wide
adjacent to intermittent and perennial streams.
         (c)   Newly planted trees and shrubs shall be species native to
central Indiana.
         (d)   Tree sizes may be a minimum of one-inch caliper unless otherwise
approved by Planning Commission Director.
         (e)   For optimal survival and unless irrigated with an automatic
system, planting should occur in the spring or fall.
   (N)   Enforcement and penalties. Enforcement of the provisions herein shall
be subject to the terms and conditions set forth above. In addition to the
duties and obligations set forth above, it shall be the responsibility of the
adjacent property owners to maintain and provide routine care of plant material
located within the rights-of-way within the town. For purposes of this section,
maintenance and care shall include but not be limited to pruning, watering,
fertilizing, and mulching as well as the removal of any item that would
constitute a safety hazard to pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
(Ord. 051805A, passed 8-17-2005)
APPENDIX A: PLANT SPECIES LIST.
   (A)   Exhibit A contains species recommended by the Town of New Palestine.
Names in single quotation marks are cultivars (varieties) of particular species
that are readily available in the surrounding area. Other species and varieties
may be substituted with approval of the Planning Commissioner. Exhibit B lists
species to be avoided.
   (B)   Plant material is generally grouped together under the following
function categories:
      (1)   Street trees. Street trees are deciduous trees planted at regular
spaces in close proximity to the street that contribute to the streetscape.
Street trees are usually canopy trees with greater than 20-foot wide canopies
at maturity. They usually have an orderly growth habit and attain heights of 25
to 40 feet minimum.
      (2)   Open space and lawn trees. These selections can be deciduous or
evergreen. They provide shade, interest and color. Street trees may also be
used.
      (3)   Shrubs. "Living fence" species: plant material can be used to
create "living fence" or barrier for perimeter landscape requirements. Tall
shrubs can provide a screen between differing land uses and can mitigate the
effects of unattractive uses. Shorter shrubs are effective in screening
automobiles in parking lots, utilities boxes and building foundations.

B.    ZONE MAP.
The zone map, which accompanies and is hereby declared to be a part of this
code, shows the boundaries of the area covered by the districts. Notations,
references, indications and other matters shown on the zone map are as much a
part of this code as if they were fully described herein.
   1.   A part of the code. The boundaries of the districts are established on
a map entitled, Zone Map, New Palestine, Indiana, dated 2001, as amended,
hereinafter referred to as the "Official Zone Map" which accompanies and is
incorporated in and made a part of this chapter. Notations, references,
indications, and other matters shown on the zone map are as much a part of this
chapter as if they were fully described herein.
   2.   Verification. The official zone map shall be identified by the
signature of the Town Council President, attested by the Clerk-Treasurer, and
bearing the seal of the city under the following words: "This is to certify
that this is the official zone map referred to in Section 1.08 of The Code of
Ordinances of the Town of New Palestine, Indiana."
   3.   Future map entries. If, in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter, changes are made in district boundaries or other matter portrayed on
the official zone map, such changes shall be entered on the map promptly after
the amendment has been approved by the Council, with an entry on the official
zone map as follows: "On (date) by official action of the Council, the
following changes were made in the official zone map; (brief description of the
nature of the changes),which entry shall be signed by the Town Council
President and attested by the Clerk-Treasurer."
   4.   Changes. No changes of any nature shall be made in the official zone
map or matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth
in this chapter. Any unauthorized change of whatever kind by any person or
persons shall be considered a violation of this chapter and punishable as
provided under Section
8.
   5.   Location of zone map. Regardless of the existence of purported copies
of the official zone map which may from time to time be made or published, the
official zone map which shall be located in the office of the Town Manager
shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land and water
areas, building, and other structures in the city.
   6.   Damaged, lost, or destroyed map. In the event the official zone map
becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret because of the
nature or number of changes and additions, the Council may direct the Plan
Commission to prepare a new official zone map which shall supersede the prior
map on approval by the Council. The new official zone map may correct drafting
or other errors or omissions in the prior map, but no such correction shall
have the effect of amending the original official zone map or any subsequent
amendment. The new official zone map shall be identified by the signature of
the Mayor attested by the Clerk-Treasurer and bearing the seal of the city
under the following words: "This is to certify that this official zone map
supersedes and replaces on this day (date) the official zone map adopted (date
of adoption of map being replaced) as part of
Chapter 90 of the Town of New Palestine, Indiana."
   7.   Map to be preserved. Unless the prior official zone map has been lost
or has been totally destroyed, the prior map or any significant parts thereof
remaining shall be preserved, together with all available records pertaining to
its adoption or amendment.
1.02 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the
official zoning map, the following rules shall apply:
A.   CENTER LINES OF STREETS AND BOUNDARIES.
Unless otherwise indicated, the district boundary lines are the centerlines of
streets, parkways, alleys, or railroad right-of-way, or such lines extended.
B.    APPROXIMATIONS.
Boundaries indicated as approximately following section line limit, half
section and quarter section lines and town corporate limit lines, or platted
lot lines shall be construed as following such lines.
C.    RAILROAD LINES.
Boundaries indicated, as following railroad lines shall be construed to be
midway between the main tracks.
D.   SHORE LINES AND WATERWAYS.
Boundaries indicated as following shore lines shall be construed to follow the
shore lines, and in the event of change in the shore lines shall be construed
as moving with the actual shore lines. Boundaries indicated as approximately
following the center lines of streams, creeks, lakes, or other bodies of water
shall be construed to follow such center lines. However, where streams and
rivers meander from their beds as they existed on the effective date of this
ordinance, the boundary shall be construed as following the original stream or
riverbed.
E.    USE OF SCALE ON ZONE MAP.
Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated in
divisions (A) through (D) above shall be so construed. Distances not
specifically indicated on the official zone map shall be determined by the
scale of the map.
F.    COMMISSION MAY DETERMINE.
Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at variance with
those shown on the official zone map, or in other circumstances not covered by
divisions (A) through (F) herein, the Planning Commission shall interpret the
district boundaries.
G.   VACATIONS AND RELOCATIONS.
The vacation or relocation of rights-of-way and lot lines shall not affect the
location of district boundaries. However, whenever proper authority vacates any
right-of-way, the districts adjoining each side of such vacation shall be
extended automatically to the center of such vacation.
H.   LINES SPLITTING LOTS.
   1.   Where a boundary line of a district divides a lot having frontage on a
street so that the front part of the lot lies in one district and the rest of
the lot lies in another, use requirements and restrictions that apply to the
front part of the lot apply to the entire lot. The Board of Zoning Appeals, on
appeal, shall interpret the applicable regulations for either portion of the
lot not to exceed 50 feet beyond the district boundary line into the remaining
portion of the lot.
   2.   Where a district boundary line divides a lot which does not have
frontage on a street or has frontage on more than one street the Board of
Zoning Appeals, upon appeal, shall interpret the applicable regulations for
either portion of the lot not to exceed 50 feet beyond the district boundary
line into the remaining portion of the lot.
1.03 APPLICATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
The regulations set forth in this chapter within each district shall be minimum
regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class of kind of structure or
land, except as hereinafter provided:
A.    REGULATIONS APPLY.
No building, structure, or land shall hereafter be used or occupied, and no
building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed,
moved, or structurally altered except in conformity with all of the regulations
herein specified for the district in which it is located, and any other
regulations required by this code.
B.   LOT AREAS AND YARDS MAY NOT BE ENCROACHED UPON.
No building shall be erected, reconstructed or structurally altered in any
manner which will encroach upon, or reduce in any manner, the yards, lot area
per family, ground floor area of dwellings, or lot coverage provisions
established and specified for the use and the district in which such building
is located, or in any other manner contrary to the provisions of this Code.
C.   YARDS ARE SEPARATE.
No part of a yard, or other open space, or off-street parking or loading space
required about or in connection with any building for the purpose of complying
with this chapter shall be included as part of a yard, open space, or off-
street parking or loading space similarly required for any other building.
D.    NO REDUCTION IN YARDS.
No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of this chapter shall be reduced
in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth herein. Yards or
lots created after the effective date of this ordinance shall meet at least the
minimum requirements established by this Code.

provisions of this section, or as otherwise indicated in Section
3, or elsewhere.
      b.   The regulations of this section are designed to alleviate or prevent
congestion of the public streets by establishing minimum requirements for on-
site parking of motor vehicles in accordance with the use to which the property
is occupied.
   2.   SCOPE.
      a.   No use lawfully established prior to this code shall be required to
provide and maintain the parking and loading requirements herein; provided,
however, the off-street parking and loading spaces required by any previous
ordinances adopted pursuant to the Indiana Planning Statutes shall be continued
and maintained.
      b.   For any nonconforming use which is hereafter damaged or partially
destroyed, and which is lawfully reconstructed, re-established, or repaired,
off-street parking and loading facilities equivalent to those maintained at the
time of such damage or partial destruction shall be restored and continued in
operation; provided, however, in no case shall it be necessary to restore or
maintain parking or loading facilities in excess of those required by this Code
for equivalent new uses.
      c.   When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises
shall be increased through the addition of dwelling units, floor area, beds,
seating capacity, or other unit of measurement, parking and loading facilities
as required herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use.
      d.   Whenever the existing use of a building, structure or premises shall
hereinafter be changed or converted to a new use permitted by this Code,
parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required for such new use.
      e.   Accessory off-street parking or loading facilities in existence on
or before enactment of this code shall not hereafter be reduced below, or if
already less than, shall not be further reduced below the requirements for a
similar new use under the provisions of this Code.
      f.   Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary
establishment of accessory off-street parking or loading facilities to serve
any existing use of land or buildings, provided that all regulations herein
governing the location, design, and operation of such facilities are adhered
to.
      g.   Accessory off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided on
the same lot as the uses served, except as otherwise provided in this Code, and
may be situated in one or more individual areas.
      h.   Accessory off-street parking facilities for separate uses may be
provided collectively if the total number of spaces so provided is not less
than the sum of the separate requirements for each such use, and provided that
all regulations governing location of accessory parking spaces in relation to
the use served are adhered to. Further, no parking space or portion thereof
shall serve as a required space for more than one use unless otherwise
authorized by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      i.   Accessory off-street parking and loading facilities provided to
comply with the provisions of this Code shall not subsequently be reduced below
the requirements of this Code.

dwellings, each off-street parking space shall be open directly upon an aisle
or driveway at least twelve (12) feet wide or such additional width and design
in accordance with the following table, so as to provide safe and efficient
means of vehicular access to such parking space. Such aisle or driveway shall
be unobstructed and allow for the passage of emergency vehicles at all times.
      c.   The angle shall be measured between center line of parking space and
center line of aisle.

90                         24
 
      d.   All off-street parking or loading facilities shall be designed with
appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner which
will least interfere with traffic movement.
      e.   In determining the minimum required number of off-street parking
spaces, the following instructions shall be applicable in such computations:

in relation to the number of spaces to be provided, said fraction shall be
considered as being the next unit and shall be counted as requiring one space.
         2.   In sports arenas, church and other places of assembly in which

amount of traffic on neighborhood streets will not be permitted.
            j.   No display of goods or external evidence of the home
occupation shall be permitted, except for 1 non-animated, non-illuminated, non-
flashing announcement plate, indicating not more than the name of the
occupation and name and address of the resident. The plate shall be attached
flat against the wall of the residence and shall not exceed 1 square foot in
total surface area.
            k.   The home occupation shall not involve retailing from the
residence, which for the purpose of this section shall mean a display of

            l.   There shall be no use of equipment or processes that create
noise, vibration, glare, fumes, odors, or electrical or electronic

detectable by neighbors.
            m.   For the purpose of this code, the uses that, by the nature of
their investment or operation, have a pronounced tendency once started to
rapidly increase beyond the limits permitted for home occupations and thereby
impair the use and value of a residentially zoned area for residential
purposes.
      b.   Those uses listed above or any other use not meeting the standards
of this section shall not be permitted uses in residential neighborhoods unless
they are granted a variance by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      c.   The provisions of this section shall not be deemed to supersede any
deed restriction, covenant, agreement, master deed, by-laws or other documents
which prohibit a home occupation within a dwelling unit.
         1.   Permitting. No home occupation shall be allowed without the owner
first obtaining a permit from the Zoning Administrator. Application must be
made on a form provided by the Zoning Administrator, and the applicant for a
home occupation permit shall pay required fees in connection with the submittal
of the application in accordance with the fee schedules adopted by the Plan
Commission.
         2.   Denial of permit. In cases where the Zoning Administrator, or his
or her appointed representative, considers the home occupation to not be in
compliance with these provisions, the application shall be denied.
         3.   Time limit. All home occupation permits shall be valid for a
period of time as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
         4.   Renewal. Home occupation permits may be renewed, provided there
has not been any violation of the provisions of this section. Requests for
renewals shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator in writing, accompanied
by the renewal fee set by the adopted fee schedule, 1 month prior to the
expiration of the home occupation permit.
         5.   Inspection. Home occupation applicants shall permit a reasonable
inspection of the premises by the Zoning Administrator, in order to determine
compliance with these regulations, upon application for a home occupation
permit, upon renewal of the permit, and upon receipt of any complaints of a
violation of the regulations of this section.
   14.   Multi-Family Developments.
      All multi-family developments of more than 3 units shall require
development plan review. In addition to the standard requirements for a
development plan (Section
4 of this appendix), the following provisions shall apply to all multi-family
developments with more than 4 dwelling units, except where the use is a
residential conversion from a single or two-family use to a multi-family use.
      a.   No separate freestanding building shall be closer than 20 feet to
any other building on or off of the site or lot.
      b.   The building or buildings shall be so designed or located so that
the distance from any window of any room proposed to be used for human
habitation shall be not less than 40 feet from the wall of any other structure
on the property, the distance to be measured by a line perpendicular to the
plane of the surface of the window, except that this distance may be reduced to
not less than 30 feet for an exposure where a room is a bathroom or laundry
utility room or is used as a community or group meeting room or for a similar
purpose.
      c.   Each apartment building shall be designed with setbacks or breaks of
not less than 12 feet to all exterior walls for every 2 building units.
      d.   Off-street parking space and adequate space for service facilities
may be provided in the side yard(s) or rear yard, but shall in no event be
located in the required front yard, provided that no driveway, off-street
parking area or service facility area shall be located closer than 10 feet to
any side lot line. The off-street parking areas and service facility areas
shall have sufficient lighting facilities, which shall be located and adjusted
so that the glare or beam is directed away from any adjoining property, public
street or multi-family use dwelling windows.
      e.   Any open air street parking area and service facility area shall be
screened according to the provisions of
Chapter 93, Design Standards Manual, and buffer areas required by the same
shall be provided.

convenience shopping and service needs of persons living in nearby residential
areas. Uses allowed in this district will, in general, be a less intense use
than those allowed in the B-2 or B-3 Districts.
   B-2 General Business

with respect to unified design, safe ingress and egress, adequate and properly
located parking and service facilities and convenient and safe pedestrian
accessibility.
   B-3 Highway Business
This district provides sites for heavier types of business and commercial uses.
The Highway Business District is classified in the B-3 District.

OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING.
   1.   INTENT.
      a.   Accessory off-street parking and loading facilities shall be
provided and maintained for all buildings, structures or premises used in whole
or in part for purposes permitted by this Code in accordance with the
provisions of this section, or as otherwise indicated in Section
3, or elsewhere.
      b.   The regulations of this section are designed to alleviate or prevent
congestion of the public streets by establishing minimum requirements for on-
site storage of motor vehicles in accordance with the use to which the property
is occupied.
   2.   SCOPE.
      a.   No use lawfully established prior to the adoption of this code shall
be required to provide and maintain the parking and loading requirements
herein; provided, however, that off-street parking and loading spaces required
by any previous ordinances adopted pursuant to the Indiana Planning Statutes
shall be continued and maintained.
      b.   For any nonconforming use which is hereafter damaged or partially
destroyed, and which is lawfully reconstructed, re-established, or repaired,
off-street parking and loading facilities equivalent to those maintained at the
time of such damage or partial destruction shall be restored and continued in
operation; provided, however, in no case shall it be necessary to restore or
maintain parking or loading facilities in excess of those required by this Code
for equivalent new uses.
      c.   When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises
shall be increased through the addition of dwelling units, floor area, beds,
seating capacity, or other unit of measurement, parking and loading facilities
as required herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use.
      d.   Whenever the existing use of a building, structure or premises shall
hereinafter be changed or converted to a new use permitted by this Code,
parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required for such new use.
      e.   Accessory off-street parking or loading facilities in existence on
or before the adoption of this code shall not hereafter be reduced below, or if
already less than, shall not be further reduced below the requirements for a
similar new use under the provisions of this Code.
      f.   Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary
establishment of accessory off-street parking or loading facilities to serve
any existing use of land or buildings, provided that all regulations herein
governing the location, design, and operation of such facilities are adhered
to.
      g.   Accessory off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided on
the same lot as the uses served, except as otherwise provided in this Code, and
may be situated as one or more individual areas.
      h.   Accessory off-street parking facilities for separate uses may be
provided collectively if the total number of spaces so provided is not less
than the sum of the separate requirements for each such use, and provided that
all regulations governing location of accessory parking spaces in relation to
the use served are adhered to. Further, no parking space or portion thereof
shall serve as a required space for more than one use unless otherwise
authorized by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      i.   Accessory off-street parking and loading facilities provided to
comply with the provisions of this Code should not subsequently be reduced
below the requirements of this Code.
      j.   Accessory off-street parking facilities required herein shall be
utilized solely for the parking of passenger automobiles or light trucks of
less than one (1) ton capacity, of patrons, occupants or employees of specified
uses. Said parking facilities shall not be used for the storage, display, sale,
repair, dismantling or wrecking of any vehicle, equipment or material.
      k.   Required off-street loading and unloading spaces shall not be
construed as being part of the required off-street parking spaces.
      l.   Loading and unloading berths shall not be required for business uses
and industrial uses, which demonstrably do not receive or transmit goods or
wares by truck delivery.
      m.   Accessory off-street parking facilities are not required in a block
frontage contained in a B-3 District in which the ground floor area of business
or industrial structures, including their accessory buildings, existing at the
time of passage of the ordinance establishing the Zoning Code, equaled fifty
percent (50%) or more of the entire area of the block frontage.
   3.   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
      a.   Each required off-street parking space shall be at least nine (9)
feet in width and at least eighteen (18) feet in length, exclusive of access
drives or aisles, ramps, columns, or office or work areas. Such space shall
have adequate vertical clearance. For parallel parking, the length of the
parking space shall be increased to twenty-four (24) feet.
      b.   Each required off-street loading space shall be of a size not less
than that required for an off-street parking space but scaled larger to
delivery vehicles expected to be used, logically and conveniently located for
bulk pickups and deliveries, and accessible to such vehicles when required off-
street parking spaces are filled; provided that for industrial uses, the off-
street area required for the receipt or distribution by vehicles of materials
or merchandise to be no less than twelve (12) feet by forty-five (45) feet
loading space with a fourteen (14) foot height clearance; provided further that
if more than one (1) berth is provided, the minimum dimensions are to be no
less than ten (10) feet by forty-five (45) feet with a fourteen (14) foot
height clearance.
      c.   The angle shall be measured between centerline of parking space and
centerline of aisle.
 
Parking Angle (in degrees) Aisle Width (in feet)
45 degrees                 14'
60 degrees                 18'
90 degrees                 24'
 
      d.   All off-street parking or loading facilities shall be designed with
appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner which
will least interfere with traffic movement.
      e.   In determining the minimum required number of off-street parking or
loading spaces, the following instructions shall be applicable in such
computations:
         1.   If the unit of measurement is any fraction of the unit specified
in relation to the number of spaces to be provided, said fraction shall be
considered as being the next unit and shall be counted as requiring one space.
         2.   In sports arenas, church and other places of assembly in which
patrons occupy benches, pews or other similar seating facilities, each twenty-
two (22) inches of such seating shall be counted as one (1) seat for the
purpose of determining requirements hereunder.
      f.   Accessory off-street parking areas may count toward the open space
requirements of this Code.
      g.   Accessory off-street parking and loading areas shall be provided to
the rear of the building, except as specified otherwise by this Code. When
permitted within required setback distances, a landscape screen shall be
provided along the property line.
      h.   Adequate employee and customer off-street parking area shall be
provided, including such areas incidental to display, servicing and repair. No
such parking shall be permitted on driveway approaches, landscape areas,
adjacent alleys or streets on any public right-of-way or in such a manner as to
restrict motorists' visibility.
OFF-SITE PARKING FACILITIES.
   1.   INTENT.
Required off-site parking facilities shall be provided hereinafter. The Board
of Zoning Appeals is hereby authorized to grant an off-site parking facility as
a special exception in accordance with the following conditions:
      a.   A development plan for such off-site parking facility shall be filed
with the Board of Zoning Appeals as a required exhibit accompanying the special
exception application and shall be made part of the conditions of any approval
therefore. Said development plan shall demonstrate compliance with all
applicable standards of this Code, shall be amended and re-approved to indicate
any change or other modification of uses served, or number of parking spaces
provided therefore, and shall indicate:
         1.   Adjacent streets, alleys and lots.
         2.   All individual primary uses to be served, including the location
use and number of parking spaces for each such use.
         3.   A layout drawn to scale of aisles and driveways, entrances, exits
and turn-off lanes, parking spaces, setbacks, drainage facilities, and
landscaping and buffer screening.
         4.   Type of lighting and pavement proposed and identification signs,
including location, size and design thereof.
      b.   Off-site parking facilities shall be provided with setback distances
equivalent to the requirements of the district, and ingress and egress points
shall be limited to protect the function of adjoining streets.
      c.   Off-site parking facilities shall be encumbered by any instrument
duly executed, in recordable form, enforceable by the New Palestine Board of
Zoning Appeals and acknowledged, which subject said accessory off-site parking
facilities to parking use served. Said instrument shall specify and bind the
time period to the anticipated life of the building or use to which the parking
facilities are accessory. Said instrument shall be filed in the applicable
Improvement Location Permit files of the Zoning Administrator's Office and
placed on public record in the office of the County Recorder.
      d.   Off-site parking facilities shall be developed in accordance with
the provisions of Subsection (F) below. Further, said facilities shall be
developed under such conditions imposed by the Board of Zoning Appeals as to
protect residential districts and maintain at a minimum the disturbance to
nearby residential uses.
   2.   DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
      a.   Required off-site parking spaces shall be so designed, arranged and
regulated as to have individual spaces marked, be unobstructed and have access
to an aisle or driveway so that any vehicle may be moved without moving another
and so that no maneuvering directly incidental to entering or leaving a parking
space shall be on any public right-of-way or walkway.
      b.   Off-site parking spaces may be open to the sky or enclosed in a
building. In any instance when a building is constructed or used for parking
facilities on the lot, said building shall be treated as any major structure
and subject to all requirements thereof.
      c.   No repair work, sales or service of any kind shall be permitted in
association with accessory off-site parking facilities unless such facilities
are enclosed in a building and otherwise permitted in the district.
      d.   All open off-site parking areas shall be surfaced with an all-
weather paving material capable of carrying a wheel load of four thousand
(4,000) pounds, or improved with concrete or a compacted macadam base and
surfaced with an asphaltic pavement, to adequately provide a durable and dust
free surface which shall be maintained in good condition and free of weeds,
dirt, trash and debris, except that:
         1.   A gravel surface may be used for a period not exceeding one year
after the date of granting the Certificate of Occupancy where ground conditions
are not immediately suitable for permanent surfacing as specified above.
         2.   A gravel surface in the area of storage or handling may be used
permanently in association with industries that handle liquids or chemicals
which create a potential hazard if containment should be lost and where
absorption into the ground through a loose surface material would eliminate or
alleviate such hazard.
      e.   Driveway entrances or exits shall be no closer than twenty-five (25)
feet to any adjoining residential property line or ten (10) feet to an
adjoining non-residential property line or designed in such a manner as to
least interfere with traffic movement. No driveway across public property at
the right-of-way line of the street shall exceed a width of thirty (30) feet;
provided, however, two (2) driveways not exceeding thirty (30) feet in width
each may constitute a single entrance-exit divider designed driveway; provided,
further, that such driveways shall conform to the requirements of the
Specifications of the Town of New Palestine.
      f.   In any district, each use which is so located that it fronts upon
and provides access to an arterial thoroughfare shall provide a frontage lane
paralleling and adjoining the improved part of the right-of-way at least eleven
(11) feet in width for turn traffic entering the lot. Such frontage lane shall
be at least one hundred (100) feet in length, exclusive of the entrance way and
taper area; provided, however, if the lot frontage is too small to meet such
requirement, the frontage lane shall extend the entire width of the lot.
      g.   Any lighting facilities used to illuminate off-site parking areas
shall be so located, shielded and directed upon the parking area in such a
manner that they do not reflect or cause glare onto adjacent properties or
interfere with street traffic. In no instance shall bare unshaded bulbs be used
for such illumination.
      h.   Such parking areas shall be graded and properly drained in such a
manner that there will be no free flow of water onto either adjacent property
or public sidewalks. Further, any additional run-off generated by such improved
areas shall be disposed of in appropriate drainage facilities.
      i.   Such parking areas shall be so lined or designated as to insure the
most efficient use of the parking spaces, and provided with bumper guards or
wheel guards so located that no part of the parked vehicle will extend beyond
the boundary of the established parking area into any minimum required yard or
onto adjoining property.
      j.   No business signs or advertisements shall be permitted in parking
areas; provided, however, directional and identification signs shall be
permitted in accordance with Sec.
1.05(I)B
      k.   Parking areas located in the business and industrial districts shall
be provided with a solid landscape screen not less than four (4) feet in height
whenever the parking area is located within one hundred (100) feet of adjoining
residential uses or fronting upon any adjoining residential uses, except as
otherwise provided in this Code.
      l.   The ground area between the required off-site parking area setback
and any lot line shall be landscaped with appropriate material to adequately
indicate delineation.
      m.   Parking areas may be provided with a one-story shelter building or
guard building which shall not exceed one hundred (100) square feet of gross
floor area and shall conform to all the structural requirements of the
district.
I.   RESERVED.
J.   SAFETY AND VISION.
The following regulations provide for the maximum safety of persons using
sidewalks and streets: on any corner lot, a wall, fence, sign, structure,
display of merchandise or any other plant growth that obstructs sight lines at
elevations between two and one-half (2½) feet and ten (10) feet above the crown
of the adjacent roadway shall not be placed or maintained within a triangle of
the area of the lot twenty-five (25) feet from the street right-of-way at
intersections.
K.   FENCES.
Fences in business districts (B-1, B-2, B-3, and B-4) where used for commercial
or industrial uses shall be allowed subject to the following provisions:
   1.   All fences built in these districts shall require a permit.
   2.   Fences intended for security purposes shall not exceed a maximum height
of eight feet, plus a maximum of three (3) strands of barbed wire, and shall be
allowed within any side or rear yards; however, they shall not be allowed in
any green strip or buffer area.
   3.   Fencing intended for decorative purposes only may be allowed anywhere
on a parcel, provided it does not exceed three and one-half (3-1/2) feet in
height.

1.06 UD - UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   UD Unit Development Plan District.
This district is intended to provide more development flexibility than is
possible through the application of customary zoning regulations. In
recognition of both the rapid changes in design and technology in the building
industry and new demands in the housing market, it is deemed necessary to meet
those changes in a manner that will be consistent with the best interests of
the Town.
A.   STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   1.   To encourage a more creative approach in land and building site
planning.
   2.   To encourage an efficient, aesthetic, and desirable use of open space.
   3.   To promote variety in the physical development pattern of the
community; including mixed-use development.
   4.   To achieve flexibility and incentives for residential development which
will produce a wider range of choice in satisfying the changing urban needs;
including cluster development.
   5.   To encourage renewal of older areas where new development and
restoration are needed to revitalize the areas.
   6.   To permit special consideration of property with unique features, such
as historical significance, unusual topography, landscape amenities, and size
and shape.
   7.   To recapture by-passed land so poorly planned and developed as to be a
public liability.
   8.   To simplify processing of development proposals for developers and the
Commission by providing for concurrent review of land use, subdivisions, public
improvements, and siting considerations.
B.    APPLICABILITY.
   1.   The provisions of this section shall apply to a tract of land of at
least five (5) acres in area for undeveloped areas within the Town. These
provisions may apply to a proposed development in which the primary or entire
use is business or enclosed industrial use when the proposal is deemed to be in
the best interests of the Town.
   2.   The provisions of this section shall apply only to proposed new
developments and shall not apply to any part of an area contained within a
subdivision previously approved and recorded in accordance with the
requirements of
Chapter 91: Subdivision Control Plan, prior to 1988; provided, however, that a
petitioner may, upon application and approval of the Commission, become subject
to all the benefits and burdens of this section, subject to such rights as
shall have been vested in the owners of the area affected by development under
such Subdivision Control Plan; provided that any plat shall first be vacated.
   3.   The basic land unit of a unit development plan is the block, parcel,
tract, combination of lots, or acreage, and not the lot. However, divisible
geographic sections of the entire planned unit development may be designated.
      a.   A proposed unit development plan shall be designed to produce an
environment of stable and desirable character in keeping with the principles of
good neighborhood design and must provide standards of open space, efficiency
in street patterns, and areas for parking adequate for the occupancy proposed,
or equal to the requirements of this code.
      b.   Before approval of a preliminary unit development plan, a detailed
determination of land use intensity shall be declared by the developer, and the
Commission shall make a finding that the intensity is consistent with the
comprehensive development plan of current adoption and in the best interest of
the Town.
C.   PROCEDURE.
The authorization of a unit development plan shall be subject to the procedures
expressed herein:
   1.   Upon a petition of the owners of property of 50% or more of the area
involved in the petition, or upon a petition initiated by the Town of New
Palestine Plan Commission, a preliminary plan for any area proposed for
development as a unit development plan shall be first presented to the Zoning
Administrator. At such presentation, three (3) copies of a preliminary plan of
the proposed development, containing the following information, shall be
submitted for review:
      a.   Boundaries of the tract to be developed as part of the planned unit
development.
      b.   Base mapping of the property showing the physical features, general
topography, drainageways, water bodies, tree cover, and existing land uses.
      c.   Highways and streets in the vicinity of the tract, and the ingress
and egress to the tract.
      d.   Location of different general land use areas proposed to be
developed.
      e.   Proposed density levels of each residential area.
      f.   Proposed square footage of commercial or industrial areas.
      g.   An enumeration of covenants, in general terms, proposed to be made a
part of the unit development plan.
      h.   A statement expressing the order and estimated time of development,
if the planned unit development is to be developed in stages, or if
construction is to extend beyond a one-year time frame.
      i.   Proposed treatment of existing topography, drainageways and tree
cover.
      j.   Proposed general location of major vehicular circulation, showing
how this circulation pattern relates to the official Thoroughfare Plan of the
Town.
      k.   Location of schools, parks and other community facility sites, if
any.
      l.   Time schedule of projected development, if the total landholding is
to be developed in stages, or if construction is to extend beyond a one year
period.
   2.   Within fifteen (15) days after the presentation, the Plan Commission
staff (See
Chapter 91) at the request of the President of the Plan Commission, a committee
of three (3) members of the Plan Commission, shall consult with the petitioner
regarding the preliminary plan. After the consultation, the petitioner may make
modifications to the petition which are deemed appropriate.
   3.   Application for approval of the planned development shall then be
submitted to the Plan Commission with a letter of recommendation from the
Zoning Administrator, accompanied by six (6) copies of the preliminary plan
(with modifications, if any) and any other desired supporting documents at a
regular meeting of the Commission, as a petition for amendment of the zoning
code and subject to the procedures applicable thereto. The Plan Commission may
approve the plan as amended, or disapprove the plan. The Commission may impose
any reasonable conditions upon its approval, including the recording of
covenants. If approved, the preliminary plan with amendments, if any, shall be
stamped "approved preliminary unit development plan" and be signed by the
president and secretary of the Commission and one copy shall be permanently
retained in the office of the Commission.
   4.   The approved preliminary unit development plan shall then be certified
to the Town Board for approval as a "UD" Unit Development Plan District
pursuant to the laws governing amendment of the Zoning Code.
   5.   Upon approval by the Town Council, the planned development shall be
returned to the Plan Commission, which shall thereafter exercise continuing
jurisdiction. Before any development takes place, the Commission shall approve
a detailed site plan specifying the exact location, composition, and
engineering features of all lots, drainage, sewage, water supply facilities,
recreational facilities, site perimeter treatment, and other pertinent site
development features, including locations and features of proposed buildings.
The approval shall be conditional upon finding by the Commission that the
detailed site plan is consistent with the approved preliminary unit development
plan. The approved detailed site plan shall be stamped "Approved detailed unit
development plan" and be signed by the president and secretary of the
Commission, and one copy shall be permanently retained in the office of the
Commission.
   6.   The approval of the preliminary UD shall be for two (2) years after its
adoption by the Common Council. Within this two (2) year period the planned
unit development shall receive approval of the final detailed site plan for the
first section or the entire development. Should the planned development not
receive approval of the detailed site plan for one (1) section or the entire
development within the two (2) years, the Plan Commission may initiate a
rezoning of the property or extend the approval period. The approval of the
detailed site plan for each section of the preliminary UD shall extend the
approval length of the preliminary UD for two (2) years.
   7.   An "approved detailed Unit Development Plan" may mean and be designated
the same as a final plat and approval of the final plat shall in all instances
precede final plat approval for record in accordance with the subdivision
control chapter of this Code.
   8.   A refusal by the Commission to approve a detailed site plan shall not
be construed as a denial, and any such refusal shall not operate as a
limitation on the right of the petitioner to continue to seek approval, nor
shall it impair the right of the petitioner to obtain an extension of time for
approval. In the event that approval of a detailed site plan is not obtained
within the two (2) year period or an approved extension of time, the Commission
shall initiate an amendment of the zoning code so that the land will be zoned
into the category or categories it held before being reclassified as an "UD"
District.
   9.   The Commission may allow the petitioner to develop the property
involved in phases. If the phasing is permitted, the Commission may allow the
petitioner to submit partial detailed site plans, which correspond to the
phases involved. The partial detailed site plans, when approved, shall be
treated in the same manner as approved detailed site plans for an entire Unit
Development Plan.
   10.   Where a platting, replatting or vacation of streets within all or a
portion of the land involved is contemplated, the Commission shall handle such
matters in accordance with its regular procedures in accordance with the law.
   11.   No construction or installation work shall be done on any public
improvement until satisfactory plans and specifications therefor have been
submitted to the Commission in accordance with the subdivision control chapter
of
Chapter 91: Subdivision Control Plan, and the petitioner has, at least twenty-
four (24) hours in advance, notified the Commission of his intention to begin
such work in order that inspections may be made as the work progresses.
   12.   In the exercise of its continual jurisdiction, the Commission may from
time to time modify the approved detailed Unit Development Plan in a manner
consistent with the approved preliminary Unit Development Plan to allow for
changed circumstances and conditions unforeseen at the time of original
approval. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to approve minor modifications
that do not:
      a.   Alter the basic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent
property;
      b.   Change the uses permitted;
      c.   Increase the maximum density floor area or height by more than 15%;
      d.   Decrease the amount of off-street parking;
      e.   Reduce the minimum yards or setbacks by more than 15%;
      f.   Alter site ingress or egress in any way or create a substantial
change to on-site circulation, as determined by the city engineer.
      g.   Upon submission of a request for a minor modification, the director
shall have ten (10) working days to respond to the petitioner, by either
approving or rejecting the request. An applicant may appeal the decision of the
Zoning Administrator to the Plan Commission.
   13.   All development shall be in conformity with the approved detailed
Planned Unit Development. In the exercise of its continuing jurisdiction, the
Commission shall take cognizance of any material deviations from the approved
Detailed Planned Unit Development and take appropriate enforcement action.
   14.   Approval by the Commission shall expire after a period of five (5)
years from the approval of a Detailed Unit Development Plan unless the
development is fifty percent (50%) completed in terms of public improvements,
including parks, walkways and utility installations in which instance an
extension of time may be granted by the Commission not to exceed five (5)
successive periods of two (2) years each.
   15.   All proceedings brought under this Section shall be subject to the
rules of procedure of the Commission.
D.   ABANDONMENT OR EXPIRATION.
Upon the abandonment of a development authorized under this Section
(abandonment shall be deemed to have occurred when no improvements have been
made pursuant to the approved Detailed Unit Development Plan for twenty-four
(24) consecutive months, or upon the expiration of five (5) years from the
approval by the Commission of a Detailed Unit Development Plan for a
development which has not been completed or the expiration of an extension
granted by the Commission), the Commission shall initiate an amendment to this
Zoning Code so that the land will be zoned (or reclassified) into a category or
categories which most nearly approximates its then existing use or such other
zoning category which it deems appropriate.
E.    RECORDING.
An approved Detailed Unit Development and modifications thereof shall be
recorded in the appropriate plat books in the offices of the County Recorder
within six (6) months after approval by the Plan Commission or the Zoning
Administrator.
F.    PERMIT.
No improvement location permit shall be issued for a "UD" District by the
Zoning Administrator unless all recording required by subsection E of this
section has been effected, and no Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued for
a "UD" District unless the approved Detailed Unit Development Plan with
modifications, if any, is adhered to, all to be in compliance with the purposes
of this Section and the Subdivision Control Chapter of this code.
G.   COVENANTS AND MAINTENANCE; FINANCIAL GUARANTEES.
   1.   Covenants shall be required by the Plan Commission as an ingredient for
stability and longevity of the Unit Development Plan, and shall set forth in
detail provisions for the ownership and maintenance of facilities held in
common so as to reasonably insure their continuity and conservation. Covenant
provisions shall include specific remedies in the event facilities held in
common are permitted to deteriorate or are not maintained in a condition
consistent with the best interests of the Town, in which event the Town shall
take those remedial steps provided for in such provisions.
   2.   The Plan Commission may require the recording of covenants for any
reasonable public or semipublic purpose, including but not limited to the
allocation of land by the petitioner for public thoroughfares, parks, schools,
recreational facilities and other public and semipublic purposes wherever
necessary in conformity with the land use plan of current adoption. Such
covenants shall provide that if a governmental unit or agency thereof does not
proceed with acquisition of the allocated land within the specified period of
time, the covenants shall automatically terminate. If such termination occurs,
the petitioner shall then submit for approval by the Commission a modified
detailed site plan for such land consistent with the approved Preliminary Unit
Development such modified detailed site plans, when approved, shall be treated
in the same manner as approved detailed site plans for an entire Unit
Development Plan.
   3.   The Commission may require the recording of covenants for any other

10, Definitions) is shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (of Hancock County,
Indiana) 180419 01008 (dated October 15, 1982).
B.   USES PERMITTED BY RIGHT.
The following uses have a low flood damage potential and do not obstruct flood
flows. These uses shall be permitted by right within the Flood Plain District
to the extent that they are not prohibited or not otherwise controlled by other
parts of the this Code, and provided they do not require structures, fill, or
storage of materials or equipment:
   1.   Agricultural uses such as general farming, pasture, grazing, orchards,
plant nurseries and vineyards.
   2.   Forestry, wildlife areas and nature preserves.
   3.   Parks and recreational uses, such as golf courses, driving ranges and

proposed development. Elevation should be in National Geodetic Vertical Datum
of 1929 (NGVD) or North American Vertical Datum (NAVD). In either case the
conversion formula should be included.
   2.   Upon receipt of an application for an Improvement Location Permit, the
Zoning Administrator shall determine if the site is located within an
identified floodway, floodway fringe or within the floodplain where the limits
of the floodway have not yet been determined.
      a.   If the site is in an identified floodway the Zoning Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Department of Natural Resources and
apply for a permit for construction in a floodway.
      b.   Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 et seq. a permit from the
Natural Resources Commission is required prior to the issuance of a local
building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction or obstruction
activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities
such as filling, grading, clearing and paving and the like undertaken before
the actual start of construction of the building.
      c.   No action shall be taken by the Zoning Administrator until a permit
has been issued by the Natural Resources Commission granting approval for
construction in the floodway. Once a permit has been issued by the Natural
Resources Commission, the Zoning Administrator may issue the local Improvement
Location Permit, provided the provisions contained in subsections (F) and (G)
of this section have been met. The Improvement Location Permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit issued by the Natural Resources Commission.
      d.   If the site is located in an identified floodway fringe, then the
Zoning Administrator may issue the local Improvement Location Permit, provided
the provisions contained in subsections (F) and (G) of this section have been
met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or
substantially improved structure shall be at or above the Flood Protection
Grade (FPG).
      e.   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and floodway fringe have not yet been determined (shown as Zone A on
the Flood Hazard Boundary Map), and the drainage area upstream of the site is
greater than one square mile, the Zoning Administrator shall require the
applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and
specifications, to the Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.
      f.   No action shall be taken by the Zoning Administrator until either a
permit for construction in the floodway or a letter of recommendation citing
the 100 year flood elevation and the recommended Flood Protection Grade has
been received from the Department of Natural Resources.
      g.   Once the Zoning Administrator has received the proper permit or
letter of recommendation approving the proposed development, an Improvement
Location Permit may be issued provided the conditions of the Improvement
Location Permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in divisions (F) and (G) of this
section have been met.
G.   PREVENTING INCREASED DAMAGES. No development in the Special Flood Hazard
Area (SFHA) shall create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood
heights or velocity or threat to public health and safety.
   1.   Within the floodway identified on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map or the
Flood Insurance Rate Map, the following standards shall apply:
      a.   No development shall be allowed which, acting alone or in
combination with existing or future development, will cause any increase in the
elevation of the regulatory flood; and
      b.   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data.
   2.   Within all Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) identified as A Zones (no
100 year flood elevation and/or floodway/floodway fringe delineation has been
provided). The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the regulatory flood elevation more than one-tenth (0.1) of one foot and will
not increase flood damages or potential flood damages.
   3.   Public Health Standards in all Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).
      a.   No development in the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) shall include
locating or storing chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable
liquids, pollutants, or other hazardous or toxic materials below the Flood
Protection Grade, unless such materials are stored in a floodproofed storage
tank or building constructed according to the requirements of subsection (H) of
this section.
      b.   New and replacement sanitary sewer lines and on-site waste disposal
systems may be permitted providing all manholes or other above ground openings
are located above the FPG, or those which are located below the FPG are
watertight.
H.   PROTECTING BUILDINGS.
In addition to the damage prevention requirements of division (F), all
buildings to be located in the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) shall be
protected from flood damage below the FPG.
   1.   This building protection requirement applies to the following
situations:
      a.   Construction or placement of any new building valued at more than
$1,000; or greater than 400 square feet, whichever is less.
      b.   Structural alterations made to an existing building that increase
the market value of the building by more than 50% (excluding the value of the
land);
      c.   Any subsequent alterations;
      d.   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged building that are valued
at or more than 50% of the market value of the building (excluding the value of
the land) before damage occurred;
      e.   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured
home on an existing site. This division does not apply to returning the
existing manufactured home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it was
removed to avoid flood damage; and
      f.   Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site for
more than 180 days.
   2.   This building protection requirement may be met by one of the following
methods. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain a record of compliance with
these building protection standards as required in subsection (1) of this
section.
      a.   A residential or nonresidential building may be constructed on a
permanent land fill in accordance with the following:
         1.   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than 1 foot deep

of "LOWEST FLOOR" in Section
10, Definitions) shall be at or above the Flood Protection Grade (FPG).
      b.   A residential or nonresidential building may be elevated in
accordance with the following:
         1.   The building or improvements shall be elevated on posts, piers,
columns, extended walls, or other types of similar foundation, provided:
            a.   Walls of any enclosure below the elevated floor shall be
designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on the walls by
allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters, through providing a minimum of
two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) having a total area of one
square foot for every two square feet of enclosed area subject to flooding. The
bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
            b.   Any enclosure below the elevated floor is used for storage of
vehicles and building access.
         2.   The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored and
aligned in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures so as to minimize
exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as buoyancy, current, waves, ice,
and floating debris.
         3.   All areas below the Flood Protection Grade (FPG) shall be
constructed of materials resistant to flood damage. The top of the lowest floor
(including basement) and all electrical, heating, ventilating, plumbing, and
air conditioning equipment and utility meters shall be located at or above the
Flood Protection Grade (FPG). Water and sewer pipes, electrical and telephone
lines, submersible pumps, and other waterproofed service facilities may be
located below the Flood Protection Grade (FPG).
      c.   Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or
substantially improved on a site for more than 180 days must meet one of the
following anchoring requirements:
         1.   The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent foundation
such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the Flood Protection Grade
(FPG) and securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to
resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. This requirement applies to
all manufactured homes to be placed on a site;
            a.   Outside a manufactured home park or subdivision;
            b.   In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
            c.   In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision; or
            d.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which
a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood.
         2.   This requirement applies to all manufactured homes to be placed
on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that has not
been substantially damaged by a flood.
      d.   The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the lowest floor of
the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other
foundation elements that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and
be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
         1.   Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either:
            a.   Be on the site for less than 180 consecutive days;
            b.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (defined as being
on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions); or
            c.   Meet the requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection (
1.04) of this Ordinance.
         2.   A nonresidential building may be floodproofed to the Flood
Protection Grade (FPG) (in lieu of elevating) if done in accordance with the
following:
            a.   A Registered Professional Engineer shall certify that the
building has been designed so that below the Flood Protection Grade (FPG), the
structure and attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of
resisting the effects of the regulatory flood. The building design shall take
into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic pressures,
and impacts from debris or ice.
            b.   Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human
intervention and without an outside source of electricity.
I.   OTHER DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS.
The Zoning Administrator shall review all proposed subdivisions to determine
whether the subdivision lies in a flood hazard area as defined. If the Zoning
Administrator finds the subdivision to be so located, the Zoning Administrator
shall forward plans and materials to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment. The Zoning Administrator shall require
appropriate changes and modifications in order to assure that:
   1.   It is consistent with the need to minimize flood damages;
   2.   All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, and
electrical;
   3.   Water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate
flood damage;
   4.   Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood
hazards;
   5.   Onsite waste disposal systems, if provided, will be so located and
designed to avoid impairment of them or contamination from them during the
occurrence of the regulatory flood.
Developers shall record the 100 year flood elevation on all subdivision plats
containing lands (identified elsewhere by ordinance) within a flood hazard area
prior to submitting the plats for approval by the Plan Commission.
All owners of manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within the
Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) identified as Zone A on the community's Flood
Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) shall develop an
evacuation plan for those lots located in the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)
and file it with the Plan Commission and have it filed with and approved by the
appropriate county emergency management authorities.
J.   VARIANCES. The Board of Zoning Appeals may consider issuing a variance to
the terms and provisions of this ordinance, provided the applicant demonstrates
that:
   1.   There exists a good and sufficient cause for the requested variance;
   2.   The strict application of the terms of this section will constitute an
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
   3.   The granting of the requested variance will not increase flood heights,
create additional threats to public safety, cause additional public expense,
create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing laws or ordinances.
   4.   The Board of Zoning Appeals may issue a variance to the terms and
provisions of this ordinance subject to the following standards and conditions:
      a.   No variance or exception for a residential use within a floodway
subject to subsection (F)(1) or (2) of this section may be granted.
      b.   Any variance or exception granted in a floodway subject to
subsections (F)(1)or (2) of this section will require a permit from Natural
Resources.
      c.   Variances or exceptions to the Building Protection Standards of
subsection (H) of this section may be granted only when a new structure is to
be located on a lot of one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and
surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the flood
protection grade.
   5.   Variance or exception may be granted for the reconstruction or
restoration of any structure individually listed on the Register of Historic
Places or the Indiana State Survey of Historic Architectural, Archaeological
and Cultural Sites, Structures, Districts, and Objects;
   6.   All variances shall give the minimum relief necessary and be such that
the maximum practical flood protection will be given to the proposed
construction; and
   7.   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall issue a written notice to the
recipient of a variance or exception that the proposed construction will be
subject to increased risks to life and property and could require payment of
increased flood insurance premiums.
K.   DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
The degree of flood protection required by this section is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions.
Therefore, this Code (
Chapter 90) does not create any liability on the part of the town, Natural
Resources, or the state, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
this section or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
1.08 H - HIGHWAY CORRIDOR OVERLAY.
A.   PURPOSE, INTENT, AUTHORITY, AND APPLICATION.
   1.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section to establish
standards for the design of sites, buildings, structures, plantings, signs,
street hardware, and such other improvements that are visible to the public and
affect the physical development of land within the US 52 (Main Street) Corridor
Overlay Zone District.
   2.   Statement of Intent. These standards are intended to promote high
quality creative development that will combine imagination, innovation, and
variety in the appearance of buildings and sites in the overlay zone. These
standards are further intended to preserve and enhance property values and to
promote the public health, safety, and welfare by providing for consistent and
coordinated treatment of the property encompassed by the US 52 (Main Street)
Corridor Overlay District.
   3.   Authority. Authority underlying creation of the US 52 (Main Street)
Corridor Overlay Zone District are provided for in 36-7-4-201 et seq. and 36-7-
4-601 et seq all acts amendatory or supplemental thereto.
   4.   Statement of Significance.
      a.   The US 52 (Main Street) corridor lies in the path of the outward
growth of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Area and is expected to experience
increasing pressures for commercial development in the future. Because the
Hancock County Overlay Districts borders the Town of New Palestine it is
necessary to make sure that the Town sets their own similar policies so that
the town stays consistent with the county. This will ensure that the town is
safeguarded from negative development that is otherwise restricted by the
county.
      b.   The visibility and accessibility of the land within the corridor is
unique and therefore commands the highest standards of development which
stimulate substantial capital investments, encourage efficient land use,
promote coordinated development, permit innovative site designs, establish
development standards and preserves the integrity of the roadways within the
corridor.
   5.   Title. This portion of the Zoning Ordinance shall be known as the US 52
(Main Street) Corridor Overlay Zone District of the Town of New Palestine and
may be so cited and pleaded and shall be referred to herein as the US 52 (Main
Street) Overlay Zone District.
   6.   Conflict, Severability.
      a.   If any portion of the US 52 (Main Street) Overlay Zone District is
found to be in conflict with any other provisions of any zoning, building,
fire, safety, or health ordinance of the Town of New Palestine, the provision
which establishes the higher standard shall prevail.
      b.   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of the US 52
(Main Street) Overlay Zone District or its application to any person or
circumstance is held invalid by the decision of any court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of the US 52 (Main Street) Overlay Zone District,
or the application of the provisions to other persons or circumstances is in
effect and shall remain in full force.
   7.   Jurisdiction. This Section shall apply to the area of the Town of New
Palestine, Indiana and within the corporate limits of the Town of New Palestine
Plan Commission.
   8.   Application. This Section shall apply to all development in the Overlay
Zone District excluding single family residential and agricultural structures,
projects, or developments.

this area.
      b.   Planting Adjacent to Free Standing Buildings. A planting area equal
to an area measuring five (5) feet in depth by the width of the front of the
building plus five (5) feet (to extend to out on both sides) shall be installed
at the front of the building. A planting area equal to an area five (5) feet in
depth by the remaining sides of the building shall be installed on all other
sides of the building. These adjacent planting areas need not be rectangular in
shape as long as the required amount of space is landscaped, and innovative and
original designs are encouraged. The adjacent planting area at the rear of a
structure may be excluded if that structure is located less than forty (40)
feet from the rear property line and sufficient peripheral planting is included
to compensate for its removal.
      c.   Sidewalks may be permitted in the landscape areas, but shall not
occupy the entire area on any side of the building.
      d.   Peripheral Planting. A peripheral landscaping strip, four (4) feet
in depth, shall be installed along the side of any private parking area which
abuts any side or rear property line separating the parcel from any

lineal feet shall be planted in any such peripheral landscaping strip.
      e.   Planting Within Parking Lots. All parking lot landscaping shall be
of a quality to improve and enhance the site and its surrounding area.
Effective use of mounding and existing topography is encouraged. Landscaping
and planting areas shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the parking area,
and not less than five percent (5%) of a private parking lot shall be
landscaped. (For purposes of this computation, landscaping in: (1) the
Greenbelt; (2) adjacent to buildings; and (3) on the periphery of the lot shall
not be included. Landscaping shall be specifically provided at the ends of
parking rows and as a means of separating parking from major circulation isles
within parking lots.)
   3.   Landscaping Standards.
      a.   The interior dimensions, specifications, and design of any planting
area or planting medium proposed to be constructed shall be sufficient to
protect the landscaping materials planted therein and to provide for proper
growth.
      b.   The primary landscaping materials used in the Greenbelt and adjacent
to buildings shall consist of one or a combination of the following: shade
trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, ground covers, grass, mulches, and the like.
      c.   The primary landscaping materials used in and around private parking
areas shall be trees, which provide shade at maturity. Shrubbery, hedges, and
other planting material may be used to compliment tree landscaping, but shall
not be the sole contribution to the landscaping.
      d.   All shade trees proposed to be used in accordance with any
landscaping plan shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet in overall height and
have a minimum trunk diameter, twelve (12) inches above the ground of two (2)
inches upon planting. They should be of a variety which will attain an average
mature spread greater than twenty (20) feet.
      e.   Landscaping materials selected should be appropriate to local
growing and climatic conditions. Wherever appropriate, existing trees should be
conserved and integrated into the landscaping plan. Plant material shall be
selected for interest in its structure, texture, and other hardy plants that
are harmonious to the design and of good appearance shall be used.
      f.   The landscaping plan shall ensure that sight distances are not
obstructed for drivers of motor vehicles.
      g.   Where natural or existing topographic patterns contribute to beauty
and utility of a development, they shall be preserved and developed.
Modification to topography shall be permitted where it contributes to good
appearance.
      h.   Grades of walks, parking spaces, terraces, and other paved areas
shall provide an inviting and stable appearance for walking and, if seating is
provided, for sitting.
      i.   Landscape treatment shall be provided to enhance architectural
features, strengthening vistas and important axis, and provide shade.
Spectacular effects shall be reserved for special locations only.
      j.   Unity of design shall be achieved by repetition of certain plant
varieties and other materials and by correlation with adjacent developments.
      k.   In locations where plants will be susceptible to injury by
pedestrian or motor traffic, they shall be protected by appropriate curbs, tree
guards, or other devices.
      l.   Where building sites limit planting, the placement of trees along
interior roads, drives or paved areas is encouraged and the tree spread shall
be a minimum of four (4) feet.
      m.   Screening of service yards and other places that tend to be
unsightly shall be accomplished by use of walls, fencing, planting, or
combinations of these. Screening shall be equally effective in winter and
summer.
      n.   In areas where general planting will not prosper, other materials
such as fences, walls, and pavings of wood, brick, stone, gravel, and cobbles
shall be used. Carefully selected plants shall be combined with such materials
where possible.
      o.   Miscellaneous structures and street hardware shall be designed to be
part of the architectural concept of design and landscape. Materials shall be
compatible with buildings, scale shall be consistent, colors shall be in
harmony with buildings and surroundings, and proportions shall be attractive.
      p.   Lighting in connection with miscellaneous structures and street
hardware shall meet the criteria applicable to site, landscape, buildings, and
signs.
   4.   Landscaping Installation and Maintenance.
      a.   Installation. All landscaping required by the approved landscaping
plan shall be installed prior to the issuance of a building occupancy permit if
said permit is issued during a planting season or within six (6) months of the
date. If issued during a non-planting season then a performance bond shall be
posted for the cost of the planting(s) and planting must take place within six
(6) months of approval.
      b.   Maintenance. It shall be the responsibility of the owners and their
agencies to insure proper maintenance of the landscaping, in accordance with
the standards set by this Section and as indicated on the landscaping plan,
which has been approved by the Plan Commission. This is to include, but is not
limited to, replacing dead plantings with identical varieties or a suitable
substitute, and keeping the area free of refuse and debris.
      c.   Changes after Approval. No landscaping which has been approved by
the Plan Commission may later be altered, eliminated, or sacrificed, without
first obtaining further written Plan Commission approval.
      d.   Inspection. The Plan Commission, Zoning Administrator, or their duly
appointed representative, shall have the authority to visit any lot within US
52 (Main Street) Overlay Zone District to inspect the landscaping and check it
against the approved plan on file.
F.   PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
Efforts to break up large expanses of pavement are to be encouraged by the
interspersing of appropriate planting areas. The number of parking spaces
required are as established in Sections
1.04 and
1.05 of the New Palestine Zoning Ordinance, depending upon the zoning and the
intended land use. Alternatives to the established parking requirements may be
granted to developments which have a mixture of uses whose peak parking
requirements do not coincide in time and thereby may share parking spaces. The
applicant shall provide expertly prepared justification for seeking such
exceptions. There shall be an appropriate number of parking spaces, accessible
to the building(s) and identified as reserved for use by handicapped
individuals, and these spaces shall be of sufficient width (minimum of twelve
(12) feet) to accommodate their needs.
G.   LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS.
In reviewing the lighting plan for a lot proposed to be developed in the US 52
(Main Street) Corridor Overlay Zone District, factors to be considered by the
Commission shall include but are not limited to:
   1.   Safety provided by the lighting.
   2.   Security provided by the lighting.
   3.   Possible light spillage or glare onto adjoining properties or streets.
(Down-shielding is encouraged and spillage or glare onto adjoining properties
is prohibited.)
   4.   Attractiveness of the lighting standards and their compatibility with
the overall treatment of the property.
   5.   Height and placement of lighting standards considering the use.
   6.   Exterior lighting, when used, shall enhance the building design and the
adjoining landscape.
   7.   Lighting standards and building fixtures shall be of a design and size
compatible with the building and adjacent areas.
   8.   Lighting shall be restrained in design and excessive brightness
avoided.
H.   ACCESS TO INDIVIDUAL SITES.
The "Corridor" streets by their functional nature as primary thoroughfares must
have reasonable restrictions as to the number and location of access points
within the overlay zone.
Therefore, in order to provide safe and sufficient traffic movement to and from
adjacent lands and to protect the functional integrity to the corridor's
primary thoroughfares, in many cases frontage roads, access roads, and
distributors roads will have to be built.
Such roads shall be coordinated with those of contiguous lots and designed to
preserve the aesthetic benefits provided by the greenbelt areas. Access at the
side or rear of buildings is encouraged. New access points onto the primary
thoroughfares in the corridors shall be coordinated with existing access points
whenever possible. The following curb cut policy shall apply throughout the US
52 (Main Street) corridor.
Curb Cuts - no more than (1) for every one-hundred and fifty (150) feet of
frontage, a minimum of one driveway cut shall be provided for each lot. No curb
cuts within fifty (50) feet of any intersection of public roads. Opposing curb
cuts shall align squarely or be offset no less than fifty (50) feet.
I.   ACCESS TO POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT SITES.
Stub streets shall be built in all cases where adjacent lots have reasonable
potential for development. Reasonable potential shall include any adjacent
parcel of adequate size for commercial or residential development or any
adjacent parcels determined by the Plan Commission.
J.   OTHER STANDARDS.
   1.   Outside Storage Prohibited. No outside, unenclosed storage of refuse or
recyclable material (whether or not in containers) or display of merchandise
shall be permitted on any lot. All refuse or recyclable material shall be
contained completely within the principle or accessory building(s) or screened
from view by an appropriate enclosure. The Plan Commission or its duly
appointed or designated representative may make exceptions to this requirement
on a case by case basis.
   2.   Loading Berth Requirements. Loading berth requirements shall be as
specified in the underlying zone district(s), except that any loading or
unloading berth or bay shall be solidly screened from view beyond the site by
landscaping or other screening effective all year long.
   3.   Accessory Buildings and Uses. All accessory buildings and uses which
are permitted in the underlying zoning district(s) shall be permitted within
the US 52 (Main Street) Corridor Overlay Zone District, except that any
detached accessory building on any lot shall be architecturally compatible with
the principle building(s) with which it is associated. All accessory buildings
shall have a roof.
   4.   Paving Requirements. All parking areas shall be finished with a hard
surface such as asphalt or concrete.

2.11 NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS, LOTS AND USES.
A.   PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   1.   Within the districts established by this Ordinance or by amendments
that may later be adopted, there may exist certain structures or uses of land
that were lawful before this ordinance was passed or amended, but which are
prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or may be
by future amendments hereto.
   2.   It is the intent of this ordinance to permit these nonconforming uses
to continue under the provisions of this section until they are removed, but
not to encourage their survival.
B.   NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   1.   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.
C.   NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURE OR STRUCTURES AND LAND IN COMBINATION.
   1.   May be extended. A nonconforming use may be extended throughout a
structure which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment to this Section, provided the size of the structure is
not increased and the use is not extended to occupy any land outside such
structure.
   2.   Use cannot be changed to nonconforming use. Whenever a nonconforming
use has been changed to a conforming use or to a use permitted in a district of
greater restrictions, it shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming
use.
   3.   No structure erected in nonconforming use premises. No structure shall
be erected on any premises devoted to a nonconforming use, except in
conformance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
   4.   Discontinuance of nonconforming use. In the event that a nonconforming
use of any structure or premises is discontinued for a period of one (1) year,
except when government action impedes access to the premises, the use of the
same shall thereafter conform to the uses permitted in the district in which it
is located, and any nonconforming dwelling which is deficient in ground floor
area, and which may be removed from the lot.
   5.   Damage to nonconforming use structure. If a structure or other
structure containing a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed by any means
to the extent of sixty percent (60%) or more of its then fair market value, the
structure can be rebuilt or used thereafter only for a conforming use and in
compliance with the provisions of the district in which it is located. In the
event the damage or destruction is less than sixty percent (60%) of its fair
market value, based upon prevailing costs, the structure may then be restored
to its original condition and the occupancy or use of such structure may be
continued which existed at the time of such partial destruction. It shall be
the decision of the Zoning Administrator as to the percentage determination.
In either event, restoration or repair of the structure must be started within
a period of six (6) months from the date of damage or destruction and
diligently prosecuted to completion.
   6.   Honoring previous permits. Nothing herein contained shall require any
change in the plans for the construction or designated use of a structure for
which a building permit has been heretofore issued, and the actual construction
of which has been diligently prosecuted within ninety (90) days of the date of
the permit, and which entire structure shall be completed according to such
plans filed on or before the adoption date of this Ordinance. Actual
construction is defined to include the erection of construction materials in
permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner.
   7.   Structures may be made safe. Nothing in this Section shall prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any part of any structure
declared unsafe by proper authority.

the same manner to a use, which may become a non-conforming use as a result of
an amendment to this Section.
   9.   Nonconforming lot areas and widths. A single family dwelling may be
located on any lot in any district in which single family dwellings are
permitted if the lot was single parcel in single ownership, or a single parcel
included in a subdivision of record on or before the approval of this Code,
even though the lot does not have the minimum lot width or the minimum lot area
specified for the district, provided that the lot size and lot width meet the
minimum standards of the Health Department, and provided further that the width
of the lot, as measure at the building line, shall be at least seventy-five
(75) percent of that required by the term of the Section
1.04-

the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   10.   Repairs and maintenance. On any nonconforming structure or portion of
a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary
repairs or on repair or replacement of walls, fixtures, heating, wiring or
plumbing, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming
shall not be increased.
If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to the lack of
repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be
unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be
restored, repaired or rebuilt after six months of such declaration except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.

Zoning Administrator at least twenty (20) calendar days prior to the next
regular meeting of the Commission. Petitions filed too late to comply with this
section shall be heard at public hearing at the succeeding regular meeting of
the Commission. The purpose of this section is to enable the members to examine
and study the pending petitions and to conduct any investigation deemed
advisable.
   4.   All such petitions not initiated by the Commission itself shall be
accompanied by a filing fee in an amount established by the Plan Commission to
defray the administrative and investigative expenses of the Commission. In
addition, the petition must contain:
      a.   Subject of the petition,

to the petition,
      g.   If the property owner is not the petitioner, a letter of consent
from the owner must be submitted,
      h.   Any other information reasonably required by the Administrator.
   5.   If the Zoning Administrator finds that the petition is in good order
with sufficient information, he will set a time and place for holding a public
hearing.
   6.   The petitioner's responsibility in reference to notification for public
hearing is as follows:
      a.   Once the petition has been accepted for public hearing by the Zoning
Administrator, interested parties shall be notified of the time and place of
the public hearing. This shall be done by certified letter with return receipt
requested at the expense of the petitioner. At the public hearing the
petitioner shall provide proof that he has conformed to the above.
      b.   At least ten (10) days prior to the date set for the hearing, the
petitioner shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation, in the Town,
the notice of time and place of hearing. The form of notice shall be approved
by the Plan Commission.
      c.   The petitioner shall place a sign, stating the nature of the
petition and the date, time and place of public hearing to be placed in a
prominent location on the petitioned site. The location of the sign shall be at
the option of the Zoning Administrator, but shall be not more than twenty-five
(25) feet from the front property line.
   7.   The Zoning Administrator shall accept no petition unless accompanied by
or included with all information, data, statistics, and/ or plats, which the
Zoning Administrator may, in his discretion, deem necessary for an intelligent
determination by the Commission.
   8.   Conduct of Hearing - The conduct of a public hearing shall be as
established in the Plan Commission's Rules of Procedure.
   9.   In preparing and considering proposals to amend the text or maps of
this Zoning Ordinance, the Plan Commission and the Town Council shall consider:
      a.   The Comprehensive Plan;
      b.   Current conditions and the character of current structures and uses
in each district;
      c.   The highest and best use for which the land in each district is
adapted;
      d.   The conservation of property values throughout the jurisdiction; and
      e.   Responsible development and growth.
   10.   All petitioners must share the burden of proving the following points
to the satisfaction of the Commission:
      a.   That there was an error in the original zoning of the property when
the ordinance was adopted or that the character of the area under consideration
has changed either through technological advances or developmental changes.
      b.   That a change of zoning will not be injurious or detrimental to the
surrounding property values.
      c.   That if the change was granted it would promote orderly community
growth.
      d.   That the petition is not "spot zoning" which will confer a special
benefit on a relatively small tract without commensurate benefit to the
community.
   11.   Upon having satisfied itself that the petitioner has met the
requirements of Section
3.01 above, the Commission shall then decide whether or not the proposed change
meets the following requirements:
      a.   That the proposed change will not adversely affect the community.
      b.   That the neighborhood will not be disrupted or destroyed.
      c.   That the topography, soil condition, and other physical features of
the land involved is suitable for the proposed use and zoning change.

surrounding land.
      e.   That the proposed land use will be in general conformance with the
Town's Comprehensive Plan.
B.   FINAL DISPOSITION OF PETITION.
   1.   The final disposition of any petition shall be in the form of an order
setting forth the findings and determination of the Commission together with
any modification, specification, or limitation which it makes. The Zoning
Administrator shall provide a true copy of each order to all petitioners within
ten (10) days of final disposition.
   2.   The Commission may dismiss a petition for want of prosecution or lack
of jurisdiction. When a petitioner has failed to appear at a meeting for which
his case has been placed upon the official docket, the case may be dismissed
for want of prosecution.
   3.   A petitioner may not withdraw a petition after a roll call vote has
been called by the President or requested by the Commission.

again placed on the docket within a period of three (3) months after the date
of withdrawal.

not again be placed on the docket for consideration until six (6) months after
the date of decision previously rendered.
   6.   All petitions shall be forwarded to the Town Council for further
action.
   7.   When an amendment to the zoning map is approved, such amendment shall
be incorporated into the official zoning map maintained by the Town of New
Palestine.

incorporated into the official document according to the numbering system
established with this Ordinance.

Commission, or interested parties that were entitled to receive notice per
Title 9,
Chapter 90, Section
3.01(A)(6)(a), and as set forth in the Rules of Procedure for the New Palestine
Advisory Plan Commission. By permitting or requiring written commitments, the
Town of New Palestine Advisory Plan Commission does not obligate itself to
approve or deny any such request and specifically reserves the right to approve
or disapprove any proposed commitment, modification or termination of a written
commitment taking into account the same considerations as set forth in Title 9,
Chapter 90, Section
3.01(A)(9), (10) and (11). The acceptance or approval of written commitments
does not affect the validity of any covenant, easement, equitable servitude, or
other land use restrictions created in accordance with law.
   2.   Procedures.
      a.   Written commitments are required to be reviewed by the Plan
Commission, for recommendation to the Town Council, as related to annexation

the subdivision of real estate as regulated by I.C. 36-7-4-700 series.
      b.   In all cases, written commitments are required to be submitted to
the Zoning Administrator a minimum of ten (10) days prior to the date of the
Plan Commission hearing. Written commitments are required to be submitted in
the form supplied by the Zoning Administrator.
      c.   Written commitments shall be recorded in the office of the county
recorder and take effect upon approval of the proposal. An unrecorded
commitment is binding on the owner of the parcel. An unrecorded commitment is
binding on a subsequent owner of the parcel or a person acquiring an interest
in the parcel only if the subsequent owner or person acquiring the interest has
actual notice of the commitment.
   3.   Enforcement. Written commitments shall be binding on the owner,
subsequent owners of the real estate and other persons acquiring an interest
therein.
Written commitments may be enforced jointly or severally by:

of two (2) ownerships, but not exceeding six hundred sixty (660) feet from the
perimeter of the real estate, and all owners of real estate within the area
included in the petition who were not petitioners for the rezoning or approval.
The identity of owners shall be determined from the records in the offices of
the Assessors of Hancock County which list the current owners of record.
      c.   Any person, party, neighborhood association, or entity who
demonstrates to the Plan Commission an interest in being a party to the written
commitments.
      d.   The Town Council of New Palestine, Indiana.
   4.   Modification or Termination - Written commitments may be modified or
terminated only by the Town Council of New Palestine upon a recommendation from
the Plan Commission made at a public hearing after proper notice has been
given. A request to modify or terminate commitments made during a land use
hearing must be made in writing to the Zoning Administrator, to be submitted
for hearing on the next available agenda, after proper notice has been given.
The Plan Commission may consider a recommendation to modify written commitments
taking into consideration the elements set forth in Title 9,
Chapter 90, Section
3.01(A)(9), (10) and (11).
   5.   A written commitment automatically terminates after the adoption of the
proposal, if:
      a.   The zone map applicable to the parcel is changed, or
      b.   The parcel is designated as a planned unit development district.

other regulations and requirements of this Code. The provisions of a special
exception shall replace and supersede the provisions of the base zone (except
in the UD district), effective upon either construction of any facilities
approved as a part of the special exception or upon beginning of operation of
the use or uses specified, whichever occurs first. The provisions shall remain
in effect until such time as the special exception use ceases to operate.
Immediately prior to reuse of the structures or facilities used for the special
exception, the provisions of the special exception shall become invalid and the
regulations and requirements of the base zone shall again be in effect.
Any significant changes (as determined by the Board) in the use of a special
exception or any construction of new facilities or structures, or major
additions to existing facilities or structures (as determined by the Board)
shall be subject to approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals using the same
process as was used for the original approval.
B.    PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL.
Upon receipt of an application for a special exception, the Zoning
Administrator shall refer a copy of the application to the Board of Zoning
Appeals for public hearing and final approval or denial of the petition.

      a.   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the special
exception will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety or
general welfare;
      b.   The special exception will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment
of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood;
      c.   The establishment of the special exception will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district;
      d.   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and other necessary
facilities have been or are being provided; and
      e.   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress or
egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets;
      f.   The Board shall direct the Zoning Administrator to issue an
Improvement Location Permit for such special exception; otherwise, the Board
shall direct the Zoning Administrator to reject the application. The findings
of the Board and its order to the Zoning Administrator shall be in writing.
   2.   The Board may impose additional conditions to assure that the special
exception will conform to the intent of this Ordinance. These additional
conditions may include, but are not limited to, the provision of the following:
      a.   Off-street parking and loading areas, with particular attention to
the economic, noise, glare, or odor effects of the special exception on
adjoining properties and properties generally in the district.
      b.   Refuse and service areas.
      c.   Special screening and buffering with reference to type, dimensions,

site development standards designed for their mutual protection and the
environmental harmony of the district.

for a particular special exception, is set forth in Section
4.
   3.   If the nature of the special exception involves more than one of those
listed, the applicant may apply for an Improvement Location Permit for the
special exception, which most closely relate to the primary use; provided that
the requirements of the related uses will be met.
   4.   Any person, to whom is issued an Improvement Location Permit for a
special exception, who fails to commence construction within twelve (12) months
after such permit is issued, or who fails to carry to completion the total
Development Plan thereof within two (2) years after such construction is begun,
whichever is later, or who fails to conform to the provisions of the
Development Plan and supporting data finally approved by the Board and upon the
basis of which such Improvement Location Permit was issued, may be required by
the Board upon its own motion, and shall be required by the Board upon written
petition of any person deeming himself aggrieved, to show cause why such
approval should not be withdrawn and such Improvement Location Permit revoked.
   5.   The holder of an Improvement Location Permit for a special exception
may apply to the Board at any time for an alteration, change, amendment or
extension of the application or Development Plan upon which such Permit was
based.
      a.   Upon receipt of such application, the Board shall proceed as in the
case of original applications for an Improvement Location Permit for a special
exception.

Development Plan by stages, the applicant may make application for a Temporary
Certificate of Occupancy for any portion of the plan that has been completed.

In order to approve a use variance, the Board must find that:
   1.   The approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety,
morals, and general welfare of the community;
   2.   The use and value of the area adjacent to the property included in the
variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse manner;
   3.   The need for the variance arises from some condition peculiar to the
property involved;
   4.   The strict application of the terms of the zoning ordinance will
constitute an unnecessary hardship if applied to the property for which the
variance is sought; and
   5.   The approval does not interfere substantially with the Comprehensive
Plan.
E.   STANDARDS FOR DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS VARIANCE APPROVAL.
In order to approve an application for a design standards variance, the Board
must find that:
   1.   The approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety,
morals, and general welfare of the community;
   2.   The use and value of the area adjacent to the property included in the

deviation from the standards of the Zoning Ordinance.
F.   CONDITIONAL APPROVAL.
   1.   All variance approvals shall be considered to be conditional approvals.
The Board shall have the authority to impose specific conditions as part of its
approval in order to protect the public health and for reasons of safety,
comfort and convenience (such as to ensure compatibility with surroundings). A
variance approval may be denied or revoked where the applicant fails to comply
with specific conditions made a part of the approval by the Board, or fails to
comply with a reasonable request of the Board or Zoning Administrator for
furnishing specific information related to the proposed variance. Failure to
comply with the conditions of approval shall constitute a violation of the
Zoning Ordinance.
   2.   The variance approval shall be effective for a period of one (1) year
after the date of approval. If the variance approval has not been implemented
on the property within the time period established above, the variance approval
shall be null and void and the Applicant shall be required to resubmit a new
application for variance approval subject to the zoning regulations in effect
at the time of resubmission. Upon the request of the Applicant and upon a
finding that the Applicant has been unable to implement the variance approval
despite due diligence, the Board may extend the approval period for one (1)
year beyond the expiration date of the original approval period, without
further notice and public hearing, or for a longer period of time upon notice
to interested parties and a hearing.

SECTION 4
ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVALS
4.01 DEVELOPMENT PLAN REVIEW.
A.    PURPOSE.
The purpose of the development plan review procedure set forth in this Section
is to regulate the development of structures and sites in a manner which
considers the following concerns and, where necessary, requires modification of
development proposals to eliminate or minimize potential problems and
nuisances. The principal areas of concern are:
   1.   The balancing of landowners' rights to use their land, with the
corresponding rights of abutting and neighboring landowners to live without
undue disturbances (such as noise, smoke, fumes, dust, odor, glare, stormwater
run off, and the like);
   2.   The convenience and safety of vehicular and pedestrian movement within
the site and in relation to adjacent areas or roads;
   3.   The adequacy of water supply, waste disposal methods and protection
from pollution of surface or ground water; and,
   4.   The protection of natural, environmental, historic, or archaeological
features on the site under review and in adjacent areas.
B.   DEVELOPMENT PLAN REVIEW REQUIREMENT.
No permit or certificate for the construction, exterior alteration, relocation,
demolition, occupancy, or change in use of any building, structure or parcel
shall be given and no existing use shall be established or expanded in floor
area except in conformity with a development plan approved by the Zoning
Administrator. Development plan review shall also be required for the
resumption of any use discontinued for more than six (6) consecutive months or
for the expansion of any existing use.
C.    DEVELOPMENT PLAN REVIEW PROCESS.
   1.   Application and Requirement for Development Plan Review.
      a.   An applicant for development plan review under this chapter shall
file with the Zoning Administrator an application for development plan approval
upon forms made available in the Commission's office along with an original and
two (2) copies of the development plan.
      b.   The development plan shall include all of the following elements
that are deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator in order to properly
evaluate the proposed project in accordance with the provisions of this

structure erected in violation of the Ordinance.
   2.   In the event the Zoning Administrator finds that a violation of the

these regulations has occurred, the Zoning Administrator may use the following
administrative remedies:
      a.   Suspend and withhold other approvals, certificates and/or permits
relevant to the development or use of the site on which the violation has
occurred as shown on the approved development plan, including sewage disposal
systems that have not been properly installed or have not become operational.

as necessary to affect any remedial actions required to abate the violation;
and/or
      d.   Revoke the permits, certificates and/or approvals that have been
violated.

for design, dedication, improvement, and restrictive use of the land in order
to conform to the physical and economical development of the Town and for the

In determining the applicability of this Zoning Ordinance with respect to the
previously applicable zoning regulations, the following rules shall apply:
A.   When a use lawfully existing on the effective date of this Zoning
Ordinance was classified as a permitted use prior to the effective date of this
Zoning Ordinance, and such use is classified as a Special Exception by this
Zoning Ordinance, such use shall be deemed a lawful nonconforming use. Such use
may be granted as a Special Exception in the manner prescribed by Section
3 of these regulations or, alternatively, may continue subject to the
nonconforming use provisions of Section
2 of this Ordinance.
B.   When a use lawfully existing as a permitted use on the effective date of
this Zoning Ordinance, or any amendment thereto, no longer classified as a
permitted use in the zoning district in which it is located, such use shall be
deemed a lawful nonconforming use and shall be subject to the nonconforming use
provisions of Section
2 of this Ordinance.
C.   Where any building, structure or lot lawfully existing on the effective
date of this Zoning Ordinance does not meet all development standards set forth
in this Zoning Ordinance, or any amendment thereto, such building, structure,
or lot shall be deemed lawfully nonconforming and shall be subject to the
nonconforming use provisions of Section
2 of this Ordinance.
D.   When, before the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, a complete
application has been filed for an improvement location permit for a building or
structure which conforms to all applicable regulations in effect prior to the
effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, the building or structure may be
completed in accordance with the plans on the basis of which the application
was submitted, subject to the provisions of Section
5 of these regulations. Upon completion, said building or structure may be
occupied for the use which was specified on the improvement location permit
application, provided said use at the time of application was classified as
permitted, or if classified as a special exception, had been approved by the
Board of Zoning Appeals. Provided, also, if the use originally intended no
longer complies with all requirements of this Zoning Ordinance such use shall
be a lawful nonconforming use subject to the nonconforming use provisions of
Section
2 of this Ordinance or, alternatively, as a special use subject to the special
exception provisions of Section
3 of this Ordinance. However, in the event that said application or permit
expires or is suspended or revoked in accordance with Section
7 of this Ordinance, any new permit application that is submitted after the
effective date of this Ordinance shall be subject to the provisions in this
Ordinance.
E.   All variances granted prior to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance
shall remain in full force and effect subject to the conditions of variance
approval. However, such variance shall apply only to the specific variance of
use or development standard granted.
F.   All special exception permits granted prior to the effective date of this
Zoning Ordinance shall remain in full force and effect subject to the
conditions of special exception approval. Expansion or change in use shall
require compliance with this Zoning Ordinance.

on the previous zoning maps shall constitute an approved development plan
subject to the standards and conditions of development plan approval.
Subsequent development plans for the site shall comply with the previous zoning
ordinance provisions concerning development plans or, alternatively, the
developer may choose to comply with the development plan provisions of this
Ordinance, provided that the proposed development plan does not conflict with
the standards and conditions applicable to the approved development plan. A
development plan approved under the previous Ordinance shall constitute an
approved development plan subject to the standards and conditions of
development plan approval. Where an development plan has been approved but has
expired, prior to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, the development
plan shall be void and may not provide a basis for development plan approval.
H.   A preliminary and/or final plat approved prior to the effective date of
this Zoning Ordinance, whether or not yet recorded, shall remain in full force
and effect, subject to the standards and conditions of plat approval. Final
plats may be recorded as approved in accordance with the Subdivision Control
Ordinance. Preliminary plats shall be entitled to final plat approval subject
to the conditions of preliminary plat approval and subject to the Subdivision
Control Ordinance and the Zoning Ordinance provisions that were in effect at
the time of preliminary approval. Lots in such subdivisions shall be
established in their platted size and configuration as lots of record. All
subsequent resubdivision, vacation and/or amendment of such plats shall be made

Control Ordinance and this Zoning Ordinance. A full and complete application
for preliminary plat approval conforming to all applicable regulations in
effect at the time of application shall be entitled to review under the

district which is unable to meet the requirements of this Ordinance as to area

SECTION 1
GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.01 TITLE.
This chapter shall hereafter be referred to as the "Subdivision Control Plan of
New Palestine, Indiana, 2001."
1.02 ESTABLISHMENT OF CONTROL.
No plat or replat of a subdivision of land located within the jurisdiction of
the New Palestine Advisory Plan Commission shall be filed with the Hancock
County Auditor and recorded by the Hancock County Recorder unless it has first
been granted secondary approval by the Commission, and such approval shall have
been signed and certified on the Plat by the President of the Commission.
1.03 DEFINITIONS.
See
Chapter 90, Section
10- Zoning Ordinance.
1.04 POLICY.
The following policies shall guide the interpretation, administration, and
enforcement of the Subdivision Control Ordinances.
A.   The Subdivision of land, the subsequent development of subdivided land and
the public and private facilities and improvements proposed to serve subdivided
land shall be considered subject to the Comprehensive Plan and related policies
(such as those embodied in the Town Zoning Ordinance) and to all relevant Town
implementation programs (such as the Capital Budget, Thoroughfare Plan, and
Zoning Ordinance) for the orderly and efficient development of the Town.
B.   Land shall not be subdivided if doing so would result in unreasonable
peril from flood, fire, or other menace. Land shall not be subdivided until
adequate access to necessary public facilities and improvements is demonstrated
and until provisions have been made for drainage, water, sewerage, and other
necessary public improvements (such as schools, parks, and transportation
facilities) adequate for serving the subdivision.
1.05 PURPOSE
The purpose of these regulations shall be:
A.   To protect and provide for the public health, safety, and general welfare
of the Town.
B.   To guide the future development and renewal of the Town in accordance with
the Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Ordinance and related policies, objectives, and
implementation programs.
C.   To provide for the safety, comfort, and soundness of the built environment
and related open spaces.
D.   To protect the compatibility, character, economic stability, and
orderliness of all development through design standards.
E.   To guide public and private policy and action to ensure that adequate
public and private facilities will be provided in an efficient manner in
conjunction with new development, to promote an aesthetically pleasing and
beneficial interrelationship between land uses, and to promote the conservation
of natural resources both during and after development.
F.   To provide proper land boundary records, such as:
   1.   to provide for the survey, documentation, and permanent monumentation
of land boundaries and property;
   2.   to provide for the identification of property; and
   3.   to provide public access to land boundary records.
The Subdivision Control Ordinances shall be interpreted, administered and
enforced in a manner that is consistent with the foregoing purposes.
SECTION 2
PROCEDURE
2.01 APPROVAL PROCEDURE.
A subdivider desiring approval of a plat of a subdivision of any land lying
within the Town of New Palestine shall submit a written verified application
therefor to the Plan Commission staff. This application shall be accompanied by
the information, requirements and plans set forth below, all in accordance with
the requirements set forth in this chapter.
A.   The application shall show the manner in which the plat of the subdivision
is in compliance with the Comprehensive Plan and its provisions, specifically
with relation to the requirements of the Thoroughfare Plan, school and
recreational sites, shopping centers, community facilities, sanitation, water
supply and drainage, and other developments existing and proposed in the
vicinity. No land shall be subdivided for residential use unless adequate
access to the land over improved streets or thoroughfares exists or will be
provided by the subdivider, or if such land is considered by the Commission to
be unsuitable for such use by reason of flooding or improper drainage,
objectionable earth and rock formation, topography, or any other feature
harmful to the health and safety of possible residents and the community as a
whole.
B.   The application shall be accompanied by a certified check or money order
made payable to the Town of New Palestine, according to the fee schedule, which
can be found in the Plan Commission Rules of Procedures. The Zoning
Administrator shall surrender the check or money order to the Clerk-Treasurer
for deposit in the General Fund of the Town. No part of this filing fee shall
be returnable to the applicant.

B.   If, after the hearing, the Commission disapproves the plat, it shall make
written findings that set forth its reason for its decision denying primary
approval and shall provide the applicant with a copy. This decision shall be
signed by the President of the Commission.
2.04 APPEALS.
The primary approval or disapproval of a plat by the Commission or the
imposition of a condition or primary approval is a final decision of the
Commission that may be reviewed by certiorari procedure as provided by I.C. 36-
7-4-1016.
2.05 SECONDARY APPROVAL.
The Commission may grant secondary approval for all or any part of a plat of a
subdivision which has heretofore been given primary approval for all or any
part of a plat of a subdivision which has heretofore been given primary
approval by the Commission, or the Commission may delegate to the Plan
Commission Staff the authority to grant such secondary approvals; provided,
that secondary approvals may only be granted after expiration of the time for
appeal under I.C. 36-7-4-1016; specifically after 31 days have elapsed from the
date of the decision of the Commission under Section
2.02 herein.
A.   Secondary approval may be granted to a plat of a subdivision in which the
improvements and installations have not been completed as required by this
Code, if the applicant provides a bond or other proof of financial
responsibility as prescribed herein.
   1.   110% of an amount determined by the Plan Commission staff to be
sufficient to complete the improvements and installations in compliance with
this code; and
   2.   Provides surety satisfactory to the Plan Commission attorney.
   Other proof of financial responsibility may take the following form:
   1.   An irrevocable letter of credit; or
   2.   A performance bond; or
   3.   An escrow agreement.
B.   No notice or hearing is required for secondary approvals.
C.   A plat of a subdivision shall not be filed with the Auditor of Hancock
County, and the Recorder of Hancock County shall not record it, unless it has
been granted secondary approval and signed by all required signatories. If
submitted and recorded, the plat shall not be considered a legal subdivision
and building permits for lots within the illegally recorded subdivision will
not be issued.
D.   The proof of financial responsibility referred to in division (A) may be
released only upon receipt of a certificate by a registered professional civil
engineer or a registered land surveyor that all improvements and installations
for the plat of the subdivision required for its approval have been made or
installed in accordance with specification and approved by the Town Engineer or
Town Manager.
E.   Phasing of Subdivisions. The applicant may seek secondary approval of a
portion or section of the primary plat. The Commission may impose such
conditions upon filing of applications for secondary approval of the sections
as it deems necessary to assure the orderly development of the subdivision
(such as sequential lot numbering.). The Commission may require that the
performance bond and financial responsibility be in such amount as will be
commensurate with the section or sections of the plat for which secondary
approval is sought and may defer the remaining required performance bond (or
other assurance) principal amount until the remaining sections of the plat are
offered for filing. Such sections must contain at least twenty (20) lots or ten
percent (10%) of the total number of lots contained in the approved primary
plat, whichever is less. The approval of all remaining sections not filed with
the Zoning Administrator shall automatically expire two (2) years from the date
of preliminary approval, unless the primary approval has been extended.
F.   Cross-reference:
   See Appendices A through E for sample forms for subdivision approval
procedures.
2.06 TIME LIMITS FOR PLAT APPROVALS.
A.   Unless extended, primary plat approval shall be effective for a period of
two (2) years ("primary plat approval period") after the date of primary plat
approval (including conditional approval), at the end of which time secondary
approval of the subdivision must have been obtained by the Applicant and
certified by the proper officials. Any plats not receiving secondary approval
within the period of time set forth herein shall be null and void, and the
Applicant shall be required to resubmit a new application for subdivision
approval subject to the zoning restrictions and subdivision regulations in
effect at the time of resubmission. Upon the request of an Applicant and upon a
finding that the Applicant has been unable to prepare the proposed development
for secondary approval despite due diligence, the Commission may extend the
preliminary approval period for one two (2) year period beyond the expiration
date of the original preliminary approval period, without further notice and
public hearing, or for a longer period of time upon notice to interested
parties and hearing.
B.   Until the secondary plat is recorded, secondary approval shall be
effective for a period of one (1) year ("secondary approval period") after the
date of secondary approval, at the end of which time the secondary plat shall
have been recorded. Any plats not recorded within the period of time set forth
herein shall be null and void, and the Applicant shall be required to resubmit
a new application for subdivision approval subject to the zoning restrictions
and subdivision regulations in effect at the time of resubmission. Upon the
request of an Applicant and upon a finding that the Applicant has been unable
to satisfy the requirements to execute the certificate of secondary approval
despite due diligence, the Commission may extend the secondary approval period
for one (1) year beyond the expiration date of the original secondary approval
period, without further notice and public hearing, or for a longer period of
time upon notice to interested parties and hearing.
2.07 MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
A.   The applicant shall be required to maintain all public improvements on the
individual subdivided lots and provide for snow removal on streets and
sidewalks until acceptance of said public improvements by the Town.
B.   The applicant shall be required to file a maintenance bond with the Town
Council one week prior to acceptance in an amount not to exceed 10% of the cost
of all public improvements and in a form satisfactory to the Town Attorney. The
maintenance bond is provided to assure the satisfactory condition of the
required public improvements for a period of three years after the date of
acceptance by the Town Council.
C.   The applicant shall be required to file a maintenance agreement along with
the above described maintenance bond. This agreement shall be in a form
acceptable to the Town Attorney and approved by the Town Council.
2.08 CONFORMITY REQUIRED.
The plat of the subdivision shall conform to the Town of New Palestine Public
Improvement Design Standards and Specifications Manual as adopted by the Town
Council and all amendments thereto.
2.09 CONFORMITY TO COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.
The subdivision plan shall conform to the principles and standards of the
Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Ordinance as adopted by the Town of New Palestine
and all amendments thereto.
2.10 OWNERS ASSOCIATIONS.
Owner's associations are required for all subdivisions. The owner's association
shall be established prior to the approval of the secondary plat. The
petitioner shall submit one copy of each of the following documents at least
one week prior to secondary plat approval:
   1.   Owner's association Articles of Incorporation,
   2.   Owner's association Bylaws,
   3.   Owner's association Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions.
The above listed documents shall be recorded in the Office of the County
Recorder prior to secondary plat approval.
The Commission may waive the requirement for the establishment of an owner's
association upon finding that:
   1.   There are no areas of common ownership within the subdivision;
   2.   There are no privately-maintained facilities or where there are
privately-maintained facilities, financial commitments other than an owner's
association have been established to provide maintenance in perpetuity.

purpose and intent of the Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning Ordinance, the
Official Zoning Map of the Town, or the Subdivision Control Ordinance;

safety, health, or welfare and would not adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (such as water, sewer, fire protection, and the like);
   4.   Granting the modifications would neither substantially alter the
essential character of the neighborhood nor result in substantial injury to
other nearby properties;
   5.   The conditions of the parcel that give rise to the practical
difficulties are unique to the parcel and are not applicable generally to other
nearby properties;

INTRODUCTION
Communities are constantly interacting with and responding to changing factors
that relate to quality of life at the local level. Sometimes these changing
factors are focused around local shifts, while others are derived from regional
and national trends. Population demographics will shift, the economy will
respond to new markets, technologies will improve, and preferences will change
for services and housing. These changes will inevitably influence current and
proposed uses of land, capital, and property. As we look into the future, we
can choose to merely react to change or anticipate and direct the changes that
occur. When engaging in a comprehensive planning process, the community is both
responding to changes that have occurred and planning for change that the
community would like to occur in the future.
PURPOSE
The primary purpose of a comprehensive development plan is to articulate the
broader vision and establish guiding principles and policies for future growth
and development of an entire community. Indiana Code states that "it should
promote the public health, safety, morals, convenience, order or the general
welfare and for the sake of efficiency and economic in the process of
development." It does not focus on the needs and desires of one property owner,
business or neighborhood. Comprehensive development plans are intended to be
broad in nature.
This provides community leaders with the flexibility to implement the
community-wide vision, goals and objectives while responding to changing
community conditions that are likely to occur over the life of the plan.
STANDARDS
The State of Indiana has developed specific requirements and minimum content
for a comprehensive development plan (I.C. 36-7-4-500 et seq.). The elements of
a comprehensive development plan, at a minimum, should include:
      •   A statement of objectives for future development of the jurisdiction;
      •   A statement of policy for the land use development of the
jurisdiction;
      •   A statement of policy for the development of public ways, public
spaces, public lands, public structures, and public utilities.
A comprehensive development plan may also include a multitude of additional
topics, community issues and strategies, such as surveys/studies of current
conditions, maps/graphics, reports, and recommendations.
This comprehensive development plan was based on community input, existing land
uses, development trends, suitability of land uses, economic feasibility,
natural land features, and the requirements of I.C. 36-7, as amended, which
empowers cities and towns to plan:
      •   That highway systems and street systems be carefully planned
      •   That new communities grow only with adequate public way, utility,
health, educational, and recreational facilities
      •   That the needs of agriculture, industry, and business be recognized
in future growth
      •   That residential areas provide healthful surroundings for family life
      •   That the growth of the community is commensurate with and promotive
of the efficient and economical use of public funds" (IC 36-7-4-201)
The comprehensive development plan does, at a minimum, under Indiana planning
law (IC 36-7-4-502) include:
      •   A summary of goals and objectives for the future development of the
Town of New Palestine;
      •   A summary of policy for development keyed to these goals and
objectives for community facilities and the public/private infrastructure; and
      •   The land use goals and objectives illustrated on the Future Land Use
Plan map in order to better understand the spatial representation and
interactions.
As a rule, a comprehensive development plan should be revisited every year to
check the progress of goals and objectives that have been developed. Every five
years a comprehensive development plan should be updated for informational
content and to review the goals and objectives that were developed. The idea is
to check that the objectives are being met and to then add new objectives and
remove completed ones from the Action Plan.
Overall, this 2016 comprehensive development plan update will help guide the
Town of New Palestine begin a new era and control the impact of pending urban
sprawl. The town wants to retain the conveniences of a modern society, while at
the same time retaining the values of the smaller rural community it once was.
THE PLANNING PROCESS
The New Palestine Comprehensive Development Plan was initiated by the Town of
New Palestine Town Council with the intent of serving as the community's guide
for future development over the next 20 years.
Throughout the development of the plan there were many opportunities for the
public to provide feedback through public meetings, an advisory committee, key
person interviews and adoption hearings. The information and ideas gathered
from these public input opportunities were used to establish recommendations
and concepts included in this plan.
LOCATION
Like many communities throughout Indiana, the Town of New Palestine has always
been a small community where all the people know one another by name. It has
been a rural way of life, not impacted by urban uses. The values are those of a
rural community - neighborliness, the opportunity to walk to various community
facilities, and tree-lined streets.
Regional Setting
New Palestine is located in Hancock County in the central part of Indiana. It
lies due east of Indianapolis/Marion County and one of the "donut" counties of
the Indianapolis MSA.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1887.jpg]
 
New Palestine's location in central Indiana provides residential, commercial
and industrial opportunities because of its regional setting. It is situated
within the American Manufacturing and the Great Lakes Economic Regions. It is
also recognized as being part of the American Corn Belt Region, a significant
agricultural area in the United States. However, agriculture is rapidly
declining within the planning area due to urban encroachment.
Politically, the regional setting includes representation on a national level
within the 6th U.S. Congressional House District currently represented by
Congressman Luke Messer. On the State level, the planning area is represented
by State Senator Michael Crider (District 28) and by State Representative
Robert Cherry (District 53). The Hancock County Commissioner representing the
residents in New Palestine is Brad Armstrong.
STUDY AREA
Town of New Palestine
The town of New Palestine is located in Sugar Creek Township in southern
Hancock County, approximately sixteen miles from downtown Indianapolis. New
Palestine has a land area of approximately 704 acres and has a (2010 US Census)
population of 2,055 residents.
The primary study area consists of land within the town limits. During this
study, areas outside of the town limits (mainly Sugar Creek Township) were also
considered in the planning of land use, transportation issues and overall
growth and development issues.
PAST PLANNING
The initial New Palestine comprehensive plan was completed in 1976. Since that
plan was completed, Indiana law regarding the content of comprehensive plans
changed and it no longer meeting the needs of the community. So, in 1999, the
Town updated the '76 plan. This updating was necessary since the Town had lost
its extra-territorial jurisdiction when Hancock County created an Area Plan
Commission.
Area growth has prompted many area communities to revise or update their plans
in recent years. Hancock County adopted a new plan in 2012 and the City of
Greenfield in 2015. This surrounding planning activity set the stage for the
New Palestine planning effort.
PLAN ORGANIZATION
The New Palestine Comprehensive Development Plan is one document with many
distinct sections. While these sections cover different aspects of the
community, they all are related.
This document will contain written text, maps, illustrations, tables, and
whatever else is needed to clearly describe the community and its conditions
and goals. The plan should be easy to read and easy to update so that local
employees, officials, and citizens can all use it comfortably.
The first part of the plan is the Introduction, which explains the Why's and
How's of this Plan. It shows the planning area and period; the purpose for
planning; previous planning efforts; how the plan was developed and the context
of the plan; and how to use the plan.
The Public Input section of the plan will discuss the public participation
process. Public participation is what drives the Plan and where all of the
Goals and Objectives are formulated. This section describes what methods were
used to obtain information and how the community's strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats should be described and evaluated.
The Community Profile section describes the historical aspects of the Town as
well as the physical characteristics and the Town's demographic statistics.
Next are a number of different areas that need to be addressed. This is where
the plan becomes comprehensive. Population and demography, land use, traffic
circulation and transportation, parks and open space (natural resources),
housing, utilities and services, community facilities, economic development,
historical preservation, and other elements are all areas that may be covered
in the plan. The goals and objectives for the overall plan, as well as for each
of these specific areas of study, will be included at the end of each of these
sections.
Section 4: Community Environment
This chapter depicts the quality of life issues of the community and the
community facilities. It looks at such items as population statistics, social
characteristics and the existing community facilities.
Section 5: Economic Environment
This chapter looks at the economic statistics and the commercial, industrial
and downtown issues of the community.
Section 6: Land Use
This chapter looks at the existing land use conditions and provides a written
summary of the Future Land Use Plan, as well as providing the maps for the
plan.
Section 7: Transportation
This chapter provides a written summary of the Transportation Plan.
Section 8: Action Plan
The last chapter contains the implementation focus, Action Plans and
conclusions which are essential to keeping the Comprehensive Development Plan
current and up-to-date by responding to changing trends and socioeconomic
conditions.
How to Use This Document
The New Palestine Comprehensive Development Plan can serve as a valuable public
management tool if used on a regular basis. This Plan can best be described as
a community guidebook. It will help guide the Plan Commission in its decision
making process. However, it addresses many other community issues as well. When
reviewing development plans, making budgets or setting priorities, this
document should be used to help make decisions. Because of its emphasis on
public participation this Plan gives city leaders knowledge of what the
community wants and needs.
PLANNING PERIOD
Even though the planning process is a continuing responsibility of the Plan
Commission and the Town Council, it is necessary to identify the planning
period which this Plan covers. Traditionally, the planning period is divided
into both a short- and a long-range planning period. For the purposes of this
Plan update, the short-range planning period would be the five-year period from
2016 through 2020. The long-range period would extend the time an additional
fifteen years into the future to 2035.
It should be emphasized that this Comprehensive Development Plan, in addition
to other ordinances designed to implement the Plan, should be reviewed annually
and revised as needed after five years.
FRAMEWORK
The framework of the plan serves as a foundation of the planning process which
is used in creating this plan - guided by four key questions. The questions are
as follows:
   "Planning for what?"
   "Where are we now?"
   "Where are we going?"
   "Where would we like to go?"
   "How do we get there?"
PUBLIC INPUT
Listening to the voices of engaged, knowledgeable residents and business owners
is an important part of any planning process. Citizen participation is a
process that gives private individuals an opportunity to influence public
decisions. It has long been a component of the democratic decision process. The
concept of citizens participating in government decision-making is fundamental
to the functioning of a democratic system of governance.
In preparing the New Palestine Comprehensive Development Plan, public input
initiatives were established early on in the process to ensure the issues
addressed by the Plan would be influenced by the citizens of the community as
much as possible. While in general, public participation is an ongoing process,
an initial round of public input procedures was conducted to establish an
understanding of how citizens feel and think about their community.
MEETINGS
Steering Committee
The Town of New Palestine was asked to provide a list of community volunteers
that would take the responsibility to form the Steering Committee. This
included not only residents of the community, but many stakeholders who
participate in community life who reside outside the community. The following
individuals participated on the Steering Committee:
   •   David Book, Town Manager
   •   Jim Robinson, Plan Commission
   •   Don Ginder, Plan Commission
   •   Vonda Vawter, BZA
   •   Adam Axthelm, BZA
   •   Becky Gaines, Main Street Organization
   •   Joe Franklin, Economic Development Commission
   •   Bob Yoder, Redevelopment Commission
   •   John Begovich, Sugar Creek Township VFD
   •   Rick Edwards, Hancock Regional Hospital
   •   Gary Halliburton, Business member
   •   Rob Walker, Business member
   •   Kim Sams, Business member
   •   Debbie Hildebrandt, Citizen member
   •   Crystal Corwin-Howard, Citizen member
   •   Pete Howard, Citizen member
   •   Danielle Daugherty, Citizen member
   •   Kim Diller, Citizen member
   •   Dave Parrish, Citizen member
The initial planning meeting was held on December 21, 2015 at the Community
Room at the New Palestine Town Hall and those attending were introduced to the
planning process, review of the timeline and the duties of being on the
Steering Committee. The 2000 Comprehensive Plan was discussed and the steering
committee was introduced to the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and
Threats (SWOT) exercise. (Agendas and sign-in sheets for all meetings are shown
in Appendix A.)
At the second meeting on January 11, 2016, the Steering Committee met and
continued the SWOT exercise to identify the positive and negative issues
related to the community and to review the citizen survey that would be
available on the Town's website via SurveyMonkey. They were then briefed on the
upcoming first Public Meeting to be held on February 9th.
The third Steering Committee meeting was held on February 29th. The first item
was the review of the citizen survey results (these can be found in Appendix
B). Then a review of the SWOT exercise from the Public Meeting was discussed.
The initial point of this meeting was to then begin the development the Goals
and Objectives for the plan.
The fourth meeting of the Steering Committee was held on March 21st. At this
meeting, the group finished the review of the SWOT issues and the results of
the citizen survey. They then began the formulation of the Goals and Objectives
by reviewing the previous goals and objectives from the 2000 Comprehensive
Plan. New goals and objectives were then established and added to the remaining
unfinished items from the 2000 plan.
The fifth Steering Committee Meeting was held on April 19th to review the final
Action Plan. The steering committee then discussed future land use in both the
town limits as well as the area surrounding New Palestine.
Public
The first of two Public Meetings was held at the New Palestine Town Hall
Community Room on February 9, 2016 at 6:30 P.M. The meeting was advertised in
the New Palestine Press and announcements were posted at various locations
throughout the town. Approximately ten people were in attendance. Introductions
were made and then an overview of what a Community Development Plan consisted
of and why the Town of New Palestine was updating their 2000 Comprehensive
Plan. The public then participated in an exercise which identified the
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT's) related to the
community. The results were much the same as when the Steering Committee
performed the SWOT exercise.
The second Public Hearing was held on July 18, 2016 at 6:00 p.m. The meeting
was advertised in the New Palestine Press and announcements were posted at
various locations throughout the town. Approximately twelve people were in
attendance. Introductions were made and then an overview of the draft Community
Development Plan was given. The Goals and Objectives were reviewed and
discussed and comments were taken.
CITIZEN SURVEY
In order to more fully determine the thoughts and desires of the community, a
citizen survey was taken during the first two weeks of February 2016. It was
primarily targeted to the residents of the Town of New Palestine in order to
help determine the major needs and identify issues which are important for the
growth and development of the town. A survey was prepared using SurveyMonkey
and was available to the public via the Town's website. Hard copies were also
available at the Town Hall and the Hancock County Library branch in New
Palestine. Public participation was garnered by newspaper advertising, social
media outreach and word of mouth. In all, 420 surveys were completed. Typically
a survey return of about five to ten percent is desired. The return rate for
the citizen survey was 20.8%.
The citizen survey was in three sections. The first section asked about basic
demographic information. The second section asked questions relevant to the
community character (quality of life issues) and to community services. The
third section was more open ended and asked what respondents felt about the
future of their community, their likes, dislikes, wants and needs.
Demographics
Who responded...
The demographic information showed that out of the survey responses, female
responders (67.5%) outnumbered the male responders (32.5%). By age group, there
were two groups with the largest response rates, those between the ages of 35
to 44 (30.4%) and those 45 to 54 (26.3%) followed by those groups in the 55 to
64 (17.2%), and 25 to 34 (15.1%).
The survey wanted to reach not only the residents within town limits, but also
to those in the outlying areas of Sugar Creek and Brandywine townships since
that population uses the facilities and resources of New Palestine. When asked
"Where do you live?", 32.8% lived within the town limits, 49.1% lived in Sugar
Creek township and 5.6% lived in Brandywine township.
Why they live here...
When asked "What the important reasons were for living in New Palestine?",
respondents were asked to mark as many as they thought. The top three answers
were; 'Quality of schools' (78.6%), 'Low crime rate' (71.9%), and 'Open spaces/
Rural feel' (66.5%). 'Uncongested area' (58.4%) and 'Native to area/Family
ties' (48.3%) were two other categories with a high response level.
When asked "How long have you been a resident of New Palestine or the area?",
the majority responded 10+ years. The largest groups were those who have lived
20+ years (39.2%), followed closely by those who have lived 11 to 20 years
(27.7%). When asked "if they expected to be living in New Palestine 5 years
from now", the vast majority (86.3%) said they would, only 9.3% of the
respondents weren't sure and only 4.4% said no they would not.
Where they work...
When asked the question "Where do you work?", the highest response were those
who worked 11 to 25 miles (30.9%). If you add those who work 2-10 miles (13.3%)
and 25+ miles outside (8%) to the 11 to 25 mile group you get 52.8% of the
people working outside of the community. The second highest response rate were
those who worked in or within 2 miles of New Palestine (27.1%). The next
highest group of respondents were those who were either retired, worked at home
or were students at 20%.
2010 Census info...
The population of New Palestine is 2,055 and Sugar Creek township has a
population of 14,920 (second only to Center township/Greenfield). This makes
New Palestine 13.8% of the total Sugar Creek population. The median age of
persons living in New Palestine is 37.2 years as compared to Hancock County at
39.1 and Indiana at 37.
The median household income is $65,875, higher than both the County median of
$61,052 and the State median of $47,697. The major occupation is that of
management and professional services (43.6%) followed by those in the office
and sales fields (29.1%). The current (2015) unemployment rate (Hancock County)
is 3.9%.
The highest levels of education attained were those with a secondary education
(93.7%) followed by those with a college degree (27.3%).
Quality of Life/Community Services/Growth
In these sections, respondents were asked various questions about how they
perceived their community. They were asked to answer the questions on a scale
of Agree, Somewhat Agree, Not Sure, Somewhat Disagree, Disagree. Some questions
were open ended and respondents were allowed to choose multiple answers or
write in their own opinions.
The following sections of this plan will address the results according to
subject and a summary of all results are shown in Appendix B.
SWOT ANALYSIS
SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats, and offers a
structured process for a community to explore their current situation. The
process helps a community gather information from a small, but representative,
group of local residents and leaders. They are then asked for their community
perceptions, in four separate areas. The first two areas are internal: the
strengths and weaknesses from within the community. The second two categories
are external: the opportunities and threats from outside the community. For
example, an external threat may be the national economy, or decreased federal
funding that affects local schools. When all the factors are combined, the
community can then begin to form a clearer picture of the community's
situation.
Steering Committee
The Steering Committee over a period of two meetings participated in a SWOT
exercise. The steering committee members were given an overview of how SWOT
works and then were asked to fill out a SWOT worksheet individually. The
exercise was to cover five separate areas of issue: Quality of Life, Community
Services, Economic Development, Land Use, and Transportation. The steering
committee then discussed their opinions and worked to develop the top issues in
each category. These would then be used to formulate the goals and objectives
for the Action Plan.
Public Meeting
A shorter version of the SWOT exercise was presented during the public meeting
where the attendees were asked about their views in each of the same five
categories. These would be combined with the results from the steering
committees and used to help derive the goals and objectives.
COMMUNITY PROFILE
In recent years, urban sprawl is beginning to encroach upon parts of Hancock
County. As recent as the 2010 census data, Hancock County was the 3rd fastest
growing county in the Indianapolis metro area just behind Hamilton and
Hendricks counties. In the past decade alone, the western part of Hancock
County has seen dramatic growth in the towns of McCordsville (4,797; +323.0%),
Fortville (3,929; +14.1%) and Greenfield (20,602; +41.1%). Only the town of
Cumberland (5,169; -6.0%), showed a negative growth.
The Town of New Palestine (2,055; +62.6%), which has seen the second highest
growth rate the county, is beginning to feel the impending pressure from
developers. This is not only the story of New Palestine, but also of many other
communities located across the nation which are in fairly close proximity to a
large growing urban area.
HISTORY
Background
Hancock County, named after John Hancock, first signer of the Declaration of
Independence, was separated from Madison County and organized in 1828.
The 1828 county organization resulted in three townships—Blue River,
Brandywine, and Sugar Creek. New townships were created until 1850 when the
county was divided into thirteen parts. In 1853 the county commissioners
reduced the number of townships to the present nine.
Low, wet land areas slowed the growth of some parts of Hancock County until the
use of tile ditching became widespread after the Civil War. This wet topography
probably accounted for the relatively small Indian population. The Delaware had
villages in Brandywine and Sugar Creek Townships.
Since Hancock County lacked travel routes by navigable waterways, traces and
early roads were important to settlers. Blue River is the largest stream, but
it only passes through the southeastern corner of the county. It was used not
only as a route for early settlement, but also as power for small mills. Sugar
Creek, Brandywine Creek, Buck Creek, and other small streams also had mills.
Among the early roads were Napoleon's Trace and the old State Road which wound
through the central section of the county. The Brookville Road (now U.S. 52),
the National Road (now U.S. 40), and various pikes were even more influential
on population growth and economic development.
Population increased tremendously following World War II as the automobile
allowed easier access to jobs in Indianapolis and Anderson for commuters who
enjoyed the rural, suburban setting of Hancock County. This has led to the
establishment of New Palestine as a "bedroom community" today.
Founding Father
Jonathon Evans, known as the founder of New Palestine, accumulated several
acres of land and established a general store. A Delaware Indian village had
been located nearby, and several cabins, inns, and businesses preceded the town
survey.
Beginning in 1828 German immigrants settled in the area around what was to
become New Palestine and developed prosperous farms and businesses. A new
school, some churches, and several commercial buildings reflected the influence
of these new citizens.
Jonathan Evans platted New Palestine in October of 1838 on the old Brookville
Road which is now. U.S. 52. The original plat contained 15 blocks and 36 lots.
He later bought 240 acres from the heirs of Amos Dickerson which became the
Evans 2nd Addition to the Town on the west side of Bittner Street. The
Junction, or better known as the Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Dayton Railroad was
completed in 1869 and formed the northern border of the town. The town was
incorporated on May 22, 1871 with a population of 279.

Mr. Evans opened a small his general store in 1838. The small primitive
department store consisted of everything from dry goods to livestock. The post
office occupied one corner of the store and was attended by Mr. Evans younger
sons. It was located at the southeast corner of Main and Bittner Street where
the original building still stands (oldest in the town), most recently known as
Bonnie Scott's cafe.

A quiet town for the most part, New Palestine has not gone without its share of
excitement. The Temperance movement was strong in the area, and a saloon and a
poolroom were blown up in 1881 and 1882. The town hall was destroyed in an
accidental gas explosion in 1906 and in which many records of the past were
lost forever.
New Palestine has grown rapidly in recent years and Sugar Creek Township, of
which New Palestine is the largest town, is the fastest growing area in Hancock
County.

HISTORIC STRUCTURES
Interim Report
In 1983 a grant for this survey and Interim Report was provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, Division of Historic Preservation and
Archaeology, using grant monies for planning and surveys from the U.S.
Department of the Interior, National Park Service. Matching funds were provided
by Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana. Hancock County was one of five
counties selected jointly by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology, and Historic Landmarks
Foundation of Indiana.
A comprehensive field survey was begun in June of 1981 under the local
sponsorship of Greenfield Historic Landmarks, Inc. Architectural and historical
field documentation was compiled by Alan Conant, Liese A. Hilgeman, Mark A.
Miles, Sheryl D. Roberson, and Deirdre Spencer. Mary Lou Poe served as
Historical Consultant. Samuel A. Roberson & Associates compiled the data and
prepared the material for this publication. As a result of the survey, a total
of 1023 sites and structures were entered into the final inventory. Of this
total, 64 entries were grouped into three multiple resource areas; 585 entries
were listed in three historic districts; and the remaining 374 were listed
under nine county townships and two scattered site areas. From this field data
the Hancock County Interim Report was compiled for publication.
The inventory for New Palestine is listed below along with a map showing the

DEMOGRAPHICS
Population
The population of New Palestine remained fairly steady from 1910 up to 2000.
Shown below is the historic population from 1900 to 2010.

Since the earliest population count in 1910 of 450, the highest population that
the Town of New Palestine has witnessed was 863 in the 1970's. In the 1990's
all of that changed and the Town saw an 88.4% increase that put the Town's
population over the 1,000 mark for the first time for the 2000 census. The
following decade showed another large increase in population by 62.6% to reach
its highest population to date of 2,055 in 2010.
By contrast, Hancock County has seen an increase in population since the
1940's. The highest increase Hancock County has seen was in the 2000's at an
increase of 26.4%. Hancock County's increase has been mostly attributed to the
suburban sprawl and growth of towns on the west side of the county just across
the border from Indianapolis. For instance, the Town of McCordsville, which
lies north of New Palestine, saw its population increase from 1,134 in 2000 to
4,797 by 2010, an increase of over 300%! The towns of Fortville and Cumberland
have also increased dramatically in population.
Sugar Creek township in which New Palestine is located is the second most
populous in Hancock County at 14,920. It trails only Center township (location
of the county seat) at 25,819.
By contrast, the State of Indiana from 1950 to 2010 had an average increase of
only 15.5%. The Town of New Palestine was much greater than the statewide
increase at over 300% from 1950 to 2010!
Population by Gender
Shown below is the population in the Town of New Palestine by gender. There is
a higher percentage of women in New Palestine which is comparable to the State
of Indiana and the U.S.

Population by Age
Shown below is the breakdown by age group for the Town of New Palestine. As can
be seen by comparing it to the percentage for Indiana and Hancock County, as a
whole, the Town of New Palestine has a much lower percentage of pre-school age
persons and a much higher percentage of senior age persons. It also has a
higher percentage of school age persons, but a lower percentage of adults of
working age. The median age of persons living in New Palestine is 37.2 years as
compared to Hancock County at 39.1 and Indiana at 37.

Population Projection
In order to plan for future land use in the Town of New Palestine, it was
necessary to determine the population projection for the planning period.
It is not enough to only examine the current population's needs and conditions.
To be effective, decisions made today must consider changes that will take
place in the future. Changes in population have an effect not only on the level
of community services and facilities that must be provided but also on the type
and amount of private investment that occurs in a community. All projections
are based on a variety of assumptions. For that reason, ranges of projections
are often developed to give higher and lower estimates based on different
scenarios. Having knowledge of the community can help to decide which
projection is most likely, but it is important to keep in mind that no
projection is foolproof. In particular, one should note that the longer the
time interval of the projection and the smaller the geographic area under
consideration, the greater is the chance for inaccuracy.
The last two decades have shown large percent changes in the population of New
Palestine. From the 1990's to 2000, there was an 88.4% increase and 2000 to
2010 showed an increase of 62.6%. This increase in population can be correlated
to several factors, but housing units built and any annexations during this
time period are two very real factors for population increases in any
community. In 2015, the State laws concerning annexation changed making it
extremely difficult for communities to annex areas into their corporate limits.
Voluntary annexations of undeveloped land will be the main source of any type
of growth for many communities. There are several large subdivisions outside
the limits of New Palestine. These subdivisions are mostly on septic systems or
tied to other sewer systems. The likelihood of the Town annexing these areas of
population is very slim.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Topography and Soils
Topography
The Planning Area has a topography that is somewhat flat with drops only
surrounding the areas around the Sugar Creek. The map shown below shows the
topographical map of New Palestine and outlying areas.

Soils
The soils in the area are predominantly of the Crosby (39%) and Brookston (30%)
silty loams. Both of these soil types have poor drainage capabilities. We have
included a general soil map of the New Palestine area.

formed in the presenc e of water), and water at or near the grou nd surfa ce
long enou gh in the growing seaso n to supp ort hydr ophytic veget ation. Wetl
ands are consi dered the single most productive type of wildlife habitat in the
United States.
Several types of NWI wetlands are found in the Planning Area. Wetlands in the
area consist of seasonally, temporarily and semi permanently flooded areas. In
the map below, we show the wetland identified in the National Wetlands
Inventory within the Planning Area.

Hydrogeological Characteristics
Outstanding State Resources Waters, Exceptional Use Streams and Natural and
Scenic Rivers
There are no outstanding state resources waters, limited use streams,
exceptional use streams, or natural and scenic rivers in New Palestine.
Floodways
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) completes comprehensive flood
studies for the Planning Area. These studies use standard hydrologic and
hydraulic computer models to find out the potential flooding from each riverine
flooding source.
FEMA defines a "floodway" and a "floodway fringe" within their modeling and
flood management system. A floodway is the channel of a stream and adjacent
floodplain area that must be kept free of encroachment to carry the 100-year
flood without substantial increases (> 0.1 ft.) in flood height. The floodway
fringe is the area between the floodway and the natural 100-year floodplain
boundary. The floodway fringe could be completely obstructed without increasing
the water surface elevation of the 100-year flood.
In the Planning Area, there are several Flood Hazard Areas as determined by the
FEMA FIRM maps.

COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENT
Quality of Life is an examination of influences upon the goodness and meaning
in life, as well as people's happiness and well-being. From our perspective,
the ultimate goal of quality of life is to enable people to live quality lives
-- lives that are both meaningful and enjoyed.
Quality of life can have a different meaning to different people. The quality
of life issues we looked at included issues affecting the social as well as the
physical nature of the community, i.e. seniors, youth, community image,
volunteerism.
Community services are very important to help a community serve its citizens
providing health and safety as well as providing for a higher quality of
living. Having adequate community facilities is also important to a community
for economic reasons as well. An overview of facilities and services can be
found in this chapter.
COMMUNITY SERVICES
Schools
New Palestine is served by the Community School Corporation of Southern Hancock
County. There is one high school (New Palestine); one middle school (Doe
Creek); and three elementary schools (Brandywine, New Palestine, Sugar Creek).
The school corporation has one other school building (former middle school)
that can be used for future expansion.

Engine/Tender, 1 Heavy Rescue, 1 Technical Rescue, 1 Grass Truck, 3 ALS
Ambulances, 7 staff/utility vehicles, 1 ATV/EMS Cart, 1 Fire Safety Training
Trailer, and 1 utility trailer).
A total of 50 personnel - 31 full-time sworn personnel (27 on 24/48 staffing
and 4 daytime administrative positions) and 19 volunteer/paid-on-call
personnel, responding to fire, emergency medical, technical rescue, hazardous

COMMUNITY CHARACTER
Terms like rural, neighborhood, village and urban character are used to
community character, but some are unsure of what people mean by character. What
do people mean by character?
The Webster Dictionary defines it as "a distinctive trait, quality or
attribute," something's "essential quality or nature," and "reputation." But,
what attributes produce the essential quality of a place? According to Roland
Warren, various criteria, "thought to characterize communities include a
specific population living within a specific geographic area, amongst whom
there are present shared institutions and values and significant social
interaction." The emphasis is on people, their institutions and their
interrelationships.

The Lion's Club sponsors the annual Fall Festival which includes a fish fry,
booths, games, music and a parade.
QUALITY OF LIFE POLICY
Goal:
Maintain a vibrant community for all citizens so they will work towards much
higher levels of economic productivity, educational and cultural attainment,
and quality of life so as to encourage greater civic pride.
Objectives:
   •   Reinvent the historic Main Street corridor as a focal point of the
community.
   •   Protect existing historic structures.
   •   Enhance gateway points into the community.
   •   Review current Town ordinances and update if necessary and determine the
need for new ordinances.
   •   Enhance communication/cooperation between major community groups
providing communication portal for services and events.
   •   Enhance leadership/volunteerism in community.
   •   Preserve the small town character of the Town.
   •   Maintain and improve on current community events.
   •   Foster community activities for youth and senior populations.
   •   Encourage recreational activities promoting health and well being.
PUBLIC WORKS
Communities cannot grow or at best even function without quality infrastructure
often known as public works. The operation of municipal public works is crucial
to a community's health and safety as well as the continuing improvement in the
quality of life. Such things as water systems, sanitation or waste water
treatment facilities, snow removal, etc. - all are within the domain of public
works and all essential to the well-being of our communities. These
infrastructure assets are at their best when they are operated, monitored,
maintained, and improved by public works professionals. Public works
departments play an important role in the management of these assets and
thereby extend their benefit to the public and prolong their useful life.
Sewer
The Town operates a 0.230 million gallon per day (MGD) Class II extended
aeration activated sludge treatment facility that was installed in the 1970's
and the last upgrade to the WWTP was made in 2003. The Town's wastewater
collection system consists of 100% separated sewers by design with no overflow
or bypass points. Most sewers are constructed of VCP that were installed in the
early 1970's. There are over 10 miles of sewers ranging in size from 8 to 12
inches in diameter. The wastewater collection system contains eight (8) lift
stations that assist in transporting flows to and through the treatment plant.

Currently New Palestine is extending wastewater collection west of County Road
600 W. This extension provides an avenue to extend services even farther west.
The Town currently has an SRF project planned with a recent PER submittal. This
project is intended to provide an efficiency increase within the collection
system while making process improvements at the wastewater treatment plant.
Stormwater
Like many towns in Indiana, stormwater systems are often an afterthought and a
combination of different methods and constructed systems. The current system in
New Palestine is controlled through a network of undersized pipes, catch basins
and inlets; overland flow; detention ponds and wetland areas. It has been
identified that there are no environmentally sensitive areas or areas where
public safety is an issue.
The Town's Stormwater Quality Plan was initiated in 2005 and recently updated
in 2015. This Plan identifies the future needs for stormwater control and water
quality improvements.
The Town of New Palestine is currently in the midst of establishing a Storm
Water Utility. It is anticipated that formation along with rate establishment
will be completed within the next month. While no specific projects have been
anticipated, the revenue generated will offset some of the ongoing costs which
have been absorbed by the wastewater utility.

different mediums. There are five major providers for residential service;
Xfinity (cable), AT&T and On-Ramp Indiana (DSL), NineStar and Lightbound
(fiber). Business service is provided by; Comcast Business (cable), AT&T and
On-Ramp Indiana (DSL/fiber), NineStar (fiber). There are seven other providers
through mobile or satellite.
COMMUNITY SERVICES POLICY
Goal:
To improve and maintain the infrastructure and services in a way that enhances
community pride, provides a tool for managing growth, and ensures the well
being of the community.
Objectives:
   •   Continue collaboration with the school corporation to capitalize upon
the educational resources within New Palestine.
   •   Identify the need for future community utility upgrades and ensure the
maintenance of existing facilities.
   •   Develop system of trails/paths for walking/bicycling.
   •   Encourage the development of a 24 hour health care clinic.
   •   Establish representation/communication with the Sugar Creek Twp Park
Board.
   •   Continue to expand community policing and its presence in the community.
   •   Continue to work with the Sugar Creek Twp. Fire Department to ensure
future infrastructure and staffing funding.
ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
Economic development is necessary for a community to renew itself and grow.
Many small cities, towns and rural communities are losing people, jobs, and
quality of life due to economic instability. Unfortunately, small towns are not
self-sustaining, and it is no easy task to maintain economic quality, good
jobs, good public services, and a broad tax base.
There are disturbing trends in America making overcoming economic weakness
harder and harder:
   1.   The formulation of large discount trade stores has created a steep
decline in retail trade in small communities.
   2.   A new global economy has brought greater international competition for
low-wage industries and many have moved their operations abroad, resulting in
loss of an economic base in small town America.
   3.   The reduction of economic development grants by the federal government
is resulting in communities having to foot more of the bill for their economic
development efforts.
   4.   Small community banks are a critical source of financing for local
residents by filtering savings into local businesses and by purchasing locally
issued municipal bonds.
These trends result in small downtowns across America realizing the need of
taking inventory of their economic assets and setting economic goals and
objectives by creating an economic development plan as a part of their
communities comprehensive development plan.
The economic setting is concerned with employment statistics and the general
economic development of New Palestine. These elements relate to the residents
of the planning area, how they earn a living and their living standards.

CURRENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
In the past few years, the U.S. economy as well as the world economy has been
recovering from a recession which the likes have not been seen since the Great
Depression of the 1930's. Unemployment rates at the height of this recession
were 9.5% in Hancock County and 10.6 in Indiana. The US economy has since
recovered and the unemployment rate in Hancock County for 2015 was only 3.9%
and the State was 4.5%.
The majority of the workforce in New Palestine since the 1990's has been
primarily in the management, professional industries. This is reflected in the
higher rate of household income which is higher than that of Hancock County and
the State.
New Palestine is a true "bedroom community". Over 65% of the workforce goes to
employment outside of Hancock County, the majority working in Indianapolis/
Marion County. Travel time from New Palestine to downtown Indianapolis is a
mere 20-30 minutes.
New Palestine's visibility along State Route 52 through the heart of the Town
and an active railroad running east/west makes it attractive to commercial
businesses. It is also only approximately 8 miles east of an I-465 interchange.
It has the added advantage of being located approximately half way between
Interstates I-70 and I-74.
New Palestine has had a Chamber of Commerce since the 1990's. Their Chamber not
only serves the Town, but also includes businesses in the Sugar Creek township
area.
Commercial Use Overview
A community's commercial land uses provide employment, goods and services,
recreation, tax revenue, and many other amenities and necessities. The features
of commercial areas reflect the economic vitality of a community as well as
local character. The location and characteristics of commercial areas directly
affect local transportation and growth management.
Existing Conditions
The main commercial areas in New Palestine run along US 52 basically from
Bittner Road to areas just west of the US 52/CR S 500 W. Historically this has
been the heart of commercial activity for the citizens of New Palestine since
the 1800's. This area makes up the Town's Main Street organizations boundaries
as well. Currently, the businesses/services in this downtown district consist
of government services (Chamber, Town offices, post office, police, library,
personal services, food services (restaurants/cafes) and specialty stores. A
few of the buildings in the downtown district are historic in nature.
Another commercial area is centered at the intersection of US 52 and CR S 600 W
and stretches west to CR W 650 N. The commercial businesses and retailers are
scattered and stretch mainly along the southern side of US 52.
Downtown Overview
In July of 2014, New Palestine was recognized as a Main Street organization
through the Indiana Office of Community and Rural Affairs. Main Street
organizations are a unique preservation-based organizing framework that enables
communities to revitalize downtown and neighborhood business districts by
leveraging local assets from historic, cultural, and architectural resources to
local enterprises and community pride. It is a comprehensive strategy that
addresses the variety of issues and problems that challenge traditional
commercial districts. By using their four point approach of organization,
promotion, design and economic restructuring, the New Palestine organization
hopes to revitalize their original downtown.
New Palestine Main Street started out as the Chamber of Commerce Beautification
Committee some 15 years previous. The New Palestine Main Street program area
encompasses the area along US 52 from the creek on the east end of town to CR W
500 S.
Existing Conditions
Unfortunately, many historic buildings have been lost over the decades due some
from neglect, but most were lost from fires. There are very few historic
buildings left in the original downtown area which poses a challenge to the
organization. Of the 28 historic structures (see Section 3 Community Profile -
Historic Structures) inventory published in 1981, 4 structures have been
demolished and only 5 structures are commercial buildings.
The New Palestine Main Street organization is in its beginning stages.
Currently its duties are those items that the previous beautification committee
oversaw such as landscaping along US 52 corridor, managing the banners on the
streetlights and the annual car show held in conjunction with the 4th of July
festival.
Industrial Use Overview
Industrial land uses in a community provide employment and contribute
positively to the local tax base. These uses however do have the potential to
promote transportation conflicts, pollution, and the reduction of aesthetic
quality. Industrial land uses are commonly in conflict with other community
uses as they can negatively affect residential and commercial quality. The
traffic from adjacent commercial and/or residential uses often imposes on
industrial vitality.
Existing Conditions
New Palestine is unique in that it has no industrial businesses. It also does
not have an industrial zoning designation. It does however have a Heavy
Business district zone designation in which manufacturing, fabricating,
processing, extracting, repairing, dismantling, storing or disposing of
equipment, raw materials, manufactured products or wastes which is conducted
entirely within enclosed buildings of any size is allowable. There is only one
parcel of land zoned for this use and is occupied by a self storage facility.
FUTURE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
New Palestine is poised to embrace new economic development opportunities. The
Chamber of Commerce, Economic Development commission, the Redevelopment
Commission and the newly formed Main Street organization should be dedicated to
the future growth and economic development of the community.
Communities must take advantage of local resources such as their location,
physical setting, financial resources and citizens. This includes the readiness
on the part of local banks, businesses, and private citizens to donate their
time and money. A strong comprehensive planning effort must be implemented to
guide growth and to improve the community. Local responsibility and problem
solving are the foundations of long-term success.
As New Palestine will continue to grow as a "bedroom community" in the
Indianapolis metro area, the community will still need some commercial and
professional services growth for the general population. The local Chamber of
Commerce has good communication with the Hancock County EDC and should continue
to work with them as well as the local business owners to develop and retain a
healthy economic atmosphere in New Palestine.
General
The Chamber of Commerce office in conjunction with the New Palestine Economic
Development and Redevelopment Commissions would be wise to develop an economic
development plan which will help the community:
   •   Identify the stakeholders and get them to participate in the planning
process;
   •   Determine the community's current condition providing information on
community setting, trends, issues and factors affecting economic development;
   •   Identify and map businesses that currently make up the economy;
   •   Define economic development options and document the analysis conducted
in determining how to manage future economic development efforts;
   •   Identify community concerns and goals for economic development; and
   •   Develop policies that translate community concerns and goals into clear
statement.
Commercial Use
As New Palestine continues to grow, it will attract more commercial
opportunities in both retail and professional services. The survey results
garnered needs for more services as seen below:

Since New Palestine is a small "bedroom community" it is accepted that certain
larger "big box" retailers would probably not locate in the community. These
commercial facilities are already located in nearby locations (Greenfield,
Indianapolis). What the community would like to see are more upscale retail and
dining businesses to cater to the growing population.
The Hancock County Comprehensive Plan calls for commercial growth to occur
along the US 52 corridor from New Palestine west to the county line. The
Steering Committee determined that they would prefer any new commercial growth
to stop at CR W 700 S instead and preferably be established on the north side
between US 52 and the railroad corridor.
Downtown
As the New Palestine Main Street organization continues to grow, it would be
pertinent to develop a Downtown Revitalization Plan. Grant monies can be
procured from the Indiana Office of Community and Rural Affairs to undertake
this study.
Such a plan can include such items as a profile of existing conditions, an
extensive downtown market assessment, analysis and implementation plan, public
participation, building inventory and analysis for facade improvements,
historic preservation design standards, project options with design standards
and cost estimates including a mix of grant funding opportunities, and an
evaluation of funding opportunities.
Industrial Use
While there are currently no plans for any type of industrial development in
the Town, it was agreed that in the future, it would be wise to revisit the
discussion of the possibility of light industrial uses in the Sugar Creek
township area. There is a light industrial zoned area to the east of the Town
at the intersection of US 52 and CR W 300 S that has yet to be developed.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT POLICY
Goal:
Provide sufficient planning and marketing that encourages growth and retention
while retaining a balance between residential neighborhoods and commercial
centers.
Objectives:
   •   Encourage commercial growth that attracts new retail and services to the
community.
   •   Support local businesses encouraging growth and retention in the
community.
   •   Encourage progressive technologies to serve the community.
   •   Enhance and expand the Main Street program.
   •   Continue partnerships with county and state economic development
agencies to promote the retention, expansion and new development of business
opportunities for the Town.
   •   Develop an Economic Development Plan to attract and guide future growth.
LAND USE
Looking at the existing land use in New Palestine can tell us about how the
community has developed and grown over time. It also gives us a look at how the
town may develop in the future. The planning area incorporates the land within
the town limits and also looks at the area surrounding the town mainly Union
Township.
Land use policy is determined by an analysis of present land use patterns,
assessing any problems associated with these land use trends, and
recommendations for future land use. A general evaluation of existing land use
is discussed first and is based upon generalized existing land use maps
prepared during the planning process. Next, future land use maps for the Town
of New Palestine are presented along with policy recommendations to guide
future land use decisions. The future land use maps must be used in conjunction
with the text of the comprehensive plan when considering zoning map amendments
and development proposals.
The goals and objectives stated in the plan, as well as background information
such as environmental data, should be considered on a site by site basis.
Although land use plans are reported relative to political boundaries, land use
trends do not respect such boundaries. Land use activities occurring at the
edge of one political subdivision influence the demand for similar activities
on the opposite side of the boundary in another political subdivision.
Therefore, development activities occurring in New Palestine can affect change
in the unincorporated areas of Sugar Creek township.
ZONING REGULATIONS
Unlike land use designations, zoning designations are what you can legally do
with your parcel today; the land use designation, in conjunction with
development guidelines, details how you may be able to use your parcel in the
future.
To clarify, there is a significant difference between the two. Land use
designations included in the Community Development Plan are plans for the
future. Whereas zoning designations more specifically define what use is
currently allowed on a specific parcel, and outline design and development
guidelines for those intended uses such as setbacks, minimum lot sizes,
buffering and landscaping requirements, etc.
The comprehensive plan is a guide or recommendation for the use of the zoning
ordinance and, to a lesser extent, the subdivision ordinance. It suggests, in
general terms, proposed uses for land within the locality, as well as the
proposed location of utilities and public facilities such as schools, fire
stations and parks. The plan also makes long-term projections of population
growth. The zoning ordinance actually establishes the rules governing the use
of land. The zoning ordinance divides a locality into different zoning
districts and spells out allowable uses for each district such as agriculture,
industry or commercial use. The zoning ordinance is not a mere recommendation
as is the comprehensive plan. In the case of a conflict concerning land use
between the comprehensive plan and the zoning ordinance, the zoning ordinance
controls. The subdivision ordinance governs the process for dividing land from
larger parcels into lots.
While the subdivision ordinance is entirely separate from the zoning ordinance,
the zoning ordinance establishes the minimum lot size for each zoning district.
New Palestine adopted their current zoning in 2001. The districts indicate how
land use and development has been shaped. The prevalence of commercial related
activities, the character of the housing stock and the special importance of
development along US 52 are all reflected in the choice of zoning districts.
The zoning in New Palestine closely follows the current land use.
The existing New Palestine Zoning ordinance defines nine use districts and
their primary purposes:
Residential
R-1 Single Family Residential
This district is defined as that which is primarily intended for single family
residential development on relatively flat land in areas that have or have
planned public services.
R-2 Single Family Residential
This district is defined as that which is primarily intended for residential
development in areas in and surrounding urban service areas, where public sewer
service is available or planned in the near future.
R-3 Multi-Family Residential
This district is defined as that which is primarily intended for multifamily
residential development in areas within urban service areas, near business
nodes and concentrations where the development of multifamily and two-family
residential lots and developments in areas where public services exist to
service them efficiently, and Mobile Home Parks as a Special Exception.
Business/Commercial
B-1 Neighborhood Business
The Neighborhood Business District is designed to meet the day-to-day
convenience shopping and service needs of persons living in nearby residential
areas. Uses allowed in this district will, in general, be a less intense use
than those allowed in the B-2 or B-3 Districts.
B-2 General Business
This district is designed to encourage well-planned business uses. Particularly
with respect to unified design, safe ingress and egress, adequate and properly
located parking and service facilities and convenient and safe pedestrian
accessibility.
B-3 Highway Business
This district provides sites for heavier types of business and commercial uses.
The Highway Business District is classified in the B-3 District.
B-4 Heavy Business
The B-4 Heavy Business District is one in which manufacturing, fabricating,
processing, extracting, repairing, dismantling, storing or disposing of
equipment, raw materials, manufactured products or wastes is conducted entirely
within enclosed buildings of any size, provided that such use shall conform to
the performance standards set forth herein. Screening of storage, parking and
loading areas is essential in this district as it is usually located adjacent
to residential areas.
Planned Unit Development
UD Unit Development Plan District
This district is intended to provide more development flexibility than is
possible through the application of customary zoning regulations. In
recognition of both the rapid changes in design and technology in the building
industry and new demands in the housing market, it is deemed necessary to meet
those changes in a manner that will be consistent with the best interests of
the Town.
Flood Plain
The development of the flood hazard areas could result in the potential loss of
life and property, create health and safety hazards and lead to extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief. Since development of these
areas is not essential to the orderly growth of the Town and environs, and
since these lands are suitable for fill, the FP Flood Plain District shall be
established and developed in accordance with the following criteria promulgated
by law.
The following uses have a low flood damage potential and do not obstruct flood
flows. These uses shall be permitted by right within the Flood Plain District
to the extent that they are not prohibited or not otherwise controlled by other
parts of the this Code, and provided they do not require structures, fill, or
storage of materials or equipment:
   1.   Agricultural uses such as general farming, pasture, grazing, orchards,
plant nurseries and vineyards.
   2.   Forestry, wildlife areas and nature preserves.
   3.   Parks and recreational uses, such as golf courses, driving ranges and
play areas.
   4.   Public or Employee Parking Area.
   5.   Sewage Treatment Facility (Primary Use).
   6.   Transmission Lines for Gas, Oil, Electricity or Other Utilities.
Overlay District
US 52 Highway Corridor Overlay
The purpose is to establish standards for the design of sites, buildings,
structures, plantings, signs, street hardware, and such other improvements that
are visible to the public and affect the physical development of land within
the US 52 (Main Street) Corridor Overlay Zone District.
These standards are intended to promote high quality creative development that
will combine imagination, innovation, and variety in the appearance of
buildings and sites in the overlay zone. These standards are further intended
to preserve and enhance property values and to promote the public health,
safety, and welfare by providing for consistent and coordinated treatment of
the property encompassed by the US 52 (Main Street) Corridor Overlay District.

ANNEXATION
In 2015 SB 330 was passed making it difficult for cities and towns to annex
outlying areas. Because of this, New Palestine is taking an approach to
annexation that will only include voluntary annexations. It is hoped that in
the future the annexation laws will once again be less stringent and allow
municipalities to annex areas with ease.
The passage of this bill will still make annexation in Indiana much more
difficult and costly for cities and towns. Specifically, the bill does the
following: SB 330 does the following: 1) Requires six months of upfront
community outreach by the municipality before an annexation ordinance may be
adopted; 2) Requires more detailed information in fiscal plans; 3) Lowers the
threshold for remonstrance signatures needed to go to court from 65% (current)
of landowners signatures to 51% of landowner signatures (or 60% of assessed
value); 4) Removes the court -stops an annexation altogether - if at least 65%
of landowners sign a remonstrance petition (or 80% assessed value); 5) Provides
an Economic Development Protection Provision that allows an annexation
involving an economic development project to go to the courts, even if 65% of
landowners sign a remonstrance petition, with a delayed effective date of
January 1, 2017 while a study takes place to develop a definition of economic
development project; 6) requires the municipality to provide a place for
remonstrance petitions to be signed; 7) Requires remonstrance petitions be
filed with the county auditor instead of with the courts; 8) prohibits a court
in a remonstrance hearing from considering personal finances or business
finances of an owner or resident of land as a factor for determining whether
the annexation will have a significant financial impact; 9) Prohibits any
amendment of a fiscal plan once a remonstrance petition is filed, without
consent of 65% of the remonstrators; 10) Allows remonstrators that prevail to
recover reasonable attorney's fees from the municipality up to $37,500; 11)
makes the agricultural exemption apply for all annexations so that farmers do
not pay any municipal taxes if they are annexed and their property is
classified agricultural for property tax purposes; 12) limits remonstrance
waivers going forward to 15 years; 13) requires a municipality with existing
remonstrance waivers with a deed recorded after June 30, 2015 to provide
written notice to property owners that the waiver exists; 14) Requires the
municipality to assume county debt or make payments to the county in certain
circumstances; 15) Requires the County Executive to approve an annexation of
any land property by a County RDC; 16) Specified circumstances under which a
public rights-of-way of a public highway may be annexed; and 17) Requires a
municipality to notify video service providers of the addition of property as a
result of annexation for the purpose of franchise fee payments.
EXISTING LAND USE
The Town of New Palestine consists of primarily residential land use,
commercial land use, institutional land use, and areas continuing as
agricultural land. There are no industrial uses in New Palestine. Most of the
open space land use is used for agricultural purposes or proposed housing
additions.
The Town of New Palestine consists of primarily residential land use (49.6%)
thus cementing its status as a bedroom community of the Indianapolis metro
area. Agricultural and or vacant land (30.4%) is the next biggest land use
category followed by institutional land use at 14.1% primarily due to the
Community School Corporation of Southern Hancock County's school facilities
located in the town limits. Commercial/office land usage represents only about
6% of the total.

Residential Use Overview
Several factors including type, size, cost, character, and availability of
housing significantly influences the local quality of life in communities. The
location of the housing is also a significant factor in the overall quality of
a community. Quality housing, of any size or type, is that which is in a well-
maintained neighborhood which is accessed by local streets and conveniently
located in relation to community activities and facilities, goods and services,
and employment.
Housing
The existing housing stock in New Palestine is similar to that which is common
in small cities and towns throughout Indiana. The housing stock is dominated by
single-family detached homes. Most of the single-family homes sit on less than
one-fourth acre lots which make up the original platted town or "old town"
area. There is a newer subdivision on the eastside of the town in which the lot
sizes are from % to 1 acre in size.
There are few multi-family housing units in the town. There are not, however,
any mobile home parks in the town.

Housing by Type
The Town of New Palestine has approximately 1,026 housing units according to
the 2014 U.S. Census/American Fact Finder Survey. The housing units are
predominantly single family dwellings. Single-family units makeup 84.2% of the
total housing units. Duplex units make up the next highest percentage at 11.8%
of the total housing units. There are only 3 mobile home units in New
Palestine.

Out of the 901 occupied units, 712 or 79% are owner occupied. The home
ownership rate is above the state average of 71.5% and the county average of
78.6%.
The total of number rental units is 189 or 21%. This rate is much the same as
the county average of 21.4% but lower than the state average of 28.5%.
105 units or 5.6% of the housing stock were reported vacant at the time of the
survey. This amount is way below the county rate of 8.2% and well below the
state rate of 11.3%. This is a good indication of the strong housing market in
New Palestine.
Housing by Age
New Palestine has a comparatively younger housing stock. Approximately 66% of
the homes were constructed after 1990 which makes them only 25 years old. By
comparison, more than 50% percent of Hancock County houses were built before
1990 and 73% for the entire state. A little more than one third of the housing
stock in New Palestine was built before 1990. The 2000's showed the highest
percentages of new housing units constructed. Approximately 36.6% of all the
housing stock in New Palestine was built during this time period.

Housing by Value
The 2014 U.S. Census/American Fact Finder Survey reported the median housing
value in the Town of New Palestine to be $170,300, which is well above the
state median value of $123,000, and above the Hancock County average of
$157,600. The table below shows New Palestine's Housing Values in comparison
with those of Hancock County and the State's. The median rent in New Palestine
was $856. This is higher than the state's median rent of $683, but just higher
than the county at $851.
An increase in the median value of homes could indicate that the average size
of homes is increasing which is the trend nationwide. According to the National
Association of Homebuilders, the average square feet of a newly constructed
home in the U.S. is 2,324. This is an increase from 2,057 square feet in 2000.
If this trend continues, then more land may be devoted to residential land use
in the future or development restraints will be needed to increase housing
density.

Institutional Land Use Overview
Institutional land uses include those which are generally public, or semi-
public such as churches, schools, and government buildings. Institutional land
uses are a necessary element of a community and their locations can either
contribute to, or detract from, the overall quality of the area.
Existing Conditions
Institutional uses in New Palestine are comprised of the town hall, post
office, library, New Palestine high school, middle schools and elementary
schools, sewer treatment plant, 13 churches and a cemetery.
Commercial Land Use Overview
Industrial Land Use Overview
Both of these can be found in Section 5 Economic Conditions
Agricultural/Vacant Land Use Overview
Agricultural land uses are necessary globally for the production of food
products. On the local level agriculture is a source of employment, community
character, and economic vitality. In a broader sense, agriculture is a way of
life for many families. In many areas, agricultural land is considered to be
simply undeveloped vacant land. Through the public input process for this
Comprehensive Development Plan, the participants indicated a need for the
recognition of agriculture as a land use, the preservation of prime
agricultural land, and the restriction of sprawl development that threatens
local agricultural operations.
Open Space uses are often set asides for park and recreational activities and
general green space. These amenities provide a community a certain quality of
life level. Parks and open spaces can provide not only recreational
opportunities, but also educational, spiritual and health related functions.
Existing Conditions
The town has a few large tracts of land within the town limits that have the
potential for development. They are all mostly open space lands currently being
used for agricultural purposes. Three large tracts (#'s 7, 8, and 9) about one
third of the existing vacant lands are on the northeast side of the town and
are designated as future phases of existing platted subdivisions.
The center of town has a large 75 acre parcel (#5) that is bisected by US 52.
It is currently being farmed and is zoned for residential use. The remaining
parcels sit on the very west side of the town mainly south of US 52.
Approximately half of the acreage (#'s 2 and 4) is zoned for commercial/
business and the other parcels (#'s 1 and 3) for residential use.

FUTURE LAND USE
The future land use is the culmination of the physical reality of land use
planning which is linked to the goals and objective s. The informati on in this
chapter provides a summary of the future land use plan for the Town of New
Palestine and how it is based on these goals and objectives for the community.
The Town of New Palestine is surrounded by flat agricultural lands to the south
and east and residential subdivisions to the west and north. Although Hancock
County does not allow planning areas to have a 2 mile fringe jurisdiction for
land use planning, this Future Land Use Plan does include land use planning for
a supposed 2 mile fringe area around New Palestine which is basically all of
Sugar Creek Township.
Discussion of future land use in the community was divided between new
development within the current town limits and the area within area of Sugar
Creek Township outside of the town limits. Most of the plans for development
outside the town limits follows the Hancock County Comprehensive Plan although
there are a few areas in which the Steering Committee wanted to express their
preferences for how the areas should be developed. This will dictate how the
town will develop in the future. The Town will need to concentrate on
preservation of existing structures and infill development to enhance the
community as well as utilizing the existing open areas for residential,
commercial, and open space uses. The Future Land Use Map shows areas where
general growth is to take place. Both maps included this report are intended to
be general in nature; land use boundaries are not specific. This plan is
intended as a flexible and general guideline; it is not intended as a zoning
map.

The Agricultural/Rural Residential designation denotes those areas of Hancock
County that are meant to remain largely rural, with uses primarily focusing on
farming and other agriculture-related functions. Some residential development
is appropriate within this designation, although it should occur at very low
densities of less than 1 unit per acre.
Low Density Suburban Residential areas are intended to include primarily single
family detached residences. These neighborhoods are distinguished from higher
density residential areas by lot size, setbacks, density, and often home size.
Community Commercial developments serve a wider area using their location near
significant transportation corridors to attract users. The scale of uses within
Community Commercial is also larger, and could include such things as
restaurants, retail stores, commercial service businesses, professional
offices, and other related uses. Medium-scaled centers containing multiple
businesses are also appropriate in Community Commercial areas.
The Mixed-Use Corridor designation is intended to provide an appropriate
pattern of development along major transportation corridors within Hancock
County. Examples of these areas include the U.S. 40 Corridor west of
Greenfield, as well as the Mt. Comfort Road corridor south of I-70. These areas
should be a focus of higher-intensity mixed-use development in the future.
New Palestine/Sugar Creek Township
Residential
In Town Area
Any new residential land use has been limited to infill areas within the Old
Town area and the existing newer subdivisions. The previous Agricultural/Vacant
Land Use section shows which undeveloped areas within the town limits might be
used for additional residential areas of development.
Sugar Creek Township Fringe Area
Future land use for the fringe area follows the Hancock County Comprehensive
Plan and shows future residential development to be mainly north and south of
US 52 and throughout the township with a ring around the remainder of town.
While this area is mostly used for agricultural uses, single family homes can
be built in these areas. They will need to follow the development standards for
agricultural zones and subdivisions will not be feasible in this area unless
the current utilities can be extended to serve the new development. At that
point these areas should be annexed into the town.
Commercial
In Town Area
Most original downtown commercial areas are limited in space and buildings to
accommodate new commercial establishments. New Palestine's downtown area has
very few vacant lots as well as very few vacant buildings that can be utilized
for further downtown development.
The newly annexed vacant parcels to on the west side of the town in and around
the intersection of US 52 and 600 W is slated for commercial development. Other
vacant land areas that lie between US 52 and the railroad tracks are desirable
for additional commercial development.
Sugar Creek Township Fringe Area
The Hancock County Comprehensive Plan shows a commercial corridor that spans US
52 on both the north and south sides going all the way from the western most
town limits to the Marion County line. This includes a "community commercial
center" at US 52 and 600 W. The steering committee felt it was better to limit
any new commercial development along this corridor to the area north of US 52
between the highway and the railroad tracks. It also wanted to limit the
corridor development west to 700 W and not to the county line.
Industrial
In Town Area
There are no areas in the town limits designated for future Industrial uses.
Sugar Creek Township Fringe Area
The only areas currently outside the town limits for industrial use are on the
east side of New Palestine. One is located on the southeast corner of US 52 and
CR 400 W. The other is a large 175+ acre parcel at the northwest corner of US
52 and CR 300 W that is zoned by the county for light industrial use. This area
will more than likely be the only area in Sugar Creek township for any type of
industrial use.
Institutional
In Town Area
There is currently no need for additional area for any expansions or new
development of institutional uses. Both the school and the library as well as
the town hall have sufficient space available for any future expansions.
Sugar Creek Township Fringe Area
There is no area that is designated for expansion of institutional land uses
outside of the current town limits.
Open Space/Recreation
In Town Area
The town would like to work with the Lions Club to continue the use of their
property for the community center and the ballfield.
Sugar Creek Township Fringe Area
An area has been designated for future recreational use that lies just south of
the current Lions Club Park. The Sugar Creek Township Park will continue to be
developed for both active and passive recreational activities.
Agricultural
In Town Area
The few remaining tracts of land still being used for agricultural purposes are
targeted for either residential, commercial or industrial uses.
Sugar Creek Township Fringe Area
There is a large number of existing farm operations in the fringe area outside
of the town limits. It is likely that these areas will remain agricultural for
the next few decades and it is the desire of the town that these areas be
preserved for agricultural uses. If and when any of these land areas should
come available for development, the town should be prepared to annex the area
into the town limits.

LAND USE POLICY
Goal:
To encourage the orderly, responsible development of land in order to promote
the community goals, and to determine and direct land use patterns in the most
positive way for the community as a whole, in a manner consistent with its long
term interests.
Objectives:
   •   Identify its desired town boundaries over the next 20 years.
   •   Use the selective extension of sanitary sewer service to promote growth.
   •   Balance residential and commercial uses that allow for the expansion of
the tax base without impacting residential areas with traffic, noise, and other
adverse impacts.
   •   Control development in a manner compatible with the desired character of
the town.
   •   Continue to update the current Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Control
Ordinance, including administrative and regulatory procedures.
   •   Continue communication with the Hancock County Planning Department on
all land use issues outside the Town's planning jurisdiction.
   •   Concentrate on development by infill properties and of vacant parcels.
   •   Investigate the possibility of additional rental units.
   •   Investigate the possibility of annexing adjacent areas into its
corporate limits.
TRANSPORTATION
The overall objective of the Transportation Plan is to offer a system of
transportations that will allow for the safe movement of people and
commodities, quickly, economically, and conveniently between all points of the
town and the surrounding area to provide a reasonable choice of facilities and
routes.
The New Palestine area is part of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Planning
Organization (MPO) area. The Indianapolis MPO is responsible for the
Transportation Improvement Plan that contains all future roadway improvements
for the planning area. There are no major projects planned for the New
Palestine/Sugar Creek Twp area through 2035.
It was decided to follow the recommendations from the Hancock County updated
comprehensive plan for all transportation related needs for the Town of New
Palestine. These recommendations are shown for the following categories of
roadways, bikeways, trails, and public transportation in the maps on the
preceding pages.
HANCOCK COUNTY TRANSPORTATION PLAN
Roadways
The updated Hancock County Transportation Plan has designated roadways in and
around New Palestine as such:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/2d7e5a689d04b22fce5b39e6237fbe55d0e7f984/
IMAGES/0-0-0-1945.jpg]
 
US 52/600 W
These roadways have been designated as a Major Arterial. Major Arterials are
those Federal or state routes of regional importance. This includes such roads
as U.S. 40, U.S. 52, State Road 9, and State Road 67. These roadways are
intended to move large volumes of traffic between the communities within
Hancock County, as well as to surrounding counties. While these roads are not
intended to be limited access, like Freeways, access control standards should
be utilized to ensure that these corridors remain safe and efficient.
500 W
This roadway has been designated as a Minor Arterial. Minor Arterials include
several State routes of lesser significance as well as some County roads which
serve high volumes of traffic. Examples of these roads would be State Road 234
or County Road 600 West (Mt. Comfort Road). These road corridors should also be
subject to access control measures as development occurs along them.
400 W/700 W/300 S/W Stinemyer Rd
Major Collectors are county roads that play significant roles in moving traffic
between Arterial roadways, as well as funneling traffic from residential areas
to the greater road network. Examples of Major Collectors in the county would
include County Roads 600 East or 300 North. This category also includes roads
built within new subdivisions which serve to gather traffic from neighborhood
streets and direct it to the larger roads in the system.
W Stinemyer Road is indicated in the Hancock County Plan to have future
improvements extending the roadway east from 550 W to 500 W. There are
currently no plans for this extension with the Hancock County Highway
Department.
All other roads in New Palestine and in the surrounding area are considered
Local Roads. Local Roads are County roads that are not designated as Arterials
or Collectors within the Thoroughfare Plan hierarchy. They typically carry low
volumes of traffic and driveway access is not strictly controlled. These roads
move traffic over short distances at relatively low speeds, connecting
travelers with the wider network of roads. This category also includes streets
within subdivisions that serve primarily as access points for residential
development. Right-of-way standards for these roads are the lowest for any of
the categories, although in the case of subdivision streets, more improvements
(such as curbs, sidewalks, or street trees) should be required.
US 52 Critical Corridor
Even though INDOT has no plans for improvements along US 52, the Hancock County
Comprehensive Plan lists the US 52 corridor as one of their Critical Corridors:
The US 52 corridor runs through the southwest corner of Hancock County. It
passes through the town of New Palestine, a community that is not a member of
the Area Plan Commission. A widening of this roadway to four lanes from the
west county line to the east side of New Palestine should be planned and
implemented for future development. Residential development has occurred in the
vicinity of the corridor, and larger-scale commercial development is beginning
to occur as well. This corridor provides an important linkage between New
Palestine and Indianapolis, a relationship that is reflected in the pending
roadway improvements.
Development Policies
   • Land Use: Development should occur primarily within and around New
Palestine. Adjacent to the corridor, more intense-mixed use development is
appropriate as the town grows outward. Development along the U.S. 52 corridor
should focus on the area west of New Palestine in the near future, while the
segment east of the town should be reserved for similar mixed use growth over
the long term. The main focus of commercial development should be at the
intersection of U.S. 52 and Mount Comfort Road.
   • Design: As a gateway to Hancock County, high standards for building
materials, architectural details, landscaping, signage, and other site
amenities should be emphasized.
   • Access Management: Careful management of highway access will be crucial as
development continues so that local and regional travel can be accommodated
efficiently. Large-scale developments should provide cross-access facilities to
reduce traffic pressure on the main corridor.
   • Town Character: Development along the corridor that is immediately
adjacent to New Palestine should reflect the character of the town and have
convenient pedestrian connections to existing neighborhoods and the town
center.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1943.jpg]
 
In addition, other categories of transportation need to be considered in the
Transportation Plan as well:
Public Transportation
Hancock County does have a countywide public transportation system. Non-
emergency transportation for various destinations is provided by Hancock County
Senior Services (HCSS) for county residents 60 years of age and over and by
Hancock Area Rural Transit (HART) for residents under 60 years of age. Vehicles
are available Monday to Friday from 7AM to 5PM. Wheelchair transportation is
also available. Appointments are scheduled first come-first served.
The Town should also work with Hancock County and the Indianapolis Metropolitan
Planning Organization to improve the public transportation system for the
region and New Palestine.
Railroads
Hancock County currently has two operational railroad lines. The southern line
that travels (in part) from Indianapolis to Cincinnati through New Palestine is
used for freight by CSX.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/2d7e5a689d04b22fce5b39e6237fbe55d0e7f984/
IMAGES/0-0-0-1941.jpg]
 
Airport Access
New Palestine is approximately 28 miles from the Indianapolis International
Airport. Residents can take US 52 to I-465 to I -70 to access the airport.
Bikeways, Trails and Walking Paths
Hancock County has no official trails plan, but instead uses information from
the Indianapolis MPO's Central Indiana Regional Bikeways Plan. The only trails
planned for the Hancock County area according to this plan is the Pennsy Trail
extension in Cumberland.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/2d7e5a689d04b22fce5b39e6237fbe55d0e7f984/
IMAGES/0-0-0-1939.jpg]
 
Several multi-use path projects have been completed within close proximity to
the Town of New Palestine. A multi-use path exists at the Sugar Creek Township
Park and the Town of Cumberland has constructed a multi-use path on the old
Pennsy railroad corridor from German Church Road to Mt. Comfort Road (CR S 600
W). The City of Greenfield has created a multi-use path on the old Pennsy
Corridor from CR S 150 W to CR S 400 E and efforts are underway to try and
connect the two communities via a path along the abandoned railroad corridor.
Fortunately, New Palestine had a Bike & Pedestrian Plan commissioned in 2015.
The Plan identified the best routes for making connections to destinations
within the Town as well as to residential neighborhoods. The plan includes a
conceptual network of on road bicycle facilities, sidewalks, and multi-use
trails. Recommendations were made on programs and policies for the Town to
implement that will help support walking and biking.
The Plan has its own Goals & Objectives centered on health and wellness issues
as well as connectivity and funding mechanisms. These are integrated into the
Action Plan and will be referenced to for more detailed implementation
measures.
The finalized Bike & Pedestrian Plan proposes to improve 11 corridors. Two
different types of bicycle and pedestrian treatments are proposed to strengthen
the bicycle and pedestrian routes. The Plan uses shared roadways and shard-use
paths for this purpose as seen in the final route map.

TRANSPORTATION POLICY
Goal:
Strive to make the community connected by all means of transportation modes
which will enhance the growth and development of the community.
Objectives:
   •   Provide pedestrian and bicycle connections between important
destinations.
   •   Improve local roadways to aid commerce in the transport of goods through
the community.
   •   Educate community on availability of public transportation.
   •   Continued maintenance and improvements to local road system.
   •   Work with the Indiana Department of Transportation and the Hancock
County Highway Department to improve major roads in and surrounding New
Palestine.
ACTION PLAN
IMPLEMENTATION
Once the Comprehensive Development Plan is completed, the single most important
aspect of the Plan is implementation. Without implementation, the Plan has no
meaning. The Town of New Palestine is fortunate in that the Town Manager and
Town Council and other Town officials and organizations are very committed to
implementing the Comprehensive Development Plan. Implementation is the final
phase of the Comprehensive Development Plan process, i.e., the realization of
the goals and objectives as set forth in the Plan.
ACTION PLAN
The Goals and Objectives set forth in the previous chapters of this Plan
represent the items which are of top priority to the community. To implement
these goals and objectives, the Action Plan was developed which will direct the
community through the steps of implementation.
CONCLUSION
Even though the Community Development Plan has been developed for short-range
(five years) and long-range (twenty years) planning periods, the Plan should be
reviewed annually, and revised as needed by the Plan Commission every five
years. Changes will undoubtedly be necessary because of changing trends and
economic conditions.
The Town Council and Plan Commission of any community are often pressured to
disregard the goals and objectives of the Community Development Plan. However,
in order to assure orderly growth and development in compliance with the Plan,
the town must continue to remain committed to implementing the Plan. It is only
with this adherence to the goals and objectives of the Plan that the residents
of New Palestine can be assured that the community will maintain and enhance
the small town values, appearance and quality of life.
QUALITY OF LIFE

SECTION 1
PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS OF DESIGN
1.01 STREETS.
A.   Proposed streets should be adjusted to the conformation of the land and
soil conditions so as to produce usable lots and streets of reasonable
gradient.
B.   The street and alley layout shall conform to the thoroughfare plan for the
development of the neighborhood in which the proposed subdivision is located
and shall provide access to all lots and parcels of land within the
subdivision. Where streets cross other streets, jogs shall not be created. The
minimum distance between center lines of parallel or approximately parallel
streets intersecting a cross street should be 150 feet.
C.   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary line of the tract to be
subdivided so as to provide for normal circulation of traffic within the
vicinity.
D.   Wherever there exists a dedicated or platted portion of a street or alley
adjacent to the proposed subdivision, the reminder of the street or alley to
the prescribed width shall be platted within the proposed subdivision.
E.   Widths of arterial streets and feeder streets shall conform to the widths
specified in the thoroughfare plan.
F.   Road connections must take place no less than six hundred and sixty (660)
feet.
G.   Stub connectors required for new developments: one (1) per every twenty
(20) lots with a minimum of one (1) stub connector.
H.   The minimum right-of-way of residential streets, marginal access streets,
or cul-de-sacs shall be 50 feet. All cul-de-sacs shall terminate in a circular
right-of-way with a minimum diameter of 100 feet, or other arrangement for the
turning of all vehicles conveniently within the right-of-way.
I.   Alleys shall be at least 20 feet in width.
J.   The center lines of streets should intersect as nearly at right angles as
possible, but in no case shall an angle of less than 60 degrees be created.
K.   If the smaller angle of intersection of two streets is between 60 degrees
and 90 degrees, the radius of the arc at the intersection of property lines
shall be increased as deemed advisable by the Plan Commission.
L.   Intersections of more than two streets at one point shall be avoided.
M.   Where parkways or special types of streets are involved, the Plan
Commission may apply special standards to be followed in their design.
N.   Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a highway
designated as a ‘controlled access highway' by the appropriate highway
authorities, or a street so designated by the thoroughfare plan, provision
shall be made for a frontage access-way or a parallel access-way situated at a
minimum distance of twenty (20) feet from the edge of the right-of-way and such
access-way located to connect with adjacent properties or access-ways or
streets. The access-way shall be designed to make the best use of access points
with the "controlled access highway." Frontage access-ways shall be platted to
a minimum width of 24 feet and paved to their full width (when located adjacent
to the controlled access highway); otherwise, the optional parallel access-way
shall be platted to a width of 40 feet and paved to a width of at least 24
feet. Access points shall be platted and improved in accordance with the street
requirements in this code.
O.   The following describe the different roadway classifications:
   1.   Highways are devoted to high-speed, long distance traffic movement with
(ideally) little or no access to adjacent land. Highways typically carry over
20,000 trips per day.
   2.   Arterials move traffic between principal traffic generators. Direct
residential access is generally discouraged, but access to commercial or
industrial areas is allowed. Arterials generally carry 5,000 to 20,000 trips
per day.
   3.   Collectors serve internal traffic functions, and generally function to
connect local streets (below) to arterials. They can also provide direct access
to property. Collectors typically carry 1,000 to 1,500 trips per day.
   4.   Local streets exist primarily to provide access to adjacent land.
P.   Unobstructed sight distances measured from a point five feet above the
proposed grade line, to permit horizontal visibility on all streets, must be

standards, steps and other similar structures, and shall delineate the
location, size, and description of all landscape materials. Landscape
treatments for plazas, roads, paths, service and parking areas shall be
designed as an integral and coordinated part of the landscape plan for the
entire lot.
B.   Areas to be Landscaped.
   1.   Buffering Between Land Uses.
      a.   Developments that have non-residential and residential uses abutting
one another shall provide a landscape buffer 20 feet wide planted with five
trees and 55 shrubs per 100 linear feet of transitional yard between the non-

IMAGES/0-0-0-1383.jpg]
 
      c.   Undeveloped properties, expansions of more than 40 percent of
existing floor area, and rezoned property are subject to the provisions of this
section.
      d.   Landscape buffers shall not overlap into required planting along
rights-of-way.
      e.   The width of the required buffer and the number of shrubs may be
reduced by half with the construction of an opaque wall of fence. The fence or
wall shall be opaque (solid) and constructed of material compatible with the
principle building in composition and color. The wall shall have a minimum
height of five feet and a maximum height of seven feet.
         1.   Screening of Loading and Storage Areas. Screening shall be by
opaque wall or fence six to eight feet in height. One-third of the surface area
of the wall or fence must be screened from the right-of-way with plants within
two years of the certificate of occupancy. Screening shall be evergreen, have a
minimum height of 30 inches when installed, and planted at a maximum spacing of
four feet on center.
         2.   Planting Adjacent to Free-Standing Non-Residential Buildings. A
planting area five feet wide shall be installed along all sides of buildings.
Sidewalks may be permitted in these areas, but shall not occupy the entire area
on any side of the building. These adjacent planting areas need not be
rectangular in shape as long as the required amount of space is landscaped.
Innovative and original designs are encouraged. The adjacent planting area at
the rear of a structure may be excluded if that structure is located less than
40 feet from the rear property line and sufficient peripheral planting is
included to compensate for its removal.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/2d7e5a689d04b22fce5b39e6237fbe55d0e7f984/
IMAGES/0-0-0-1385.jpg]
 
         3.   Supplemental Tree Plantings. All lots, including common areas,
within major subdivisions shall be planted with supplementary trees if less
than the required number of trees exists on the lot after construction is
complete. Required street yard trees are additional to the following table.
 
Lot Size                 Supplemental Shade Trees
‹ 12,000 sq. ft.       1
12,001 to 20,000 sq. ft. 2
20,001 to 30,000 sq. ft. 3
30,001 to 1 acre         4
› 1 acres              5 per acre
 
For design flexibility, one shade tree may be substituted for two ornamental
trees or two evergreen trees for up to 50 percent of the required supplemental
trees. Existing trees 6 to 12 inches in caliper may be used to fulfill the
supplemental tree planting requirements. Existing trees over 12 inches in
caliper may reduce by one the required number of supplemental trees.
   6.   Planting within Parking Lots.
      a.   Parking lots with more than 10 spaces shall be landscaped.
      b.   Parking areas within 50 feet of a right-of-way shall have a planted
screen between the parking perimeter and the street yard. Screening must be at
least three feet high with no gaps greater than four feet. (Exceptions: car
sales lots and driveways.) Walls not to exceed four feet in height may be used
to substitute for vegetation.
      c.   Planting areas shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the parking
area. Not less than five percent of the parking lot shall be landscaped.
Landscape buffers and landscaping adjacent to buildings and on the periphery of
the parking lot shall not be included toward the interior parking lot planting
requirements. Landscaping shall be specifically provided at the ends of parking
rows and as a means of separating parking from major circulation aisles within
parking lots. One shade tree per 2,400 square feet of surface area is required.
One shrub per 500 square feet of surface area is required. No parking space
shall be further than 60 feet from the trunk of a shade tree. Existing shade
trees over 12 inches in caliper may be used to fulfill these requirements.
      d.   Peripheral Planting. A peripheral landscaping strip four feet wide
shall be installed along the side of any parking area that abuts any side or
rear property line separating the parcel from any residential uses or
districts. At least one tree for each 50 lineal feet shall be planted in any
such peripheral landscape strip.
   7.   Planting along Rights-of-Way. Street trees shall be planted parallel
with the street between the curb and sidewalk. In commercial areas where there
is no parkway, the trees shall be planted in tree wells. The tree species shall
be the same for a street. Spacing shall be determined by tree type with a
minimum spacing of 10 feet on center and a maximum spacing of 40 feet on
center. Street trees shall be seedless hardwood shade trees. Species should be
selected based upon hardiness, durability, root systems that do not damage
sidewalks, and leaf and fruit litter that will not clog storm drain inlets. The
following species shall not be used for street trees:
 
Silver Maples                Sweetgums
Pin Oaks                     Cottonwoods
Locust varieties with thorns
 
C.   Landscaping Standards.
   1.   The interior dimensions, specifications, and design of any planting
area shall be sufficient to protect the trees and shrubs planted and provide
for their proper growth.
   2.   The primary plant materials used in and around parking areas shall be
trees that provide shade at maturity. Shrubs and other plantings may be used to
compliment tree landscaping, but shall not be the sole contribution to the
landscaping.
   3.   Plant materials should be appropriate to local growing and climatic
conditions. Whenever appropriate, existing trees greater than 12 inches in
caliper should be conserved and integrated into the landscape plan. Plant
materials shall be selected for their purpose, structure, texture, hardiness,
and appearance.
   4.   The landscape plan shall ensure that sight distances are not obstructed
for drivers of motor vehicles.
   5.   Where natural or existing topographic patterns contribute to beauty and
utility of a development, they shall be preserved and protected. Modification
to topography shall be permitted where it contributes to the design.
   6.   Plant materials shall conform to the requirements described in the
latest edition of the American Standard Nursery Stock, which is published by
the American Association of Nurserymen. Shade trees shall have a minimum
caliper of 2 inches. Ornamental trees shall have a minimum caliper of 1½
inches.
   7.   Existing trees 4 inches or greater in caliper that have good form and
will be protected in place may count toward the landscape requirements.
D.   Landscaping Installation and Maintenance.
   1.   Installation. All landscaping required by the approved landscaping plan
shall be installed prior to the issuance of a building occupancy permit if said
permit is issued during a planting season, or within six months of the date an
occupancy permit is issued during a non-planting season.
   2.   Maintenance. It shall be the responsibility of the owners and their
agencies to insure proper maintenance of the landscaping, in accordance with
the standards set by this Ordinance and as indicated on the landscaping plan
which has been approved by the Plan Commission. This is to include, but is not
limited to, replacing dead plantings with identical varieties or a suitable
substitute and keeping the area free of refuse and debris.
   3.   Changes after Approval. No landscaping that has been approved by the
Area Plan Commission may later be altered, eliminated, or sacrificed without
first obtaining further Plan Commission approval.
   4.   Inspection. The Area Plan Commission, or their duly appointed
representative, shall have the authority to visit any lot within the Town of
New Palestine to inspect the landscaping and check it against the approved plan
on file.

1.03 are required.
STANDARD DRAWINGS: The drawings of structures, sanitary sewer lines or devices
commonly used and referred to on the plans and in these Standards.
STANDARDS: The Standards for Design and Construction within the New Palestine
jurisdiction as contained herein and all subsequent additions, deletions or
revisions.
3.02 RECORD DRAWINGS
The project Designer shall furnish to the Town one set of as-built drawings and
one set of digital files on compact disc in AutoCAD ".DXF" and ".DWG" format
for all projects dedicated to the Town and for all multi-family, industrial and
commercial sites 5 acres and larger. All sheets shall have "Record Drawing"
boldly printed on them with the date, stamp, and signature of the Professional
Design Engineer, who must be registered in the State of Indiana. Drawings and
computer files shall clearly differentiate between the original design and
changes made to the design during the construction process. Each disk shall be
labeled with project name, property name, and date. A New Development Project
Summary Form (See

structures to a minimum accuracy of +/- 2 feet.
   5.   The horizontal location and/or bank cross sections for all detention/
retention facilities or other information to verify storage volume.
3.03 DIGITAL DATA SUBMISSION STANDARDS
The Town has created a geographic information system (GIS) to store, manage and
maintain geographic/spatially related data for the Town of New Palestine. It is
the Town's goal to use computer aided technologies, such as Computer Aided
Design (CAD) to expedite the review process and update the Town's GIS basemap.
This will be accomplished by the development of standards and procedures for
the integration of digital CAD drawings into the GIS environment, whereby
maintaining the integrity and positional accuracy of the data.
Below are the requirements for submission of digital as-built AutoCad and GIS
data, which are required for construction projects in the Town of New
Palestine.
A.   A plan view of the affected construction area shall be submitted in a
digital CAD drawing. The engineering design shall be completed in a drawing
(digital file) that includes plan and profile drawing sheets. The file format
will be AutoCAD Drawing Interchange File (DXF) format. DXF files can be created
from all major CAD and GIS packages.
B.   The drawing file shall be submitted in State Plan coordinates with three
points of geodetic control for spatial reference. Drawings submitted in plan
and profile sheets are not stored in a drawing coordinate system which
translates to real world locations. A digital file must be submitted and must
contain all information for new or altered GIS structures and any or all
accompanying geodetic control. Acceptable control includes section corners and
street intersections. It is required that the control used be referenced and
shown in the plan drawing. If a section corner is located within the project
limits it should be symbolically indicated and annotated in the design file. If
the nearest section corner is located well outside of the project area, it
should be tied to one of the geodetic control points used. All street
intersections should be symbolically indicated. Any land survey information,
such as basis of bearings and or any assumptions must be submitted and
annotated on the design file.
C.   Required graphic specifications shall include layer names and color
definitions. Graphic file specifications are shown in
Appendix 3-A. All features included in the submitted GIS review will follow
these specifications in the following manner:
1.   The feature will be submitted on the specified layer.
2.   The color number of the features that have been changed or added will be a
different color than the original features on that layer.
3.   Miscellaneous lines and text will be placed on unique layers different
from ones used by the GIS.
Example: Added sanitary manholes will be submitted on the layer SANITARY.
Existing manholes are also on that layer in the color magenta. The new manholes
will be any other color but magenta. It does not matter if an entity on another
layer is also the existing or new color because entities are translated with
layer first, then color.
D.   Attribute information will be submitted in a text file or spreadsheet. For
example, when a CAD file is submitted that contains design of a sanitary sewer,
the length, material and diameter of each sewer line segment will be submitted
in a text file or spreadsheet along with the attribute information on the
drawings.
Each record in the file will be assigned a unique ID, which will correspond to
text labels in the CAD file showing the referenced feature. The Town will
provide unique numbers for structures and segments. Developers also have the
option of creating their own numbering system as long as they correspond with
the entire design file. The unique numbering system for each segment and
structure will be listed in the first column, with the corresponding attributes
for each feature provided in the corresponding rows. The Town will then be able
to sort and import the data into the GIS and assign the appropriate segments
and structures imported from the DXF file. Required attributes for features are
shown in Appendix 1-A.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 94.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has, in I.C. 36-7-4, granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Town Council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 010414, passed 1-4-2014; Am. Ord. 121918, passed 12-19-2018)
§ 94.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-proofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 010414, passed 1-4-2014; Am. Ord. 121918, passed 12-19-2018)
§ 94.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters.
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage.
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (F)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 010414, passed 1-4-2014; Am. Ord. 121918, passed 12-19-2018)
§ 94.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located
in floodplains; and
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
(Ord. 010414, passed 1-4-2014; Am. Ord. 121918, passed 12-19-2018)
§ 94.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A ZONES, flood
waters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   ZONE AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones
A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived, from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the ADDITION is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed ADDITION, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the Regular
Program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   D ZONE. Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding
is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is
not required by regulation in this zone.
   DEVELOPMENT.
      (1)   Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate including
but not limited to:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any
addition to a structure;
         (b)   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home or installing a recreational vehicle on a site for more than
180 days;
         (c)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction
of roads, or similar projects;
         (d)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements, and the like;
         (e)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling
operations;
         (f)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
         (g)   Storage of materials; or
         (h)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
      (2)   DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the maintenance of
existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing, resurfacing
roads, or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent
structures.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter
walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or
columns (posts and piers).
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. A certified statement that verifies a structure's
elevation information. This certification must be signed and sealed by a land
surveyor, engineer, or architect authorized by law to certify elevation
information.
   EMERGENCY PROGRAM. The first phase under which a community participates in
the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOOD)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See FREEBOARD)
   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The FLOODPLAIN includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to
as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention
ordinance, and floodplain management requirements.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP. As related to variances of this chapter, the exceptional HARDSHIP
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Town of
New Palestine Stormwater Utility Board requires that the variance is
exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or
financial HARDSHIP alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of
one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional HARDSHIP.
All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally
intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURES. Any structures individually listed on the National

damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,1997,
will include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in
an SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is
only issued by FEMA.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision
by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the

below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls, and if a structure has more than one enclosed
area, each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area, and the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the

annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base
flood elevations or SFHAs.
   PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE. Anything which is injurious to the safety or
health of an entire community, neighborhood or any considerable number of
persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary
manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.

be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that
intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood-prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdiction of the
town subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the town are
generally identified as such on the Hancock County, Indiana, and Incorporated
Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated December 4, 2007, as well as any future
updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as Zone A,
AE, A1-A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,

   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in VIOLATION until such time as that
documentation is provided.

topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X ZONES shown on recent FIRMs (B Zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or

designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type
of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. See A ZONE.
   ZONE B, C, and X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(ZONE X is used on new and revised maps in place of ZONES B and C.)

available regulatory flood data is listed below.
   (A)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the town shall be as delineated on the
1% annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Hancock County,
Indiana, and Incorporated Areas and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map
dated December 4, 2007, as well as any future updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date.

dated December 4, 2007, as well as any future updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage area
from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace existing
data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review, and subsequently approved.
   (C)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification
on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of
any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas shall be according
to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater
than one square mile.
   (D)   Upon issuance of a letter of final determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.

   (B)   Construction stage.
      (1)   Upon establishment of the lowest floor of an elevated structure or
structure constructed on fill, it shall be the duty of the applicant to submit
to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the NAVD 88 or NGVD
elevation of the lowest floor, as built. The certification shall be prepared by
or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor, professional
engineer or architect and certified by the same. The Floodplain Administrator
shall review the lowest floor elevation survey data submitted. The applicant
shall correct deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is
allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make the
corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the
project. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the elevation certification
shall be at the applicant's risk.
      (2)   Upon establishment of the floodproofed elevation of a floodproofed
structure, it shall be the duty of the applicant to submit to the Floodplain
Administrator a floodproofing certificate. Certification shall be prepared by
or under the direct supervision of a registered professional engineer or
architect and certified by same. (The Floodplain Administrator shall review the
floodproofing certification submitted.) The applicant shall correct any
deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is allowed to
proceed. Failure to submit the floodproofing certification or failure to make
correction required shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
   (C)   Finished construction. Upon completion of construction, an elevation
certification (FEMA Elevation Certificate Form 086-0-33 or any future updates)
which depicts the "as-built" lowest floor elevation is required to be submitted
to the Floodplain Administrator. If the project includes a floodproofing
measure, floodproofing certification (FEMA Floodproofing Certificate Form 81-65
or any future updates) is required to be submitted by the applicant to the
Floodplain Administrator.

partitioned or finished into separate rooms; and
         (f)   The interior grade of such enclosed area shall be at an
elevation at or higher than the exterior grade.
         (g)   Openings are to be not less than 3 inches in any direction in
the plane of the wall. This requirement applies to the hole in the wall,
excluding any device that may be inserted such as typical foundation air vent
device.
         (h)   Property owners shall be required to execute a flood openings/
venting affidavit acknowledging that all openings will be maintained as flood
vents, and that the elimination or alteration of the openings in any way will
violate the requirements of this division (D). Periodic inspections will be
conducted by the Floodplain Administrator to ensure compliance. The affidavit
shall be recorded, along with the deed, in the office of the Hancock County
Recorder.
         (i)   Property owners shall be required to execute and record with the
structure's deed a non-conversion agreement declaring that the area below the
lowest floor (where the interior height of the enclosure exceeds 6 feet) shall
not be improved, finished or otherwise converted; the community will have the
right to inspect the enclosed area. The non-conversion agreement shall be
recorded in the office of the Hancock County Recorder.
   (E)   Structures constructed on fill. A residential or non-residential
structure may be constructed on a permanent land fill in accordance with the
following:
      (1)   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep
before compacting to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with either the
standard or modified proctor test method. The results of the test showing
compliance shall be retained in the permit file.
      (2)   The fill shall extend 10 feet beyond the foundation of the

(Ord. 010414, passed 1-4-2014; Am. Ord. 121918, passed 12-19-2018)
§ 94.44 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
94.07, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1, a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving, and the like undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in §§
94.40 through
94.47 have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community's more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse effect is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
fifteen-hundredths of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood
elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway
condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees), the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
(Ord. 010414, passed 1-4-2014; Am. Ord. 121918, passed 12-19-2018)
§ 94.45 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
94.40 through
94.47 have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of
any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.
(Ord. 010414, passed 1-4-2014; Am. Ord. 121918, passed 12-19-2018)
§ 94.46 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in §§
94.40 through
94.47 have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
94.40 through
94.47 have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not adversely affect
the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This
adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory
flood of at least fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by
comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that
under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.

PROJECT BACKGROUND
BACKGROUND
Several multi-use path projects have been completed within close proximity to
the Town of New Palestine. A multi-use path exists at the Sugar Creek Township
Park and the Town of Cumberland has constructed a multi-use path on the old
Pennsy railroad corridor from German Church Road to Mt. Comfort Road (CR S 600
W). The City of Greenfield has created a multi-use path on the old Pennsy
Corridor from CR S 150 W to CR S 400 E and efforts are underway to try and
connect the two communities via a path along the abandoned railroad corridor.
Wishing to capitalize on connections to these other regional trails and to
improve walking and biking opportunities within the Town Limits, the Town of
New Palestine has decided to complete a Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan. The
master plan will identify the best routes for making connections to
destinations within the Town as well as to residential neighborhoods. The plan
will include a conceptual network of on road bicycle facilities, sidewalks, and
multi-use trails. Recommendations will also be made on programs and policies
for the Town to implement that will help support walking and biking.
NEED FOR THE PLAN
In the United States of America, 30% of the population currently does not drive
a motor vehicle. This includes children, the elderly, those people that are
physically unable to drive, those that are financially unable to afford the
cost and maintenance of a vehicle, and an increasing population of those who
chose to use alternative transportation for its economic, environmental, and
health benefits.
Currently it is recommended that adults participate in moderate activity for
150 minutes a week. This translates to 30 minutes a day for 5 days a week. In
the State of Indiana, 30% of adults fall into the obese category and 16% of
teenagers are obese. This alarming fact is partly attributed to an increasingly
sedentary lifestyle. In 1969 the percentage of school children walking to
school was 48% and today that number is down to 13%. Getting more kids to walk
or bike to school could help lower this percentage and an added benefit is that
kids who walk or ride arrive ready to learn and more focused. This is also true
of workers who use alternative modes of transportation.
TARGET USERS
This plan is intended for pedestrians and bicyclists who either wish to or need
to make daily trips for goods and services within their community, and
recreational users looking to maintain or improve their health. Users that fall
into the category of needing to make trips by foot are the elderly who can no
longer drive, schoolchildren, those people that are unable to afford or
maintain a car and therefore need to find alternative means to make
connections. This plan is also for casual bike riders that may not be
comfortable riding among automobile or truck traffic. These types of riders
account for 60% of the bicycling population, and require improved
infrastructure or residential streets with low traffic and speed limits to make
connections within the community.
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
   1.   Increase the number of people that exercise daily by providing safe
walking and biking experiences for citizens of all ages and levels of ability.
   2.   Increase the number of people walking and bicycling for everyday
transportation purposes such as commuting to work, to school and running
errands.
   3.   Enhance community connections to neighborhoods, parks, schools,
library, businesses, retail and dining, and government facilities.
   4.   Increase the quality of life in the Town in an effort to retain current
citizens and attract new citizens.
   5.   Provide guidance and priorities for implementing infrastructure to
support walking and bicycling with a broad range of funding and support.
   6.   Provide program and policy recommendations that help support and
increase walking and biking in the community.
   7.   Provide community awareness of motorists and cyclists sharing the road
through public education.
   8.   Increase eco-tourism in the Town by attracting people that are looking
for recreational activities in the region.
   9.   Be ready for future funding opportunities when they present themselves.
   10.   Create regional connections to county facilities and surrounding
communities.
SCOPE OF THE PLAN
The plan studies within the entire town limits of New Palestine. The plan
investigates both on-road facilities as well as separated corridors that can be
improved to enhance the existing pedestrian and bike network. A master plan for
infrastructure improvements has been developed. Detailed cost estimates and
phasing are provided for each route. Priority corridors are identified.
Development Standards and possible funding opportunities are included for all
routes. Public input has been sought throughout the master plan.
Bicycle and walking programs and policies has been developed for the entire
community to help support the infrastructure plan. The programs and policies
concentrate on the areas of education, encouragement, enforcement, engineering,
and evaluation.

PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC INPUT
In an effort to gain as much input from the members of the community, there
were several meetings provided throughout the course of the plan development.
Additionally, a master plan website was created to provide information to the
public to provide information and to allow further input.
A Steering Committee was created consisting of several town staff members and
key members from the community. The Steering Committee's role was to guide the
plan and act as a sounding board for the Town. There were a series of 5
steering committee meetings held to review the major stages of the design and
planning process.
Three stakeholder meetings were held during the inventory and analysis stage of
the project. The groups were split into government stakeholders; private
organizations; and local retail, dining, and major employers.
During the inventory and analysis phase of the project, the city held a public
open house at the Town Hall to give as much opportunity for the public to
express its desires and needs for the project. The open house allowed for
citizens to come and go at their leisure and on their schedule. The public was
allowed to participate in the process by allowing attendees to place stickers
on a board designed to find out the bicycle and walking programs that they
would be interested in. Aerial maps were provided so the attendees could to
highlight the roadways they use to walk, run, or bike through their community,
and so they could identifying dangerous roadways and intersections from their
personal experience. Members of the consultant team and city staff were able to
interact with the public in "one-on-one" sessions.
There were two public presentations of the Lebanon Bicycle and Pedestrian
Master Plan. The first presentation was given on October 14, 2015 at the Town
Hall. This presentation was given while the plan was in a draft stage, and the
public was encouraged to provide feedback at the meeting. A comment sheet was
also provided to allow citizens time to digest the plan and send the comment
sheet back by the end of the comment period. The final presentation of the plan
was given at the Town Council Meeting on December 16, 2015.

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC SURVEY
As mentioned previously, the public survey for this master plan was
administered through the Town of New Palestine's website. The survey was
advertised through the newspaper, social media, and fliers handed out at
various public events. The survey consisted of 20 questions. In total, there
were approximately 410 responses. Below is a summary of some of the responses.
For a detailed breakdown of the responses, see Appendix x.
•   Top 3 goals identified by respondents:
   -   Enhance community connections to neighborhoods, parks, schools,
businesses, retail and dining, and governmental facilities.
   -   Increase the number of people who exercise daily by providing safe
walking and biking experiences for citizens of all ages and levels of ability.
   -   Improve the quality of life in the Town of New Palestine in an effort to
retain current citizens and attract new citizens.
•   The age group with the most responses were from both the 35 - 44 and 45 -
64 age groups.
•   Only 9% indicated they would use network to commute.
•   32% would use network for their daily routines, such as running errands.
•   33% would use in the winter. Fall was the most popular ranked season for
use.
•   43% of respondents do not bike on a regular basis. 54% would not use an on-
road bike facility, and would prefer a separated path.
•   Majority of respondents walk or jog 2 to 3 times a week. They walk between
1 - 10 miles in a week's time.
•   Only 3% of children currently walk or bike to school.
•   The most favorable time to use the network is weekday evenings after 5:00
PM.
•   Change of personal behavior for enhanced bike and pedestrian network:
   -   Only 5% of respondents would not change their behavior.
   -   75% would increase their walking and bicycling for wellness.
   -   55% would support public funding for improving bicycle and pedestrian
networks.
INVENTORY AND ANALYSIS
BIKEABILITY CONDITIONS
Many of New Palestine's residential streets have low volumes of vehicles and
low speeds. Therefore, there are already many on-road facilities that can be
safely used for bicycling by the citizens. However, these routes are disjointed
from one another and certain existing routes span the length of the community
are heavily traveled or have high speeds. Contributing to this lack of
connection is US 52 / Main Street, 600 W, Gem Road, and Bittner Road. US 52/
Main Street separates the community almost in half where retail and dining is
predominately located. Another major factor that limits bicycle travel is the
CSX Railroad. There are three at-grade railroad crossings at 600 W, Gem Road,
and Depot Street and one elevated crossing at Bittner Road.
The design team measured and created mid-block cross sections of the streets
along identified "desired" routes as part of the inventory process, and
analyzed them to visualize where opportunities were available to gain space for
bicycle facilities along roadways. The team looked at the existing lane widths
to understand if it narrowing the lanes would be appropriate and how much space
could be gained from that treatment. Opportunities and constraints were
recognized at each mid-block section based on apparent available right-of-way,
existing utilities, drainage structures, curb type, distance from street to
building, and utilization of on-street parking.
Measurements of the mid-block geometry of each route along with the average
daily traffic, speed limit, and percent of commercial traffic, were inserted
into a Bicycle Level of Service Calculator (BLOS). The BLOS is a nationally-
used measure of on-road bicycle level of comfort based upon a roadway's
geometry and traffic conditions. Its intent is to understand the comfort level
of a beginner to intermediate rider.
The Route Location Map indicates where measurements were taken for the cross
sections and the stretch of roadway that the measurements covered.
A map was created that reveals the existing BLOS conditions by color coding
those routes that are more suitable for casual riders and those that are
currently more appropriate for expert riders.
The following map illustrates the existing BLOS for the routes studied. A grade
of "A" through "B" indicates that the route is suitable for a casual rider. A
grade that equals high "C" indicates that the route is borderline suitable for
casual riders. A grade of "D" through "F" means that only expert riders would
feel comfortable riding the route in its present conditions and that an
improvement is needed.

WALKABILITY CONDITIONS
The core of New Palestine's downtown area is comprised of consistently sized,
relatively short blocks which lend themselves well to making pedestrian
connections. There are good pedestrian facilities within the residential
neighborhoods, but there is no connection between the different neighborhoods.
Aside from Main Street's beautiful streetscape and sidewalks, connecting into
downtown from the surrounding residential neighborhoods is hardly possible.
As mentioned previously in the Bikeability Conditions section, US 52 / Main
Street, 600 W, Gem Road, Bittner Road, and the CSX Railroad create barriers for
the community in utilizing alternative modes of transportation.
The team analyzed the same corridors for pedestrian level of service that were
analyzed for bikeability conditions to see if the corridor would support both
biking and walking. Corridors that currently had sidewalks on both side of the
streets were deemed as highly walkable, corridors or sections of corridors with
a sidewalk located only on one side were deemed borderline walkable, and
sections that had sidewalks on neither side of the road were considered not
walkable. Existing sidewalks were also evaluated based upon the condition of
the current sidewalk.
A map was then created that summarizes the existing Pedestrian Level of Service
(PLOS) conditions by color coding those sections that are more suitable for
walking and those that need improvement. Based upon the PLOS map it was
determined that most of the residential areas falls into the A and B level and
is considered on the high side of walkability. Sections that fell into the C
level are considered borderline walkable, and D-F levels are considered less
walkable or not walkable. The less walkable sections appeared to mostly be
located away from the core of the downtown, and along county roads.
The following map illustrates the existing PLOS for the study area.

FINAL PLAN
BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN FACILITY MASTER PLAN
The finalized bicycle and pedestrian facility master plan proposes to improve
11 corridors. Two different types of bicycle and pedestrian treatments are
proposed to strengthen the bicycle and pedestrian The plan will use shared
roadways and shard-use paths for this purpose.
Many of the existing neighborhood streets as discussed previously have low
traffic and low speeds. Many of them already have existing sidewalks except in
a few locations. Several key through streets were identified for connections to
county roads and downtown New Palestine. These routes employ a complete streets
method by using the existing pedestrian facilities and on road bicycle
facilities. Sharrows and signage are proposed along these routes to bring extra
added awareness of bicycle traffic. Where needed, sidewalks and trails were
proposed to make vital links.
Along county roads it was determined that the existing speed limit of the
roadways in conjunction with the amount of traffic did not make them safe for
bicycles to share the road. Bicycles would need to have their own space
separate from vehicles. Additionally, the county roads do no not have existing
pedestrian facilities along them. Based upon these facts, it was determined the
best facility to provide safety for both pedestrians and bicycles was a shared
use path.
Based upon comments from the public a recreational shared-use path was proposed
south of US 52 to make connections from the Town to the Sugar Creek Township
Park. A shared-use path along US 52 has been proposed to make connections to
the future county bicycle and pedestrian facilities along County Road 600 West,
the community grocery store, Lions Park, a community drug store, the library,
and other businesses.

TOTAL DISTANCE OF BICYCLE & PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES SUMMARY
Shared-Use Paths (Trail):         8.70 miles
Shared Roadways:            2.75 miles
Sidewalks:               1.10 miles
PRIORITY ROUTES
The following list and map represents the general recommendations on the order
that each facility should be installed within the community. The
recommendations are based upon knowledge of the community's priorities at the
initial design of the Master Plan. The steering committee should continue
meeting regularly in order to re-evaluate priorities based on construction
projects and other changes within the community.
In general, the cost of most shared roadways and bike lane routes can be
installed for much less than other types of facilities like a shared-use path
(trail). Some of these facilities could be installed by local forces.
The majority of the shared roadway routes in the master plan are not listed
below in the priority routes list. They will be included in the town's annual
budget, and the town will implement those routes under their supervision and
resources. These routes include: Lawrence Way, Cedar Creek Road, Cedar Creek
Lane, Stonehaven Lane, Kelly Drive, North Street, and Depot Street.

DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
BIKE FACILITY TYPES AND STANDARDS
See the Types of Bicycle Facilities section for those that are recommended as
part of this plan. As all long term plans are meant to be adaptable to new
information, this one should be reviewed at regular intervals to see if any
standards have changed. At the time this document was created there were
several guidelines that apply, including The 2012 American Association of State
Highway and Transportation Officials Guide for the Development of Bicycle
Facilities (AASHTO), and The National Association of City Transportation
Officials Urban Bikeway Design Guide (NACTO). It is recommended that these
guidelines as well as the standards outlined below be followed unless new
standards or information become available.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/2d7e5a689d04b22fce5b39e6237fbe55d0e7f984/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2166.jpg]
 
BIKE LANE WIDTH
Both NACTO and AASHTO recommend that the minimum width of a bike lane shall be
4 feet where there is a clear graded shoulder for recovery. The consultant team
would further recommend that the clear graded shoulder be at least 5 feet wide
before any drop off greater than 2 feet and that the closest vertical object be
at least 2 feet from the edge of the bike lane. A bike lane shall have a
minimum width of 4.5 feet next to a straight curb and only for short distances.
The standard width of bike lane should be 5 feet or wider where there is a curb
present and there is no on street parking. Where on street parking is adjacent
to the bike lane, then the width of the lane shall be 6 feet minimum to allow
for cars to open there doors into the bike lane without conflict. If possible,
where parking is adjacent to the bike lane, then a 7 feet lane should be
installed. Bike lanes shall be delineated from vehicular lanes by a solid white
6 inch stripe and between adjacent parking by a 4 inch solid white stripe.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2164.jpg]
 
BIKE LANE MARKING AND SIGNAGE
Bike lane markings shall consist of a bicycle symbol and an arrow placed
together in the center of the lane. MUTCD sign R3-17 will also be used in
conjunction with these markings.
The bicycle symbol shall be placed so that it is the first symbol to be seen
followed by the arrow. Bike lane markings and signage shall be placed at the
start of each bike lane, after an intersection, after a bike path crossing, and
after a major approach. Bike lane markings should be placed no more than a 1000
feet apart in rural sections and no more than 350 feet apart in urban sections.
Signs can be placed further apart in between intersections and can be placed
every other occurrence of placing the bike lane markings. See illustrations to
the left for more information on standard sizes. Signs should also be placed
warning users of a bike lane ending and when the bike lane continues on the
other side of an intersection with a supplemental "AHEAD" plaque. Bike lanes
are appropriate on roadway with speeds under 45 mph.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2162.jpg]
 
SHARED ROADWAY MARKING AND SIGNAGE
Markings shall consist of a bicycle symbol and chevrons placed together to
create a "Sharrow". Sharrows shall be placed in the center of the lane to
indicate where the bicyclist should ride. MUTCD signs W11-1 (Bike Symbol) with
W161P (Share the Road) will also be used in conjunction with these markings.
The bicycle symbol shall be placed so that it is the first symbol to be seen
followed by the chevrons. Bike lane markings and signage shall be placed at the
start of each shared roadway, after an intersection, after a bike path
crossing, and after a major approach. Markings should be placed no more than
250 feet apart on low volume roads and no more than 100 feet apart in urban
sections.
For wayfinding purposes, the orientation of the chevron in the sharrow symbol
marking may be adjusted to direct bicyclists along discontinuous routes.
Signs can be placed further apart in between intersections and can be placed
every other occurrence of placing the bike lane markings. Signs should also be
placed warning users of the shared roadway ending.
On roadways where vehicles and bikes share the same route, alternate signs
"W11-1" and "W16-1" with sign "R4-11." This will bring extra attention to the
vehicle that cyclist has the right to use the entire width of the travel lane.
Use sign "R4-11" to indicate where bikes merge into traffic when a designated
W16-1 bike lane comes to an end. See illustrations to the left for standards.
At non-signalized roadway intersections where a non bike and pedestrian route
crosses with a designated bike and pedestrian route, place the "2-Way Crossing"
sign at either side of that intersection. Additionally, place the "2-Way
Crossing" sign at the exit of commercial drives if it crosses with a shared-use
path.

SHARED ROADWAY ROUTES WITH MARKED AUTOMOBILE PARKING
Marking automobile parking along shared roadway routes has several safety
functions for bicyclists and pedestrians. For bicyclists it better defines the
travel lane for vehicles and reduces the perceived lane width even when parked
vehicles are not present. This has the effect of traffic calming on the route.
In areas where the parking is not heavily used, the parking area can be used as
a refuge for more inexperienced cyclists as long as they do not have to weave
in and out of the travel lane. For pedestrians it moves the travel way further
from the walking for end space and provides a greater level of comfort.
Parking spaces should be marked based upon the 2011 Indiana Manual for Uniform
Traffic Control Devices. The marked parallel parking space shall typically be 8
feet wide by 23 feet long. In certain circumstances on low volume roadways it
may be possible to reduce the width of the space to 7 feet. Each space shall be
denoted by two solid white transverse stripes 6 inches wide in the
configuration of a "T" or "tick" (see illustration).

IMAGES/0-0-0-2158.jpg]
 
CONFLICT ZONE MARKINGS
Vehicular crossings of bicycle facilities can happen at intersections and at
private drives or entrances. Care must be taken by both bike and vehicles to
watch out for one another in these transition zones. Marking these crossings to
bring attention to these conflict areas can be helpful. Several options are
available for marking these area:
   1.   An epoxy-modified, acrylic, waterborne coating has been successfully
used for bike lanes. There are several colors available and selection should be
based upon the color choice that provides the most contrast and matches with
the amenities/ color scheme selected along that particular route.
   2.   Cabot Deck Stain is another option that might be considered on a trial
basis. This coating has been used by the City of Portland, Oregon, to color
neighborhood road intersections with less than 2,500 V.D.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2156.jpg]
 
BICYCLE FRIENDLY CASTINGS
Bicycle friendly castings for drainage inlets are necessary where bicycle
facilities are present. It is important to make sure that a bicycle tire will
not fit into the grate opening and cause a bicycle user to be thrown from the
bike causing injury.
The gap between the drainage grate and its frame should be 1 inch or less.
Several casting types are available. The most versatile is the octagon style.

BICYCLE FACILITY AMENITIES:
BICYCLE PARKING
Bicycle Parking should follow the Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle
Professionals (APBP) Bicycle Parking Guidelines 2nd Edition. At a minimum
bicycle parking should offer a rack that supports the bicycle in at least two
spaces, allows locking the frame and at least one wheel with a "U-Lock",
resists rusting, resists cutting, resists bending, and is securely anchored to
the ground. An example of a rack meeting this criteria would be a "U-rack". The
rack should be coated with powder coating or thermoplastic to reduce
maintenance. Racks that only support the bike by the front wheel should not be
used.
Bicycle racks should be spaced a minimum of 36 inches apart from one another
when placed side by side and a minimum of 24 inches from the nearest
obstruction. Design should take into account that a bicycle is a minimum of 6
feet long.
Further considerations should be made for bicycle parking that is intended to
be for longer than 2 hours. Examples are areas where a considerable number of
people who use the parking for commuting. Bicycle parking that is intended for
longer than 2 hours should provide shelter or enclosure, be as close as
possible to building fronts and in a secure location with active surveillance.
It might even be wise to consider bicycle lockers or a supervised area.

SHARED-USE PATH TYPE
It is recommended that each shared-use path be a universally accessible multi-
use path. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials (AASHTO) Guide for the Development of Bicycle Facilities (2012) and
Chapter 51 of the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) Design Manual
defines a shared-use path as an off-road, two-way facility designed for use by
bicyclists, in-line skaters, wheelchair users, and pedestrians on exclusive
right-of-way with minimal cross flow by motor vehicles. This means that the
paths will have to be wide enough to accommodate two way travel for each type
of use. In order to allow accessibility to each use, the path's surface must be
adequate and slopes must follow guidelines developed by the US Access Board or
regulations from the US Department of Justice. At the time this document was
created there were several guidelines that apply: 1) Guidelines for Shared Use
Paths; 2) Guidelines for Outdoor Developed Areas; and 3) Guidelines for
Pedestrian Facilities in the Public Right-of-Ways. Although INDOT and AASHTO
regulations may not be required for all shared-use paths, it is recommended
that these guidelines be followed on all paths applications.

SHARED-USE WIDTH
AASHTO recommends a minimum width of 10 feet for shared-use paths, with 2 foot
wide graded shoulders on either side of the path. However, when a higher number
of users are anticipated, at least a 12 foot wide trail with shoulders should
be employed. This allows for two 6 foot wide lanes that will accommodate
several different types of users.
Therefore, the design team recommends using a 10 foot wide path (minimum) with
2 foot grass shoulders wherever possible. Only where absolutely necessary
should an 8 foot path with shoulders be implemented. This instance should only
happen when the shared-use path is considered a connector path (a path that
will have minimal traffic and isn't a through path) and/or when it is not
feasible to fit a larger width of path due to right-of-way or other
limitations.

SHARED-USE PATH SLOPE
It is important that the path cross slope provide positive drainage, but not
create a non-traversable slope for trail users or those in wheel chairs. For
this reason all cross slopes shall be no more than 2%. Trail shoulders create
recovery areas for bicycle users and should not have cross slopes greater than
4%.
Side slopes beyond the shoulders should not be greater than 4:1. Steeper slopes
are non-mowable and therefore create maintenance issues. Additionally, slopes
steeper than 3:1 within 5 feet of the trail's edge must be protected.
Longitudinal trail slope should be no greater than 5% in most circumstances.
The INDOT Design Manual gives more guidance on when it is permissible to exceed
this guideline and appropriate mitigation techniques.

SHARED-USE PATH SURFACE
The primary concern with path surfacing is accommodating a variety of path
users and providing accessibility. While crushed stone is less expensive to
construct and is more forgiving for runners and walkers, it does not
accommodate all users. It is non-traversable for in-line skaters and can be
difficult for people in wheel chairs because not all stone paths meet the
definition of firm and stable. Asphalt, on the other hand, can accommodate all
types of users, and even though initial construction costs are higher, it lasts
longer and requires less annual maintenance.
In order to preserve the asphalt, consideration should be given to using an oil
sealant right after construction. One popular product is a bio based/soy bean
product called replay. Regular treatment will help to keep the asphalt from
becoming dry and rigid which can lead to failure and cracking. See the Shared-
Use Path Maintenance Section for further recommendation.

SHARED-USE PATH SUPPORT FACILITIES:
Providing accessibility to all users at key locations throughout the town is
important to the success of each shared-use path. Along with accessibility,
users require that the path have certain facilities to meet the needs of its
use. These support facilities can be broken down into four categories: major
trailheads, shared use trail heads, minor trail heads, and community access
points. In addition to these public facilities, partnerships should be
developed between the community and local businesses to provide secure bicycle
parking and other path support facilities as a part of their building or
property. This will not only enhance their business but it will also enhance
the opportunities given to the path users.
MAJOR TRAILHEADS:
Major trailheads provide the greatest amount of amenities to path users and are
recognizable points of access. They are like mini-parks alongside the path that
may include parking areas, shelters, restrooms, drinking fountains, benches,
trash receptacles, picnic tables, bicycle racks, path signage, corridor access,
and landscaping.
Due to the scope and type of facilities normally required for a major
trailhead, it can be difficult to locate them within the narrow constraints of
a shared-use corridor. Typically it is necessary to find parcels of land
adjacent to the corridor for development. These can be city-owned, such as
parks or street right-of-way, or privately-owned properties that are created
and operated with the owner's cooperation. These usually require the
development of all new amenities for users' needs.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2140.jpg]
 
SHARED USE TRAILHEADS:
Shared use trailheads are similar to major trailheads except they share
amenities with other existing or potential uses. They are usually city owned
and in many cases need only to have their amenities slightly upgraded in order
to meet path users' needs. These trailheads may or may not have existing
shelters. This trailhead should be easily accessible from the path, and include
amenities such as trash receptacles, bicycle racks, and benches.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/2d7e5a689d04b22fce5b39e6237fbe55d0e7f984/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2138.jpg]
 
MINOR TRAILHEADS:
Minor trailheads are similar to major trailheads in that they provide amenities
to serve shared-use path users, but on a smaller scale. They usually occur more
frequently and can be situated within the trail right-of-way. Minor trailheads
are located between major trailheads and at certain path intersections. Minor
trailheads may provide benches, trash receptacles, bicycle racks, landscaping
and signage, but usually will not provide parking.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/2d7e5a689d04b22fce5b39e6237fbe55d0e7f984/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2136.jpg]
 
COMMUNITY ACCESS POINTS:
The last type of shared-use path support facility is the community access
point, which provides a minimal amount of amenities such as a trail directory
sign or wayfinding sign and a connector path. It is the most frequently
occurring type of support facility and provides citizens of adjacent
neighborhoods access to the path. Community access points simply provide an
informal and direct access between community and trail much like the driveway
connects to the street.
They are important in fostering a community's adoption of the path and getting
users to respect the rights of private property owners by establishing
designated points of access.
Locations of community access points should be determined in consultation with
adjacent landowners and through the selection of logical places to enter the
right-of-way from surrounding communities.
SHARED USE PATH - STREET INTERSECTION DESIGN:
Intersection design for shared use-paths should be based upon sound
"engineering judgment" at each intersection and each should be treated
individually as each has unique characteristics.
Uniformity in the use of traffic control devices is critical to encourage
proper and predictable behavior by shared-use path users. The Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) shall be followed for size, shape, color and
placement of signs on both the path and the street. In addition, coordination
with the City should ensure the proper design and layout of traffic control
devices necessary to warn vehicular traffic on public streets of path
crossings. The North American Cities and Towns Organization (NACTO) Urban
Bikeway Design Guide can also be consulted for unique situations.
All street crossings will occur as at-grade. Traffic will have the right-of-way
and path users, at most crossings, will have to stop.
The team devised three different types of street crossing treatments to deal
with the various at-grade crossings throughout the city. The following
treatments are minimum recommendations.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/2d7e5a689d04b22fce5b39e6237fbe55d0e7f984/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2134.jpg]
 
At-Grade Road Crossing - Level 1:
   •   Used on local roads with a maximum of two lanes. Speed limit should be
under 40 mph and a gap study should be done to assess user risk at the
crossing.
   •   Warning Signs of an upcoming intersection will be placed on the roadway
based upon MUTCD standards.
   •   No Motor Vehicles signs placed facing the street at all path
intersections.
   •   Stop sign along the path placed approximately 10 feet from the edge of
the street.
   •   Crosswalk pavement markings at crossing point.
   •   "Trail Xing" markings on the roadway.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/2d7e5a689d04b22fce5b39e6237fbe55d0e7f984/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2132.jpg]
 
At-Grade Road Crossing - Level 2:
   •   Should be considered on all roads with a maximum of two lanes and speed
limits over 40 mph or greater. A gap-study should be performed to assess user
risk at the crossing.
   •   All treatments of a Level 1 Road Crossing apply.
   •   In addition to Level 1 treatments, at a minimum it is recommended that
overhead flashers (or a rapid flashing beacon) with signage be used and that a
HAWK signal be used if warranted by traffic conditions. Rapid flashing beacons
should preferably be used in combination with a motion activated warning
signal. Flashers that are always on tend to be ignored or not noticed by
vehicular drivers because they do not necessarily indicate that a path user is
in the area.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2130.jpg]
 
At Grade Road Crossing - Level 3:
   •   Should be considered on all roads where there are more than two lanes of
travel to cross. A gap study should be performed to assess pedestrian risk.
   •   All treatments of a Level 2 Crossing apply.
   •   In addition to Level 2 treatments, median refuge areas are recommended
that allow path users to cross one direction of traffic at a time (additional
street right-of-way may be required).
   •    If, and ONLY IF, a refuge island isn't feasible, speed ta bles are a
secondary option.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2128.jpg]
 
Access of Shared-Use Path At Public Road Crossings:
A public road crossing provides an opportunity to bring identity and attention
to the path. It also should provide plenty of room for trail users to cross
without having conflicts with other users crossing in the opposing direction.
Restricting vehicular access without restricting maintenance vehicles can also
be a concern. The following is a list of options to consider based upon
available right-of-way.
   •   Option 1: Split entry with a 4 foot wide median. The plantings shall be
no taller than 6 inches. This will allow for easy flow of trail traffic, while
allowing maintenance vehicles access. See detail below.
   •   Option 2: Concrete node without a bollard or central median. This option
should be used if the area appears to be too narrow or there is not enough
right-of-way for a split entry, and the risk of motor vehicles entering the
path is low.
   •   Option 3: Concrete node with bollard. If the area appears to be too
narrow and it is believed that public vehicles might try to access the trail in
that area, a bollard should be added. The bollard should be easy to collapse or
remove and only used when absolutely necessary, as the bollard itself is an
obstacle for path users to negotiate around. See the Site Furnishings section
for bollard types.

RAILROAD/SHARED-USE PATH INTERSECTION DESIGN
Due to the speed of train travel, sight distance needed to stop a train, and
regulatory stipulations, it is recommended that proposed railroad crossings
occur at existing road crossings wherever possible. If an existing road
crossing is not available then a bridge or tunnel may have to be utilized.
Railroad crossings will follow the guidelines established in the Federal
Highway Administration's 'Railroad-Highway Grade Crossing Handbook - 2nd
Edition FHWA-TS-86-215', AASHTO, the MUTCD, and the requirements and
specifications of the individual railroad companies.
It is advised to abide by the following treatments as a minimum for railroad
crossings:
   •   A rubber panel crossing will be used with an asphalt approach.
   •   A railroad warning sign shall be placed a minimum of 115 feet from the
nearest rail.
   •   A Crossbuck sign will be placed 15 feet from the nearest rail and shall
have a sign denoting number of track crossings.
   •   Where there are existing gate arms, a new pedestrian gate shall be
placed if the path must go outside the post.
   •   A 24-inch stop bar will be placed approximately 15 feet from the nearest
rail.
   •   The shared-use path will have a minimum 45 degree skew from the center
line of the rail with 90 degrees being desirable.
   •   The path's pavement width will be widened to 14 feet.
   •   Railroad pavement markings will be placed adjacent to the rail warning
sign.

SHARED-USE PATH SIGNAGE
There are many different issues to consider in the design of signs for a
shared-use path. Signs along the system will need to serve a variety of
purposes, including: providing traffic control along the path, alerting users
to potential hazards, identifying path access points, providing historic
information, providing educational information, indicating path distance, and
providing orientation on the path and to surrounding communities.
Signs will need to be located so they are legible to path users and must be
constructed in methods and materials that are somewhat vandal resistant and
easy to maintain.
The need for different types of signs must be balanced with the idea of
creating a visually pleasing landscape in which to use the shared-use path. The
paths will feature a system of signage to clearly communicate a variety of
messages in a graphically consistent manner. The signage system is divided into
the following categories: Shared-Use Path Traffic Signs, Shared-Use Path
Identity Signs, Shared-Use Path Guidance and Interpretive Signs, and Mile
Markers.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/2d7e5a689d04b22fce5b39e6237fbe55d0e7f984/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2118.jpg]
 
Shared-Use Path Traffic Signs:
The shared-use path system will be a transportation corridor and, therefore,
must have recognizable transportation signs that follow MUTCD guidelines. The
shared-use path traffic signs will include regulatory and warning signs, such
as: STOP, YIELD, and TRAIL NARROWS signs.
The design of the shared-use path traffic signs should be consistent from path
to path Signs can have graphic information on one or both sides, reducing the
overall number of signs needed. Signs should be placed 3 feet from the path's
edge and be mounted at a height of 5 feet.
If the shared-use path is parallel with a roadway, "Yield To Trail Users"
signage should be placed to warn motorists when turning that pedestrians and
bicyclists may be crossing the roadway or drive intersection. This provides
added safety for both the motorist and pedestrian.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/2d7e5a689d04b22fce5b39e6237fbe55d0e7f984/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2116.jpg]
 
Shared-Use Path Identity Signs:
The shared-use path system will have numerous points of access. It is important
that these points of entry be identified for the public in an appropriate and
consistent manner. The shared-use path identity sign is intended to serve two
functions: identify the main entry points to the path, and establish for the
public a consistent and lasting identity for the path. By selecting a
consistent treatment for each path it will help the user to know which route
they are currently on. Each sign should be designed to incorporate a unique
feature of each path. The city park's logo should be incorporated into each
sign and the identity sign should follow the same color scheme as the route it
is representing. The identity sign should be 9 feet to the bottom of the sign,
minimum, to provide visibility and clearance. The signs should be visible by
the public at the shared-use path and street intersections and at other
significant access points.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/2d7e5a689d04b22fce5b39e6237fbe55d0e7f984/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2114.jpg]
 
Shared-Use Path Guidance & Interpretive Signs:
Along the path, there should be several different types of signs that provide
the user with guidance information such as points of interest, path support
facilities, and orientation.
Shared-use path guidance signs can be placed into two different categories. One
type would be a directory sign which would show the path users how they can
reach key destination points within the entire community. This sign would give
an overall view of the entire shared-use path system and would need to be 30" x
42" in size to show enough detail. There should be a consistent layout for all
these signs so they match and give a cohesive design throughout the system.
Directory signs would typically be placed at major trailheads or key path
access points.
The second type of guidance sign is a wayfinding sign. This type of sign is a
map indicating amenities that are within close proximity to your current
location on the path. These signs should be located at intersecting routes. A
wayfinding sign should be no larger than 24" x 36", but at a scale that shows
much more detail than the directory signs. The image located at the top of the
next page represents an example of this type of sign.
Interpretive signs are another type of sign that provide educational
information to path users and enhance their experience. These signs help to
convey the historical, cultural, or ecological significance of certain points
along the path. Examples would be the importance of protecting wetlands or
water bodies, geological formations unique to the area, or a historically
significant feature within the community.
With all these functions, the materials that the signs are made of must be
flexible enough to incorporate a variety of graphic information and, yet, be
consistent in appearance and presentation. It is recommended that a high
pressure laminate be used for the directory, wayfinding, and interpretive
signs. High pressure laminates provide high quality graphics and longevity at a
reasonable price. A ½ inch thick sign should be employed to avoid the use of a
frame. A high pressure laminate sign has a very clean print, has a low
replacement cost, and resists shattering, and typically has a warranty period
of 10 years. The interpretive signs and guidance signs should be mostly
conveyed graphically, with minimal text and at a size that is at a comfortable
height.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2112.jpg]
 
Mile Markers:
Mile markers provide orientation for the path users and emergency personnel as
well as traveled distance along the path. Distance should be marked in quarter-
mile intervals or less by transverse pavement markings placed directly on top
of the path. Information included on the markers should be distance in miles
and each trails logo. The top mile marker image to the right shows a type that
is easily readable and reduces conflicts during routine maintenance such as
mowing.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2110.jpg]
 
SITE FURNISHINGS
In addition to signage, the design of the shared-use path system will include
site furnishings to accommodate the needs of the path users along the length of
the entire route. Amenities such as benches, informal seating areas, trash
receptacles, bicycle racks, and bollards will be clustered together at major,
minor, and shared-use trailheads.
Locations of amenities along paths will depend on the characteristics of each
path segment and should be addressed on a case by case situation. The purpose
of most shared-use paths is to move people between various locations and for
recreation. As such people are less likely to stop in between access points.
Benches generally should be located at overlook points along paths where
appropriate and where enough right-of-way exists. Paths located in sections of
the city where there is a more elderly population or where there might be a
need for people to stop more frequently may require benches to be placed in
between access points. Paths located near hospitals may need to have benches
placed more frequently if the hospital plans to use the route for
rehabilitation programs.
Along with path signage, site furniture will be among the most frequently
utilized elements along the path, setting the tone for the overall image of the
path system in the minds of the users. It is important that design standards
for the paths' site furnishings be established to ensure overall consistency of
design and path image. The colors should be consistent with the route color
scheme that the furnishing is located along. Along with consistency of color, a
consistent style of furnishings needs to be established and followed as paths
begin to be constructed. Establishing a color and style to use throughout the
path it will minimize the amount of cost for the City because replacement parts
can be stockpiled for one style of bench instead of five styles. See the
following product information for consistency in site furnishings.
For federally funded projects it will be important to use the information in
this document to complete the proprietary selection form.
Benches:
   •   Minimum of 6 feet long.
   •   Color and style should match other amenities along the trail for a
cohesive look.
   •   Arm rests should be provided to help those that are more physically
challenged.
   •   A backrest should be provided to help those that are more physically
challenged.
   •   Powder or plastisol coating should be applied to reduce maintenance.
   •   Option: Center Arm can be provided to keep people from sleeping on the
bench.
   •   The bench must have a firm and stable pad underneath it and provide a 3
foot wide area for a wheelchair to sit next to it.

bag.
   •   A liner helps to reduce leaking of refuse on to surrounding surfaces.
   •   The receptacle must have a firm and stable access path to it.

SHARED-USE PATH LANDSCAPING
The shared-use path system, due to its overall length and diverse scenery, may
require more landscaping in urban areas and less in rural areas. The presence
of mature vegetative cover not only adds to the natural beauty of the path
experience, but also minimizes the amount of new landscaping necessary to
improve the appearance of the path system and screening of the path from
undesirable views and adverse adjacent path conditions.
In areas along the path where the appearance warrants improvement and no
existing vegetation is present, plantings of trees, shrubs and ground cover
should be considered to create a linear park effect alongside the route. New
plantings should also be used to identify and improve "entrances" to parks
(trail access points) and street crossings.
In addition, plantings should be used to screen certain land uses adjacent to
the corridor (such as business service areas and industrial sites) and to
separate the path from other improvements within the right-of-way (such as
parking lots). Native plant material should be used where possible in an effort
to keep landscape maintenance to a minimum and to maximize the ecological
benefits of the plantings.

SHARED-USE PATH LIGHTING
The system is intended for use during daylight hours only; therefore it is not
anticipated that the shared-use paths will need trail lighting. However, the
installation of security lighting at trailheads, road crossings, bridges, and
other activity areas should be considered if conditions warrant. Should
conditions deem lighting to be necessary, there should be a standard lighting
choice throughout all of the system.

SHARED-USE PATH MAINTENANCE ISSUES AND SAFETY
Maintenance costs are expected to be a minimum for the first 5-10 years. Costs
will vary depending on the amount of paths needing to be maintained and the
location of the paths. On a typical milelong trail, maintenance could cost
approximately $3,000 per year. Long term maintenance costs could consist of
repairing any asphalt damage. Over 20 years it could be anticipated to spend
approximately $10,000 to $20,000 on asphalt repair. The city or parks
department should have a general maintenance fund set aside for this. Below is
a list of general system maintenance items to keep in mind during the upkeep of
the shared-use paths:
   •   Treat any wooden railing at least every 5 years to keep from rotting.
   •   Properly prune trees above trails and shoulders to maintain 12 feet of
vertical clearance.
   •   Properly prune trees and shrubs to maintain at least 5 feet of
horizontal clearance from trail pavement edge. Use horticultural accepted
pruning techniques and do not "top" trees (do not cut mid branch). Improper
pruning can put stress on trees and cause more harm to the public in the long
run.
   •   Properly prune any dead limbs out of trees to protect trail users.
Remove any existing trees within close proximity that may die over time to
protect trail users.
   •   Perform routine maintenance: mowing, clearing, trimming, vandalism
repair, and litter control.
   •   Edge pavement or shoulder periodically to prevent roots/ vegetation from
compromising pavement.
   •   Seal cracks in pavement every 2 years to prevent debris build up, water
from entering base, and continued deterioration. Rubberized sealant is
recommended.
   •   Consider using a seal coat every 4 years to arrest deterioration,
prevent water filtration, restore oils to upper surface, and prevent loss of
fines.
Path maintenance costs could be reduced by utilizing local volunteers and other
programs for simple tasks like litter removal and storm clean-up. A full time
employee could be the designated volunteer coordinator and help manage
resources and efforts. The Cardinal Greenway is a good example of where a
volunteer system has been used to reduce maintenance costs and would be a good
resource for how to make one successful. Also, youth scouting organizations,
community corrections programs, community service programs, and youth programs
could be utilized to do these tasks. More stringent repairs, like sealing
asphalt and repairing cracks should still be handled with city forces or a
contractor.
Another area where volunteers can help reduce cost is through regular patrols
of the shared-use path systems. Since many path users will use the system daily
for recreational or commuting needs, they can monitor any unwanted behavior
simultaneously. Their responsibility would not be to address any unwanted
behavior, but rather report it immediately to the proper authorities. In this
way, the program can help to reduce the number of law enforcement officers that
would need to be dedicated to the trail system and the need to install call
boxes along the trails. Examples for places to find local volunteers would be
local bicycle clubs, avid cyclists, alternative transportation advocates, etc.

ACCESSIBILITY
As mentioned previously, all new path construction must follow guidelines
developed by the US Access Board or regulations from the US Department of
Justice. At the time this document was created there were several guidelines
that applied: 1) Guidelines for Shared Use Paths; 2) Guidelines for Outdoor
Developed Areas; and 3) Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities in the Public
Right-of-Ways.
Some of these accessibility standards have already been addressed in other
sections of the design guidelines, but there are a few others to consider:
   •   Ramps - See Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities in the Public Right-of-
Ways.
   •   Detectable warnings - See ADA Chapter 7: Communication Elements and
Features, Section 705 and Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities in the Public
Right-of-Ways.
   •   Push buttons (activation)/signalization standards - See Guidelines for
Pedestrian Facilities in the Public Right-of-Ways.
   •   Site amenities - See Accessibility Guidelines for Outdoor Developed
Areas.

PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES
The downtown walking area already has a high level of pedestrian service. There
are several design treatments that were proposed as part of the final
pedestrian plan. All elements installed should follow the guidelines as
outlined in the AASHTO Guide for the Planning, Design, and Operations of
Pedestrian Facilities. Below are some treatments that would help support the
existing sidewalk network.
   1.   Crosswalks shall have "piano bar" striping to provide more visibility.
   2.   Intersection Treatments.
      a.   Install refuge islands where the width of the lanes to be crossed is
greater than 75 feet or a pedestrian walking at 2.5 feet/second cannot
completely cross the street during a signalized walk cycle.
      b.   Consider bump outs at intersections where on-street parking is
present to lessen the crossing distance.
      c.   Mid-block crossings should consider Hawk signalization.
   3.   Street trees should be planted a maximum of 40 feet apart. Street trees
should have the following characteristics.
      a.   Non-invasive varieties.
      b.   Vase shaped as to not impede pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
      c.   Maximum height of 40 feet.
      d.   Maximum width of 20-25 feet.
   4.   Tree grates should be considered to give street trees a maximum root
zone, while not impeding the pedestrian walking area. This will help to cut
down on tree roots heaving the existing walks as well.
   5.   Install a downtown pedestrian support facility including the following:
      a.   Benches for resting.
      b.   Trash receptacles.
      c.   Trees for shade.
      d.   Pedestrian directory signs.
      e.   Drinking fountain.
      f.   Pet waste disposal.
      g.   Bike racks.
      h.   Public art.
   6.   Countdown crosswalk signals with auditory warning.
   7.   More trash receptacles.
   8.   More benches for resting.
      a.   Benches should have arm rests and back rests to help those people
that are more physically challenged.
PROGRAMS AND POLICIES
BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN PROGRAMS
Moving New Palestine into a bicycle and pedestrian friendly community will need
to be supported through programs and policies. Programs will be used to support
and continue efforts in making the town safe for all non-motorized modes of
transportation. As stated before, The League of American Bicyclists has
developed a 5 E's program which they use as the foundation for labeling a city
or town as a Bicycle Friendly Community. This plan will further use the 5 E's
program to promote pedestrian walking routes throughout the community with
programs and policies.
EDUCATION
As defined by the League of American Bicyclists, education is the amount of
information available for bicyclists, motorists and pedestrians to allow for
safe routing along all defined pathways.
New Palestine should implement that develop a variety of educational programs
which teach young and old about safety, proper bicycling techniques on the
road, bicycle maintenance, rules of the road and responsibilities. The
following chart, developed from committee meetings, stakeholders meetings and
public meetings, gives suggestions for new education programs to be implemented
within the Town of New Palestine.

ENCOURAGEMENT
The community should promote and encourage bicycling, walking and running
within the Town of New Palestine. The community should consider participation
in national events, such as, Bike to Work Month, and set up their own
promotional events to encourage residents and visitors to bike and walk within
New Palestine. The community should also provide the tools to promote awareness
for bike riding, walking and running. Placing routing maps, proper way finding
signage, bike lock-up areas and restrooms around the community will help create
a bike friendly and walkable town.
New Palestine needs to develop a variety of promotional events to encourage
bicycling, walking and running throughout the community. Additionally, the
community will need to create spaces, places and signage to help promote and
portray their dedication to biking and walking throughout the area. The
following chart, developed from committee meetings, stakeholders meetings and
public meetings, gives suggestions for new promotional programs to be
implemented within the Town of New Palestine.

ENFORCEMENT
New Palestine will need to address bicycling as it relates to law enforcement.
Similar to vehicles on the road, police need to be aware of proper procedures
for upholding the law when it comes to bicycles navigating the streets. Law
enforcement officers will need to protect motorists and bicyclists as they
travel together along the same pathway. New Palestine will need to evaluate how
they protect bicyclists, pedestrians and motorists by adding to their current
curriculum; new bike police, new share the road laws and a way to distribute
penalties for violators.
New programs, laws and policy may need to be implemented as bicycle traffic
increases in New Palestine. This will be an important addition to the town as
it creates a safe place for pedestrians, bicyclists and motorists to
intermingle. The following chart, developed from committee meetings,
stakeholders meetings and public meetings, gives suggestions for new
enforcement programs to be implemented within the Town of Palestine.

ENGINEERING
This will be the most direct way to create a bicycle and pedestrian friendly
community. Providing the actual built environment so bicyclists and pedestrians
can use roadways and walkways will enable the public to reach the main
destination points around the community. Additionally, the town should provide
facilities at main destination points for riders, walkers and runners. These
facilities provide security, rest stops, way finding and support for those
riding, running and walking within the area.
Implementing the suggested routes and facilities proposed by this plan will be
the next step in becoming a bicycle and pedestrian friendly community. The
following chart, developed from committee meetings, stakeholders meetings and
public meetings, gives suggestions for new routes and facilities to be
implemented within the Town of New Palestine.

EVALUATION
Planning for the future is very important in creating a bicycle and pedestrian
friendly community.
In order to keep up with current trends and expand the Town's bicycle and
sidewalk network, New Palestine must evaluate existing programs and policies
for future development. Gathering statistical data on crashes, finding current
ridership counts, and updating the location of existing sidewalks should be
performed on a yearly basis to increase the current infrastructure network. The
bicycle and pedestrian comprehensive plan must be updated as more sidewalks and
bike routes are added.
Development and adoption of the New Palestine Bicycle and Pedestrian Master
Plan be the first step in evaluating the current conditions of the Town.
Implementation of the Plan will enable New Palestine to incorporate recommended
policies, programs and infrastructure into future improvements, creating a
pedestrian and bicycle network. The following chart, developed from committee
meetings, stakeholders meetings and public meetings, gives further suggestions
for new evaluation programs to be implemented within the Town of New Palestine.

FUNDING SOURCES
There are various sources of funding available for the design, development and
construction of bicycle facilities and pedestrian projects. The following is a
summary of some of the most often utilized sources.
TRANSPORTATION ALTERNATIVES PROGRAM (TAP)
The current federal highway bill, Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st
Century, or MAP-21, is a two year bill that will provide transportation funding
from October 1, 2012, through September 30, 2014. MAP-21 combines several
previous biking and pedestrian programs into one program known as the
Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP). TAP includes the Recreational Trails
Program (RTP), Transportation Alternatives (TA) activities (many of the
projects and programs that were included in the former Transportation
Enhancement [TE] program), and Safe Routes to School (SRTS). The following
discussion is related to all of these programs. Information specific to each
program is addressed in later sections.
If the State does not opt out of the RTP funding, the RTP funds are set aside,
and the remaining TAP funds are divided equally into two categories. The first
half is sub-allocated based on population, in which INDOT will distribute half
of the TAP funds to communities according to their share of population within
the state. These population categories are as follows:
   •   MPOs with populations greater than 200,000: INDOT will sub-allocate
funds to Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs). MPOs will distribute their
funds through their own competitive application process.
   •   Other urbanized and rural areas: MAP-21 allows state DOT's to hold a
competitive application process for communities to compete for these funds.
INDOT is currently developing their process, including the possibility of sub-
allocating to smaller MPOs.
The second half of the remaining TAP funds will be distributed state-wide by a
competitive application process through INDOT, where population is not
considered. Eligible entities include local governments, school districts,
tribal governments, and public lands agencies. In MAP-21, the State has the
ability to transfer funds both into and out of TAP for other transportation
programs.
Federal TAP funds provide 80% of the costs for preliminary engineering (survey,
design, and construction documents), right-of-way (engineering, management,
acquisition), construction, and construction supervision. The local agency is
required to provide the matching 20%. The local match for TA funds can be
obtained from various sources, such as budget appropriations, cash donations,
right-of-way donations, and other grant sources, provided the other grant
programs allow their funds to be used as a match for MAP-21 funds. Currently,
Indiana has received approximately $21 million for funding the TAP program.
Approximately $1 million is taken off the top and distributed to Recreational
Trails Program, and the other $20 million is distributed to Transportation
Alternatives and Safe Routes to School.
RECREATIONAL TRAILS PROGRAM (RTP)
As part of TAP, funding for the Recreational Trails Program (RTP) is set aside
as a separate program. Each state has the option to "opt out" of the RTP. For
2014, the Governor has opted in, and will continue the RTP in Indiana.
This program is a federal financial assistance program administered through
IDNR. It provides grants for 80% of the cost of land acquisition and/or
development of multi-use recreational trail projects. Both motorized and non-
motorized projects are eligible. The program is administered at the federal
level by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), but is operated at the
state level by IDNR. Previously provided funds for individual projects have
ranged from $10,000 to $150,000. Currently, Indiana has received approximately
$1 million for RTP funding. All units of government and not-for-profit
organizations with 501(c)(3) tax exempt status are eligible to participate.
Applications are typically available in February and due back to IDNR by May 1
of each year.

TRANSPORTATION ALTERNATIVES (TA)
Under MAP-21, eligible activities included in the former Transportation
Enhancement (TE) program are now referred to as Transportation Alternatives
(TA) activities, and are included in TAP funding that remains after RTP funds
are set aside. Although some former TE eligible activities are not included in
TA, the activities most closely related to the development of trails,
greenways, and bike/pedestrian facilities are still eligible. These activities
include: on-road and off-road facilities for pedestrians, bicyclists, and other
non-motorized forms of transportation; developing safe routes for non-drivers;
conversion of abandoned railroad corridors for trails; and, historic
preservation and rehabilitation of historic transportation facilities.
At this time, the new federal guidelines for the implementation and use of TA
funds are being reviewed. The details for the State's program and process for
acquiring and using the funds is being developed. In recent years,
approximately $16 million to $20 million in TE funds were available annually in
Indiana. At this time, Indiana has received approximately $20 million to be
split between TA and Safe Routes to School. The process for applying for the
funds and the funding cycle has not yet been determined.

SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL (SRTS)
The Indiana Safe Routes to School (SRTS) program is based on the federal
programs designed to make walking and bicycling to school safe, more
convenient, and routine, providing a true option for school travel. Growing
areas of emphasis of the program are the physical activity, environmental, and
social benefits of walking and biking. INDOT is responsible for administering
SRTS as part of the TAP. Both infrastructure projects and non-infrastructure
projects, such as encouragement, education, and enforcement, are eligible.
Kindergarten through 8th grade is the primary focus and these projects should
help improve access for children with physical disabilities.
The funding for SRTS is part of the TAP funds that remain after the RTP funds
are set aside. In the past, the maximum infrastructure improvement project
award was $250,000. At this time, Indiana has received approximately $20
million to be split between TA and SRTS. The process for applying for the funds
and the funding cycle has not yet been determined.

STELLAR COMMUNITIES PROGRAM
The Stellar Communities program is a multi-agency partnership designed to fund
comprehensive community development projects in Indiana's smaller communities.
The Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority, Indiana Office of
Community and Rural Affairs, and Indiana Department of Transportation are
participating in this innovative program.
A call for a letters of interest is made through an announcement to Indiana
communities. Each community then submits a letter of interest. The state team
chooses finalist communities from the letters of interest. Finalist communities
are then asked to put together a strategic investment plan. Once a community
becomes a "Designated Community", they are elevated to a status of non-
competitive funding for a 3-year cycle. It also means that the community will
not be able to receive funds through other regular agency programs.
Currently there are 6 pilot communities in the Stellar Communities program.
Since 2010 over 60 Hoosier communities have expressed interest in the program
and 21 strategic investment plans have been created. For more information
visit: http://www.in.gov/ocra/2601.htm or contact your Office of Community and
Rural Affairs Community Liaison.
SURFACE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM (STP) & HIGHWAY SAFETY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
(HSIP)
The Surface Transportation Program (STP) provides funding that may be used by
States and localities for projects to preserve and improve the conditions and
performance on Federal-aid projects. Eligible projects include highway, bridge
and tunnel projects on any public road, pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure,
and transit capital projects, including intercity bus terminals. Therefore, any
pedestrian or bicycle facility that has been previously funded by federal-aid
can use this funding to "preserve and improve the conditions and performance."
Eligible activities that relate to bicycle and pedestrian projects are as
follows: fringe and corridor parking facilities and programs, bicycle
transportation and pedestrian walkways, ADA sidewalk modifications;
transportation alternatives; and recreational trails projects.
Similarly, under MAP-21 there appear to be opportunities for bicycle and
pedestrian facilities funding in the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP).
Traffic and accident data would need to support the development of bicycle and
pedestrian facilities as a means to improve overall safety.

TAX INCREMENT FINANCING (TIF)
Tax Increment Financing(TIF) is a way of subsidizing redevelopment,
infrastructure, or other community improvement projects. Future gains in taxes
from the completion of a community improvement project are dedicated within a
certain defined district to finance the debt that is issued or money that is
borrowed to pay for the project. Gains can come from the projected increase of
surrounding real estate as a result from the project, which generates
additional tax revenue. Tax revenue increases can also come from increased
sales-tax and the addition of more jobs within the community as a result of the
project. Defined districts are usually areas of distressed, underdeveloped, or
underutilized parts of the community that might not otherwise see development
and that would benefit from the completion of a the project.
LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND (LWCF)
Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is a federal financial assistance
program administered through IDNR. It provides matching grants for 50% of the
cost of land acquisition and/or development of outdoor recreation sites and
facilities. Funds for this program come primarily from federal off-shore oil
lease receipts. The program is administered at the federal level by the
National Parks Service (NPS), but is operated at the state level by IDNR.
Individual projects typically receive $10,000 to $200,000 in funds. Only
legally established park boards with an approved 5-year Park and Recreation
Master Plan are eligible to participate. Applications are available on or after
March 1 and are required to be submitted or post-marked by June 1 of each year.

PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS
There are a number of foundations and trust funds which support the planning
and development of trails and greenways, in the interest of conservation,
preservation, and outdoor recreation. Although many of them fund only nonprofit
organizations, some will assist local public agencies. A few of these
organizations include:
   1.   Kodak American Greenways Awards through the Conservation Fund
      www.conservationfund.org/?article=2106
   2.   Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust
      http://www.ninapulliamtrust.org/index.php/grant-information/
   3.   Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Active Living by Design program
      http://www.activelivingbydesign.org/what-we-do/albd-grant-program
CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP
In addition to the federal and private foundation options, corporate
sponsorship presents another opportunity for funding. As trails and roadways
are developed, especially in close proximity to businesses or industries, there
are opportunities for corporations to sponsor trails. Sponsorships can be
direct financial support of construction activities for trails, trailheads,
specific trail or trailhead amenities, or even trail maintenance. The donation
of land for the development of trails is also an excellent method of corporate
support that can become a sponsorship opportunity. Sponsorship often includes
granting naming rights to the sponsor for the items or areas that were financed
or donated. Contacting adjacent or area corporations should be considered for
these types of sponsorships.
LOCAL BUSINESSES AND ORGANIZATIONS
Corporations and organizations within the community are often willing to help
with projects that attract employees and residents to the community through
bettering the amenities available. The municipality should continue to identify
organizations within the community that would be willing to help with some of
the smaller projects or possibly provide match money for the larger projects.
