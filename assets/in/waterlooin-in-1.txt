SERVICE ANIMALS
§ 37.60 SERVICE ANIMALS.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of this policy is to ensure that the rights of
individuals who use service animals to assist with disabilities are protected
in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
      (2)   The ADA requires state and local government agencies, businesses,
and non-profit organizations that provide goods or services to the public to
make "reasonable modifications" in their policies, practices, or procedures
when necessary to accommodate people with disabilities. This includes service
animals. Accordingly, entities that have a "no pets" policy generally must
modify that policy to allow service animals into their facilities.
   (B)   Requirements of the ADA.
      (1)   Service animal. Under the ADA, a service animal is defined as a dog
that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for an
individual with a disability. A service dog can be of any breed.
      (2)   Meaning of "do work or perform tasks”: The task(s) performed by the
dog must be directly related to the person's disability, and the dog must be
trained to take a specific action when needed to assist the person with a
disability. The following examples illustrate types of service dogs, but there
are many others:
         (a)   A person with diabetes may have a dog that is trained to alert
her when her blood sugar reaches high or low levels.
         (b)   A person with depression may have a dog that is trained to
remind her to take her medication.
         (c)   A person who has anxiety may have a dog that is trained to take
a specific action to avoid the attack or lessen its impact.
         (d)   A person who has epilepsy may have a dog that is trained to
detect the onset of a seizure and then help the person remain safe during the
seizure.
      (3)   Emotional support, therapy, comfort, or companion animals are not
considered service animals under the ADA. These terms are used to describe
animals that provide comfort just by being with a person. Because they are not
trained to perform specific tasks or jobs, they do not qualify as service
animals under the ADA.
      (4)   The ADA does not require service animals to be professionally
trained. People with disabilities have the right to train the dog themselves
and are not required to use a professional service dog training program.
      (5)   The ADA does not require that service animals have some kind of
certification. Covered entities may not require documentation, such as proof
that the animal has been certified, trained, or licensed as a service animal as
a condition for entry.

one year shall be capitalized and depreciated.
      (2)   All assets must have a total cost exceeding $10,000 to be
capitalized. Capital assets should be recorded at actual cost. The cost
recorded is the purchase price or construction costs of the asset, but also
includes any other reasonable and necessary costs incurred to place the asset
in its intended location and intended use. Donated or contributed assets should
be recorded at their fair market value on the date donated or acquired plus any
associated costs. Purchases made using federal or state funding will follow the
source funding policies and any procedures included in this subchapter.
   CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS. Where construction work has not been completed in

   (A)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly owned
treatment works that will interfere with its operation;
   (B)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly owned
treatment works that will pass through the publicly owned treatment works,
inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be incompatible with
the publicly owned treatment works;
   (C)   To protect both publicly owned treatment works personnel who may be
affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the
general public;
   (D)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge
from the publicly owned treatment works;
   (E)   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance, and improvement of the publicly owned treatment works;
and
   (F)   To enable the town to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and
any other Federal or State laws to which the publicly owned treatment works is
subject.
   (G)   This chapter shall apply to all users of the publicly owned treatment
works. This chapter authorizes the issuance of individual wastewater discharge
permits; provides for monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities;
establishes administrative review procedures; requires user reporting; and
provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs
resulting from the program established herein.

prohibited or regulated materials or substances. Where necessary, procedures
and facilities to prevent the accidental discharge of prohibited materials must
be provided and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing
facilities and operating procedures to provide the protection must be submitted
to the town for review and be approved before construction of the facility.
Review and approval of plans and operating procedures by the town will not
relieve the user from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to
meet applicable requirements.
   (B)   Users must notify the town immediately when a slug load or accidental
discharge occurs. The notification must include the location of the discharge,
date and time of occurrence, type of waste, concentration and volume, and
corrective actions. Any industrial user who discharges a slug load of
prohibited materials will be charged a Slug Load/Accidental Discharge Fee per
the Town of Waterloo's Fee Schedule and be liable for any expense, including
any cleaning, loss or damage to the sewerage system, in addition to the amount
of any fines imposed under state or federal law.
   (C)   Signs must be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the user's
premises, advising employees whom to call in the event of an accidental

(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19; Am. Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.304 DISCHARGE APPROVAL PROCESS.
   (A)   Significant industrial users are required to obtain discharge approval
from the state prior to discharge to the sewerage system per federal or state
rules and regulations. Information provided to the state shall also be provided
to the town.
   (B)   Industrial users are required to obtain discharge approval from the
town if any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged,
to the public sewers, that contain pollutants or the characteristics enumerated
in §§
51.204 and
51.205 of this chapter.
      (1)   Existing connections. Within 60 days of approval of this chapter,
any industrial user required to obtain wastewater discharge approval who wishes
to continue wastewater discharges in the future, shall apply to the town for
discharge approval.
      (2)   New connections. Any user required to obtain wastewater discharge
approval from the town who proposes to begin or recommence discharging into the
sewerage system must obtain such approval prior to the beginning or
recommencing of such discharge. The wastewater discharge approval process must
be completed at least 60 days prior to the date upon which any discharge will
begin or recommence.
   (C)   When required by the town, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastewaters shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastewaters. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessible and safely
located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
town. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his or her expense and
shall be maintained by him or her to be safe and accessible at all times. Plans
for the installation of control manholes and related equipment must be approved
by the town before construction is begun.
   (D)   Information provided to the town for discharge approval shall include:
construction or building plans including all sewerage system connections,
description of activities at the facility, a narrative description of any
pretreatment of wastewaters, description of industrial wastewaters produced,
characterization of wastewaters, and detailed plans of any pretreatment system.
The town may require additional information or equipment.
   (E)   Upon review of the provided materials, the town may:
      (1)   Approve the discharge without further monitoring or surcharges;
      (2)   Require a site inspection to identify sources of wastewater;
      (3)   Reject the wastewaters in whole or in part for any reason deemed
appropriate by the town;
      (4)   Require pretreatment of such wastewaters to within the limits of
normal domestic sewage as defined;
      (5)   Require control or flow equalization of such wastewaters to avoid
any "slug" loads or excessive loads that may be harmful to the sewerage system;
or
      (6)   Require payment of a surcharge on any excessive flows or loadings
discharged to the sewerage system to cover the additional costs of having
capacity for and treating such wastewaters.
   (F)   Once the industrial user is approved by the town, the industrial user
is to follow all sections of this chapter. The town will issue a letter to the
user stating discharge is approved within 30 days of receiving the submittal
and identify any requirements for: flow-equalizing facilities, pretreatment
equipment, grease interceptors, sampling, sampling point, reporting, and
inspections as needed.
   (G)   Discharge approval will be for a period of five years. Users are
required to submit information at least 60 days prior to approval expiration.
   (H)   Any violation of the terms and conditions of a state permit or this
chapter shall be deemed a violation and subjects the approved user to the
sanctions set out in §§
51.500 through
51.999 of this chapter. Obtaining wastewater discharge approval does not
relieve a user of its obligation to comply with all federal and state
pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of
federal, state, and local law.
   (I)   Wastewater Discharge Approval Fee for industrial users will be due at
the time of submittal. As necessary, the town may engage outside consultation
to review submittals and plans. The user shall agree to pay the town for the
actual costs incurred by the town with respect to the review of all submittals,
plans, and accompanying information. Fees are listed on the Town of Waterloo's
Fee Schedule that may be revised from time to time by the Town Council.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19; Am. Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.305 NOTIFICATIONS TO THE UTILITY.
   (A)   Changes in facility conditions or discharge. Industrial users must
notify the town of any planned changes to the industrial user's operations or
system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at
least 60 days before the change. The town may require the industrial user to
submit any information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition. The town shall review any proposed new or increased discharge to
ensure it is admissible under this chapter. The town retains the right to deny
any new or increased discharge to ensure compliance with this chapter, state
and federal pretreatment standards and requirements. Planned changes include,
but are not limited to:
      (1)   Expansion or addition of wastewater generating production lines or
processes;
      (2)   Projected increases of 20% or greater in monthly flow over the
previous year's highest monthly flow, or annual average flow over the previous
year's annual average flow; and/or
      (3)   The discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
   (B)   Change in ownership or business. Industrial users with a change in
ownership will be recognized as a new industrial facility and shall comply with
the town's discharge limits in accordance with this chapter. Discharge approval
for an industrial user shall not be reassigned, transferred, or sold to a new
owner, new user, different premises, or a new or changed operation without
prior notification to and approval by the town. If a change in a business
occurs, the property owner and/or user shall inform the town of the change
within 60 days and inform the town of the new type of business that is
currently operating at said location.
   (C)   Potential problems. Users shall notify the town immediately of all
discharges that could cause problems or harm to the sewerage system. This would
include any of the following: bypass of pretreatment facilities or equipment;
accidental discharges; slug load or slug discharge; batch or other non-
customary discharges that could cause pass through or cause interference to the
sewerage system; and/or upsets. The industrial user shall verbally notify the
town of any unanticipated flow that exceeds prohibited discharges as described
in §§
51.204 through
51.205 or other requirements as soon as the industrial user becomes aware of
the violation. Notification to the town does not nullify any possible fines or
enforcement actions per §§
51.500 through
51.999.
   (D)   Notification methods. If an industrial user knows in advance of a
potential problem, it shall notify the town, if possible, at least ten days
before the date of the event. Verbal notifications shall include: the date,
time, location and duration of the discharge; the type of wastewater including
concentration and volume; any corrective actions taken by the industrial user.
If requested by the town, the industrial user shall also provide a written
notification within five days of the event. The written submission shall
contain: a description of the bypass and its cause; the volume and duration of
the bypass, including exact times and dates, and if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or
planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the event. Notification
to the town does not nullify any possible fines or enforcement actions per §§
51.500 through
51.999.

§ 51.306 REVIEW OF INDUSTRIAL USERS.
   (A)   Industrial users shall be subject to a periodic facility inspection
and discharge monitoring as often as the town deems necessary (but at least
once a year) and may include the use of suitable continuously-monitoring
instruments in appropriate cases. Samples shall be collected by the town either
manually or by approved mechanical devices and in such a manner as to be
representative of the overall composition of the wastewaters. Every care shall
be exercised in collecting the samples to ensure their preservation until
analyzed in a state comparable to that at the time the samples were collected.
   (B)   Laboratory procedures used in the examination of industrial
wastewaters shall be those set forth in Standard Methods. However, alternative
methods for certain analyses of industrial wastewaters may be used subject to
agreement between the town and industrial user. The town may periodically
analyze the industrial user's wastewater for parameters deemed necessary by the
town. All laboratory costs shall be charged to the industrial user according to
the standard work order billing practices. All such analyses shall be binding
and conclusive in determining strength of wastewater surcharges and other
matters which are dependent upon the character and concentration of wastes.
Analytical results provided by an industrial user will not be used for
surcharges, compliance, or to determine compliance with §§
51.204 and
51.205; only wastewater sampled and analyzed through the town will be used.
   (C)   Significant industrial users will provide the town with copies of the
state required monitoring reports. If required by the town, industrial users
shall submit to the town a periodic summary report of the character of the
effluent to show discharge concentrations, effectiveness of treatment, and for
comparison against town monitoring records.
   (D)   The town may sample at any point in the sewerage system to determine
an industrial user's compliance, impact, and interference to the sewerage
system.

SEWER RATES AND CHARGES
§ 51.400 USER CLASSIFICATIONS.
   (A)   Every person whose premises are served by said sewer works shall be
charged for the services provided. These charges are established for each user
class, as defined, in order that the sewerage system shall recover, from each
user and user class, revenue which is proportional to its use of the POTW in
terms of volume and load.
   (B)   User charges are levied to defray the cost of operation and
maintenance (including replacement) of the POTW. User charges shall be uniform
in magnitude within a user class.
      (1)   User charges are subject to the rules and regulations adopted by
the United States Environmental Protection Agency, published in the Federal
Register August 21, 1973 (38 CFR 22523) and on February 11, 1974 (39 CFR 5252).
Replacement costs, which are recovered through the system of user charges,
shall be based upon the expected service life of the sewerage system plant and
equipment.
      (2)   The various classes of users of the POTW, for the purposes of this
subchapter, shall be as follows: Class I - Residential, Commercial,
Institutional, Governmental, Industrial.

§ 51.401 SEWER SERVICE.
   (A)   For the use of and service rendered by the sewerage system, rates and
charges shall be collected from the owners of each and every lot, parcel of
real estate or building that is connected with the town's sanitary system or
otherwise discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids
either directly or indirectly, into the sewerage system of the town. These
charges shall be due and payable even where no water service is provided to the
lot, parcel of real estate or building. In those cases where the water service
has been discontinued for nonpayment of bills and charges or disconnected at
the request of the customer, the owner shall still be responsible for the
minimum (base rate) sewage charge and garbage fee charge as established by
chapter.
   (B)   Such rates and charges include user charges, debt service costs,
excessive strength surcharges and other service charges, which rates and
charges shall be payable as hereinafter provided and shall be in an amount
determinable as follows:
      (1)   The sewage rates and charges shall be based upon the quantity of
water used on or in the property or premises subject to such rates and charges,
as the same is measured by the water meter there in use, plus a base rate
charge based on the size of the water meter installed, except as herein
otherwise provided. However, if there is no water usage on or in the property
or premises, the base rate shall still be charged to and paid by the customer
or property owner. For the purpose of billing and collecting the charges for
sewage service, water meters shall be read monthly and the users shall be
billed each month (or a period equaling one month). The usage on which the
amount of the rates and charges shall be determined is as follows:

*   The town may utilize available tax increment financing (“TIF”) funds to
“buy down” the rates billed to customers. To the extent the town sets aside
available TIF funds in accordance with enacted ordinances that provide for the
payment of sewage works revenue bonds (which the town anticipates will be
determined and undertaken annually), a credit for such set aside funds will be
credited to sewage works customers in a manner the town determines.
      (2)   The treatment rate as shown above shall apply to all users. For
metered customers the total rate is the treatment rate plus the base rate. For
unmetered customers the total rate is the treatment rate plus the unmetered
users rate.
   (C)   Deposit. The utility shall require from each applicant for wastewater
(sewage) service a cash deposit of $50 as a guarantee against the non-payment
of bills for service, which deposit shall be paid at the time of the
application for service.
   (D)   Unmetered water users. For users of the sewerage system that are
unmetered water users or where accurate water readings are not available, the
monthly charge shall be determined by equivalent single-family dwelling units,
except as otherwise provided herein. Bills for the sewerage system shall be
rendered once each month (or periods equally a month). The schedule on which
said rates and charges shall be determined according to the unmetered users
rate shown above.
   (E)   Connection fees. Prior to connecting to the town's sewerage system, a
customer shall be required to pay a connection fee as set forth hereafter.
These fees will be used by the utility in the best interests of the utility and
in accordance with the utility's policy but shall be primarily available to
offset the costs of future extensions, modifications, and improvements to the
town's sewerage system.

§ 51.402 ANNUAL STUDY.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain
fair and equitable and be in proportion to the cost of providing services to
the various users of user classes, the town shall cause a study to be made
within a reasonable period following the first 12 months of operation,
following the date on which this subchapter goes into effect. Such study shall
include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the costs associated with the
treatment of excessive strength effluents from industrial users or user
classes, the financial position of the sewerage system and the adequacy of its
revenue to provide reasonable funds for operation and maintenance,
replacements, debt service requirements and capital improvements to the
sewerage system.
   (B)   Thereafter, on an annual basis, within a reasonable period following
the normal accounting period, the town shall cause a similar study to be made
for the purpose of reviewing the fairness and equity of the rates and charges
for sewage services on a continuing basis. Said studies shall be conducted by
officers or employees of the town or by a firm of certified experience in such
studies, or by such combination of officers, employees, certified public
accountants, or engineers as the town shall determine to be best under the
circumstances.

§ 51.403 SURCHARGES.
   (A)   In order that the surcharges may be justly and equitably adjusted to
the service rendered to users, the town shall base its surcharges on the volume
of sewage flow billed to industrial users and strength of the stronger-than-
normal domestic sewage and wastewaters which it is required to treat and
dispose of.
   (B)   The owner or industrial user shall furnish a central sampling point
available to the town at all times. If one is not available, the user and town
will agree upon an alternate sampling point.
   (C)   The town shall have the right to measure and determine the strength
and content of all sewage and wastewater discharges, either directly or
indirectly into the town's sewerage system, in such manner and by such method
as it may deem practicable in the light of the conditions and attending
circumstances of each case to determine the applicable surcharges.
   (D)   The town will review wastewater discharges from new and existing users
periodically. If there is a substantial change in the strength, volume or
delivery flow rate characteristics introduced into the sewerage system by an
individual user, then the classification of that user may be reviewed and
reevaluated.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19; Am. Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.404 STRENGTH OF WASTEWATERS.
   (A)   The town shall determine the strength and content of all sewage and
wastewaters discharge at least annually, either directly or indirectly into the
sewerage system, to determine the applicable surcharges.
   (B)   The measurements of the strength and character of industrial
wastewaters shall be determined by the town based on a sample, authorized
hereunder, to be taken by the town for the purpose of appropriate billing. The
town shall sample at least once a year per the standard methods.
   (C)   The town will calculate the surcharges and provide to the user.
Surcharges will be assessed based on the table below.
 
Parameter   Surcharge Level (mg/L) Surcharge Amount ($/lb)
CBOD5       200                    $0.007/lb
TSS         200                    $0.007/lb
Phosphoru s 5                      $0.049/lb
 
   (D)   If an industrial user can and does show to the satisfaction of the
town that a portion of the total monthly billed sewage flow is from normal
domestic sanitary conveniences, then the flow and pollutant loadings to which
the surcharge is applied shall be determined based on net flow and pollutant
loadings excluding sanitary conveniences.
   (E)   Appropriate charges for sampling and analysis may be assessed to the
user at the option of the town. The results of routine sampling and analysis by
the user may also be used for determination of surcharges after verification by
the town.
   (F)   The surcharge for treatment services on or after the effective date of
this chapter, shall be prepared and billed monthly. The surcharges shall be
prepared, billed and collected in the manner provided by law and chapter.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19; Am. Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.405 ADJUSTMENTS TO RATES.
   (A)   The quantity of water discharged into the sewerage system and obtained
from sources other than the utility that serves the town shall be determined by
the town in such manner as the town shall reasonably elect, and the sewerage
service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates; further, as is
hereinafter provided in this section, the town may make proper allowance in
determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be
consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the town that such
quantities do not enter the sewerage system.
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the town's
sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied
by the water utility serving the town, and the water used thereon or therein is
not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not acceptable
to the town, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or
determined by the town. To ascertain the rate or charge provided in this
subchapter, the owner or other interested party shall at his or her expense
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the town for the
determination of sewage discharge.
   (C)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the sewerage
system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and the quantity of
water is measured by a single water meter, then in each such case, for billing
purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for each user and the
base charge and the flow rates and charges shall apply to each of the number of
residential lots, parcels of real estate or buildings served through the single
water meter.
   (D)   In the event two or more dwelling units such as mobile homes,
apartments or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water or other
liquids into the sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of
water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in
such case, billing shall be for a single service in the manner set out
elsewhere herein, except that the minimum bill shall not be less than the
number of such dwelling units times $6.60 per month. In the case of mobile home
courts, the number of mobile spaces available for rent plus any other dwelling
units served through the meter. A dwelling unit shall be interpreted as a room
or rooms or any other space or spaces in which cooking facilities are provided.
   (E)   In order that the single-family domestic and residential users of
sewage service shall not be penalized for sprinkling lawns and gardens, filling
of pools, power-washing, and the like during the summer months of May, June,
July and August, usage during the month billed shall be reduced to an amount
equal to the average of the previous monthly bills for the period January
through April. Domestic and/or residential sewage service as applicable to the
sprinkling rate shall apply to each lot, parcel of real estate or building
occupied and used as a single-family residence. The sprinkling rate shall not
apply to any premises partially or wholly used for commercial or industrial
purposes. In the event a portion of such premises shall be used for commercial
or industrial purposes, the owner shall have the privilege of separating the
water service so that the residential portion of the premises is served through
a separate meter, and in such case, the water usage is registered by the water
meter serving the portion of the premises used for residential purposes would
qualify under the sprinkling rate.
   (F)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the town's
sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess of
25,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the town
that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not and
cannot enter the sewerage system, then the owner or other interested party
shall, at his or her expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric
measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable
to the town for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (G)   (1)   Above-ground pool owners filling their pools before or after
sprinkling credit months shall contact the Water Department for a water meter
reading 24 hours before filling their pool with water, and notify the town of
the estimated number of gallons of water in the pool, and subsequently obtain
another meter reading 24 hours after the pool is filled. The Water Department
shall make an appropriate adjustment on the owner's sewage bill for the water
used in the pool and not discharged into the sewerage system.
      (2)   In-ground pool owners shall submit plans for their pool and its
outlet shall be verified by a plumber or contractor to assure the town that the
outlet is not the sewerage system. If the outlet of said pool is not the
sewerage system, then an adjustment shall be made according to the same
proceeding as set forth above for above-ground pools.
      (3)   If the outlet drain for any pool is the sewerage system, no
adjustment shall be made for water used to fill said swimming pool.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19; Am. Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.406 TOWN ACCOUNTING.
   The town shall account for all rates and charges from industrial users in
the following manner:
   (A)   All revenues derived from rates and charges from industrial users
shall be segregated and kept in a special fund, separate and apart from all
other funds of the town. The special fund shall be designated the "Sewage Works
Industrial Cost Recovery Fund" and payment of said amount into said fund shall
be deemed a reasonable expense of operation of the sewerage system for
computing net operating revenue.
   (B)   Within 45 days following the end of the first calendar year after
completion of construction of the sewage facilities and annually thereafter,
the town shall return 50% of the amounts recovered from industrial users,
together with any interest earned thereon, to the U.S. Treasury. Pending use,
the town shall invest the retained amounts for reconstruction and expansion in:
      (1)   Obligations of the U.S. Government;
      (2)   Obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S.
Government or any agency thereof; or
      (3)   Shall deposit such amounts in accounts fully collateralized by
obligations of the U.S. Government or by obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by the U.S. Government or any agency thereof.
   (C)   Eighty percent of the funds retained by the town in the "Sewage Works
Industrial Cost Recovery Fund" or authorized investments and the interest
earned thereon, shall be expended only for eligible costs of expansion or
reconstruction of the POTW. The town shall obtain the written approval of the
Regional Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to
commitment of the retained amounts for any expansion and reconstruction. The
remaining 20% of the funds retained by the town may be utilized for any
authorized use associated with the sewerage system.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19; Am. Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.407 BASIS FOR MONTHLY BILLING.
   (A)   All property owners of each lot, parcel or tract of real estate or
building that is connected to the town water system shall be assessed a water
charge whether there is water usage or not. For those lots, parcels, tracts or
buildings for which the water has been shut off, there will be no water charge.
   (B)   All water usage charges, other than for unmetered fire service or
other special purposes, will be calculated upon the registration of the meter
or meters installed, which registration shall be prima facia evidence of the
amount of water used.
   (C)   (1)   The utility will make an effort to read meters every month or at
intervals as designated by the Town Council. If the utility is unable to read
the meter, or should the meter fail to register, or if the utility is unable to
gain access to the customer's premises, the customer will be billed based on
average of consumption as shown by the record of previous meter readings. It is
the customer's obligation to make every effort to keep meter free of debris
and/or obstructions.
      (2)   The first charge after a meter reading is obtained will be then
adjusted by averaging consumption over a period from the last reading, charging
for each period in accordance with the schedule of rates in effect for the
periods, and allowing credit for the amount of estimated billings as applicable
to the event.
   (D)   After six consecutive months of estimating, the utility will
automatically boost the consumption to four times the estimated amount. The
customer will continue to be billed at the boosted rate until an actual read is
taken and validated. Any necessary billing adjustments will be made on the
following billing, after the actual read.
   (E)   Where water is taken through more than one meter, and where such
arrangement is for the convenience of the customer, then, each meter will be
read and billed separately. Where water is taken through more than one meter
for the convenience of the utility, then, the meter readings will be aggregated
and billed as one reading.
   (F)   All water passing through meters will be charged for at the applicable
rates, whether used, wasted or lost through leakage.
   (G)   The utility will not be bound by billings rendered under a mistake of
fact as to the quantity of service rendered.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19; Am. Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.408 PAYMENT OF BILLS.
   (A)   Billings rendered to customers for water service will reflect at least
the following information:
      (1)   The dates at the beginning and ending of the service period, and
the meter reading at the end of the period for which the billing is rendered;
      (2)   The previous balance, if any;
      (3)   The amount of the billing;
      (4)   The date on which the billing is due;
      (5)   If an estimated billing, a clear coding or other indication
identifying the billing as an estimated bill;
      (6)   An explanation, which can be readily understood, of all the codes
and/or symbols on the billing.
   (B)   Billings will be rendered monthly. If a billing is not paid on or
before the due date indicated on the billing (approximately 15 days after the
bill is mailed to the customer), the customer will be considered delinquent. A
period of two consecutive months delinquent will then constitute termination of
water service to the customer by the utility.
   (C)   Failure to receive a billing shall not affect the right of the utility
to cut-off and discontinue service for non-payment as provided above.
   (D)   To qualify for the above consideration, the customer must not be
entered into and have breached a similar agreement with the utility during the
last 12-month period.
   (E)   It is the policy of the town to discontinue utility service to
customers by reason of nonpayment of bills. The Clerk-Treasurer shall prepare a
utility service application form with such information as the Clerk-Treasurer
deems necessary.
   (F)   When it becomes necessary for the town to discontinue utility service
to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only after
all bills for service then due have been paid, along with a turn-on charge as
set by Town Council.
   (G)   (1)   All water charges follow the customer rather than the property;
if a customer moved from the premises where water service has been supplied,
such customer will be held responsible for the payment of all billings rendered
for the service supplied to the premises until proper notice of discontinuance
of water service has been given to the office of the utility.
      (2)   Moving from one location to another location in no way absolves the
customer from any unpaid charges incurred at a previous location.
      (3)   A customer's service or a property owner's service may be
discontinued for failure to pay any of the unpaid charges due from the customer
or property owner regardless of the premises with respect to which the charges
were incurred.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19; Am. Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.409 ADJUSTMENT OF BILLINGS.
   (A)   If any service meter is found to have a percentage error greater than
that allowed by the Public Service Commission of Indiana, the following
procedure for the adjustment of billings will be observed:
      (1)   Fast meters. When a meter is found to have a positive average error
(i.e. is fast, in excess of 2%) the utility will refund or credit the
customer's account with the amount in excess of that determined to be an
average charge for one-half of the time elapsed since the previous test of the
meter, or six months, whichever period is shorter. This average charge will be
calculated based on the units registered on the meter over corresponding
periods either prior or after the period for which the meter is determined to
be fast. No part of a minimum service charge will be refunded.
      (2)   Stopped or slow meters. When a meter is stopped or has a negative
average error (i.e. is slow, in excess of 2%) the utility may charge the
customer an amount estimated to be an average charge for one-half of the time
elapsed since the previous meter test or six months, whichever period is
shorter. This average charge shall be calculated based on the units registered
on the meter over the corresponding periods or after the period for which the
meter is determined to be slow or stopped. Such action may be taken only in
cases where the utility is not at fault for allowing the stopped or slow meter
to remain in service.
   (B)   All billing errors, including incorrect tariff applications, will be
adjusted to the known date of the error or for a period of one year, whichever
is shorter.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19; Am. Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.410 COLLECTIONS.
   Such rates and charges shall be prepared, billed and collected by the town
in the manner provided by law and chapters.
   (A)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed
monthly.
   (B)   As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when due are
hereby declared to be delinquent and a penalty of 10% of the amount of the
rates or charges shall thereupon attach thereto. The time at which such rates
or charges shall be paid is now fixed at 20 days after the date of mailing of
the bill.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19; Am. Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.411 COLLECTIONS AND DEFERRED PAYMENT CHARGE.
   (A)   The utility may bring a civil action to recover any delinquent charges
together with applicable interest at the statutory rate, the costs and
disbursements of said actions, and any other remedies prescribed by law.
   (B)   All billings for water services not paid on or before the due date
indicated on the billing shall be subject to a collection or deferred payment
charge of 10%.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19; Am. Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
ENFORCEMENT
§ 51.500 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   The town shall make and enforce such by-laws and regulations as may be
deemed necessary for the safe, economical and efficient management of the
sewerage system for the construction and use of sewers and connections to the
sewerage system, and for the regulation, collection, rebating and refunding of
such rates and charges.
   (B)   The town is hereby authorized to prohibit dumping of wastes into the
sewerage system which, in its discretion, are deemed harmful to the operation
of the sewerage system, or to require methods affecting pretreatment of said
wastes to comply with the pretreatment standards included in the National
Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued to the town.
   (C)   A person shall not knowingly make or submit to the town a false
statement, representation, record, report, plan or other document required to
be filed hereunder or under a duly adopted regulation of the town, or
voluntarily filed, with the intent that the town rely thereon, or falsify,
tamper with or knowingly render inaccurate any monitoring, testing, measuring
or timing device required or installed under these regulations.
   (D)   To provide consistent enforcement responses for all similar violations
and circumstances for industrial users, the town's enforcement actions will
generally be in accordance with the town's enforcement response plan.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19; Am. Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.501 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   (A)   Any person or user found that has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, shall be served by the town with a written
notice of violation stating the nature of the violation and providing a
reasonable time limit to satisfactorily correct the violation. The offender
shall, within the period stated in such notice, permanently cease all
violations.
   (B)   The user will provide to the town within ten days of receiving the
written notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions.
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the town to take any
action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without
first issuing a notice of violation.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19; Am. Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.502 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
   (A)   Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the time limit
provided for in the notice of violation shall be fined in the amount not
exceeding $1,000 for each violation. Each day in which any such violation shall
continue, shall be deemed a separate offense. Additional fines and enforcement
actions will generally be in accordance with the town's Enforcement Response
Plan.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 60 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance, and interest shall
accrue thereafter at a rate of 1% per month. A lien against the user's property
will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the town to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount
within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the
town may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be
returned to the user. The costs of preparing administrative enforcement
actions, such as notices and orders, may be added to the fine.
   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19; Am. Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.503 CONSENT ORDERS.
   The town may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance,
or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible
for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by
the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the
document. Violations resulting in significant noncompliance by a user will be
addressed with an administrative order. Such documents shall have the same
force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §§
51.504 and
51.505 and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.504 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   The town may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before
the town and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not
be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered
or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 21 days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the
user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.505 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the town finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the town may
issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the
user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come
into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued
unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances
are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring
and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants
discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.506 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   When the town finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the
user’s past violations are likely to recur, the town may issue an order to the
user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the
user to:
   (A)   Immediately comply with all the requirements; and
   (B)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   (C)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.507 EMERGENCY SUSPENSION.
   (A)   The town may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after a verbal
notice to the user of the violation, whenever such suspension is necessary to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or
cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or the environment.
   (B)   The town may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and
opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the
sewerage system, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the
environment.
   (C)   The town may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user
has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the town that the period of
endangerment has passed.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19; Am. Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.508 TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.
   (A)   The town may revoke a user's privilege to discharge non-domestic
wastewater into the sewerage system.
   (B)   Termination of service is used when the discharge from a user presents
imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, or the environment;
or threatens to damage the sewerage system or interfere with the town's
operations; or as an escalating enforcement action to a significant violation
when a non-compliant user fails to respond adequately to previous enforcement
actions.
   (C)   Termination of service may be accomplished by physical severance of
the user's connection to the collection system, issuance of a cease-and-desist
order which compels the user to immediately terminate its discharge, revocation
of the user's discharge permit, or a court ruling.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19; Am. Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.509 COST RECOVERY.
   (A)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall
become liable to the town for any expense, loss, or damage occasioned the town
or downstream users by reason of such violation.
   (B)   The user shall be responsible for paying the following (but not
limited to) costs incurred by the town for the user's failure to comply: cost
of mileage and labor incurred in detecting and correcting the violation;
laboratory analysis costs associated with detecting and correcting the
violation; additional treatment costs caused by the violation or associated
with detecting and correcting the violation; costs of any additional equipment
acquired or expended by the town for detecting or correcting the violation;
repair
and/or replacement of any part of the sewerage system damaged by the violation;
any liability, damages, fines, or penalties incurred by the town because of the
violation; all expenses of outside professionals to include, but not limited
to, engineers, scientists, and/or legal counsel; and other costs associated
with the detection and correction of the violations.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19; Am. Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.510 JUDICIAL ACTION.
   Judicial action will be taken when it is deemed necessary to force the
industrial user to correct the violation and comply with the permit. Judicial
action may consist of civil prosecution; criminal prosecution; or an action for
injunction, at the discretion of the town and its counsel. As an alternative to
judicial action, the town and industrial user may agree to a voluntary zero
discharge of industrial waste by the industrial user pending correction of the
violation.
(Ord. 22-03, passed - -22)
§ 51.511 REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE.
   (A)   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The town
may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant
user.
   (B)   Enforcement of industrial user violations will generally be in
accordance with the town's Enforcement Response Plan. However, the town may
take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the
town is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any
noncompliant user.

      (2)   In each case, except those arising under divisions (B)(a), (b),
(d), (f), (g). (h), (i), (j), (n) and (o) of this section, the utility will

the customer.
      (3)   (a)   When water service to the premises has been terminated for
any reason, water service will be restored only upon proper application to the
utility after conditions of the notice of termination have been properly
corrected and inspected by the utility, when all charges due from the customer
have been settled, and when arrangements have been made to provide access to
the premises during regular working hours of the utility (9:00 a.m. - 3:00
p.m.). No payments in lieu of disconnections will be accepted by utility
personnel in the field. A $50 service charge will be due and owing at the time

of such work shall be borne by the customer.
         (b)   Should the conditions under which service was discontinued not
be corrected within 60 days, the utility shall have the right to finalize the
customer's account. In the absence of a final meter reading, the utility will
render a final bill based on the average of previous consumption; if
arrangements are made within seven working days after or following the date of
the final billing, adjustments will be made. No adjustments will be made after
the expiration of the seven-day period.
         (c)   Reconnection of the service is included in the initial base

reconnection and the customer fails to keep that appointment, an additional
service charge will be added for every additional service call, plus any
applicable hourly charges for utility personnel.

health official which states that discontinuance of water service would be a
serious and immediate threat to the health or safety of a designated person in
the household of the customer. The postponement or disconnection will be
continued for one additional 30-day period upon the furnishing of an additional
medical statement.
      (2)   The utility will not disconnect service to the customer:
         (a)   Upon failure to pay for the service rendered at a different
meter address, residence or location, if such billing has remained unpaid for
less than 45 days; or

of and not in accordance with these general rules and regulations, where water
is being taken from a single curb stop for supply for two or more units,
buildings or premises, each customer benefiting from such arrangements shall be
responsible for the payment of the individual usage charges and all other
legitimate charges.
      (5)   Any violation of the rules of the utility by either of the
occupants of said premises shall be deemed a violation as to all, and the

in accordance with state, local, and applicable standards, codes, regulations
and ordinances.
   (F)   There shall be no physical connection from a secondary water supply to
any service provided by the utility. Such connection shall be cause for
immediate termination of water service.

inspections and re-inspections based on potential health hazards involved shall
be as established by the Water Department and may include a requirement of
annual inspection reports being made to the Water Department.
   (C)   Upon presentation of credentials, the representative of the Water
Department shall have the right to request entry at any reasonable time to
examine any property served by a connection to the public water system of the
town for cross-connections. On request, the owner, lessee, or occupant of any
property so served shall furnish to the inspection agency any pertinent
information regarding the piping system or systems on such property. The
refusal of access or refusal of requested pertinent information shall be deemed
evidence of the presence of cross-connections.
   (D)   The Water Department is hereby authorized and directed to discontinue
water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of this
section exists, and to take such other precautionary measures deemed necessary
to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water system. Water
service shall be discontinued only after reasonable notice is served on the
owner, lessee, or occupants of the property or premises where a violation is
found or suspected to exist. Water service to such property shall not be
restored until the cross-connection(s) has been eliminated in compliance with
the provisions of this section.
   (E)   If it is deemed by the Water Department that a cross-connection or an
emergency endangers public health, safety, or welfare and requires immediate
action, and a written finding to that effect is filed with the clerk of the
town and delivered to the consumer's premises, service may be immediately
discontinued. The consumer shall have an opportunity for hearing within ten
days of such emergency discontinuance.
   (F)   All consumers using toxic or hazardous liquids, all hospitals,
mortuaries, wastewater treatment plants, laboratories, and all other hazardous

      (2)   The customer shall provide a suitable location for the placement of
the meter, near the service entrance either in the basement, in an approved
meter box or in a location approved by the utility prior to the water service
installation.
   (B)   The utility will designate the minimum size and type meter to be
installed for each customer. Each building to be served from the water main
shall be supplied by at least a three-quarter inch or one-inch line. For water
services larger than the minimum size, the utility will reserve the right to
designate the number and size of meters that can be supplied for such service
requested.
   (C)   (1)   A "by-pass" arrangement around all new meter installations will
be required under any of the following circumstances:
         (a)   The service line on the meter outlet side is one and one-half
inches or larger.
         (b)   The service line, regardless of size, serves refrigeration
equipment of water supplied is used in and for cooling.
         (c)   The water service must not, for any other reason, be so
interrupted while the meter is being repaired or replaced.
      (2)   The by-pass shall be furnished and installed by the customer in
accordance with the utility's specifications and/or codes. Where existing
piping, not containing a by-pass, is altered to meet any of the above
conditions, such alteration shall also include a by-pass arrangement.
   (D)   (1)   All meters, appliances, equipment and appurtenances furnished by
the utility and which may be on the customers premises, shall remain as the
property of the utility, unless otherwise expressly provided herein; the
customer shall protect such property from freezing, loss or damage and shall
not be permitted to remove, tamper or alter such property.
      (2)   The customer shall be responsible and liable for all damages to the
utilities property while on the premises if such property is damaged from
freezing or hot water and shall pay for cost for repair or replacement
necessary to restore service and required accuracy of the metering. Upon
repeated instances of damaged meters due to negligence of the customer, the
utility can refuse service until the customer can properly protect the
equipment from such damage.
   (E)   Ordinary repairs to meters will be performed by the utility without
expense to the customer.
   (F)   (1)   A meter will be tested for accuracy upon request from the
customer. A utility will first investigate the premises for other reasons for
excessive water usage before removing the meter for testing.
      (2)   At the customer's request the remote reader and the inside meter
may be checked for accuracy comparison with no charge to the customer. This is
a recommended yearly check.
      (3)   If leaks are found or if the meter test establishes accuracy of the
meter to be between 98% and 102%, the utility may make a service charge of at
least $25 for either service activity. The customer may have a representative
present during the investigation or testing.
      (4)   Such testing and/or investigation will not be performed more than
once in 12 months, unless the customer has abnormally high billings. A report
of the results of the test will be made to the customer and a complete record
of the test will be maintained by the utility.
   (G)   The utility may place seals on any water meter, by-pass or related
couplings, in and for any premises, and will replace such seals found to be
broken or removed. The water supply may be turned off if such seals are found
to be broken or removed.
   (H)   Where water is taken through one meter servicing a multi-family
dwelling, the utility requires the owner of the real estate property to
maintain the billing in the owner's name.
   (I)   New meter applications shall be installed with "remote-read" equipment
as designated by the utility within its ordinances, general rules and
regulations and schedules of installation, in effect.
   (J)   If a customer's premises are deemed unsafe by the water utility's
meter reader, the utility will send notification to the customer for a clean-
up. The customer then has five working days to complete such a clean-up and a
remote-reader will be installed at the customer's expense.
   (K)   If the utility cannot gain access to a home to read the meter, a
remote reader will be installed at the home owner's expense.
   (L)   If once access is gained to a property and a change is needed to be
made to match up the remote reader with the meter itself, adjustments will be
made as necessary to the customer's billing.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19)
§ 52.020 PRE-WIRING FOR REMOTE WATER READING UNITS.
   (A)   All new dwelling units constructed within the service areas of the
utility shall be pre-wired by the builder with suitable transmission wire as a
part of the construction costs to the unit.
   (B)   When the water service is ordered for the unit, a reasonable fee will
be charged by the Building Commissioner, in addition to the costs of the water
service connection, to compensate for materials, labor and/or equipment to
install a water meter remote read unit at the location in the new dwelling
unit.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19)
§ 52.021 BASIS FOR MONTHLY BILLING.
   (A)   All property owners of every lot, parcel or tract of real estate or
building that is connected to the town water system shall be assessed a water
charge whether there is water usage or not. For those lots, parcels, tracts or
buildings for which the water has been shut off, there will be no water charge.
   (B)   All water usage charges, other than for unmetered fire service or
other special purposes, will be calculated upon the registration of the meter
or meters installed, which registration shall be prima facia evidence of the
amount of water used.
   (C)   (1)   The utility will make an effort to read meters every month or at
intervals as designated by the Town Council. If the utility is unable to read
the meter, or should the meter fail to register, or if the utility is unable to
gain access to the customer's premises, the customer will be billed based on
average of consumption as shown by the record of previous meter readings. It is
the customer's obligation to make every effort to keep meter free of debris
and/or obstructions.
      (2)   The first charge after a meter reading is obtained will be then
adjusted by averaging consumption over a period from the last reading, charging
for each period in accordance with the schedule of rates in effect for the
periods, and allowing credit for the amount of estimated billings as applicable
to the event.
   (D)   After six consecutive months of estimating, the utility will
automatically boost the consumption to four times the estimated amount. The
customer will continue to be billed at the boosted rate until an actual read is
taken and validated. Any necessary billing adjustments will be made on the
following billing, after the actual read.
   (E)   Where water is taken through more than one meter, and where such
arrangement is for the convenience of the customer, then, each meter will be
read and billed separately. Where water is taken through more than one meter
for the convenience of the utility, then, the meter readings will be aggregated
and billed as one reading.
   (F)   All water passing through meters will be charged for at the applicable
rates, whether used, wasted or lost through leakage.
   (G)   The utility will not be bound by billings rendered under a mistake of
fact as to the quantity of service rendered.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19)
§ 52.022 PAYMENT OF BILLS.
   (A)   Billings rendered to customers for water service will reflect at least
the following information:
      (1)   The dates at the beginning and ending of the service period, and
the meter reading at the end of the period for which the billing is rendered;
      (2)   The previous balance, if any;
      (3)   The amount of the billing;
      (4)   The date on which the billing is due;
      (5)   If an estimated billing, a clear coding or other indication
identifying the billing as an estimated bill;
      (6)   An explanation, which can be readily understood, of all the codes
and/or symbols on the billing.
   (B)   Billings will be rendered monthly. If a billing is not paid on or
before the due date indicated on the billing (approximately 15 days after the
bill is mailed to the customer), the customer will be considered delinquent. A
period of two consecutive months delinquent will then constitute termination of
water service to the customer by the utility.
   (C)   Failure to receive a billing shall not affect the right of the utility
to cut-off and discontinue service for non-payment as provided above.
   (D)   To qualify for the above consideration, the customer must not be
entered into and have breached a similar agreement with the utility during the
last 12-month period.
   (E)   It is the policy of the town to discontinue utility service to
customers by reason of nonpayment of bills. The Clerk-Treasurer shall prepare a
utility service application form with such information as the Clerk-Treasurer
deems necessary.
   (F)   When it becomes necessary for the town to discontinue utility service
to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only after
all bills for service then due have been paid, along with a turn-on charge as
set by Town Council.
   (G)   (1)   All water charges follow the customer rather than the property;
if a customer moved from the premises where water service has been supplied,
such customer will be held responsible for the payment of all billings rendered
for the service supplied to the premises until proper notice of discontinuance
of water service has been given to the office of the utility.
      (2)   Moving from one location to another location in no way absolves the
customer from any unpaid charges incurred at a previous location.
      (3)   A customer's service or a property owner's service may be
discontinued for failure to pay any of the unpaid charges due from the customer
or property owner regardless of the premises with respect to which the charges
were incurred.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19)
§ 52.023 ADJUSTMENT OF BILLINGS.
   (A)   If any service meter is found to have a percentage error greater than
that allowed by the Public Service Commission of Indiana, the following
procedure for the adjustment of billings will be observed:
      (1)   Fast meters. When a meter is found to have a positive average error
(i.e. is fast, in excess of 2%) the utility will refund or credit the
customer's account with the amount in excess of that determined to be an
average charge for one-half of the time elapsed since the previous test of the
meter, or six months, whichever period is shorter. This average charge will be
calculated based on the units registered on the meter over corresponding
periods either prior or after the period for which the meter is determined to
be fast. No part of a minimum service charge will be refunded.
      (2)   Stopped or slow meters. When a meter is stopped or has a negative
average error (i.e. is slow, in excess of 2%) the utility may charge the
customer an amount estimated to be an average charge for one-half of the time
elapsed since the previous meter test or six months, whichever period is
shorter. This average charge shall be calculated based on the units registered
on the meter over the corresponding periods or after the period for which the
meter is determined to be slow or stopped. Such action may be taken only in
cases where the utility is not at fault for allowing the stopped or slow meter
to remain in service.
   (B)   All billing errors, including incorrect tariff applications, will be
adjusted to the known date of the error or for a period of one year, whichever
is shorter.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19)
§ 52.024 COLLECTIONS AND DEFERRED PAYMENT CHARGE.
   (A)   The utility may bring a civil action to recover any delinquent charges
together with applicable interest at the statutory rate, the costs and
disbursements of said actions, and any other remedies prescribed by law.
   (B)   All billings for water services not paid on or before the due date
indicated on the billing shall be subject to a collection or deferred payment
charge of 10%.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19)
§ 52.025 WASTE OR EXCESSIVE USE OF WATER.
   If a customer on a special purpose un-metered rate is found using water in
excess of the contracted for amount, or permits leaks on the premises, or
wastes water by allowing hydrants or faucets to run continuously, the utility
may require the customer to provide a suitable place for the installation of a
water meter and thereafter will supply service in accordance with said
applicable metered tariff.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19)
§ 52.026 NOTIFICATION OF LOAD INCREASE.
   The service and meters supplied by the utility have definite capacities; no
substantial addition to the water consuming equipment or appliances connected
thereto shall be made except after written notice to a written consent from the
utility.
(Ord. 19-01, passed 4-9-19) Penalty, see §
52.999
§ 52.027 RESALE OF WATER.
   The water or service furnished under these rules and regulations is for the
use of the customer on the premises. He or she shall not resell any water or
service without the expressed written consent of the utility. Written consent
shall be in the form of a clear contract with the utility.

§ 52.029 PRIVATE FIRE PROTECTION SERVICE.
   (A)   The entire private fire protection service on a customer's premises
shall be subject to inspection and testing by the utility at such times as it
is deemed necessary by the utility or other authority having legal interest in
such private systems.
   (B)   Before any modifications are made to any private fire protection
system or before service is furnished to any new private fire protection system
connected to or proposed to be connected to and supplied with water from the
utility's distribution mains, the owner of the private fire protection system
or the owner's contractor shall provide certification in accordance with this

   (D)   No connection with a fire protection system will be permitted to
supply water for general purposes unless the connection has been approved by
the customer's fire underwriter and unless the general-purpose water is
metered. If such a connection is approved, both the fire protection line and
the general-purpose line shall be separately valved outside the building to be
served and proper cross-connection devices provided, all in accordance with the
utility's specifications, thus permitting either line to be turned on or off
without affecting the other.
   (E)   A private fire protection system without a tank shall be equipped with

constitute a public nuisance.
   (D)   Denial or revocation. The Town Manager or designated code enforcer may
deny or revoke a permit to keep, maintain, or possess chickens within the town
if the Town Manager determines that any nuisance exists or any law is being
violated or if the Town Manager finds that maintenance of any chickens

section may also be enforced by injunctive relief. The town may recover

   (B)   (1)   Waterloo Memorial Cemetery reserves the right to regulate the
method of decorating plots, lots, and graves in the cemetery so that a uniform
beauty may be maintained. It is not the desire of this board to arbitrarily
control or to curb the individual’s interest in the Waterloo Memorial Cemetery.

flooding or improper drainage, objectionable earth, and rock formation
topography or any other feature harmful to the health and safety of possible
residents and the community as a whole.
      (2)   All proposed subdivisions shall conform to any thoroughfare plan.
Whenever a tract to be subdivided embraces any part of a major street,
boulevard, or parkway so designated on the thoroughfare plan, such part of such
proposed public way shall be platted by the subdivider in the locations and of
the width indicated on the thoroughfare plan. Due considerations shall also be
given by the subdivider and owners of adjoining property for the provisions of

convenient form of space instead of the required turning circle.
      (5)   Minimum radii or curvature on the center lines. Where a deflection
angle of more than ten degrees in the alignment of a street occurs, a curve
shall be introduced, providing for:
         (a)   Major streets, a minimum radius of 300 feet, but should be much
greater wherever possible.
         (b)   Other streets, a minimum radius of 100 feet, but should be much

be intended for the use of pedestrians only.
      (9)   Lots.
         (a)   In any agriculture or resident district, the minimum width and
area for lots shall conform to the requirements of the zoning ordinance, but in
no case shall the width be less than 60 feet at the setback line, and the area
contain less than 6,000 square feet if a public water supply and sanitary
sewers are provided, 7,200 square feet if a public water supply but no sanitary

have an easement for utilities along the rear lot line and along the side lot
line where necessary. No easement shall be less than ten feet wide on each lot,
making an overall easement width of 20 feet.
         (h)   When the terrain so requires, easements for sanitary sewers
along lot lines other than the rear lot lines shall be provided.
      (10)   Public spaces. Whenever a park, recreation area, school site, or

      (2)   Sewers.
         (a)   The subdivider shall provide the subdivision with a complete
public sewer system which shall connect with a sanitary sewer outlet, if

disposal of sanitary sewage by means of septic tanks with absorption systems or
seepage pits, all constructed according to the minimum requirements of the
State Board of Health and compatible with existing sewer improvements in the
town.
         (b)   In this division (B)(2), and the next division (B)(3), the
phrase "the subdivider shall provide" shall be interpreted to mean that the
subdivider shall install the facility referred to, or that the subdivider shall
require, as a condition of the sale of each lot or parcel in the subdivision,
that the facilities referred to in these divisions shall be installed by the
developer of the lots in accordance with these regulations.
         (c)   Upon completion of the installment of a public sewer system, the
plans for such system as built shall be filed with the Town Board.
      (3)   Water. The subdivider shall provide the subdivision with a complete
water main supply system which shall be connected with the city water supply
system, if available, meeting the standard as set forth by the Town Board, or a
private water supply for each lot to be installed in accordance with the

standard street signs at the intersection of all streets.
   (C)   Variance and modification.
      (1)   Where the subdivider can show that a provision of divisions (A)(5),
(6), or (7) of these regulations would cause unnecessary hardship if strictly
adhered to and where, in the opinion of the Commission, because of
topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site, a departure may be made
without destroying the intent of such provision, the Commission may authorize a
variance. Any variance thus authorized is required to be entered in writing in
the minutes of the Commission and the reasoning on which the departure was
justified set forth.
      (2)   The foregoing requirements and principles of land subdivision may
be modified by the Commission in the case of a subdivision large enough to be
developed as a community center or neighborhood unit in accordance with a plan
prepared by the subdivider and adopted as a part of the Master Plan.
      (3)   The Plan Commission shall not approve variances unless it shall
make written findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific
case that:
         (a)   The variance is not detrimental to public safety or injurious to
property.
         (b)   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based
are unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not
applicable generally to other property.
         (c)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the land, a particular hardship would result, as
distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these
regulations are carried out. Financial hardship does not constitute grounds for
a variance.
         (d)   The variance will not in any manner vary the provisions of the
Housing Ordinance, Master Plan, or Thoroughfare Plan if applicable to Waterloo.
         (e)   1.   Where the variance impacts on the design and construction
of public facilities, all appropriate public agencies will be given ample time
to comment in writing to the Commission.
            2.   In granting a variance, the Plan Commission may require
conditions which will secure the standards and objectives of the subdivision
regulations, and a requirement that a variance petition be submitted in writing
at the time the sketch plat is submitted.

the Plat Committee/Plan Commission is mailed to the interested party. Notice

SECTION 3: ZONING DISTRICT DESIGNATION, USES AND STANDARDS
3.1 ZONING DISTRICT DESIGNATION.
   The Town of Waterloo is divided into the following districts for purposes as
stated. Each of the following districts stands alone and is not part of a
tiered system of zoning.
   AG: Agriculture. This district is composed of land being used primarily for
agricultural activities in those areas outside of the corporate limits for
which control for planning and zoning has been granted to the Town of Waterloo
by DeKalb County. This land is expected to develop into urban uses within the
near future. It is the intent of this district to protect the area from the
encroachment of scattered urban uses that may inhibit the overall future
development of the area in accordance with the Comprehensive Land Use Plan.
   SR: Suburban Residential. The Suburban Residential District is established
for the purpose of low-density residential development. This district is
intended to promote the new development of larger lot housing opportunities
within the community. This area should be protected from conflicting land uses
and non-family oriented businesses.
   UR: Urban Residential. The Urban Residential District is established for
medium to high-density residential development. This district is intended to
promote development in new residential areas as well as redevelopment of
housing in older areas of the community.
   MF: Multi-Family Residential. The Multi-Family Residential District is
established to provide a land use category for small to medium scale two-family
and multi-family developments.
   CB: Central Business. The Central Business District is established to
promote and regulate a variety of urban uses within the downtown business area,
to promote vitality and to attract commerce.

establishments that are close to residential areas and are appropriate to
serving their shopping and service needs.
   GB: General Business. The General Business District is established to
include areas that are appropriate to all kinds of retail, commercial, service,
entertainment, eating establishments or similar uses.
   LI: Light Industrial. The Light Industrial District is intended to provide
areas for fabricating, manufacturing, and processing industries where the
operation is enclosed within a building and conducted in such a manner that no
adverse impacts are created or emitted outside of the buildings.
   HI-E: Heavy Industrial - Enclosed. The Heavy Industrial-Enclosed District is
intended to provide for areas for intense industrial uses such as fabricating,
manufacturing, processing, heavy repair, and dismantling industries where the
operation is enclosed within a building and conducted in such a manner that no
adverse impacts are created or emitted outside of the buildings.
   HI-O: Heavy Industrial - Open. The Heavy Industrial District is intended to
provide for areas for intense industrial uses such as fabricating,
manufacturing, processing, extraction, heavy repair and dismantling industries
where outside operations and storage areas may be required. Due to the nature
of these industries, districts are typically located away from residential
areas and districts.
   OS: Open Space. The purpose of the Open Space District is to provide areas
for public and quasi-public uses, for passive and active recreation activities,
and for the conservation of unique and/or environmentally sensitive natural
areas.
3.2 LAND USES.
   A.   Land uses are either permitted, non-permitted or a special exception in

4.9 INDUSTRIAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   A.   Intent. The purpose of these performance standards is the regulation of
industrial activities as follows:
      1.   To permit potential industrial nuisances to be measured factually
and objectively;
      2.   To ensure that all industries will provide methods to protect the
community from hazards and nuisances which can be prevented by processes of
control and nuisance elimination; and
      3.   To protect industries from arbitrary exclusion or persecution based
solely on the nuisance production by any particular type of industry in the
past.
   B.   Application.
      1.   These performance standards apply to land use activity in industrial
and manufacturing areas. However, the standards do not apply to machinery,
equipment, and facilities, which were at the site on the effective date of the
appendix. Submission of the appropriate documentation to substantiate claims in
this regard is the responsibility of the owner of the business.
      2.   Any use established, or changed to, and any building, structure or
tract of land developed, constructed or used for, any permitted or permissible
primary or accessory use shall comply with all the performance standards set
forth in this section for the zoning district involved.
      3.   If any existing use or building, or other structure, is extended,
enlarged, moved, structurally altered or reconstructed, or any existing use of
land is enlarged or moved, the performance standards for the zone involved will
be applied to that extended, enlarged, moved, structurally altered or
reconstructed building or other structure or portion of it, and to that use of
the land which is enlarged or moved.
   C.   Air pollution. No use on a property shall release fly ash, dust, smoke,
vapors, noxious, toxic or corrosive matter, or other air pollutants in such
concentration as to be detrimental to health, animals, vegetation or property,
or in conflict with public air quality standards.
   D.   Glare and heat. No use on a property shall produce heat and glare in
such a manner as to create a hazard or interfere with the reasonable enjoyment
of a neighboring property.
   E.   Vibration. No use on a property shall cause vibrations detectable
beyond the lot lines as determined by the appropriate measuring instruments.
   F.   Noise.
      1.   Noise shall be measured in decibels with a sound level meter meeting
the latest standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The
instrument shall be set to the "A-weighting scale" and the meter to "slow
response". Measurements shall be conducted in accordance with the latest ANSI
method for the physical measurement of sound.
      2.   The table below specifies noise limits that apply on or beyond the
adjacent lot lines or zoning district boundaries, whichever is applicable,
outside the user's property. Noises shall not exceed the maximum sound levels
specified in the table. Where more than one specified sound level applies, the
most restrictive will govern. Measurements shall be taken at points of maximum
noise intensity.

SECTION 6: FLOOD HAZARD AREAS
6.1 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES.
   6.1.A. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
      The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Town Council of the Town of Waterloo, Indiana, does hereby adopt the following
floodplain management regulations.
   6.1.B. FINDINGS OF FACT.
      1.   The flood hazard areas of the Town of Waterloo, Indiana, are subject
to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
      2.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities,
and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
   6.1.C. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
      It is the purpose of this appendix to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      1.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
      2.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      3.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
      4.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage;
      5.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
      6.   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures
and their contents in the Town of Waterloo, Indiana, by fulfilling the
requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
   6.1.D. OBJECTIVES.
      The objectives of this appendix are:
      1.   To protect human life and health;
      2.   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      3.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      4.   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      5.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains;
      6.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood
blight areas; and
      7.   To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in
a flood area.
6.2 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this appendix
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this appendix its most reasonable application.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM or FHBM. The definitions are
presented below:
      1.   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply.
      2.   ZONE AE and A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements
apply. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-A30.)
      3.   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance
purchase requirements apply.
      4.   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are one to three feet.
Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within
this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.
      5.   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection. Mandatory flood insurance
purchase requirements apply.
      6.   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements
apply.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure that is located on
the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory
structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay
sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this appendix or a request for a variance.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.

hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
Town of Waterloo, Indiana, requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual,
and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship
alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical
handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise
cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems
can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the START OF CONSTRUCTION of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred SUBSTANTIAL
DAMAGE or repetitive loss regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any
alteration of a HISTORIC STRUCTURE, provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structures continued designation as a HISTORIC STRUCTURE.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this appendix, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this appendix where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this appendix. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this appendix is presumed to be in violation until such time as that

or type of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. See A ZONE.
   ZONE B, C, and X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)
6.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   6.3.A. LANDS TO WHICH THIS APPENDIX APPLIES.
      This appendix shall apply to all SFHA's within the jurisdiction of the
Town of Waterloo, Indiana.
   6.3.B. BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING REGULATORY FLOOD DATA.
      This appendix's protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best
available regulatory flood data is listed below. Whenever a party disagrees
with the best available data, the party submitting the detailed engineering
study needs to replace existing data with better data and submit it to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and approval.
      1.   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the
studied SFHA's of the Town of Waterloo, Indiana, shall be as delineated on the
100-year flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of DeKalb County, Indiana,
and Incorporated Areas, dated September 29, 2006 and the corresponding FIRM
dated September 29, 2006, as well as any future updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date.
      2.   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each
of the unstudied SFHA's of the Town of Waterloo, Indiana, delineated as an "A
Zone" on the FIRM of Dekalb County, Indiana, and Incorporated Areas shall be
according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources.
   6.3.C. ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
      A Floodplain Development Permit shall be required in conformance with the
provisions of this appendix prior to the commencement of any development
activities in areas of special flood hazard.
   6.3.D. COMPLIANCE.
      No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or
structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of
this appendix and other applicable regulations. No land or stream within the
SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the terms of this
appendix and other applicable regulations.
   6.3.E.    ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
      This appendix is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this appendix and
another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions
shall prevail.
   6.3.F. DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND
   ELEVATIONS.
      1.   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles shall govern.
      2.   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
      3.   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above
the base flood elevation, that site shall be considered outside the SFHA and
the floodplain regulations will not be applied. The property owner should be
advised to apply for a LOMA.
   6.3.G. INTERPRETATION.
      In the interpretation and application of this appendix all provisions
shall be:
      1.   Considered as minimum requirements;
      2.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      3.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   6.3.H. WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
      The degree of flood protection required by this appendix is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this appendix does not create any
liability on the part of the Town of Waterloo, Indiana, the Indiana Department
of Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on this appendix or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder.
   6.3.I. PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
      Failure to obtain a Floodplain Development Permit in the SFHA or failure
to comply with the requirements of a Floodplain Development Permit or
conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this appendix.
All violations shall be considered a common nuisance and be treated as such in
accordance with the provisions of the zoning code for the Town of Waterloo,
Indiana. All violations shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding $50.
      1.   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the
violation continues to exist.
      2.   The Town of Waterloo, Indiana, Planning Commission shall inform the
owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood
damages and therefore may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy
to be suspended.
      3.   Nothing herein shall prevent the Town of Waterloo, Indiana, from
taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs
connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.
6.4 ADMINISTRATION.
   6.4.A. DESIGNATION OF ADMINISTRATOR.

Floodplain Administrator on forms furnished by him or her prior to any
development activities, and may include, but not be limited to, the following
plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and
elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, earthen
fill, storage of materials or equipment, drainage facilities, and the location
of the foregoing. Specifically the following information is required:
      1.   Application stage.
         a.   A description of the proposed development;
         b.   Location of the proposed development sufficient to accurately
locate property and structure in relation to existing roads and streams;
         c.   A legal description of the property site;
         d.   A site development plan showing existing and proposed development
locations and existing and proposed land grades;

floodproofing, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the
Floodplain Administrator a certification of the NAVD88 elevation of the lowest
floor or floodproofed elevation, as built. Said certification shall be prepared
by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or
professional engineer and certified by the same. When floodproofing is utilized
for a particular structure said certification shall be prepared by or under the
direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by
same. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the certification shall be at
the permit holders' risk. (The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest
floor and floodproofing elevation survey data submitted.) The permit holder
shall correct deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is
allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said
corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the
project.
   6.4.C. DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.
      The Floodplain Administrator and/or designated staff is hereby authorized
and directed to enforce the provisions of this appendix. The administrator is

6.4.B;
      11.   Review certified plans and specifications for compliance.
      12.   Stop work orders:
         a.   Upon notice from the Administrator, work on any building,
structure or premises that is being done contrary to the provisions of this
appendix shall immediately cease.
         b.   Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner
of the property, or to his or her agent, or to the person doing the work, and
shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed.
      13.   Revocation of permits:
         a.   The Administrator may revoke a permit or approval, issued under
the provisions of the ordinance, in cases where there has been any false
statement or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application or
plans on which the permit or approval was based.
         b.   The Administrator may revoke a permit upon determination by the
Administrator that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving,
demolition, installation, or replacement of the structure for which the permit
was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of
this appendix.
6.5 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   6.5.A. GENERAL STANDARDS.
      In all SFHA's, the following provisions are required:
      1.   New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure;
      2.   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in
addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting
wind forces;
      3.   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage below the FPG;
      4.   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
      5.   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as
to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding;
      6.   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
      7.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
      8.   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding;
      9.   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a
structure that is in compliance with the provisions of this appendix shall meet
the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this appendix; and
      10.   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a
structure that is not in compliance with the provisions of this appendix, shall
be undertaken only if said non-conformity is not further extended, or replaced.
      11.   Whenever any portion of the SFHA is authorized for use, the volume
of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the
BFE shall be compensated for and balanced by an equivalent volume of excavation
taken below the BFE. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to the
volume of storage lost (replacement ratio of 1 to 1) due to the fill or
structure.
         a.   The excavation shall take place in the floodplain and in the same
immediate watershed in which the authorized fill or structure is located;
         b.   Under certain circumstances, the excavation may be allowed to
take place outside of but adjacent to the floodplain provided that the
excavated volume will be below the regulatory flood elevation, will be in the
same immediate watershed in which the authorized fill or structure is located,
will be accessible to the regulatory flood water, will not be subject to
ponding when not inundated by flood water, and that it shall not be refilled;
         c.   The fill or structure shall not obstruct a drainage way leading
to the floodplain;
         d.   The fill or structure shall be of a material deemed stable enough
to remain firm and in place during periods of flooding and shall include
provisions to protect adjacent property owners against any increased runoff or
drainage resulting from its placement; and
         e.   Plans depicting the areas to be excavated and filled shall be
submitted prior to the actual start of construction or any site work; once site
work is complete, but before the actual start of construction, the applicant
shall provide to the Floodplain Administrator a certified survey of the
excavation and fill sites demonstrating the fill and excavation comply with
Section
6.5.
   6.5.B. SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
      In all SFHA's, the following provisions are required:
      1.   In addition to the requirements of Section
6.5.A, all structures to be located in the SFHA shall be protected from flood
damage below the FPG. This building protection requirement applies to the
following situations:
         a.   Construction or placement of any new structure having a floor
area greater than 400 square feet;
         b.   Structural alterations made to:
            i.   An existing (previously unaltered structure), the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50% of the value of the pre-altered structure
(excluding the value of the land); or
            ii.   Any previously altered structure.
         c.   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged structure that are
valued at more than 50% of the market value of the structure (excluding the
value of the land) before damage occurred;
         d.   Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site for
more than 180 days;
         e.   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new
manufactured home on an existing site. This appendix does not apply to
returning the existing manufactured home to the same site it lawfully occupied
before it was removed to avoid flood damage; and
         f.   Reconstruction or repairs made to a repetitive loss structure.
      2.   Residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the
lowest floor; including basement, at or above the FPG (two feet above the base
flood elevation). Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of
floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of Section
6.5 .B.(4).
      3.   Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure (or
manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to
or above the FPG (two feet above the base flood elevation). Structures located
in all "A Zones" may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated if done in
accordance with the following:
         a.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the structure has been designed so that below the FPG, the structure and
attendant utility
            facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the effects of
the regulatory flood. The structure design shall take into account flood
velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic pressures, and impacts from
debris or ice. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set
forth in Section
6.4.C.(9).
         b.   Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human
intervention and without an outside source of electricity.
      4.   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and
other exterior walls below the base flood elevations shall be designed to
preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of
floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls.
         a.   Designs for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect and meet the following
minimum criteria:
            i.   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of
not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
            ii.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade);
            iii.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions;
            iv.   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to
allow for parking for vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
            v.   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
            vi.   Where elevation requirements exceed six feet above the
highest adjacent grade, a copy of the legally recorded deed restriction
prohibiting the conversion of the area below the lowest floor to a use or
dimension contrary to the structure's originally approved design, shall be
presented as a condition of issuance of the final Certificate of Occupancy.
      5.   Structures constructed on fill. A residential or nonresidential
structure may be constructed on a permanent landfill in accordance with the
following:
         a.   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep
before compacting to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with the Standard
Proctor Test method.
         b.   The fill should extend at least ten feet beyond the foundation of
the structure before sloping below the FPG.
         c.   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during
flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulkheading. If vegetative cover is
used, the slopes shall be no steeper than 3 horizontal to 1 vertical.
         d.   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties.
         e.   The top of the lowest floor including basements shall be at or
above the FPG.
      6.   Standards for structures constructed with a crawlspace. A
residential or nonresidential structure may be constructed with a crawlspace
located below the flood protection grade provided that the following conditions
are met:
         a.   The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
         b.   Any enclosed area below the flood protection grade shall have
openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the automatic
entry and exit of floodwaters. A minimum of one opening on each wall having a
total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of
enclosed area. The bottom of the openings shall be no more than one foot above
grade;
         c.   The interior grade of the crawlspace must be at or above the base
flood elevation;
         d.   The interior height of the crawlspace measured from the interior
grade of the crawlspace to the top of the foundation wall must not exceed four
feet at any point;
         e.   An adequate drainage system must be installed to remove
floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace within a reasonable period
of time after a flood event;
         f.   Portions of the building below the flood protection grade must be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; and
         g.   Utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated above the
flood protection grade.
      7.   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially
improved on a site for more than 180 days must meet one of the following
requirements:
         a.   The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent foundation
such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and securely anchored
to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement. This requirement applies to all manufactured homes to be
placed on a site:
            i.   Outside a manufactured home park or subdivision;
            ii.   In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
            iii.   In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision; or
            iv.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which
a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood.
         b.   The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the lowest floor
of the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other
foundation elevations that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and
be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. This requirement applies to all
manufactured homes to be placed on a site in an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision that has not been substantially damaged by a flood.
         c.   Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either:
            i.   Be on site for less than 180 days;
            ii.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (defined as being
on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions); or
            iii.   Meet the requirements for "manufactured homes" as stated
earlier in this section.
   6.5.C. STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
      1.   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
      2.   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
      3.   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
      4.   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres.
   6.5.D. CRITICAL FACILITY.
      Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities
shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and
sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be
displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above
the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
   6.5.E. STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
      Located within SFHA's, established in Section
6.3.B, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of non-substantial additions/ improvements to residences in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in a
floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if
fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval
(construction in a floodway permit) for the fill is required from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.)
      No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a permit
(when applicable) has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources granting approval for construction in a floodway. Once a permit for
construction in a floodway has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain
Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in Section
6.5 of this appendix have been met. The Floodplain Development Permit cannot be
less restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community's more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
      No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in combination with
existing or future development, will increase the regulatory flood more than
0.14 of one foot; and
      For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the Town of Waterloo, Indiana, shall submit the data and request that
the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data.
   6.5.F. STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
      If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit provided the
provisions contained in Section
6.5 of this appendix have been met. The key provision is that the top of the
lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or
above the FPG.
   6.5.G. STANDARDS FOR SFHA’S WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION    AND/
OR FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
      1.   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
         If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
         No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until either
a permit for construction in a floodway or a floodplain analysis/regulatory
assessment citing the 100-year flood elevation and the recommended Flood
Protection Grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
         Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit for
construction in a floodway or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment
approving the proposed development, a Floodplain Development Permit may be
issued provided the conditions of the Floodplain Development Permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in Section
6.5 of this appendix have been met.
      2.   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
         If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodway, fringe and 100 year flood elevation for the site.
         Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in Section
6.5 of this appendix have been met.
      3.   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and will not increase flood
damages or potential flood damages.
6.6 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   6.6.A. DESIGNATION OF VARIANCE AND APPEALS BOARD.
      The Town of Waterloo, Indiana, Board of Zoning Appeals as established by
the Town Council of the Town of Waterloo, Indiana, shall hear and decide
appeals and requests for variances from requirements of this appendix.
   6.6.B. DUTIES OF VARIANCE AND APPEALS BOARD.
      The Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in
any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Floodplain
Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this appendix. Any person
aggrieved by the decision of the Board may appeal such decision to the Superior
or Circuit Court of DeKalb County, Indiana, as provided in I.C. 36-7-4-1000
series.
   6.6.C. VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
      In passing upon such applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards
specified in other sections of this appendix; and
      1.   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      2.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      3.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      4.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      6.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      7.   The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and
Floodplain Management Program for that area;
      8.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      9.   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
of transport of the floodwaters at the site; and
      10.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
   6.6.D. CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
      1.   Variances shall only be issued when there is:
         a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship; and
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
      2.   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to
Section
6.5.D or Section
6.5.F of this appendix may be granted.
      3.   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to Section
6.5.D or Section
6.5.F of this appendix will require a permit from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources.
      4.   Variances to the Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction of Section
6.5.B may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
      5.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      6.   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of
any structure individually listed on the Register of Historic Places or the
Indiana State Survey of Historic Architectural, Archaeological and Cultural
Sites, Structures, Districts, and Objects.
      7.   Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation (See Section
6.6.E, below).
      8.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request (See Section
6.6.E, below).
   6.6.E. VARIANCE NOTIFICATION.
      Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice
over the signature of a community official that:
      1.   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      2.   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property. A copy of the notice shall by recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the County Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
      The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
   6.6.F. HISTORIC STRUCTURE.
      Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic
structures" upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an "historic
structure" and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character
and design of the structure.
   6.6.G. SPECIAL CONDITIONS.
      Upon the consideration of the factors listed in Section
6.6, and the purposes of this appendix, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach
such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
the purposes of this appendix.
6.7 SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of this appendix is held to be
invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said
holding shall in no way effect the validity of the remaining portions of this
appendix.
6.8 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This appendix shall take effect upon its passage by the Town Council of the
Town of Waterloo, Indiana.
(Ord. 05-03, passed 7-12-05)
SECTION 7: NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES, AND USES
7.1 INTENT.
   Upon adoption of this appendix and zoning map, some buildings, structures,
lots, and uses may no longer conform to the regulations of the zoning district
where they are located. These were lawful before this appendix was passed or
amended, but they are prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of
this appendix, or may be under future amendments of this appendix.
   It is the intent of this appendix to permit these nonconforming uses to
continue until they are removed, and not to encourage their survival. It is
further the intent of this appendix that nonconforming uses shall not be
enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other
structures or uses which are prohibited elsewhere in the same district. (Note:
Illegal uses existing at the same time this appendix is enacted shall not be
validated by virtue of its enactment.)
   Within the districts established by this appendix, or by amendments that may
later be adopted, there may exist:
   A.   Nonconforming lots;
   B.   Nonconforming uses of land;
   C.   Nonconforming structures;
   D.   Nonconforming uses of land and structures in combination; and
   E.   Nonconforming characteristics of use.
7.2 INCOMPATIBILITY OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   Nonconforming uses are declared by this appendix to be incompatible with
permitted uses in the districts in which such use is located. A nonconforming
use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a
structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after
passage of this appendix in any manner that would be generally prohibited in
the district in which such use is located.
7.3 AVOIDANCE OF UNDUE HARDSHIP.
   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this appendix shall be deemed to require
a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building or
development on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this appendix and upon which actual
building construction has been carried on diligently. Where demolition or
removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to
rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction, provided that the work shall be carried on diligently. Actual
construction is hereby defined as work done which is beyond the preparation
stage and into that stage where the changes or additions are made permanent.
7.4 SINGLE NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-
family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single
lot of record after the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
appendix, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this
appendix. Such lots must be in separate ownership or included in a subdivision
of record in the office of the County Recorder at the time of passage of this
appendix. This provision shall apply even though such lots fail to meet the
requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the
district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those
applying area or width, or both, of the lots shall conform to the regulations
for the district in which such lots are located. Variances from the
requirements listed in
Sections 3 and
4 of this appendix, other than lot area or lot width, shall be obtained only
through action of the Board of Zoning Appeals as provided in Section
11.10. (Note: This shall apply only to single-family residences.)
7.5 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD IN COMBINATION.
   If two or more lots or a combination of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this appendix and if all or part of the lots with no buildings do
not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the land involved
shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this appendix
and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which
diminishes compliance with the lot width and area requirements established by
this appendix, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot
having its width or area below the requirements stated in this appendix.
 
7.6 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where, at the time of adoption of this appendix, lawful uses of land exist
which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this appendix, the
uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, provided:
   A.   No such nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this appendix.
   B.   No such nonconforming uses shall be moved in a whole or in part to any
portion of a lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this appendix.
   C.   If any such nonconforming uses of land are discontinued or abandoned
for more than one year (except when a construction project conducted by the
state, county, or town impedes access to the premises), any subsequent use of
such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this appendix for the
district in which such land is located.
   D.   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
appendix shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
7.7 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this appendix that could not now be built under the terms of this
appendix by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its
location on the lot, bulk, or other requirements concerning the structure, such
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
   A.   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way,
except that which increases its nonconformity, but the size of any structure or
portion thereof may be reduced to decrease its nonconformity.
   B.   Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of a
structure be destroyed by any means to the extent of more than 50% of the fair
market value of the building immediately prior to the damage, it shall not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this appendix.
Structures made nonconforming by the action of the government are not subject
to this restriction.
   C.   Should such structure be moved for any reason, it shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is
moved.
7.8 NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES AND LAND IN COMBINATION.
   If a lawful use involving individual structures, or if a structure and land
in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
appendix that would not now be allowed in the district under the terms of this
appendix, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this appendix
in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
   B.   A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any interior parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this appendix, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building.
   C.   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use shall not
thereafter be resumed.
   D.   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for more than one year (except when a
construction project conducted by the state, county, or town impedes access to
the premises), the structure or structure and land in combination, shall not
thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in
which it is located.
   E.   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
7.9 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on
ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures,
wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding 30% of the net assessed value
established by the DeKalb County Assessors Office of the nonconforming
structure and net assessed value of real estate, or nonconforming portion of
the structure, whichever the case may be, provided that the cubic content
existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.

(Ord. 05-03, passed 7-12-05)
SECTION 8: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
8.1 INTENT OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   The purpose of this section is to allow innovative and diverse design in
land development that is consistent with the adopted Comprehensive Plan and the
intent of this appendix. (The goal is to provide a variety of environmentally
appropriate residential, nonresidential, and mixed-use developments to meet the
needs of the community). Planned Unit Development (PUD) zoning is encouraged in
the following contexts:
   A.   To accommodate compatible development in environmentally sensitive
locations.
   B.   To enhance compatibility with surrounding land uses.
   C.   To permit a harmonious variety of uses within a single development.
   D.   To promote efficiency and thus economy by clustering structures and/or
by using shared facilities or services.
   E.   To foster new site treatments not contemplated in other kinds of zones.
8.2 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.
   PUD zones are not identified on the zoning maps in advance. PUD zones are
the result of a public hearing to rezone a specific parcel(s) to a new PUD zone
based on the negotiated development plan between the petitioner(s), Plan
Commission, the Zoning Administrator, and representatives of the checkpoint
agencies. The provisions of
Section 3 of this appendix shall not be applied, or be applicable, to a PUD
zone or district since the negotiated development plan determines the nature of
the PUD district.
8.3 ORIGINATION OF PROPOSALS.
   A request to rezone from any other zoning classification to a PD zone may be
initiated by: (1) the Waterloo Town Council; (2) the Waterloo Plan Commission;
(3) all owners of the property in question; or (4) any group of owners united
in interest acting jointly under an agreement to carry out the proposal in
separate ownership.
   The negotiated agreement is the substance of a PD zone. Therefore, a request
for a PD zoning classification shall include among the petitioners either: (1)
all owners of the property within the current planned unit development; or (2)
the owners association acting on behalf of a majority of property owners in the
current planned unit development, as constituted in the recorded bylaws.
   PD zoning is mandatory for any new condominium construction or condominium
conversion.
8.4 CLASSIFICATIONS OF PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS.
   To identify the nature of planned unit developments on zoning maps, they
shall be classified as one of the following four zones:
   A.   PD-R Residential Planned Development. Any development consisting of not
less than five acres in which more than 80% of the interior floor area of all
buildings to be included in the development is used for residential purposes or
those accessory purposes customarily related to residential uses.
   B.   PD-B Business Planned Development. Any development consisting of not
less than four acres in which 80% of the interior floor area of all buildings
to be included in the development is to be used for commercial purposes.
   C.   PD-I Industrial Planned Development. Any development consisting of not
less than ten acres in which 80% of the total interior and exterior area of all
sites and structures is to be used for manufacturing, warehousing, or other
light to medium intensity industrial use.
   D.   PD-E Planned Development-Extraordinary. A development not otherwise
distinguishable under any previous classification, containing less than the
minimum land area and/or less than the stated minimum proportions of any single
dominant use or function, and in which the proposed uses of interior and
exterior spaces require unusual design flexibility to achieve a completely
logical and complementary conjunction of uses and functions.
8.5 PRE-SUBMISSION CONFERENCE.
   Before filing a rezoning petition seeking any PD classification, the
petitioner shall arrange a meeting with the Zoning Administrator. The
petitioner shall bring a scaled site plan of the proposed planned unit
development to the meeting. The site plan should show the location of proposed
uses and major buildings, layout and classification of roads, all entrances and
exits, and any environmental sensitive areas. Also, the petitioner shall bring
a chart detailing the phasing and a time frame for development.
   Discussion at the meeting shall include but not be limited to:
   A.   The proposed treatment of environmentally sensitive areas;
   B.   The petitioner's intentions and objectives regarding land use, street
improvements, and utilities;
   C.   The petitioners' intentions assuring compatibility between uses
proposed for the perimeter of the PUD and surrounding land uses and zoning
classifications;
   D.   The general availability of utilities to the site;
   E.   The areas’ current zoning pattern;
   F.   The classification of the proposed rezoning to a PD category.
   The Zoning Administrator shall continue the pre-submission conference from
time to time.
8.6 FILING PROCEDURE.
   After the pre-submission conference, if the petitioner wishes to proceed,
the petitioner may file a re-zoning petition for one of the PD zoning
classifications.

      If the petitioner fails to meet the Preliminary Development Plan
submission requirement within six months of the required review meeting, his or
her rezoning petition shall be void. Thereafter, if the petitioner wishes to
continue the project, the petitioner must begin again with Section
8.5 of this appendix.
8.9 PRELIMINARY PLAN HEARING AND DISPOSITION.
   The rezoning petition and Preliminary Development Plan shall be heard by the
Plan Commission as a petition for an amendment to the official zoning map.
After the conclusion of the public hearing, the Plan Commission shall forward
the petition and the Preliminary Development Plan to the Town Council with one
of the following recommendations: Favorable, Unfavorable, or No Recommendation.
   During the hearing process, the Plan Commission may require changes to the
Preliminary Development Plan. Those changes may relate to the proposed site and
may include, but are not limited to, drainage, lighting, streets and entrances,
building locations, screening, signage, utilities, and landscape plans. In the
event that the Plan Commission requires such changes, the petitioner shall
either agree to the changes and revise the Preliminary Development Plan
accordingly or withdraw the Preliminary Development Plan, which will require a
new Preliminary Plan Hearing.
   If the Commission forwards the petition and Preliminary Development Plan to
the Town Council, three sets of the full-size Preliminary Development Plan
shall be stamped with the Plan Commission recommendation and signed by the
President and Secretary of the Commission. Distribution of the plan sets shall
be as follows: One set shall be certified to the Town Council, one set shall be
retained by the Plan Commission, and one set shall be returned to the
petitioner.
   The Waterloo Town Council may approve or deny the certified Preliminary
Development Plan, but shall not have the authority to amend the Preliminary
Development Plan. If adopted by the Town Council, the petitioner, in order to
proceed, shall prepare and submit Final Detailed Plans.
8.10 APPROVAL OF FINAL DETAILED PLANS.
   If the petitioner wishes to continue, the petitioner shall submit the Final
Detailed Plans. A complete Final Detail Plans Submission shall contain the

issued, nor development activity begun, until the Zoning Administrator
determines the final submission is complete, the checkpoint agency approvals
are received in writing and the Zoning Administrator approves the Final
Detailed Plan.
      If public improvements or improvements for common usage are to be
installed by the petitioner, such improvements must be completed after approval
of the Final Detailed Plan, but before work on the dwelling units commences.
Otherwise, surety must be provided before an improvement location permit will
be issued for a dwelling unit. Surety must be 10% of the cost of construction
of the public or common improvement as determined by a qualified engineer or
land surveyor. A planned unit development containing common facilities shall be
provided with an owners’ association or other private organization responsible
to and controlled by the property owners. This organization's purpose is to

8.11 RECORDING APPROVED FINAL DETAILED DEVELOPMENT PLANS.
   The petitioner shall record the Final Detailed Plans, after approval by the
Zoning Administrator, in the Office of the DeKalb County Recorder before any
development, construction, earth moving activity, or application for
improvement location permits shall occur.
8.12 AMENDMENT OF THE APPROVED FINAL DETAILED DEVELOPMENT PLANS.
   The petitioner may wish to make changes to the Approved Final Detailed Plans
after recordation. The Zoning Administrator shall make a determination if the
changes constitute a minor modification or a major modification. An approved
written determination of minor modification by the Zoning Administrator shall
be attached to the Amended Final Plans before recording. A major modification
will require rezoning.
   A minor modification cannot include: (1) any increase in residential
density; (2) any decrease in residential density of 10% or more; (3) any change
in building dimension or location other than within the defined building
envelope; (4) any change in lot lines; (5) any change in landscaping other than
substitution of species or redesign with the same materials; (6) any alteration
in the size and/or location of signage; (7) any change in the alignment or
intersection of streets; (8) or any change in restrictive covenants, or
horizontal property ownership and owner's association documents regarding the
items (1)-(7) above.
   The petitioner shall provide the Zoning Administrator an as-built survey
locating buildings and common lot lines after the foundations are in place for
all condominium or attached zero lot line projects. As-built drawings shall
also be submitted for any sanitary sewers, storm sewers, drainage swales,
retention or detention basins, water lines, and streets for which the Town of
Waterloo will assume ownership, if any, after completion of the development,
but prior to transfer of said ownership. The revised plan needs to be submitted
to and approved by the Zoning Administrator and recorded as an As-Built Drawing
of the Final Detailed Development Plans. If development occurs in phases, As-
Built Drawings shall be submitted within 180 days of completion of public
utilities and streets for each phase.
   Changes to restrictive covenants and any horizontal property ownership and
owners association documents can only be initiated by a majority of property
owners within the planned unit development. Multiple owners of a single unit
shall be considered one owner. The developer shall be considered a single owner
until all property is sold. The proposed changes shall be reviewed by the
Zoning Administrator and the determination made as to whether the changes
amount to a minor or major modification. The disposition of the minor or major
modification shall be made as stated in
8.12 above.
8.13 CONSTRUCTION.
   A.   No construction or installation work shall be done on any public
improvements until the petitioner has, at least 48 hours in advance, notified
the Zoning Administrator, and any affected utility, of his/her intention to
begin such work, in order that inspections may be made as the work progresses.
Inspections shall be at the developer's expense.
   B.   All development shall be in conformity with the approved and recorded
Final Detailed Development Plan, and any material deviations from the approved
and recorded Final Detailed Development Plan shall be subject to appropriate
enforcement action as provided for in this appendix.
8.14 EXTENSIONS, ABANDONMENT, AND EXPIRATION.
   A.   Extensions of the time for accomplishing any matters set forth herein
may be granted by the Plan Commission at a public hearing for good cause shown.
   B.   Upon the abandonment of a development authorized under this section
(abandonment shall be deemed to have occurred when no improvements have been
made pursuant to the approved Final Detailed Development Plan for 24
consecutive months), or upon the expiration of five years from the approval of
a Final Detailed Development Plan for a development which has not been
completed, an amendment may be initiated by the Plan Commission, as provided by
law, to the zoning map so that the land will be zoned into a category or
categories which most nearly approximate its then existing use or such other
zoning category or categories which the Plan Commission deems appropriate.
8.15 LIMITATION OF REZONING.
   The Plan Commission shall not initiate any amendments to the zoning map
concerning the property involved in a Planned Development before completion of
the development as long as the development is in conformity with the approved
Final Detailed Planned Development and is proceeding in accordance with the
time requirements imposed herein.

      3.   Clear vision area. No part of any sign or sign structure, including
supports, shall be located within a clear vision area except directional signs,
which must be less than three feet in height. A sign may project or extend into
a clear vision area only if the sign's lowest edge is greater than eight feet
above ground level or if the sign is less than three feet in total height. A
clear vision area is described as:
         a.   An area formed by the intersection of the right-of-way lines of
two public roadways and a line connecting points measured 25 feet from the

Zoning Administrator shall give the owner ten days' written notice to remove
it. Upon failure to comply with this notice, the Zoning Administrator, or his/
her duly authorized representative, may remove the sign at cost to the owner.

matters relating to sign relocations.
   F.   Assurance of discontinuance. As an additional means of enforcement, the
Zoning Administrator may accept an assurance of discontinuance of any act or
practice deemed in violation of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant
thereto, from any owner or person engaging in such act or practice. Such
assurance shall be in writing and shall specify a time limit during which said
discontinuance is to be accomplished. Failure to perform the assurance shall
constitute prima fascia proof of a violation of this appendix or any rule or
regulation adopted pursuant thereto, which makes the alleged act or practice
unlawful for the purpose of securing any injunctive relief from a court of
competent jurisdiction.
9.5 NONCONFORMING USES AND SIGNS.
   Signs that existed prior (nonconforming) to the time this appendix was
passed and were in conformance with previous ordinances will be legally
nonconforming (grandfathered) until such time a major change is made to the
sign. Major changes include changing the name, changing the size, adding
lights, refurbishing, and/or relocation.
   All signs shall be kept in good repair and safe, neat, clean and attractive
condition. In the event signs are not kept in said condition, or are demolished
by any force whatsoever to the extent of 50% or more of the fair market value
of the sign structure, then the sign must be completely demolished or repaired/
replaced in conformance with this appendix.
   Nonconforming signs, which are structurally altered, relocated, or replaced,
shall comply immediately with all provisions of this appendix. Nothing in this
appendix shall be construed to give a legal status to any sign without a sign
permit.

11.9 SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.

in which this appendix authorizes special exceptions without a recommendation
by the Zoning Administrator and approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
Further, no previous applications shall set a precedent for any other
application before the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   B.   The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant a special exception for a use in
a district if, after a public hearing, it makes written findings of facts,
that:
      1.   The requirements and development standards for the requested use as
prescribed by this appendix will be met;
      2.   Granting the special exception will not subvert the general purposes
served by this appendix and will not be harmful to other properties or uses in
the same district and vicinity;
      3.   The nature, size and location will be compatible with the immediate
area; and
      4.   The use does not conflict with the Comprehensive Plan.
   C.   The Board of Zoning Appeals may impose such reasonable conditions upon
its approval, to find that the requirements of subsection B above will be
satisfied.
   D.   The Board of Zoning Appeals may permit or require the owner of the
parcel of property to make a written commitment concerning the use or
development of the parcel as specified in I.C. 36-7-4-921 and have such
commitment recorded in the DeKalb County Recorder's Office.
   E.   The granting of a special exception is unnecessary for a use if that
use existed on the date this appendix was adopted. However, this subsection
shall not authorize the expansion of such a use if it involves the enlargement
of a building, structure, or land area.
   F.   A use authorized by special exception may not be expanded, extended, or
enlarged unless reauthorized by the Board of Zoning Appeals under the
procedures set forth in this appendix for granting a special exception.
   G.   A special exception, granted for a specific use ceases to be authorized
and is void if that use is not established within a 12 month period of the date
the special exception was granted, or if that use is discontinued at that site
for a 12 month period during which time it is not succeeded by the same use
specifically authorized as a special exception.
   H.   A special exception may be terminated by the Board of Zoning Appeals,
upon filing of an application by an interested person, a member of the staff,
or the Zoning Administrator, and upon a finding at a public hearing, with
notice to the property owner, that the terms of this appendix, or conditions of
approval or commitments have not been complied with.
11.10 VARIANCES.
   A.   The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant a variance of use from the terms
of the zoning ordinance if, after a public hearing, it makes a determination in
the form of findings of fact in writing, that:
      1.   The approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety,
morals, and general welfare of the community;
      2.   The use and value of the area adjacent to the property included in
the variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse manner;
      3.   The need for the variance arises from some condition particular to
the property involved;
      4.   The strict application of the terms of the zoning ordinance will
constitute an unnecessary hardship if applied to the property for which the
variance is sought;
      5.   The approval does not substantially interfere with the town's
Comprehensive Plan.
   B.   The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant a variance from development
standards (such as height, bulk, area) of the zoning ordinance if, after a
public hearing, it makes a determination in the form of findings of facts in
writing, that:
      1.   The approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety,
morals, and general welfare of the community;
      2.   The use and value of the area adjacent to the property will not be
affected in a substantially adverse manner; and
      3.   The strict application of the terms of the zoning ordinance will
result in practical difficulties in the use of the property.
   C.   Whether unnecessary hardships exist, (for a use variance), or whether
practical difficulties exist, (for a development standard variance), there are
fact questions to be determined by the Board. No single fact determines what
constitutes unnecessary hardship, but all relevant factors taken together, must
indicate such special conditions that the property cannot reasonably be put to
a conforming use because of the limitations imposed by its classification under
the zoning ordinance. The existence of unnecessary hardship is not governed by
the size of the particular piece of property with respect to which the hardship
is claimed. A petitioner for a variance from applicable development standards,
seeking to establish practical difficulties in use of the property generally
must prove significant economic injury from the enforcement of the zoning
ordinance. The Board may also consider in determining the existence of
practical difficulties whether any feasible alternative is available within the
terms of the ordinance, which will achieve the same goals for the landowner.
   D.   A use variance granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals shall run with
the land unless otherwise specifically provided, in writing, by the Board of
Zoning Appeals.
   E.   Failure to comply with any conditions imposed by the Board of Zoning
Appeals or any commitments made or required by the Board of Zoning Appeals in
granting a variance shall be deemed in violation of the zoning ordinance and
may be enforced as any other zoning ordinance violation.
