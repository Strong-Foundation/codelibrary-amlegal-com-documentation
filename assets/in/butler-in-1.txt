CODE ENFORCEMENT POLICY GUIDELINES
§ 30.40 ADOPTION OF STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES.
   The city may adopt additional standard operating procedures to implement
city code provisions relating to code enforcement and these policies.
(Ord. 1690, passed 8-5-19)
§ 30.41 INTERPRETATION.
   These policies and procedures are to be interpreted to maximize both the
efficiency of city code enforcement and compliance with city codes. Nothing in
this policy manual shall be interpreted to require the city to act or to
refrain from acting to establish a standard of care for city actions.
(Ord. 1690, passed 8-5-19)
§ 30.42 CODE ENFORCEMENT.
   Code enforcement should follow the priority ranking in §
30.43 but be flexible to allow enforcement that fits the type and circumstance
of the code violation(s).
   (A)   Enforcement mechanisms. Enforcement mechanisms available to the city
include:
      (1)   Obtaining voluntary compliance;
      (2)   Mediated settlement of code violation complaints;
      (3)   Notice of violation (“NOV”);
      (4)   Citation and prosecution of ordinance violations in City Court;
      (5)   Petition for injunction in circuit or superior court;
      (6)   Stop work order;
      (7)   Permit revocation;
      (8)   Nuisance abatement;
      (9)   Unsafe building enforcement;
      (10)   Restricting issuance of permits on property with uncorrected code
violations;
      (11)   Assisting in enforcement by other regulatory and licensing
agencies; and
      (12)   Any other remedy under city code or existing law.
   Not all enforcement mechanisms may be applicable in a particular situation.
   (B)   Enforcement mechanism options. The enforcement mechanisms are not
mutually exclusive, and may be used alone, in sequence or in combination with
other mechanisms. In most cases, the city will use the lowest level of
enforcement to assure compliance, but may use any enforcement mechanism.
(Ord. 1690, passed 8-5-19)
§ 30.43 PRIORITIES FOR CODE ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Priority cases. The following cases are priorities for enforcement:
      (1)   Violations presenting an imminent threat to public health and
safety;
      (2)   Violations affecting rivers, streams and/or adjacent riparian
areas;
      (3)   Building code violations consisting of ongoing non-permitted
construction or failure to obtain permits for construction started after the
effective date of this manual;
      (4)   Land use violations occurring after the effective date of this
manual including failure to meet conditions of approval; and
      (5)   Building and planning permit violations occurring after the
effective date of this manual including failure to obtain required permits or
failure to meet conditions and requirements of permits.
   (B)   Non-priority cases. All other cases are non-priority.
(Ord. 1690, passed 8-5-19)
§ 30.44 SCOPE OF CODE ENFORCEMENT.
   These policies apply to civil enforcement of alleged code violations. The
city does not enforce covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&Rs) or other
private agreements. The city does not resolve private disputes among third
parties. Nothing in these policies limits or applies to actions by private
parties to obtain compliance with city code.
(Ord. 1690, passed 8-5-19)
§ 30.45 INITIATION OF CODE ENFORCEMENT.
   Code enforcement may be initiated by any of the following methods:
   (A)   Citizen complaint. Any person may make a complaint to the city
alleging one or more code violations.
      (1)   Form. A citizen’s complaint may be made on a city complaint form.
      (2)   Anonymous complaints. The city’s policy is to not accept anonymous
code violation complaints. Nothing in this policy precludes the city from
investigating any violation.
      (3)   Confidentiality. The city’s policy is to maintain the
confidentiality of code enforcement complaint files and computer records,
including the identity of the complainant, to the extent legally possible. The
city believes it is important to maintain confidentiality to assure effective
investigation and prosecution of code violations. In addition, the city
recognizes that some complainants do not want their names disclosed to the
alleged code violator for fear of retaliation. However, in some cases, it may
be necessary for successful prosecution and enforcement for the complainant to
be identified and to testify in court.
         (a)   Code enforcement files will be maintained as confidential files
throughout investigation, infraction prosecution and/or other types of code
enforcement.
         (b)   The contents of code enforcement files will not be disclosed to
anyone other than city staff who have a reason to know and who are involved in
the investigation, or to similar staff of an agency with which the city is
cooperating. The contents of the file will not be disclosed to any other until:
(1) the investigation is complete and a discovery request is made; or (2) the
file is closed and disclosure is made pursuant to the Indiana Public Records
Act.
   (B)   Observation. City staff may initiate enforcement any time a violation
is observed.
   (C)   Permit/approval condition. City staff shall conduct timely monitoring
of ongoing conditions of approval for all permits and approvals as staffing and
time resources allow.
   (D)   General. Information from other sources may reveal code violations and
may be investigated.
(Ord. 1690, passed 8-5-19)
§ 30.46 ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Voluntary compliance without penalty.
      (1)   Policy. It is the city’s policy to encourage voluntary code
compliance by providing code violators and other responsible persons with the
opportunity during code enforcement to comply with the codes with little or no
penalty. Voluntary compliance generally is less expensive for all parties and
of a more satisfactory and lasting nature than involuntary compliance.
      (2)   In some cases, allowing code violators the opportunity to
voluntarily comply may result in abuse of this opportunity in order to delay
compliance. Therefore, a time frame for compliance should be part of any
voluntary compliance.
      (3)   Voluntary compliance without penalty or cost recovery will not be
allowed where the alleged violator is a repeat offender either on the subject
property or by the code violator, or where the original violation was not
corrected following the prior code enforcement action.
      (4)   Following the issuance of a NOV, if the alleged violator admits the
violation(s) and requests extended time for voluntary compliance, the alleged
violator shall sign a “voluntary compliance agreement.” The agreement shall
provide that, in exchange for the extended time for voluntary compliance, the
alleged violator agrees to abate the violation(s) by a specified time, and
consent to judgment against him/her if voluntary compliance is not obtained
during the extended time allowed by the city and a citation is filed in court.
   (B)   Notice of violation.
      (1)   The city may issue a notice of violation (“NOV”) to the property
owner and any responsible party when there are reasonable grounds to believe a
violation did or does occur.
      (2)   NOVs shall be sent by certified mail to the most recent known
address for the property owner(s) and other responsible person(s). The NOV
shall establish a deadline for compliance.
   (C)   Citation and complaint.
      (1)   Where voluntary compliance is not obtained within a reasonable
time, a citation may be issued as provided by the City Code.
      (2)   Citations may be on a uniform citation and complaint form or any
other form approved by the City Attorney.
   (D)   Injunctions. The city may seek an injunction in accordance with state
or local laws.
   (E)   Stop work orders.
      (1)   The city may issue stop work orders to assure compliance with
permits and approvals or when otherwise authorized by applicable law.
      (2)   A stop work order may be issued for non-compliance with permits or
approvals or for doing work without a permit or approval when a permit or
approval is required.
      (3)   If construction, installation or land use activity continues after
the issuance of a stop work order, the activity shall be reported to code
enforcement. The City Planner or designee shall cite the violator.
   (F)   Permit revocation. Certain city codes authorize the revocation of
permits or approvals for failure to comply with their requirements or
conditions. Permit revocation may be pursued when corrective action may not be
effective due to the nature of the violation or the deliberateness of the code
violator’s actions.
   (G)   Nuisance abatement. Chapter 93 of the City Code authorizes the
abatement of code violations that are defined as “nuisances.”
   (H)   Unsafe building abatement. The city has adopted the Indiana Unsafe
Building Law (IC 36-7-9 et seq.) as part of its building code and will follow
the procedures in that document.
   (I)   City cost recovery. The city incurs costs investigating code
violations and enforcing codes. The include the cost of personnel and
equipment, legal advice and representation, service of summons, and
administrative expenses. It is the policy of the city to maximize code
enforcement and to increase the incentives for code compliance by recovering
its reasonable code enforcement costs from code violators when authorized by
state or local law.
   (J)   Liens. The city may use liens as a means of cost recovery as permitted
under state or local law.
   (K)   Civil action.
      (1)   The city, pursuant to IC 36-1-6-1 et seq., may bring a civil action
for the enforcement of ordinances in the circuit or superior court of DeKalb
County, Indiana.
      (2)   The city has discretionary power to request the court for any of
the following remedies:
         (a)   Injunction;
         (b)   Judgment;
         (c)   Continuous enforcement order;
         (d)   Suspension or revocation of license;
         (e)   Order an inspection;
         (f)   Order the property to be vacated;
         (g)   Order the structure to be demolished;
         (h)   Impose a penalty;
         (i)   Impose court costs and fees;
         (j)   Order compliance without a specified amount of time; or
         (k)   Order the city to bring the property into compliance.
(Ord. 1690, passed 8-5-19)
§ 30.47 FILE CLOSURE.
   (A)   Code enforcement files may be closed for the following reasons:
      (1)   When no code violation is found after investigation;
      (2)   When there is voluntary compliance;
      (3)   When a judgment is entered resolving the matter;
      (4)   When an injunction has been issued and the property owner or other
responsible party has corrected the violation(s);
      (5)   When investigation and prosecution of the violation(s) have been
completed by a federal or state agency to which the city deferred code
enforcement; or
      (6)   When it is determined in writing by the city, that the code
violation(s) are not likely to be successfully resolved within a reasonable
timeline, due to factors outside the city’s control.
   (B)   The city may send written notice to the complainant when the complaint
is resolved, describing the resolution.

§ 34.18 FIRE COST RECOVERY AND REIMBURSEMENT FUND.
   (A)   (1)   The City of Butler WFST Fire Department is authorized to seek
reimbursement for fire, safety, and rescue responses, hazardous material and
environmental incidents as specified in the ESRV by statute as follows:
      (a)   For initial response with a fire engine, a fire truck, or a fire
apparatus, including a hazardous material response unit, or a fire rescue unit
dispatched on a fire or hazardous material incident.
      (b)   For each hour or fraction thereof as on-scene assistance.
      (c)   For expendable materials such as absorption materials, emulsifiers,
or other agents used in cleanup operations, the actual replacement cost of
those materials.
      (d)   For collection of debris, chemicals, fuel, or contaminated
materials resulting from a spill, the actual cost of removal and disposal at an
authorized location.
      (2)   It is recognized that the duties of fire companies require
specialized fire/safety/emergency/rescue/environmental/ hazardous material,
tools, equipment, materials, supplies and specialized training in order to
provide for the safety of the public served. Such requirements, as well as the
response to emergency situations involving, and/or caused by, non-resident
individuals, places a tremendous financial burden on said fire companies and
the communities that support them. While taxes, if applicable, may provide the
fire companies sufficient financial assistance to exist, in an effort to avoid
ever-increasing tax burdens on the residents of the City of Butler and
surrounding townships, it is determined that emergency service cost
reimbursement (i.e., response billing) should be authorized in order to defray
the cost of services provided.
      (3)   To grant the City of Butler WFST Volunteer Fire Department or any
successor company operating in the City of Butler or surrounding townships the
authority to seek reimbursement for all reasonable costs of responding to such
incidents, as well as all reasonable costs to recoup such costs for apparatus,
materials, equipment, tools, and personnel, as well the ability of its billing
agent to collect administrative fees based upon their calculated percentage of
fees.
   (B)   Recovery of costs.
      (1)   (a)   Fire departments are authorized to recover the reasonable
costs of the use of emergency fire and/or rescue (including, but not limited
to, vehicle accidents) personnel hours, tools, equipment, materials and
vehicles; hazardous material and/or environmental response personnel hours,
tools, equipment, materials and vehicles; and reasonable interest on any amount
due from the date of the response forward. Additionally, fire departments are
authorized to collect a reasonable flat-rate fee for any false alarm responses
or fire drill responses for which the fire department did not receive at least
48 hours prior notice.
         (b)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as limiting any
amounts fire departments are authorized to collect under any applicable state
statute or law.
      (2)   The reasonable costs authorized to be billed for under this section
may be recovered directly by the Fire Department or through a third party
billing service as an authorized agent for the collection of such costs.
      (3)   The reimbursement rates for the aforementioned costs shall be set
by the billing company.
      (4)   If a third party billing service is utilized, said third party
billing service shall be authorized to charge a service charge in addition to
the costs it is recovering for the Fire Department. Said service charge will be
set by the third party billing service.
      (5)   All funds recovered under this section, and due to the Fire
Department, shall be remitted directly to the Fire Department by either the
responsible party or, if a third party billing service is utilized, by said
third party billing service. All funds recovered under this section shall be
exclusively used for the support of the Fire Department.
      (6)   The Fire Department or third party billing service shall only have
the authority to recover the costs authorized under this section from the
applicable insurance company/carrier of the party responsible for the costs
authorized to be billed for under this section. In the event that collection
costs and/or attorney's fees are incurred by the Fire Department or third party
billing service as a result of the efforts required to obtain full
reimbursement for the costs billed for under this section, said collection
costs and/or attorney's fees may be recovered by the Fire Department or third
parry billing service from the applicable insurance company/carrier of the
parry responsible for the costs authorized to be billed for under this section.
   (C)   All monies recovered by the City of Butler WFST Fire Department for
services provided shall be remitted or paid to the Clerk-Treasurer for the City
of Butler.
   (D)   The Fire Chief or his designee shall be responsible for collection of
all recovered monies and doing all necessary paperwork for the recovery of said
sums and transmitting said funds to the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (E)   All such monies that are recovered for services rendered by the City
of Butler WFST Fire Department shall be deposited in the Fire Cost Recovery and
Reimbursement Fund and dispersed or used for Fire Department purposes as
authorized by the Butler City Council.
   (F)   There is hereby established a Recovery and Reimbursement Account as an
income line in Fire Cost Recovery Fund. The account number is 271.0.00.39600.

(Ord. 1315, passed 11-2-98; Am. Ord. 1420, passed 4-19-04)
§ 34.48 PURCHASING AND PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR FEDERAL PROJECTS.
   (A)   Purchasing procedures and requirements when utilizing federal funds.
      (1)   Any and all purchasing agents, the city and all other boards of the
city shall comply with the following procedures and requirements when using
federal funds or awards to procure goods and/or services, whether received
directly or as a sub-recipient:
         (a)   No employee, officer, or agent of the city may participate in
the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by a federal
award if he or she has a real or apparent conflict of interest. Such a conflict
of interest would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his
or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs
or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or
other interest in or a tangible personal benefit from a firm considered for a
contract. The officers, employees, and agents of the non-federal entity may
neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value
from contractors or parties to subcontractors. Violation of this requirement
shall result in disciplinary action against the employee in violation. This
policy shall not apply in situations where the financial interest is not
substantial, or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. Prior to any
participation in the selection, award of administration of a contract, the
employee shall disclose any financial interest to the purchasing agent for a
determination if such interest is substantial.
         (b)   All purchasing shall avoid acquisition of unnecessary or
duplicative items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking
out procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an
analysis shall be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any other
appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach.
         (c)   To foster greater economy and efficiency, and in accordance with
efforts to promote cost-effective use of shared services across the federal
government, the city shall consider state and local intergovernmental
agreements or inter-entity agreements where appropriate for procurement or use
of common or shared goods and services. Competition requirements will be met
with documented procurement actions using strategic sourcing, shared services,
and other similar procurement arrangements.
         (d)   The city shall consider using federal excess and surplus
property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property whenever such use is
feasible and reduces project costs.
         (e)   The city shall consider using value engineering clauses in
contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to offer reasonable
opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is a systematic and
creative analysis of each contract item or task to ensure that its essential
function is provided at the overall lower cost.
         (f)   The city shall award contracts only to responsible contractors
possessing the ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions
of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be given to such matters as
contractor integrity, compliance with public policy, record of past
performance, and financial and technical resources.
         (g)   The city shall maintain records sufficient to detail the history
of procurement. These records will include, but are not necessarily limited to,
the following: Rationale for the method of procurement, selection of contract
type, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.
         (h)   1.   The city may use a time-and-materials type contract only
after a determination that no other contract is suitable and if the contract
includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. “TIME-
AND-MATERIALS TYPE CONTRACT” means a contract whose cost to the city is the sum
of:
               A.   The actual cost of materials; and
               B.   Direct labor hours charged at fixed hourly rates that
reflect wages, general and administrative expenses, and profit.
            2.   Since this formula generates an open-ended contract price, a
time-and-materials contract provides no positive profit incentive to the
contractor for cost control or labor efficiency. Therefore, each contract with
the city must set a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk.
Further, the city shall assert a high degree of oversight in order to obtain
reasonable assurance that the contractor is using efficient methods and
effective cost controls.
         (i)   The city shall be responsible, in accordance with good
administrative practice and sound business judgment, for the settlement of all
contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements. These issues
include, but are not limited to, source evaluation, protests, disputes and
claims.
         (j)   All procurement transactions for the acquisition of property or
services required under federal award shall be conducted in a manner providing
full and open competition consistent with the standards of this section and 2
CFR 200.320.
         (k)   In order to ensure objective contractor performance and
eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft
specifications, requirements, statements of work, or invitations for bids or
requests for proposals must be excluded from competing for such procurements.
Some of the situations considered to be restrictive of competition include but
are not limited to:
            1.   Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them
to qualify to do business;
            2.   Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding;
            3.   Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between
affiliated companies;
            4.   Noncompetitive contracts to consultants that are on retainer
contracts;
            5.   Organizational conflicts of interest;
            6.   Specifying only a “brand name” product instead of allowing “an
equal” product to be offered and describing the performance or other relevant
requirements of the procurement; and
            7.   Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.
         (l)   The city shall conduct procurements in a manner that prohibits
the use of statutorily or administratively imposed state, local, or tribal
geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in
those cases where applicable federal statutes expressly mandate or encourage
geographic preference. Nothing in this section preempts state licensing laws.
When contracting for architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic
location may be a selection criterion provided its application leaves an
appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the
project, to compete for the contract.
         (m)   All solicitations for bids or quotes by the city shall
incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for
the material, product, or services to be procured. Such description must not,
in competitive procurements, contain features which unduly restrict
competition. The description may include a statement of the qualitative nature
of the material, product, or service to be procured and, when necessary, must
set forth those minimum essential characteristics and standards to which it
must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product
specifications should be avoided if at all possible. When it is impracticable
or uneconomical to make a clear and accurate description of the technical
requirements, a “brand name or equivalent” description may be used as a means
to define the performance or other salient requirements of procurement.
         (n)   The specific features of the named brand which must be met by
offers must be clearly stated; and identify all requirements which the offerors
must fulfill and all other factors to eb used in evaluating bids or proposals.
         (o)   The city shall ensure that all prequalified lists of persons,
firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and services are current
and include enough qualified sources to ensure maximum open and free
competition. The city shall not preclude potential bidders from qualifying
during the solicitation period.
         (p)   Methods of procurement to be followed. The city may use the
following methods of procurement used for the acquisition of property or
services required under a federal award or sub-award:
            1.   Informal procurement methods. When the value of the
procurement for property or services under a federal award does not exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold (SAT), as defined in 2 CFR 200.1, formal
procurement methods are not required. The city may use informal procurement
methods to expedite the completion of its transactions and minimize the
associated administrative burden and cost. The informal methods used for
procurement of property or services at or below the SAT include:
               A.   Micro-purchases.
                  (i)   Distribution. The acquisition of suppliers or services,
the aggregate dollar amount of which does not exceed the micro-purchase
threshold, as defined in 2 CFR 200.1. To the maximum extent practicable, the
city should distribute micro-purchases equitably among qualified suppliers.
                  (ii)   Micro-purchases may be awarded without soliciting
competitive price or rate quotations if the city considers the price to be
reasonable based on research, experience, purchase history or other information
and documents its files accordingly. Purchase cards can be used for micro-
purchases.
               B.   Small purchases. The acquisition of property or services,
the aggregate dollar amount of which is higher than the micro-purchase
threshold but does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. If small
purchase procedures are used, price and quotations must be obtained from an
adequate number of qualified sources as determined by the City Council. The
simplified acquisition threshold (SAT) shall be $50,000, unless a higher amount
may be hereafter be required by federal regulation, rule or order.
            2.   Formal procurement methods. When the value of the procurement
for property or services under a federal financial assistance award exceeds the
SAT, formal procurement methods are required. Formal procurement methods
require following documented procedures. Formal procurement methods also
require public advertising unless a non-competitive procurement can be used in
accordance with 2 CFR 200.319 or this section. The following formal methods of
procurement are used for procurement of property or services above the SAT:
               A.   Sealed bids.
                  (i)   A procurement method in which bids are publicly
solicited and a firm fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded
to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and
conditions of the invitation for bids, is the lowest in price. The sealed bids
method is the preferred method for procuring construction services.
                  (ii)   In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the
following conditions should be present:
                     a.   A complete adequate, and realistic specification or
purchase description is available;
                     b.   Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able
to compete effectively for the business; and
                     c.   The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price
contract and the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on
the basis of price.
               B.   If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:
                  (i)   Bids must be solicited from an adequate number of
qualified sources, providing them sufficient response time prior to the date
set for opening the bids, for local, and tribal governments, the invitation for
bids must be publicly advertised;
                  (ii)   The invitation for bids, which will include any
specifications and pertinent attachments, must define the items or services in
order for the bidder to properly respond;
                  (iii)   All bids will be opened at the time and place
prescribed in the invitation for bids, and for local and tribal governments,
the bids must be opened publicly;
                  (iv)   A firm fixed price contract award will be made in
writing to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in
bidding documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life
cycle costs must be considered in determining which bid is lowest. Payment
discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior experience
indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; and
                  (v)   Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound
documented reason.
            3.   Proposals. A procurement method in which either a fixed price
or cost-reimbursement type contract is awarded. Proposals are generally used
when conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealed bids. They are
awarded in accordance with the following requirements:
               A.   Requests for proposals must be publicized and identify all
evaluation factors and their relative importance;
               B.   Proposals must be solicited from an adequate number of
qualified offerors;
               C.   Any response to publicized requests for proposals must be
considered to the maximum extent practicable;
               D.   The city shall conduct technical evaluations of the
proposals received;
               E.   Contracts must be awarded to the responsible offeror whose
proposal is most advantageous to the city, with price and other factors
considered; and
               F.   The city may use competitive proposal procedures for
qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E)
professional services whereby offeror’s qualifi- cations are evaluated and the
most qualified offeror is selected, subject to negotiation of fair and
reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as a selection
factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional services. It cannot
be used to purchase other types of services through A/E firms that are a
potential source to perform the proposed effort.
            4.   Noncompetitive procurement. There are specific circumstances
in which noncompetitive procurement can be used. Noncompetitive procurement can
only be awarded if one or more of the following circumstances apply:
               A.   The acquisition of property or services, the aggregate
dollar amount of which does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold;
               B.   The item is available only from a single source;
               C.   The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will
not permit a delay resulting from publicizing a competitive solicitation;
               D.   The federal awarding agency or pass-through entity
expressly authorizes a noncompetitive procurement in response to a written
request from the city; or
               E.   After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is
determined inadequate.
         (q)   1.   The city shall take all necessary affirmative steps to
assure that minority businesses, a women’s business enterprises, and labor
surplus area firms are used when possible.
            2.   Affirmative steps shall include:
               A.   Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women’s
business enterprises on solicitation lists;
               B.   Assuring that small and minority businesses and women’s
business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;
               C.   Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible,
into smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and
minority businesses, and women’s business enterprises;
               D.   Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement
permits, which encourage participation by small and minority businesses, and
women’s business enterprises;
               E.   Using the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such
organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Minority Business
Development Agency of the Department of Commerce; and
               F.   Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be
let, to take affirmative steps listed in this section.
         (r)   1.   As appropriate and to the extent consistent with law, the
city, to the greatest extent practicable under a federal award, shall provide a
preference for the purchase, acquisition, or use of goods, products, or
materials produced in the United States (including but not limited to iron,
aluminum, steel, cement, and other manufactured products). The requirements of
this section must be included in all subawards including all contracts and
purchase orders for work or products under this award.
            2.   For the purposes of this section:
               A.   “Produced in the United States” means, for iron and steel
products, that all manufacturing processes, from the initial melting stage
through the application of coatings, occurred in the United States.
               B.   “Manufactured products” means items and construction
materials composed in whole or in part of non-ferrous metals such as aluminum;
plastics and polymer-based products such as polyvinyl chloride pipe; aggregates
such as concrete; glass, including optical fiber; and lumber.
         (s)   The city shall comply with section 6002 of the Solid Waste
Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The
requirements of section 6002 include procuring only items designated in
guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR part 247 that
contain the highest percentage of recovered materials practicable, consistent
with maintaining a satisfactory level of competition, where the purchase price
of the item exceeds $10,000 or the value of the quantity acquired during the
preceding fiscal year exceeds $10,000; procuring solid waste management
services in a manner that maximizes energy and resource recovery; and
establishing an affirmative procurement program for procurement of recovered
materials identified in the EPA guidelines.
         (t)   The city shall perform a cost or price analysis in connection
with every procurement action in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold
including contract modifications. The method and degree of analysis is
dependent on the facts surrounding the particular procurement situation, but as
a starting point, the non-federal entity must make independent estimates before
receiving bids or proposals.
         (u)   The city shall negotiate profit as a separate element of the
price for each contract in which there is no price competition and in all cases
where cost analysis is performed. To establish a fair and reasonable profit,
consideration must be given to the complexity of the work to be performed, the
risk borne by the contractor, the contractor’s investment, the amount of
subcontracting, the quality of its record of past performance, and industry
profit rates in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.
         (v)   Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under the
federal award are allowable only to the extent that costs incurred, or cost
estimates included in negotiated prices would be allowable for the city under
federal regulations.
         (w)   The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of
construction cost methods of contracting must not be used.
         (x)   For construction or facility improvement contracts or
subcontracts exceeding the SAT, the federal awarding agency or pass-through
entity may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the city provided that
the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity has made a determination
that the federal interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has
not been made, the minimum requirements must be as follows:
            1.   A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to 5% of the bid
price. The bid guarantee must consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond,
certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance
that the bidder will, upon acceptance of the bid, execute such contractual
documents as may be required within the time specified.
            2.   A performance bond on the part of the contactor for 100% of
the contract price. A performance bond is one executed in connection with a
contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor’s requirements under such
contract.
            3.   A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100% of the
contract price. A payment bond is one executed in connection with a contract to
assure payment as required by law of ail persons supplying labor and materials
in the execution of the work provided for in the contract.
         (y)   The purchasing agent or other employee in responsible charge
shall maintain oversight to ensure that contractors perform in accordance with
the terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase
orders.
   (B)   Applicability. The policies and procedures in this section shall apply
to purchases that utilize federal funds or awards.

CAPITAL ASSET POLICY
§ 34.55 CAPITAL ASSET POLICY.
   (A)   General information.
      (1)   The Capital Asset Policy became effective January 1, 2008 and shall
be referred to as the “Capital Assets Policy”. This Policy is instituted to set
the minimum dollar value of capital assets as reported on the city’s financial
statements at $5,000. The Policy is related to Government Standards Accounting
Board Statement 34. This reporting model also requires all units to depreciate
certain assets.
      (2)   This Policy will provide a higher degree of control over the city’s
considerable investment in capital assets, and allows the city to demonstrate
accountability to its various constituencies: citizens, taxpayers, oversight
bodies and regulators.
      (3)   The purpose of this Capital Assets Policy is:
         (a)   To safeguard the investments of the people of Butler;
         (b)   To fix responsibility for the custody of equipment;
         (c)   To provide a basis for formulating capital asset acquisition,
maintenance and retirement dispositions;
         (d)   To provide data for financial reporting;
         (e)   To demonstrate appropriate stewardship responsibility for public
assets.
   (B)   Definitions of capital assets.
      (1)   “CAPITAL ASSETS” include: land, land improvements, easements,
rights-of-way, buildings, building improvements, construction in progress,
machinery, equipment, vehicles and infrastructure. All land will be capitalized
but not depreciated. All items with a useful life of more than one year and
having a unit cost of at least $5,000, or more, will be capitalized. A capital
asset meeting the criteria will be reported and depreciated on the annual
financial statements.
      (2)   Assets that are not capitalized are expensed in the year of
acquisition. For accountability and safeguarding of assets, an inventory list
will be kept and maintained on all of those items that have a value between
$100 and $5,000, and classified as non-capitalized assets.
Class of Asset Minimum Threshold Depreciation Method
Class of Asset           Minimum Threshold Depreciation Method
Land                     $1.00             Straightline
Land Improvements        $2,500.00         Straightline
Building                 $2,500.00         Straightline
Building Improvements    $2,500.00         Straightline
Construction in Progress $2,500.00         Straightline
Machinery & Equipment    $2,500.00         Straightline
Vehicles                 $2,500.00         Straightline
Utility Assets           $2,500.00         Straightline
 
   (C)   Valuation of capital assets.
      (1)   Capital assets should be recorded at actual cost. Normally the cost
recorded is the purchase price or construction costs of the asset, but any
other reasonable and necessary costs incurred to place the asset in its
intended location and its intended use should also be included. Such costs
could include the following:
         (a)   Legal and title fees, closing costs;
         (b)   Appraisal and negotiation fees, surveying fees;
         (c)   Damage payments;
         (d)   Land preparation costs, demolition costs;
         (e)   Architect, engineering and accounting fees;
         (f)   Insurance premiums during construction;
         (g)   Transportation charges;
         (h)   Interest costs during construction - on utility funds only.
      (2)   Donated or contributed assets should be recorded at their fair
market value on the date donated or acquired.
   (D)   Asset definitions by major category.
      (1)   It is important to the maintenance of accurate records that each
asset category be precisely defined and that all persons responsible for
records maintenance are fully aware of the categorization system. This division
(D) further clarifies the asset definitions by major category.
      “BUILDINGS.”
         1.   All structures designed and erected to house equipment, services,
or functions are included. This includes systems, services and fixtures within
the buildings, and attachments such as porches, stairs, fire escapes, canopies,
areaways, lighting fixtures, flagpoles and all other such units that serve the
building.
         2.   Plumbing systems, lighting systems, heating, cooling, ventilating
and air handling systems, sprinkler systems, alarm systems, sound systems and
surveillance systems, passenger and freight elevators, escalators, built-in
casework, walk-in coolers and freezers, fixed shelving, and other fixed
equipment are included with the building, if owned. Communications antennas
and/or towers are not included as buildings. These are parts of the equipment
units that they serve.
      “EQUIPMENT.”
         1.   The definition of “MACHINERY” and “EQUIPMENT” is as follows: an
apparatus, tool, or conglomeration of pieces to form a tool. The tool will
stand alone and not become part of a basic structure or building. Included
within this category are office equipment and furniture, appliances,
furnishings, machinery items, maintenance equipment, communication equipment,
police and fire equipment, sanitation and water equipment, vehicles and
emergency equipment. This list is not inclusive. All supplies are excluded.
         2.   Improvements or renovations to existing machinery and equipment
will be capitalized only if the result of the change meets all of the following
conditions:
            A.   Total cost exceeds $500;
            B.   The useful life is extended two or more years; and
            C.   The total costs will be greater than the current book value
and less than the fair market value.
      “IMPROVEMENTS OTHER THAN BUILDINGS.”
         1.   Improvements to land for better enjoyment, attached or not easily
removed, and will have a life expectancy of greater than two years.
         2.   Examples of unit assets in this category are walks, parking areas
and drives, fencing, retaining walls, pools, fountains, planters, underground
sprinkler systems, and other similar items. Examples of utility assets in this
category are water supply mains, collection sewers, wells, fences, intake
pipes, manholes and fire hydrants.
      “INFRASTRUCTURE.”
         1.   Long-lived capital assets that normally can be preserved for a
significantly greater number of years than most capital assets and are normally
stationary in nature. Examples include roads, bridges, sidewalks, street
lights, traffic signals, street signs, waste water systems, and water systems.
“INFRASTRUCTURE ASSETS” can include structures directly related to the
infrastructure. An example would be water pumping buildings associated with
water systems.
         2.   The historical reporting requirement of GSABS 34 allows the unit
to only include items put into use from 1980 forward.
      “LAND, EASEMENTS AND RIGHTS-OF-WAY.” Specified land, easements, rights-
of-way, lots, parcels or acreage owned by the unit or its various departments,
boards or authorities, regardless of the method or date of acquisition.
   (E)   Asset transfers and dispositions.
      (1)   Property should not be transferred, turned in for auction, or
disposed of without prior approval of the appropriate department head. A
capital asset notification form should be sent to the Clerk-Treasurer in all
cases. Invoices for new purchases will not be paid unless this form is
attached. Deletions for any reason must be reported to the Clerk-Treasurer.
      (2)   "TRANSFERS” are defined as any movement of an asset by virtue of
change in location, either by account, department or building. If an asset is
stolen, the department head should ensure that a police report is promptly
filed and that the police report be forwarded to the Clerk-Treasurer along with
the capital asset notification form.
   (F)   Periodic inventories.
      (1)   A physical inventory of all capital assets will be conducted every
two years, as close to year-end as possible. This will begin in 2021 and
continue for every odd year. The Clerk-Treasurer’s office will provide a list
of the current capital assets to each department head during the month of
November. The department heads will then compare physical observations of each
asset to what is listed. The department heads will note any differences and
then return the list to the Clerk-Treasurer’s office by the end of December.
      (2)   The department head will also make note of any items that are
physically present but not on the capital assets list. The Clerk-Treasurer will
ensure that those items are correctly added to the list.
      (3)   A physical inventory of all other non-capitalized items will be
conducted annually in the same manner as described above.
   (G)   Safeguarding of assets. Accounting controls shall be designed and
implemented to provide reasonable assurances that:
      (1)   Capital expenditures made by the city, its various departments and
utilities are in accordance with management’s authorization as documented in
the minutes.
      (2)   Transactions of the utilities are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
principles.
      (3)   Adequate records are maintained to assure accountability for city
and utility owned assets.
      (4)   Access to assets is permitted in accordance with management’s
authorization.
      (5)    The recorded accountability for assets is compared with the
existing assets at least every year and appropriate action be taken with
respect to any differences.
   (H)   Depreciation methods. The city will depreciate capital assets using
the straight-line method. Salvage value will be determined on an asset-by-asset
basis. Depreciation will be calculated at year-end. Land is not depreciated
according to generally accepted accounting principles.
      (1)   The most common useful lives are:
         (a)   Vehicles: 5 years;
         (b)   Office equipment: 5 years;

establishing and maintaining a capital asset inventory. The Fiscal Officer will
further ensure that the Capital Assets Report is updated annually to reflect
additions, dispositions, depreciation and transfers.
   (J)   Responsibilities of department heads.
      (1)   It is the responsibility of the department heads to act as a
steward for each piece of property. The department head will be the focal point
for questions regarding the availability, conditions and usage of an asset, as
well as the contact during the physical inventory process.
      (2)   The department head will record the receipt of the asset, examine
it to make sure that no damage was incurred during shipment and make sure it is
in good working order.
      (3)   The department head is also responsible for performing preventative
maintenance and any needed repairs to keep an asset in good working condition.
The department head will also ensure that the asset is used for the purpose for
which it was acquired and that there is no unauthorized use.

must comply with, the provisions of IC 36-1-21 et seq. and other state law.
      (2)   The city may enter into or renew a contract for the procurement of
goods, services, or public works projects with a relative of an elected
official or a business entity in which a relative has an ownership interest if:
         (a)   The elected official files with the city a full disclosure which
must be:
            1.   In writing; and
            2.   Describe the contract or purchase to be made by the city; and
            3.   Describe the relationship the elected official has to the
individual or business entity that provides the contract for goods, services or
public works projects.
         (b)   The appropriate city board or department:
            1.   Issues a certified statement that the contract amount or
purchase price was the lowest amount or price bid offered; or
            2.   Issues a certified statement detailing the reasons why the
particular vendor or contractor was selected.
         (c)   The city satisfies all other requirements of Indiana's public
purchasing (IC 5-22) or public works projects (IC 36-1-12) statutes.
         (d)   The elected official complies with disclosure provisions of IC
35-44-1-3.
   (E)   The city's personnel report, which is required and defined by IC 5-11-
13-1, shall include a statement by the Mayor that the city has implemented an
anti-nepotism policy as required by and pursuant to IC 36-1-20.2 and IC 36-1-
21.
   (F)   Any amendments to IC 36-1-20.2 and IC 36-1-21 are hereby incorporated
by reference to this policy at the time of passage.

§ 50.091 RESIDENTIAL EQUIVALENT UNIT (REU).
   (A)   A residential equivalent unit (REU) shall be calculated for every new
customer (residential, commercial, non-industrial, industrial) in the city or
existing customer who is expanding a facility in the city to form the basis for
comparing different water customers to calculate the capacity fee as
established by this section.
   (B)   One REU represents the volume of water expected to be used by a
single-family residence in the city. The water REU in the city is equal to 300
gallons per day when calculating equivalency on flow basis.

   (A)   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements of the permit
shall be representative of the user’s discharge and obtained through
appropriate sampling techniques. The data analysis of the samples collected
shall be performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that
is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
   (B)   Except as indicated in divisions (C) and (D) below, the user shall
collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow proportional composite collection
techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is not feasible, the
Superintendent may authorize, in writing, the use of time proportional sampling
or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will
provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. Using
protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour
period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total
phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the
field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited
in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by
composting procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the Superintendent, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may
be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
   (C)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds shall be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
   (D)   Samples for monitoring compliance by categorical industries should be
taken immediately downstream from the pretreatment facilities if such
facilities exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no
pretreatment facilities exist. If other wastewaters are mixed with the
regulated wastewater prior to treatment, the user should measure the flows and
concentration necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream in order to
evaluate compliance with pretreatment standards. When an alternate
concentration or mass limit has been calculated this adjusted limit along with
the supporting data shall be submitted to the Superintendent.
   (E)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required by this chapter and 40 C.F.R. 403.12(b) and (d), a
minimum of four grab samples shall be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil
and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which
historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical
sampling data are available, the Superintendent may authorize, in writing, a
lower minimum number of samples. For the reports required by this chapter and
40 C.F.R. 403.12(e) and (h), the industrial user is required to collect the
number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

§ 52.120 UPSET.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, “UPSET” means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An “UPSET” does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (C) of this section are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent,
professional and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable
operation and maintenance procedures; and
      (3)   The user had submitted through verbal communication the following
information to the Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
upset, with a written submission provided within five calendar days of the
upset:
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
when it began and ended or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the
noncompliance is expected to continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   The user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have
the burden of establishing the elements of the upset by a preponderance of
evidence and proof in any enforcement proceeding.
   (E)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

§ 52.121 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in this chapter if
it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge,
alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass
through or interference and that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when the city was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

from any portion of a user’s treatment facility.
      (2)   “SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE.” Substantial physical damage to property,
damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or
ineffective, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass.
      (3)   “SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE” does not mean economic loss caused by
delays in production.
   (B)   A user may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation of the process. These bypasses are
not subject to the provision of sections (C) and (D) of this section.
   (C)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the Superintendent, at least ten days before the date of the
bypass, if possible. A user shall submit oral notice to the Superintendent of
an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission
shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of
the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass
and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times,
and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected
to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Superintendent may waive the written report on
a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
   (D)   Bypassing is prohibited, and the Superintendent may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
      (1)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or
severe property damage;
      (2)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
      (3)   The user submitted notices as required under division (C) of this
section.
   (E)   The Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Superintendent determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in division (D)(1) of this section.

§ 52.131 METERED RATES, MINIMUM CHARGES AND SURCHARGES.
   (A)   Metered rates. Sewage rates and charges for industrial users served by
the Wastewater Department shall be based on the consumption of water as
determined and billed by the Water Department or if the industry is not served
by the Water Department by the measurement of effluent discharged through a
non-resettable flow measurement device as designated in the user’s industrial
wastewater permit. Sewer use volume rates shall be set periodically by the City
Council as detailed in this chapter.
   (B)   Excessive strength surcharges. Excessive strength wastewater can cause
problems with the treatment processes at the wastewater treatment plant, which
may cause the wastewater treatment plant to be in violation of the terms and
conditions of its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
Permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM).
Excessive strength wastewater is not desirable and entities discharging
excessive strength wastewater will be surcharged as outlined below.
      (1)   Excessive strength wastewater containing total suspended solids
(TSS) in excess of 225 mg/l shall be billed at $0.27 per pound, each month, for
the TSS in excess of 225 mg/l.
      (2)   Excessive strength wastewater with a carbonaceous biochemical
oxygen demand (CBOD5) concentration in excess of 200 mg/l shall be billed at
$0.31 per pound, each month, for the CBOD5 in excess of 200 mg/l.
      (3)   Excessive strength wastewater with a chemical oxygen demand (COD)
concentration in excess of 500 mg/l shall be billed at $0.12 per pound, each
month, for the COD in excess of 500 mg/l.
      (4)   Excessive strength wastewater with a total ammonia-nitrogen (NH4-N)
concentration in excess of 20 mg/l shall be billed at $3.08 per pound, each
month, for the NH4-N in excess of 20 mg/l.
      (5)   Excessive strength wastewater with a phosphorous content in excess
of 10 mg/l shall be billed at $6.16 per pound, each month, for the phosphorous
in excess of 10 mg/l.
      (6)   Excessive strength wastewater may be surcharged for CBOD or COD but
not for both.
      (7)   Invoices for excessive strength surcharges will be sent monthly for
each month a surcharge may occur. Payment of the surcharge must be within 30
days of receipt of the surcharge invoice or a 10% penalty will be added for
each 30 days that the invoice is not paid. The 10% penalty will be added to the
invoice, said 10% penalty shall be calculated on the total amount due, not just
on the initial excessive strength surcharge.

   (F)   Nothing contained herein shall be construed to require the Board or
City Council to approve extending water and/or wastewater service outside of
the city’s corporation limits.
(Ord. 1639, passed 12-19-16)
§ 52.152 RESIDENTIAL EQUIVALENT UNIT (REU).
   (A)   A residential equivalent unit (REU) shall be calculated for every new
customer (residential, commercial, non-industrial, industrial) in the city or
existing customer who is expanding a facility in the city to form the basis for
comparing different water and wastewater customers to calculate the capacity
fee as established by this chapter.
   (B)   One REU represents the volume of wastewater expected to be discharged
by a single-family residence in the city. The wastewater REU in the city is
equal to 300 gallons per day when calculating equivalency on flow basis. An REU
may also be calculated on a situation specific basis on mass quantity when flow
is not representative for calculation.
   (C)   The number of REUs for an entity other than a single-family residence
shall be calculated by dividing the actual total daily flow (if known) or the
projected total daily flow (from the information provided by the owner or

      (4)   Potable water.
   (B)   Operational information. The Board of Works is the governing body for
all utilities.
   (C)   Purpose of these rules.
      (1)   The purpose of these rules is to identify opportunities that could
allow unauthorized access to customers confidential information, to alert
employees of the potential for identity theft, to recognize situations when new
accounts may be opened using false information, and to provide guidance on
avoiding these situations so we can prevent identify theft, or the
establishment of false accounts or the use of false methods to pay said
accounts by methods associated with identity theft.
      (2)   “CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION” is any information about a customer that
may be used for identity theft such as date of birth, social security number,
driver’s license number, photograph address, utility account number, bank
account number(s) or any other information that may be obtained as part of the
application process or payment, and maintained as part of the utilities files
and records.
   (D)   Risk assessment. Identify documents that contain confidential
information:
      (1)   New accounts:
         (a)   An application process is followed to establish a new account.
The applicant must fill out an application for water, sewer and garbage
service. All personal information on the application is verified by having the
applicant provide a photo ID such as a state issued driver’s license or state
issued identification card.
         (b)   Any application not signed and witnessed in the utility office
must be notarized in order to verify the authenticity of the applicant(s)’s
signature(s).
         (c)   Applications that are submitted by fax must have the original
notarized application filed with the utility department within ten business
days of the receipt of the faxed application.
      (2)   Account information:

Utility Department’s computer billing software. The customer’s confidential
information is protected by two separate passwords. These passwords are changed
every 90 days as a security precaution.
         (b)   The City Clerk-Treasurer and the utility clerical personnel who
are involved in the application and billing process have access to these
passwords. No other city employee shall have access to these passwords.
         (c)   All paper applications are kept in a locked file cabinet. There
are only three keys to this cabinet. These keys are assigned to the utility
clerk, assistant clerk and Clerk-Treasurer.
      (3)   Payment methods: The Utility Department office employees may only
accept payment on accounts in the following manner:
         (a)   Cash.
         (b)   Check from the customer drawn on the customer’s bank account.
Payments received by check will be scanned. These checks will be kept by the
Utility Department for at least 90 days. Once a month the Utility Department
personnel shall shred all scanned checks that are at least 90 days old.
         (c)   Check from a third party as long as it is signed by the person
named on the bank account. Payments received by check will be scanned. These
checks will be kept by the Utility Department for at least 90 days. Once a
month the Utility Department personnel shall shred all scanned checks that are
at least 90 days old.
         (d)   Money order.
         (e)   Credit and debit cards.
         (f)   ACH - Invoice Cloud.
         (g)   Autopay - Invoice Cloud.
   (E)   Confidential client information. No confidential client information
shall be revealed to any person except as follows:
      (1)   To the customer named on the account in person.
      (2)   To a third party who has a verified written authorization, such as
a power of attorney, from the customer.
      (3)   When any third-party requests confidential information, a copy of
the original written authorization allowing release of the information to the
requestor shall be maintained by the Utility Department and the name, address,
and social security number of the requestor shall be provided. The identity of
the third party shall be verified with a photo ID to be sure the person named
in the authorization is the same person requesting the information.
      (4)   Pursuant to a court order or subpoena.
      (5)   Information authorized or allowed by statutes or laws of the United
States or the State of Indiana to be accessible to the public upon proper
request.
   (F)   Red flags.
      (1)   These are activities observed by Utility Department employees that
may indicate a potential for identity theft of a customer’s information or the
use of the fruits of an identity theft to establish an account or to pay a
customer’s account.
         (a)   A request for confidential information of a customer by someone
not authorized to receive that information.
         (b)   An attempt to pay an account in an unusual way such as a third-
party check.
         (c)   An attempt to open an account in someone else’s name or without
proper identification. This would include identification documents that appear
to be altered; or don’t match the applicant.
         (d)   Customer is unable to provide all of the required information
and proof of identity.
      (2)   Policy when red flags are observed:

         (b)   Report any unauthorized requests for information to the proper
authorities.
         (c)   Report any suspected identity theft or use of materials from an
identity to the proper authorities.
         (d)   Copy any suspicious materials provided to the Department in
support of identifying a customer, a request to open an account, or attempts to
pay an account and provide them to the proper authorities for investigation.

Board of Works.

   For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   "PRIMARY SNOW EMERGENCY ROUTES." Those streets generally traversing the city
and which considered essential to the rapid movement of emergency vehicles
which normally carry the heaviest traffic volumes.
   "ROADWAY." That portion of a street or highway improved, designed, or
ordinarily used for vehicular travel, exclusive of the berm or shoulder.
   "SECONDARY SNOW EMERGENCY ROUTES." Those streets which provide access to
primary snow emergency routes and are frequently used by emergency vehicles.
   "SNOW TIRES." Tires mounted on drive wheels of motor vehicles which are
especially designed to give effective traction on snow, mud, or ice-covered
streets by means of extra heavy-duty treads with special high-traction
patterns; however, no tire so defined shall be construed to be a snow tire if
it is damaged or worn to the extent that its performance would be substantially
impaired.
   "STREET" or "HIGHWAY." The entire width between the boundary lines of every
way publicly maintained when any part thereof is open to the use of the public
for purposes of vehicular travel.
   "TIRE CHAINS." Any metal chains mounted on drive wheel tires of motor
vehicles which cross the tread of each tire laterally in at least three
different places.
(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80)
§ 72.02 PARKING ON SNOW EMERGENCY ROUTES.
   (A)   Whenever the Mayor, the Superintendent of Streets, or the Chief of
Police finds on the basis of falling snow, sleet, or freezing rain, or on the
basis of a forecast by the United States Weather Bureau or other weather
service of snow, sleet, or freezing rain that weather conditions will make it
necessary that motor vehicle traffic be expedited and that parking on city
streets be prohibited or restricted for snow plowing and other purposes, he
shall put into effect a parking prohibition on primary snow emergency routes,
as necessary, by declaring it in the manner prescribed in this chapter. This
parking prohibition shall automatically go into effect on any part of any
primary snow emergency route in the city when there has been or there is
predicted an accumulation of snow of four inches or more or ice.
   (B)   Once in effect, a prohibition under this section shall remain in
effect until terminated by announcement of the Mayor or Superintendent of
Streets, in accordance with this chapter. While the prohibition is in effect,
no person shall park or allow to remain parked any vehicle on any portion of a
primary snow emergency route to which it applies.
(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80) Penalty, see §
72.99
§ 72.03 PARKING ON SECONDARY SNOW EMERGENCY ROUTES.
   (A)   Whenever the Mayor finds on the basis of falling snow, sleet, or
freezing rain, or on the basis of a forecast by the United States Weather
Bureau or other weather service of snow, sleet, or freezing rain that weather
conditions will make it necessary that motor vehicle traffic be expedited and
that parking on city streets be prohibited or restricted for snow plowing,
safety, or other purposes, he shall put into effect a parking prohibition on
secondary snow emergency routes as necessary by declaring it in a manner
prescribed by this chapter.
   (B)   Once in effect, a prohibition under this section shall remain in
effect until terminated by announcement of the Mayor in accordance with this
chapter. While the prohibition is in effect, no person shall park or allow to
remain parked any vehicle on any portion of a secondary snow emergency route to
which it applies.
(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80) Penalty, see §
72.99
§ 72.04 CONDITION OF MOTOR VEHICLES.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to operate a motor vehicle on a primary
snow emergency route on which there is a covering of snow, sleet, or ice which
shall allow the vehicle to become stalled wholly or partly because the drive
wheels thereof are not equipped with effective tire chains or snow tires. It
shall be unlawful for any person operating a motor vehicle on a primary snow
emergency route on which there is a covering of snow, sleet, or ice on which
there is a parking prohibition in effect to allow the vehicle to become stalled
because the motor fuel is exhausted or the battery has become inoperative.
(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80) Penalty, see §
72.99
§ 72.05 STALLED VEHICLES.
   Whenever a vehicle becomes stalled for any reason, whether or not in
violation of this chapter, on any part of a primary snow emergency route during
a declared snow emergency when a parking prohibition is in effect, the person
operating the vehicle shall take immediate action to have the vehicle pushed or
towed off the roadway of the primary snow emergency route. No person shall
abandon or leave his vehicle in the roadway of a primary snow emergency route
regardless of whether he indicates, by raising the hood or otherwise, that the
vehicle is stalled, except for the purpose of securing assistance during the
actual time necessary to go to a nearby telephone or to a nearby garage,
gasoline station, or other place of assistance and return without delay. In no
event shall a vehicle be abandoned for the purpose of getting assistance for
more than a period of 30 minutes.
(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80) Penalty, see §
72.99
§ 72.06 DECLARATION OF SNOW EMERGENCY.
   In the event the Mayor determines that because the weather conditions listed
in § 72.02 make it necessary to have motor vehicle traffic expedited in the
city and parking prohibited he may declare a snow emergency. The Mayor shall
cause each declaration made pursuant to this chapter to be publicly announced
by means of broad- casts or telecasts from stations with a normal operating
range covering the city, and he may cause the declaration to be further
announced in newspapers of general circulation when feasible. Each announcement
shall describe the action taken by the Mayor, including the time it became or
will become effective, and shall specify the streets or areas affected. A
designation of primary, secondary, or snow emergency routes shall be sufficient
designation of the streets to be affected. A parking prohibition declared by
the Mayor shall specify whether it is applicable to primary snow emergency
routes only or both primary and secondary snow emergency routes, and shall not
go into effect until at least two hours after it has been announced at least
two times between 6:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. on any day. However, one
announcement in a newspaper of general circulation shall be sufficient. The
Mayor shall make or cause to be made a record of each time and date when any
declaration is announced to the public in accordance with this section.
(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80)
§ 72.07 TERMINATION OF PARKING PROHIBITION.
   Whenever the Mayor shall find that some or all of the conditions which give
rise to a parking prohibition in effect because of the snow emergency declared
pursuant to the terms of this chapter no longer exists, he may declare the
prohibition terminated, in whole or in part, in a manner prescribed by this
chapter, effective immediately upon announcement.
(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80)
§ 72.08 INTERPRETATION.
   Any provision of this chapter which becomes effective by declaration of the
Mayor or upon the occurrence of certain weather conditions shall, while
temporarily in effect, take precedence over other conflicting provisions of law
normally in effect. However, it shall not take precedence over provisions of
law relating to traffic accidents, emergency travel of authorized emergency
vehicles, or emergency traffic directions by a police officer.
(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80)
§ 72.09 SIGNS.
   On each street designated by this chapter or by resolution as a primary or
secondary snow emergency route, such street shall be posted with appropriate
signs at intervals not exceeding 400 feet. Signs posted in accordance with this
section shall be distinctive and uniform in appearance and shall be plainly
visible and readable to persons traveling on the street or highway.
(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80)
§ 72.10 IMPOUNDING VEHICLES.
   Any vehicle parking on any primary or secondary snow emergency route in
violation of any of the provisions of this chapter may be impounded by the city
police and no person shall recover any vehicle removed pursuant to this section
without first paying the cost of removal and the cost of storage. Any payments
required by this section shall not be construed as a penalty so as to preclude
prosecution for violation of any of the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80)
§ 72.11 EVIDENCE.
   In any prosecution with regard to a vehicle parked or left in a place or in
a condition in violation of any provision of this chapter, proof that the
particular vehicle described in the com- plaint was parked or left in violation
of a provision of this chapter, together with proof that the defendant named
and the complaint was at the time the registered owner of the vehicle, shall
constitute prima facie evidence that the defendant was the person responsible
for having the vehicle parked or left in violation of this chapter. It is the
specific intent of this provision to make the owner of a motor vehicle
responsible for the use and operation of the motor vehicle regardless of who
actually parks the vehicle in violation of this chapter, for it is the owner
who has control over who drives or operates his motor vehicle.
(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80)
§ 72.12 PRIMARY SNOW EMERGENCY ROUTES.
   (A)   The following streets or portions of streets within the city are

shall be fined not less than $25 nor more than $500 for each offense; and a
separate offense shall be deemed committed on each day during or on which a
violation occurs or continues.

concurrent jurisdiction, provided the defendant was notified pursuant to §
93.03. Said action may be brought on a uniform traffic ticket (UTT) alleging a

be fined $25 for each day after the expiration of seven days, plus costs and
attorney fees.

court concerning the condition of the property from the date the UTT was issued
until the date the hearing is held.
   (C)   The court shall determine the number of days said property is in
violation. Any action brought pursuant to this section shall prohibit a lien
being filed as set out herein for the same acts alleged in the complaint (UTT)
by the city pursuant to this section. However, in lieu of the issuance of
notices of violation of this subchapter, the city may file a suit for
injunction against the offender seeking an injunction to prohibit such activity
and to comply with the provisions of this subchapter. The suit may seek fines
as provided for herein. Further, the city shall be entitled to recover all
costs and expenses including attorney fees if the defendant is found to be in
violation of the provisions of this subchapter.

   (A)   In the event any owner of real estate located within the geographical

shall prepare and forward to the property owner a written notice calling for

permitted under IC 1-1-7-1, return receipt requested at the last known address
as recorded in the DeKalb County Auditor's office.
   (B)   If an initial notice of violation was provided by certified mail,
first class mail, or equivalent service permitted under IC 1-1-7-1, a
continuous abatement notice may be posted at the property at the time of
abatement. A continuous abatement notice serves as notice to the real property
owner that each subsequent violation during the same year for which the initial
notice of the violation was provided may be abated by the city or its
contractors.
   (C)   Any notice of violation issued pursuant to this chapter may be
appealed if written notice of appeal is served by the property owner to the
Clerk-Treasurer within three days of the date of notice of violation. Upon
appeal, the Clerk-Treasurer shall set the matter for hearing at the next
regular meeting of the Board of Public Works and Safety (the "Board"). If the
notice of appeal is received less than five days prior to the next regular
meeting of the Board, the hearing shall be scheduled at the next subsequent
regular meeting of the Board to determine whether the property owner was in
violation of this chapter. The appealing party must appear in person or by
counsel to present his or her case. If not present, the question will be
decided in abstentia. Notwithstanding the appeal party's right of future appeal
to any court of competent jurisdiction, the determination by the Board shall be
final.
(Ord. 1755, passed 6-6-22)
§ 102.10 REMOVAL BY CITY; PAYMENT OF COST.
   (A)   From the date the notice of violation is mailed or delivered, the
property owner has seven days to abate the violation. After seven days and if
no timely appeal is filed, the Department will perform a site inspection. If
the property owner has abated the violation (mowed the property), the
Department will note in its file that the property owner has come into
compliance, and the violation is closed. If the property owner fails to abate
the violation, then the property owner shall be deemed to have granted
permission to the city to enter the property owner's property for the purpose
of cutting and/or removing weeds and rank vegetation located thereon and
identified in the notice of violation. The Department or its designee will
document the violation via photography that captures the height of the grass
and the property address, and immediately mow the property. The Department
shall maintain before and after photographs.
   (B)   If the property owner fails to abate the violation within the seven-
day period referenced in division (A) above, the property owner shall be liable
for a fine subject to the following:
      (1)   If the property owner has not previously violated this section, the
fine shall be no more than $25;
      (2)   If the property owner has previously committed one violation of
this section, the fine shall be no more than $100; and
      (3)   If the property owner has previously committed two or more
violations of this section, the fine shall be no more than $500.
   (C)   In the event city employees are used to enforce this chapter, the
hourly rate shall be $100 per hour per employee for the first violation and
said rate shall increase by $50 per hour per employee for subsequent
violations. In addition to the hourly rate, all costs involved with the
disposal of any material removed from the property shall be assessed to the
property owner. This hourly rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the
City Council by resolution in order to be assured that the costs of such
cutting, removal or destroying are completely paid for by the landowner, and
not the taxpayer.
   (D)   The Department shall mail, via first class mail, an invoice to the
property owner reflecting the total cost incurred by the city in mowing the
property, administrative costs associated with abating the violation, and a
citation for the appropriate minimum fine as outlined in division (B).
   (E)   Within ten days of the date the invoice in division (C) is mailed, the
property owner shall:
      (1)   Pay to the Department all amounts owed as reflected in the invoice;
or
      (2)   File a written appeal with the City Court setting forth the address
of the property; the name of the property owner; the basis for the appeal and
any documentation supporting the appeal. Basis for appeal may be:
         (a)   Cut and removal of weeds and rank vegetation was not performed
on the property;
         (b)   Cut and removal of weeds and rank vegetation was performed
before the time period set forth in the notice of violation;
         (c)   Amount of invoice is incorrect; or
         (d)   The property owner was not properly served legal notice. Upon
appeal, the City Court shall set the matter for contested hearing and determine
whether the property owner is liable for the violation and, if appropriate,
assess fines. In any proceeding before the City Court regarding the violation,
the city shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees and costs if it
is the prevailing party.
(Ord. 1755, passed 6-6-22)
§ 102.11 TAX LIEN.
   (A)   If the property owner fails to pay the invoice or file a written
appeal within ten days or fails to pay the invoice within ten days of an
adverse determination rendered by the City Court, the Department shall certify
to the DeKalb County Auditor the amount incurred by the city to abate the
violation, including the administrative costs associated with abating the
violation ("certified amount"). If the cost of abatement is $0-$100, the
administrative fees shall be $100. If the cost of abatement is $101-$200, the
administrative fees shall be $200. If the cost of abatement exceeds $200, the
administrative fee shall be $300. The limitation on administrative fees shall
not limit whatever might be necessary in costs to collect the outstanding
balances, including court costs and attorney fees. The Auditor shall place the
certified amount on the tax duplicate against such real estate and the amount
shall be collected as taxes are generally collected and when collected shall be
disbursed to the city for deposit in the General Fund.
   (B)   The city is permitted to utilize the Tax Refund Exchange and
Compliance System (TRECs), to collect any lien or outstanding fines, as
permitted under IC 6-8.1-9.5, as amended from time to time.
(Ord. 1755, passed 6-6-22)
§ 102.12 ALTERNATIVES TO LIENS.
   (A)   In lieu of filing a lien as set out in §
102.11, the city may bring an action in City Court or any other court of
concurrent jurisdiction, provided the defendant was notified pursuant to §
102.09. Said action may be brought on a uniform traffic ticket (UTT) alleging a
violation of this chapter. Any person notified pursuant to §
102.09 who fails or refuses to act as directed therein shall, upon conviction,
be fined $25 for each day after the expiration of seven days, plus costs and
attorney fees.
   (B)   Each day after the seven-day period expires shall constitute a
separate offense. A new UTT need not be issued each and every day in order for
each day to constitute a separate violation. Evidence may be presented to the
court concerning the condition of the property from the date the UTT was issued
until the date the hearing is held.
   (C)   The court shall determine the number of days said property is in
violation. Any action brought pursuant to this section shall prohibit a lien
being filed as set out herein for the same acts alleged in the complaint (UTT)
by the city pursuant to this section. However, in lieu of the issuance of
notices of violation of this chapter, the city may file a suit for injunction
against the offender seeking an injunction to prohibit such activity and to
comply with the provisions of this subchapter. The suit may seek fines as
provided for herein. Further, the city shall be entitled to recover all costs
and expenses including attorney fees if the defendant is found to be in
violation of the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 1755, passed 6-6-22)
§ 102.13 EMERGENCY REMOVAL.
   In the event a property owner has failed to perform his or her duty to cut
and remove weeds and rank vegetation as provided herein and such weeds and rank
vegetation obstructs, either in whole or in part, the normal and usual view of
any street or vehicular traffic thereon, from an intersecting street, alley or
drive, such weeds, grass or other rank or useless vegetation may be declared to
be a public nuisance by the City Council and may be cut and removed by the city
immediately and without the necessity of the seven day written notice. The cost
of such cutting and removal and the penalty shall be assessed and sought as a
judgment against the property owner in the City Court.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
City of Butler does hereby adopt the following floodplain management
regulations.
(Ord. 1465, passed 9-5-06)
§ 153.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the City of Butler are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 1465, passed 9-5-06)
§ 153.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and,
   (F)   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and
their contents in the City of Butler by fulfilling the requirements of the
National Flood Insurance Program.
(Ord. 1465, passed 9-5-06)
§ 153.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains;
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas, and;
   (G)   To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a
flood area.
(Ord. 1465, passed 9-5-06)
§ 153.05 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   “A ZONE.” Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM or FHBM. The definitions are
presented below:
      (1)   “ZONE A.” Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual
chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been
performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood
insurance purchase requirements apply.
      (2)   “ZONE AE AND A1-A30.” Areas subject to inundation by the one-
percent annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood
elevations are shown within these zones. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-
A30.)
      (3)   “ZONE AO.” Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance
shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths
are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance
purchase requirements apply.
      (4)   “ZONE AH.” Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance
shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are one to
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.
      (5)   “ZONE AR.” Areas that result from the decertification of a
previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the
process of being restored to provide base flood protection. Mandatory flood
insurance purchase requirements apply.
      (6)   “ZONE A99.” Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance
flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an
under-construction Federal flood protection system. These are areas of special
flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a
protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for
insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection
system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base
flood elevations or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply.
   “ACCESSORY STRUCTURE” (“APPURTENANT STRUCTURE”). A structure that is located
on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which
is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures
should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human
habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of
accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns,
and hay sheds.
   “ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE).” Any walled and roofed expansion to
the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common
load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which
is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-
bearing walls, is new construction.
   “APPEAL.” A request for a review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
   “AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING.” means a designated AO or AH Zone on the
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to
three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be
evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   “BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE).” means the elevation of the 1% annual chance
flood.
   “BASEMENT.” That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   “BUILDING.” - see "Structure."
   “COMMUNITY.” A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   “COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS).” A program developed by the Federal
Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the
Regular Program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management
requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   “CRITICAL FACILITY.” A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   “DEVELOPMENT.” means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate including but not limited to:
      (1)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any
addition to a structure;
      (2)   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home or installing recreational vehicle on a site for more than
180 days;
      (3)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction of
roads, or similar projects;
      (4)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements, etc.;
      (5)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling
operations;
      (6)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
      (7)   Storage of materials; or
      (8)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
      (9)   “DEVELOPMENT” does not include activities such as the maintenance
of existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing
roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent
structures.
   “ELEVATED STRUCTURE.” A non-basement structure built to have the lowest
floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation
perimeter walls, pilings, or columns (posts and piers).
   “ELEVATION CERTIFICATE.” A certified statement that verifies a structure's
elevation information.
   “EMERGENCY PROGRAM.” The first phase under which a community participates in
the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   “ENCROACHMENT.” The advance or infringement of uses, fill, excavation,
buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may
impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   “EXISTING CONSTRUCTION.” Any structure for which the "start of construction"
commenced before the effective date of the community's first floodplain
ordinance.
   “EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.” A manufactured home park
or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots
on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   “EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.” The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   “FEMA.” means the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   “FIVE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD (500-YEAR FLOOD).” The flood that has a 0.2% chance
of being equaled or exceeded in any year.
   “FLOOD.” A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   “FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM).” An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration
(FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   “FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM).” An official map of a community, issued
by FEMA, where the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been
identified as Zone A.
   “FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM).” An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   “FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS).” The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   “FLOODPLAIN.” The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake
or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The floodplain includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT.” The operation of an overall program of corrective
and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS.” This chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which
control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state,
or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for
preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. Floodplain management
regulations are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain
ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain management
requirements.
   “FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG).” The elevation of the regulatory flood plus
two feet at any given location in the SFHA. (see "Freeboard")
   “FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING).” A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   “FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE.” A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect.
   “FLOODWAY.” is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   “FREEBOARD.” means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the
BFE, which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   “FRINGE.” is those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   “FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT FACILITY.” means a facility which cannot be used for
its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to
water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and
unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood
processing facilities. The term does not include long-term storage,
manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   “HARDSHIP.” (as related to variances of this chapter) The exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
City of Butler requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar
to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is NOT
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the

another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions
shall prevail.
§ 153.11 DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND ELEVATIONS.
   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles shall govern.
   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
   (C)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the

§ 153.42 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
   (A)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage;
   (C)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards, and;
   (D)   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres.
(Ord. 1465, passed 9-5-06)
§ 153.43 CRITICAL FACILITY.
   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities
shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and
sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be
displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above
the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. 1465, passed 9-5-06)
§ 153.44 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
153.07, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/ improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26
allows construction of non-substantial additions/improvements to residences in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in a
floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if
fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval
(construction in a floodway permit) for the fill is required from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit (when applicable) has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources granting approval for construction in a floodway. Once a permit for
construction in a floodway has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain
Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in Article 5 of this
chapter have been met. The Floodplain Development Permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community's more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, will increase the regulatory flood more
than 0.14 of one foot; and
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data.
(Ord. 1465, passed 9-5-06)
§ 153.45 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit provided the
provisions contained in Article 5 of this chapter have been met. The key
provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially
improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.
(Ord. 1465, passed 9-5-06)
§ 153.46 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway or a floodplain analysis/
regulatory assessment citing the 100-year flood elevation and the recommended
Flood Protection Grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment
approving the proposed development, a Floodplain Development Permit may be
issued provided the conditions of the Floodplain Development Permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in §§
153.40 et seq. of this chapter have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodway, fringe and 100-year flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in §§ 153.40
et seq. of this chapter have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and will not increase flood damages
or potential flood damages.

Natural Resources.
   (D)   Variances to the Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction of §
153.41, may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
   (E)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (F)   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of any
structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
   (G)   Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
