            2.    For the surviving spouse of a member who dies after December
31, 1988, an amount per month, during the spouse’s life, equal to the greater
of 40% of the monthly pay of a first class firefighter or 55% of the monthly
benefit the deceased member was receiving or was entitled to receives on the
date of the member’s death; (these amounts shall be proportionately increased
or decreased if the salary of a first class firefighter is increased or
decreased); however, if the deceased member was not entitled to a benefit
because the member had not completed 20 years of service, for the purposes of
computing the second amount under this item, the member’s benefit shall be
considered to be 50% of the monthly salary of a first class firefighter in the
unit at the time of payment of the pension;
         (b)   The member’s children under 18 years of age are each entitled to
receive an amount equal to 15% of the salary of a fully paid first class
firefighter in the unit at the time of the payment of the pension; and
         (c)   Each parent of a deceased member who was eligible for a pension
is entitled to receive jointly an amount equal to 30% of the salary of a fully
paid first class firefighter in the unit at the time of the payment of the
pension.
      (3)   If a member dies in the line of duty after August 31, 1982, the
surviving spouse is entitled to an additional monthly benefit, during the
spouse’s lifetime, if the surviving spouse did not remarry before September 1,
1983, equal to the difference between the benefit to which the member would
have been entitled on the date of his death, but not less than 50% of the
monthly wage received by a fully paid first class firefighter and the amount
received by the spouse under division (2)(a). If the spouse remarried before
September 1, 1983, benefits ceased on the date of remarriage. The children of a
spouse receiving benefits under this division (3) may not receive more than a
total of 30% of the monthly wage received by a fully paid first class
firefighter. However, this limitation does not apply to the children of a
spouse receiving benefits under this division who are physically or mentally
disabled. For purposes of this division, "dies in the line of duty" means death
that occurs as a direct result of personal injury or illness incurred in the
member’s capacity as a firefighter while on the scene of an emergency run
(including false alarms) or on the way to or from the scene.
         (a)   If the local board finds upon the submission of satisfactory
proof that a child 18 years of age or older is mentally or physically
incapacitated and is not a ward of the state, the child is entitled to receive
the same amount as is paid to the surviving spouse of a deceased firefighter,
as long as the mental or physical incapacity continues. A sum paid for the
benefit of a child or children shall be paid to the remaining parent, if alive,
as long as the child or children reside with and are supported by the parent.
If the parent dies, the sum shall be paid to the lawful guardian of the child
or children.
         (b)   A member who has been in service 20 years, upon making a written
application to the Fire Chief, may be retired from all service with the
department with a medical examination or disability. The local board shall
authorize the payment to the retired member of 50% of the salary of a fully
paid first class firefighter of the unit at the time of the payment of the
pension, plus:
            1. For a member who retires before January 1, 1986, 2% of that
salary for each year of service over 20 years; or
            2. For a member who retires after December 31, 1985, 1% of that
salary for each six months of service over 20 years.
            3.   However, the pension in one year may not exceed an amount
greater than 74% of the salary of a fully paid first class firefighter. The
pension of the dependents of retired members is the same if the member dies
after retirement as it is for dependents of members who die in the service or
after retirement with disability.
         (c)   A member who is discharged from the Fire Department after having
served at least 20 years is entitled to receive the amount equal to the amount
that the member would have received if the member retired voluntarily. If a
member dies after retirement and leaves a surviving spouse or dependent child
or children, they are entitled to receive the amount provided for the
dependents of members who have died in the service of the Fire Department.
         (d)   All pensions in a class are on an equal basis. The local board
may not depart from this chapter in authorizing the payment of pensions.
         (e)   The monthly pension payable to a member or survivor may not be
reduced below the amount of the first full monthly pension received by that
person
      (4)   The Common Council authorizes the Board of Trustees of the
Firefighters’ Pension Fund to pay funeral benefits to the heirs or estates of
any active or retired member of the Fire Department who has suffered death from
any cause, after June 30, 2008, in an amount equal to the difference between
$12,000 and any lesser amount paid to such heirs or estates by the Public
Employees’ Retirement Fund of the state.
      (5)   All benefits paid hereunder shall be subject to § 401 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
   (C)   In each of the cases in division (B) above which provide for payment
to a dependent relative of a deceased firefighter, the Board of Trustees of the
Firefighters’ Pension Fund shall be the final judges of the question of
necessity and dependency and of the amounts within the limits of the law to be
paid in any case.
   (D)   The payments herein provided shall apply only with respect to the
widow, each dependent child, and heirs of any active or retired member of the
fire force who was hired and became a member of the Fire Department prior to
May 1, 1977. The provisions of this section shall not apply to widows,
dependent children, or heirs of any active or retired member of the Fire
Department who was or is hired and who became or becomes a member of the Fire
Department on or after May l, 1977.
   (E)   To the extent that the Board of Trustees of the Firefighters’ Pension
Fund may heretofore have paid since the effective date of I.C. 36-8-7-12, any
benefits or payments from the Firefighters’ Pension Fund to any widow or child
under the age of 18 years of any deceased member of the Fire Department in
excess of the minimum amount provided by law from time to time, the Common
Council hereby ratifies and approves retroactively all the excess payments so
made.

§ 32.113 HISTORIC DISTRICTS, CONSERVATION DISTRICTS, AND GUIDELINES.
   (A)   Recommendations for establishment. All recommendations for the
establishment of a historic district shall be in the form of a written report
and must be based on the criteria outlined in this section. A recommendation
for establishing a historic district may be initiated from either of the
following two sources:
      (1)   Based on its survey, the Board may draw and submit historic
district maps for City Council approval.
      (2)   Owners of property in fee simple wishing to establish a historic
district which includes their property may petition the Board to consider
drawing and submitting a map or maps of said property to the City Council for
its approval. The Board may establish in its rules criteria to be met before it
considers a petition.
   (B)   Conservation districts. The Board may recommend, and the City Council
may provide that the establishment of a historic district shall occur in two
phases. During the first phase, which continues for a period of three years
from the date the ordinance is adopted, a certificate of appropriateness is
required for the following activities: the demolition of any building; the
moving of any building; and any new construction of a principal building or
accessory building or structure subject to view from a public way.
      (1)   At the expiration of the initial three-year period, the first phase
of a conservation district continues, and the second phase does not become
effective if a majority of the property owners in the district object to the
Board, in writing, to the requirement that certificates of appropriateness be
issued for the following activities:
         (a)   A conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of historic
buildings by additions, construction, alteration, or maintenance involving
exterior color changes;
         (b)   A change in walls and fences or construction of walls and
fences, if along public ways;
         (c)   A conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of non-historic
buildings subject to view from a public way by additions, reconstruction,
alteration, or maintenance involving exterior color change.
      (2)   The objections of a majority of the property owners must be
received by the Board not earlier than 180 days or later than 60 days before
the third anniversary of the adoption of the ordinance.
   (C)   Board preparation of historic district maps. In order to establish a
historic district, the Board shall first prepare a map describing the district
in accordance with the following:
      (1)   The map shall be based on a survey conducted by the Board which
identifies historic buildings, structures, and sites located within the City.
      (2)   A district may be limited to the boundaries of a property
containing a single building, structure, or site.
      (3)   The map may divide the district into primary and secondary areas as
follows: (a) primary area–the principal area of historic and architectural
significance; (b) secondary area–an area adjacent to a primary area which has a
visual relationship to the primary area and could affect the preservation of
the primary area. The purpose of designating a secondary area is to assure its
compatibility and harmony with an adjacent primary area.
   (D)   (1)   The Board shall classify and designate on the map all buildings,
structures, and sites within each historic district described on the map.
Buildings, structures, and sites shall be classified as historic or non-
historic. Historic buildings, structures, and sites must possess identified
historic or architectural merit of a degree warranting their preservation.
      (2)   The Board shall further classify and designate all buildings and
structures within a proposed historic district as follows:
         (a)   Outstanding;
         (b)   Notable; or
         (c)   Contributing.
      (3)   Non-historic buildings, structures, and sites are those not
classified on the map as historic. In lieu of other classifications, the Board
may devise its own system of further classification of historic buildings,
structures, and sites.
   (E)   City Council approval of maps of historic districts. Before a historic
district is established and the building classifications take effect, the map
setting forth the district's boundaries and building classifications must be
submitted to, and approved in an ordinance by, the City Council.
   (F)   Recording the fact of designation. The map establishing boundaries of
a historic district may be recorded in the office of the County Recorder.
(Ord. 11-2010, passed 8-10-10)
§ 32.114 INTERIM PROTECTION.
   (A)   When submitting a map to the City Council under §
32.113 of this subchapter, the Board may declare one or more buildings or
structures that are classified and designated as historic on the map to be
under interim protection.
   (B)   Not more than two working days after declaring a building, structure,
or site to be under interim protection under this section, the Board shall, by
personal delivery or first class mail, provide the owner or occupant of the
building, structure, or site with a written notice of the declaration. The
written notice must:
      (1)   Cite the authority of the Board to put the building, structure, or
site under interim protection under this section;
      (2)   Explain the effect of putting the building, structure, or site
under interim protection; and,
      (3)   Indicate that the interim protection is temporary.
   (C)   A building or structure put under interim protection under division
(A) of this section remains under interim protection until the map is:
      (1)   Submitted to; and
      (2)   Approved in an ordinance; or
      (3)   Rejected by the City Council.
   (D)   While a building, structure, or site is under interim protection under
this section:
      (1)   The building, structure, or site may not be demolished or moved;
and,
      (2)   The exterior appearance of the building, structure, or site may not
be conspicuously changed by:
         (a)   Addition;
         (b)   Reconstruction; or
         (c)   Alteration.
      (3)   The Board may approve a certificate of appropriateness at any time
during the period of interim protection, provided that the proposed change
meets the criteria for considering effect of actions on historic buildings in §
32.115(D) of this subchapter and any proposed preservation guidelines prepared
for the building, structure, or site, but the certificate of appropriateness
shall have no effect, and no action may be taken pursuant thereto, unless the
map including the building, structure, or site is approved by the City Council.
(Ord. 11-2010, passed 8-10-10)
§ 32.115 CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS (COA).
   (A)   Certificates of appropriateness (COA) required. A certificate of
appropriateness must be issued by the Board before a permit is issued for, or
work is begun on, any of the following:

         (a)   The demolition of any building or structure;
         (b)   The moving of any building or structure;

that the historic building, structure, or site is incapable of earning an
economic return on its value, as appraised by a licensed real estate appraiser.

construed so as to prevent the ordinary repairs and maintenance of any
building, structure, or site, provided that such repairs or maintenance do not
result in a conspicuous change in the design, form, proportion, mass,
configuration, building material, texture, color, location, or external visual
appearance of any structure, or part thereof.

§ 33.35 NEPOTISM POLICY; CONTRACTING WITH A UNIT BY A RELATIVE POLICY.
   (A)   The city finds that it is necessary and desirous to adopt a policy of
conduct with regard to nepotism in the employment with the city and in

government services to its residents and to comply with the new laws effective
July 1, 2012 known as I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21, respectively.
   (B)   On July 1, 2012 the city shall have a nepotism and contracting with a
unit policy that complies with the minimum requirements of I.C. 36-1-20.2
(hereinafter nepotism policy) and I.C. 36-1-21 (hereinafter contracting with a
unit by a relative policy) and implementation will begin.
   (C)   The city’s nepotism policy is hereby established effective July 1,
2012 by adopting the minimum requirements provisions of I.C. 36-1- 20.2, and
including all future supplements and amendments thereto which become law from
time to time, and making them a part hereof as if fully set out herein. In
addition a copy of I.C. 36-1-20.2 nepotism in effect on July 1 is attached to
Ord. 7- 2012, passed 6-12-12.
   (D)   The city contracting with a unit by a relative policy is hereby

policy may be subject to action allowed by law.
   (J)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, compliance
and certifications connected with the contracting with unit by a relative

§ 33.51 INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR RETIREES.

forth herein, regardless of the department in which they were formerly
employed, may elect to continue their existing city group health insurance
plan, including dental and vision, after their retirement at their sole expense
until they reach Medicare eligibility (age 65). The retiree must elect to
continue (no lapse in coverage) their existing coverage in writing through the

   (B)   Pursuant to I.C. § 5-10-8-2.6(e), a city retiree shall qualify to

Medicare coverage as prescribed by 42 U.S.C. 1395, et seq.;
      (2)   The city retiree will have completed 20 years of creditable
employment with a public employer on or before the employee's retirement date,
ten years of which must have been completed immediately preceding the
retirement date; and
      (3)   The city retiree must have completed at least 15 years of
participation in the retirement plan of which the employee is a member on or
before the employee's retirement date.
   (C)   A city retiree, including current city retirees who are participating
in the city's group health, dental or vision insurance plans, may not change

plans after 90 days following the retiree's retirement date.
   (D)   The city retiree shall pay the full amount of the monthly premium for
the coverage they are enrolled in. The full amount of the premium is defined as
the employee's share cost and the city's share cost and shall be paid as
follows:
      (1)   Each city retiree who elects to participate in the city's group
health coverage plan shall pay the full amount of their premium to the third-
party administrator of the retiree program for the AIM Medical Trust promptly
when the premium becomes due.
      (2)   Each city retiree who elects to participate in the city's group
dental or vision insurance coverage shall pay the full premium to the Clerk-

   (E)   If any city retiree fails or refuses to pay the full amount of their
monthly premium cost promptly when the premium is due, the group insurance
coverage with respect to the defaulting city retiree and any covered family
members shall terminate.
   (F)   Coverage for eligible retirees terminates when the retiree becomes
eligible for Medicare coverage. The spouse of an eligible retiree may remain on
the plan until the spouse becomes eligible for Medicare even if the eligible
retiree enrolls in Medicare first and drops off the plan. However, if the
eligible retiree dies before the spouse becomes eligible for Medicare, coverage
for the spouse terminates upon the earlier of:
      (1)   The date the spouse becomes eligible for Medicare;
      (2)   The date the spouse remarries; or
      (3)   Two years after the date of the eligible retiree's death.

health insurance retiree program shall be grandfathered under the AIM Medical
Trust rules and regulations.

SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY
ARTICLE I: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND POLICY
§ 33.105 PROTECTION OF EMPLOYEES’ HEALTH AND SAFETY.
   (A)   Employees are an extremely valuable resource for the city’s business.
Their health and safety are a serious concern of the city. Drug or alcohol use
may pose a serious threat to employee's health and safety. It is therefore the
policy of the city to prevent substance use or abuse from having an adverse
effect on city employees. The city maintains that the work environment is safer
and more productive without the presence of alcohol, illegal or inappropriate
drugs in the body or on city property. Furthermore, employees have a right to
work in an alcohol and drug-free environment, and to work with employees free
from the effects of alcohol and drugs. Employees who abuse alcohol or use drugs
are a danger to themselves, their coworkers and the city's assets.
   (B)   The adverse impact of substance abuse by employees has been recognized
by the federal government. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration
("FMCSA") has issued regulations which require the city to implement a
controlled substance testing program. The city will comply and require that a
driver submit to alcohol and controlled substance tests administered in
accordance with these regulations, and is committed to maintaining a drug-free
workplace. All employees are advised that remaining drug-free and medically
qualified to drive are conditions of continued employment with the city.
   (C)   Specifically, it is the policy of the city that the use, sale,
purchase, transfer, possession, or presence in one's system of any controlled
substance (except medically prescribed drugs) by any employee while on city
premises, engaged in city business, while operating city equipment, or while
under the authority of the city, is strictly prohibited. FMCSA states that
mandatory testing must apply to every person who operates a commercial motor
vehicle in interstate or intrastate commerce and is subject to the CDL
licensing requirement.
   (D)   The execution and enforcement of this policy will follow set
procedures to screen body fluids (urinalysis), conduct breath testing, and/or
search all covered employees including applicants, for alcohol and drug use.
These procedures are designed not only to detect violations of this policy, but
to ensure fairness to each employee. Every effort will be made to maintain the
dignity of employees or applicants involved. Disciplinary action will, however,
be taken as necessary.
   (E)   Neither this policy nor any of its terms are intended to create a
contract of employment, or to contain the terms of any contract of employment.
The city retains the sole right to change, amend, or modify any term or
provision of this policy without notice. This policy is effective January 9,
2018 and will supersede all prior policies and statements relating to alcohol
or drugs.

procedures for the implementation of controlled substance and alcohol use and
testing of employee applicants, current employees, and employees pursuant to
the city’s alcohol and drug abuse policy. These procedures are intended as a
guide only, and are in no way intended to alter any existing relationship
between the city and any employee.
   (B)   The city's alcohol and drug program administrator designated to
monitor, facilitate, and answer questions pertaining to these procedures is the
Employee Relations Coordinator.

substance does not adversely affect the employee's ability to operate a
commercial motor vehicle or city vehicle.
   (H)   Off duty use of drugs and alcohol is prohibited to the extent it
affects an employee's attendance or performance and his/her ability to pass
required alcohol and controlled substance tests.
(Ord. 2-2010, passed 1-12-10; Am. Ord. 1-2018, passed 1-9-18)
§ 33.109 PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION AND/OR OTHER MEDICATION USE.
   (A)   An employee is prohibited from reporting for duty or remaining on duty
when the employee uses any controlled substance, except when the use is
pursuant to the written instruction of a physician who has advised the employee
that the substance will not adversely affect their ability to safely perform
their duties. The employee must provide the city with proof of such medical
advice. The city can decide if the employee can remain at work or on the city
premises, and what work restrictions, if any, are deemed necessary.
   (B)   Any employee who is using a prescribed drug or other medication, which
is known or advertised as possibly affecting or impairing judgment,
coordination, or other senses (including dizziness or drowsiness), or which may
adversely affect the employee's ability to perform work in a safe and
productive manner, must notify the city prior to starting work or entering any
city premises. The city will decide if the employee can remain at work or on
the city premises, and what work restrictions, if any, are deemed necessary.
   (C)   Ingestion of products that contain hemp will not be an acceptable
explanation for testing positive for marijuana.
(Ord. 2-2010, passed 1-12-10; Am. Ord. 1-2018, passed 1-9-18)
§ 33.110 REFUSAL TO TEST.
   Refusal to submit to the types of drug and alcohol tests employed by the
city will be grounds for refusal to hire employee/applicant(s) and to
discipline existing CDL employee(s) or non-regulated employee(s) covered by
this policy. A refusal to test would include any of the following situations:
   (A)   Failing to appear for any test within a reasonable time after being
directed to do so;
   (B)   Failing to remain at the testing site until the testing process is
completed;
   (C)   Failure to provide a breath sample, saliva sample, or urine sample as
directed;
   (D)   Failure to permit, if the situation requires, the observation or
monitoring of providing a urine specimen;
   (E)   Failure to provide a urine, breath, or saliva specimen within required
time frames may be considered a refusal. If an employee cannot provide a
sufficient quantity of urine or breath, he/she will be directed to be evaluated
by a physician of employer's choice. If the physician cannot find a legitimate
medical explanation for the inability to provide a specimen (either breath or
urine), it will be considered a refusal to test. In that circumstance the
employee has violated one of the prohibitions of the regulations.
   (F)   Failure or decline to take an additional drug test the employer or
collector has directed you to take;
   (G)   Failure to undergo a medical examination or evaluation, as directed by
the MRO as part of the verification process, or as directed by the DER as part
of a "shy bladder" or "insufficient breath" situation;
   (H)   Failure to cooperate with any part of the testing process and/or
conduct that would obstruct the proper administration of a test (for example,
refusing to empty pockets when so directed by the collector, behaving in a
confrontational way that disrupts the collection process);
   (I)   For an observed collection, fail to follow the observer's instruction
to raise and lower clothing, and to turn around to permit the observer to
determine if you have any type prosthetic or other device that could be used to
interfere with the collection process;
   (J)   Possess or wear a prosthetic or other device that could be used to
interfere with the collection process;
   (K)   Admit to the collector or MRO that you adulterated or substituted the
specimen;
   (L)   A report from the MRO that you have a verified adulterated or
substituted test result; or
   (M)   Refusing to sign step two of the alcohol testing form.
(Ord. 2-2010, passed 1-12-10; Am. Ord. 1-2018, passed 1-9-18)
§ 33.111 TYPES OF TESTS.
   (A)   Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Department of
Transportation (DOT) and the city's policy, the following circumstances for
drug and alcohol testing will be required: pre-employment (drug testing only),
post-accident, random, and reasonable suspicion.
   (B)   Pre-employment testing.
      (1)   This applies to all applicants applying for a CDL position and to
all other positions defined under §
33.107.
      (2)   As a condition of employment, the applicants applying for a CDL
covered position shall provide the city with a written authorization for all
previous employers within the past three years to release drug and alcohol
testing records as the DOT FMCSA regulations require. Within 30 days of
performing a safety-sensitive function, DOT regulations require that the city
obtain, to the extent available, certain drug and alcohol testing records from
the employee's previous employers for the previous three years. All applicants
who are required to have or obtain a CDL must submit to a urine drug test
unless a qualifying pre-employment exemption can be documented.
   (C)   Random testing.
      (1)   The city conducts random drug and alcohol testing on all employees
covered by this policy. Separate random pools will be established and
maintained for CDL covered employees and other non-regulated employees. The
city will submit all employees' names to a random selection system. The random
selection system provides an equal chance for each employee to be selected each
time random selection occurs. Random selections will be reasonably spread
throughout the year. The city will drug test, at a minimum, 25% of the average
number of employee positions in each calendar year or at a rate established by
the DOT for the given year. The city will select, at a minimum, 10% of the
average number of employee positions in each calendar year for random alcohol
testing, or at the rate established by the DOT for the given year. The city
reserves the right to test above the aforementioned minimum percentages should
they feel there is sufficient reasons for doing so. Random selection by its
very nature, may result in employees being selected in successive selections or
more than once a calendar year.
      (2)   If an employee is selected at random for either drug or alcohol
testing, a city official will notify the employee. Once notified, the employee
must proceed to the designated collection site immediately. If the employee
does not go to the collection site as soon as possible after notification, such
conduct may be considered a refusal to test.
   (D)   Post-accident testing.
      (1)   Following any accident, the employee must contact the city as soon
as possible. Employees who are covered under federal DOT required testing will
be tested for drugs and alcohol any time he or she is involved in an accident
where:
         (a)   A fatality is involved; or
         (b)   The employee receives a citation for a moving violation arising
from the accident that involved:
            1.   Injury requiring medical treatment away from the scene; or
            2.   One or more vehicles having to be towed from the scene.
      (2)   The employee shall follow the instructions from the city or its
representative to complete required testing.
      (3)   In addition to the testing requirements outlined above for those
holding a CDL, all other employees who are covered by this policy shall be
tested for the following situations if reasonable cause exists:
         (a)   Any accident/incident involving injury or death.
         (b)   Any accident/incident involving property damage.
         (c)   Any accident/incident where the employee receives a citation
under state or local law for a moving traffic violation arising from the
incident.
         (d)   Any accident/incident in which an employee's involvement or
actions could have caused or contributed to the cause of the accident/incident.
      (4)   Any time a post-accident drug or alcohol test is required, it must
be performed as soon as practical. If no alcohol test can be made within eight
hours, attempts to perform an alcohol test shall cease. If no urine collection
can be obtained for the purpose of post-accident drug testing within 32 hours,
attempts to make such collection shall cease. An employee is prohibited from
consuming alcohol between the time of the accident and the test.
      (5)   In the event that federal, state, or local officials conduct breath
or blood test for the use of alcohol, and/or urine tests for the use of
controlled substances, following an accident, employees must comply with law
enforcement personnel requests. The city may request testing documentation from
such agencies, and may ask the employee to sign a release allowing the city to
obtain such test results.
      (6)   In the event an employee is so seriously injured that the employee
cannot provide a sample of urine, breath, or saliva at the time of the
accident, the employee must provide necessary authorization for the city to
obtain hospital records or other documents that would indicate the presence of
controlled substances or alcohol in the employee's system at the time of the
accident.
   (E)   Reasonable suspicion testing,
      (1)   Reasonable suspicion for requiring an employee to submit to drug
and/or alcohol testing shall be deemed to exist when an employee manifests
physical, behavioral, speech, or performance symptoms or reactions commonly
attributed to the use of controlled substances or alcohol. Such employee
conduct must be witnessed by a supervisor who is trained in compliance with
Part 382.603 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations.
      (2)   A supervisor observing such conditions will take the following
actions immediately:
         (a)   Confront the employee involved, and keep under direct
observation until the situation is resolved;
         (b)   Secure the DER's concurrence to observations. After discussing
the circumstances with the DER, arrangements will be made to observe or talk
with the employee. If he/she believes, after observing or talking to the
employee, that the conduct or performance problem could be due to substance
abuse, the employee will be immediately required to submit to a breath test or
urinalysis. If the employee refuses to submit to testing for any reason, the
employee will be informed that continued refusal would result in
disqualification from performing any safety-sensitive function;
         (c)   Employees will be asked to release any evidence relating to the
observation for further testing, failure to comply may subject the employee to
subsequent discipline or suspension from driving duties. All confiscated
evidence will be receipted for with signatures of both the receiving supervisor
as well as the provider;
         (d)   The DER shall, within 24 hours or before the results of the
controlled substance test are released, document in writing the particular
facts related to the behavior or performance problems that led to the
reasonable suspicion test and maintain this documentation in appropriate DOT
files; and
         (e)   The DER shall remove or cause the removal of the employee from
the city owned vehicle and ensure that the employee is transported to an
appropriate collection site and thereafter to the employee's residence, or,
where appropriate, to a place of lodging. Under no circumstances will that
employee be allowed to continue to drive a city vehicle or his/her own vehicle
until a confirmed negative test result is received.

         (e)   The specimen appears to have been tampered with; or
         (f)   The test is a return-to-duty or follow-up test.
      (6)   Observed collections may be required on return-to-duty and follow-
up tests.
      (7)   As part of the collection process, the specimen provided will be
split into two portions: a primary specimen and a secondary (split) specimen.
      (8)   If the employee is unable to provide 45 ml of urine, the DOT "shy
bladder" rule will apply. The employee will have up to 3 hours to provide the
required 45 ml, and may consume up to 40 ounces of fluids during this time
period. The employee will be required to be monitored during the waiting
period.
      (9)   After collection, the specimen will be submitted to a SAMHSA
certified laboratory for testing.
   (B)   Laboratory procedures.
      (1)   Drug testing will be performed through urinalysis. Urinalysis will

substances: marijuana, cocaine, opioids, amphetamines, and phencyclidine (PCP).
      (2)   The SAMHSA certified laboratory will perform initial screenings on
all primary specimens. In the event that the primary specimen tests positive, a
confirmation test of that specimen will automatically be performed. If the
confirmatory test is positive it will be reported to the Medical Review Officer
(MRO) as a positive.
   (C)   Validity testing. The laboratory must also perform validity testing on
each specimen received. The purpose of validity testing is to determine whether
certain adulterants or foreign substances were added to the urine, if the urine
was diluted, or if the specimen was substituted. The following will be
measured: creatinine level, specific gravity, and pH. In addition, all
specimens will be tested for known adulterants. An initial validity test is
performed first, followed by a confirmation test if required. Laboratory
results will be reported by the laboratory to a MRO designated by the city or
its agents.
   (D)   MRO procedures.
      (1)   All tests results will undergo a review process by the MRO.
      (2)   Negative test results will be reported directly to the city by the
MRO.
      (3)   Positive, adulterated, or substituted results will be handled in
the following manner by the MRO:
         (a)   Before reporting a positive, adulterated, or substituted test
result to the city, the MRO will attempt to contact the employee to discuss the
test result;
         (b)   The employee is required to discuss the result with the MRO. The
employee will be allowed to explain and present medical documentation to
explain any permissible use of a drug;
         (c)   For adulterated or substituted results, the employee must
demonstrate that he or she did produce or could have produced urine, through
physiological means, a specimen meeting the creatinine and specific gravity
criteria of a substituted or adulterated specimen;
         (d)   If the MRO is unable to contact the employee directly, the MRO
will contact the DER designated in advance by the city, who shall, in turn,
contact the employee and direct the employee to contact the MRO. Upon being so
directed, the employee shall contact the MRO immediately or, if the MRO is
unavailable, at the start of the MRO's next business day;
         (e)   If, after failing to contact the MRO within 72 hours after being
instructed to do so by the DER, or if the employee cannot be contacted at all
within ten days, or the employee expressly declines the opportunity to discuss
the test, the MRO may verify the test as positive or a refusal;
         (f)   In the MRO's sole discretion, a determination will be made as to
whether a result is verified as positive, negative, or considered a refusal;
and
         (g)   After any verified positive or refusal to test determination,
the employee may petition the MRO to reopen the case for reconsideration.
      (4)   Diluted specimens. If a test is reported as negative and diluted,
it will be the policy of the city to require an immediate recollect for another
test. The employee will be given the minimum possible advance notice to report
for another test. The result of this second test will become the test of
record. If the second test is also negative and diluted the test will be
accepted as a valid test and no additional testing will be required. If the
employee is directed to take another test and declines to do so, this will be
considered a refusal to test and have the consequences of a refusal to test.
      (5)   Medical information disclosure. Pursuant to DOT regulations, if, in
the MRO's opinion, any information provided may mean a medical disqualification
or represent a safety hazard, such as the use of certain prescription drugs,
the MRO must disclose this to the employer. Individual test results for
employee applicants and employees will be released to the city and will be kept
strictly confidential unless consent for the release of the test result has
been obtained. Any individual who has submitted to drug testing in compliance
with this procedure is entitled to receive the results of such testing upon
written request.
      (6)   Safeguards for the integrity of the drug testing process.
         (a)   The collector must obtain photo identification from the donor or
identification by a supervisor prior to administering the test.
         (b)   The employee will be asked to wash their hands.
         (c)   The donor signs the chain of custody form signifying the
correctness of data for test reporting.
         (d)   Electronic communication of test results from the laboratory
into the MRO reporting system with no external human intervention.
         (e)   The specimen container and specimen bottles are individually
wrapped and unwrapped in employee's presence.
         (f)   After the specimen is provided in a reasonable time, the
collector inspects it for sufficient volume, temperature, and signs of
tampering. If a specimen is not provided, the employee will be referred to a
MRO to determine whether there is a valid medical reason. If there is, the
employee must still attempt to provide a specimen each time their name is
drawn.
         (g)   After the specimen is given to the collector, the remaining
collection procedures are conducted in the donor's view.
         (h)   The specimen bottles and shipping container are sealed with
tamper evident seals.
         (i)   The donor will be asked to sign the seals covering the specimen
bottles identifying they were sealed in their presence.
         (j)   The specimen bottle seals match the identifying seals on the
chain of custody form.
         (k)   The laboratory will check the specimen bottles upon receipt to
insure the seal has not been broken. If the seal has been broken the laboratory
will report the test as cancelled.
         (l)   A collector who has completed the qualification training as
mandated in CFR Part 40, as amended, will perform the collection.

§ 33.113 SPLIT SPECIMEN TESTING PROTOCOL.
   (A)   An employee may request that the "split" portion of his/her specimen
be tested at a different SAMHSA laboratory if he/she was notified by the MRO
that his/her test result was positive, adulterated, or substituted. The request
must be made to the MRO within 72 hours of being notified of a verified
positive, adulterated, or substituted result. The MRO will arrange for all
procedures to be done in accordance with split specimen testing procedures.
   (B)   The cost of a split specimen test will be the responsibility of the
employee. The city will withhold the amount of the cost of testing the split
from the employee's pay unless other arrangements are acceptable to both the
employee and the city. If the employee makes a timely request (within 72 hours)
to the MRO for the split portion to be tested, the MRO shall immediately make
arrangement with the laboratory to initiate the process.

§ 33.114 ALCOHOL TESTING.
   (A)   Alcohol tests will be conducted by a trained breath alcohol technician
(BAT) or screening test technician (STT). Screening tests may be done using an
evidential breath testing device (EBT) or non-evidential screening device
approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Confirmatory
tests will be done by a trained BAT using an evidential breath testing device.
The employee shall report to the alcohol testing site as notified by the city.
The employee shall follow all instructions given by the alcohol technician.
   (B)   If the result of a screening test is a breath alcohol concentration

indicating a BAC of 0.02 or greater will be confirmed on an EBT operated by a
BAT. The confirmation test will be performed no sooner than 15 minutes and no
later than 30 minutes following the completion of the initial test. In the
event the confirmation test indicates a BAC of 0.020 to 0.039, the employee
shall be removed from duty for 24 hours or until his/her next scheduled on-duty
time, whichever is longer. Employees with tests indicating a BAC of 0.04 or
greater are considered to have engaged in prohibited conduct, which may result
in disciplinary action up to and including termination. All alcohol tests shall
be performed just prior to, during, or just after performing a safety-sensitive
function.
   (C)   Alcohol testing safeguards for employee's protection.
      (1)   The BAT must obtain donor's photo identification prior to
administering the test.
      (2)   An individually wrapped mouthpiece will be opened and inserted into
the EBT for the employee's test.
      (3)   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration approves the EBT
that is used.
      (4)   Calibration checks are frequently performed to insure the EBT is
working efficiently.
      (5)   If the screening test indicates a 0.02 or greater, a confirmation
test will be administered.
      (6)   An air blank will be administered prior to the confirmation test
with a 0.000 reading.
      (7)   An individually wrapped mouthpiece will be inserted for the
confirmation test.
      (8)   The BAT has completed the required training course in the correct
operation of the EBT.

   (A)   The city shall provide educational materials that explain the
requirements of Part 382.601 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations,
consequences of violating the regulations, and the city's policies and
procedures with respect to meeting these requirements. The materials supplied
to the employees may include information on additional city policies with
respect to the use or possession of alcohol or controlled substances, for
example, the consequences for an employee found to have specified alcohol or
controlled substances level based on the city's authority independent of Part
382.601 of the Federal Motor Carries Regulations. Materials will also be
provided concerning the effects of alcohol and controlled substances use on an
individual's health, work, and personal life.
   (B)   Employees are required to attend an educational meeting(s) to discuss
the city's policies and procedures and to review all materials covered by this
procedure. Each employee is required to sign a statement (certificate of
receipt) certifying that he or she has received a copy of these materials

§ 33.116 DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES FOR POLICY VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Any employee who has a positive test for alcohol (0.04 BAC or greater)
or controlled substances, or has refused to test is considered in violation of
this policy. This employee is not qualified to drive a commercial motor
vehicle, other city vehicle or perform any duties for the city. Employees
engaged in safety-sensitive duties will be removed immediately from those
duties.
   (B)   The consequences of testing positive or refusing to test will result
in termination from employment with the city. City employees who hold a CDL
license will be provided with the name, address, and telephone number of
qualified substance abuse professionals (SAPs) so they may pursue assistance in
completing required DOT rehabilitation should they choose to do so.

problem with drug or alcohol misuse before it becomes a matter of discipline
with the city. The city will assist any employee who voluntarily discloses to
the city that he/she believes that he/she has a drug or alcohol problem in
seeking professional help to address their problem. This voluntary step of
self- identification is the responsibility of the individual, and with the
exception of certain conditions, will alleviate the requirement for
disciplinary action if brought to the city's attention prior to any testing
conducted by the city. Upon disclosure of a problem to city personnel, the
employee will be removed from all safety-sensitive duties without pay until
completion of the following rehabilitation steps are met.
   (B)   To be able to be returned to a CDL position or a non-regulated
position with the city, the following steps must be completed:
      (1)   Complete an initial evaluation with a SAP (substance abuse
professional);
      (2)   Complete any rehabilitation and/or education recommended by the
SAP;
      (3)   Complete a second evaluation with the SAP and obtain written
confirmation of satisfactory progress and/or completion of all recommendations;
      (4)   Complete a return-to-duty test that is issued with a negative
result; and
      (5)   As a condition of continued employment, the employee will be
required to submit to a minimum of six unannounced follow up tests in the next
12 months after returning to work.
   (C)   Follow-up testing is separate from and in addition to the city's
reasonable suspicion, post- accident, and random testing procedures. The
schedule for follow-up testing shall be unannounced and in accordance with the
instructions of the SAP.
   (D)   The employee will be responsible for all costs associated with this
process. If the employee makes no commitment to overcoming the problem and
achieving a satisfactory level of performance, attendance, or behavior, then
termination of employment will result.

within 60 days after the end of the fiscal year end.
(Ord. 15-2005, passed 4-12-05; Am. Ord. 10-2011, passed 7-12-11)
§ 33.136 SPIRIT OF THE POLICY.
   (A)   All employees seeking reimbursement must strive to incur the lowest
possible travel expense and must exercise care to avoid impropriety or the
appearance of impropriety. Public funds must never be used for personal gain.
   (B)   This policy has been developed to simplify compliance. If a
circumstance arises which is not specifically covered, either adopt the most
conservative course with the "spirit" of the policy or consult with the Clerk-
Treasurer's Office.
   (C)   This policy applies to all business travel conducted on behalf of the
city. Travel expenses are reimbursed the same for all city employees and
elected officials.
   (D)   No variance to the amount of reimbursement under these regulations
shall be made unless a memo is signed by the department head, and approved by
the Mayor.

the Clerk- Treasurer's Office and approved or prescribed by State Board of
Accounts.
   (G)   It is the policy of the city that any compensation acquired by any
employee as a result of travel reimbursed by the city, is the property of the
city.

policy.
      (3)   The department head will report any compensation received to the
Clerk-Treasurer's Office.

   (A)   (1)   An employee in travel status is entitled to reimbursement for
the actual itemized cost of meals and incidental expenses (defined below) at
the stated times up to the maximum rate as allowed by the published Federal
Government Meals and Incidental Expense (M&IE). The TDY (Temporary Duty
Location) determines the maximum M&IE rate. If employee travels to more than
one location in one day, the maximum M&IE rate will be the rate in effect for
the area the employee stops to sleep or rest. The Mayor's Office will provide
the Federal Government M&IE rates each time a Travel Approval form is submitted
for approval.
         (a)   Breakfast (1:00 a.m. - 9:00 a.m.).
         (b)   Lunch (9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.).
         (c)   Dinner (5:00 p.m. - 1:00 a.m.).
      (2)   An employee is only eligible for 75% of the total published Federal
Government M&IE rate on the first and last day of travel.
      (3)   Tips for meals are reimbursable up to a maximum of 15%, but must be
included in the total maximum allowed for M&IE.
      (4)   INCIDENTAL EXPENSES are: a) fees and tips given to porters, baggage
carriers, bellhops, hotel maids, stewards or stewardesses and others on ships,
and hotel servants in foreign countries; b) transportation between places of
lodging or business and places where meals are taken, if suitable meals cannot
be obtained at the temporary duty site.
   (B)   (1)   A department head must inform an employee in advance of travel
that receipts must be submitted to the department head upon completion of
travel, and that reimbursement shall be for the actual amount expended, subject
to the maximum published Federal Government M&IE Rate.
      (2)   Employees will only be allowed reimbursement for the actual cost of
meals consumed up to the published federal government rate in the time periods
listed, and will not be allowed to carry over any unused amounts of the maximum
allowance from one time period to the next. The published federal government
rates are the maximum amounts allowed for actual itemized reimbursement, and an
employee who spends any amount above the limits stated is personally
responsible for the overage except as stated below.
   (C)   The brochure or other written documentation on the event that the
employee attends must be attached before any reimbursement will be made. Make
sure to make enough copies for each claim to be reimbursed.
   (D)   Alcohol, tobacco and personal items will not be reimbursed.
   (E)   Other.
      (1)   There will be no actual meal cost reimbursement if meal(s) are
provided as a part of registration fees. If a continental breakfast is all that
is offered, the employee has the option of using actual meal reimbursement up
to the stated limit. The city will not pay for a person's meal more than once
other than the breakfast exception above.
      (2)   If lodging is provided to an employee in travel status at no cost
to the employee, a statement explaining that the person was in travel status,
signed by the department head, may be submitted as documentation to justify
claiming the actual cost of meals not to exceed the stated limit.
      (3)   An employee may claim reimbursable itemized meals for Saturdays,
Sundays, or holidays (even though he or she is not conducting city business on
those days) in order to reduce the total cost of travel. The savings must be
documented and approved in advance by the department head. Reimbursed meals may
not be claimed if the employee is using vacation, unused holiday, or personal
leave time during a part of the travel status. (Employee's time sheet will need
to be turned in before any reimbursement is made.)

and the terminal;
      (2)   The cost of transportation between the terminal, the place of
lodging and other places of business while in travel status may be reimbursed.
Employees must provide fixed mileage from a map quest or other reliable website
or an official map. Odometer readings are used only when the distance between
points cannot be determined by fixed mileage or official highway maps. The
employee must submit this documentation of such trips with travel voucher(s).

   (H)   An employee who chooses to drive rather than fly must get the travel
approved in advance by his or her department head, if he or she is in travel
status for a maximum of two full driving days each way. Driving instead of
flying will be approved only where the total cost of driving (including any
reimbursed mileage, meals, and lodging while en route) does not exceed the
total costs of flying (including any reimbursed costs of getting to and from
the airport, parking, meals not provided by airline, and airfare based on the

PROCUREMENT CARD HANDBOOK
§ 33.165 INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW.
   (A)   The City of Bedford Procurement Card is intended to provide an
efficient, cost-effective method of procurement and paying for purchases.
Advantages of the card include:
      (1)   Ease of use;
      (2)   Reduction in the number of checks produced for vendor payment;
      (3)   An itemized list of purchases made by each cardholder; and
      (4)   Additional interest earnings for the city due to increased float
time between purchase and payment.
   (B)   The Procurement Card Program is not intended:
      (1)   To avoid or bypass appropriate procurement or payment procedures;
      (2)   For personal use; or
      (3)   For cash advance.
   (C)   This subchapter provides the guidelines under which a Procurement Card
is issued and used. Please read it carefully.
(Ord. 40-2005, passed 10-11-05; Am. Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-13)
§ 33.166 USAGE.
   (A)   The card can be used at any vendor, merchant or service provider that
accepts Master Card, either in-store, or by phone, mail or fax.
   (B)   A cardholder will be required to attend training before a card will be
issued. In this training, the cardholder will be instructed on appropriate
order placement techniques, vendor selection, record keeping associated with
the Procurement Card, proper receiving techniques, and dealing with any card
difficulties.
   (C)   Please remember that you are acting as a city agent each time you use
the card. This responsibility should not be taken lightly. Use of the card is a
privilege granted by the city and, as such, may be revoked. If it is determined
that the cardholder has used or permitted a card to be used for personal or
non-business purchases or committed any other fraud or abuse in use of the
card, the cardholder will be responsible for all such charges and may be
subject to disciplinary action. As a cardholder, you will be personally liable
for any finance charges and/or interest that appear on the card issued to you
due to negligence on your part (e.g., failing to submit documents for prompt
payment of the account balance). However, you will not be responsible for
finance charges and/or interest beyond your control. Also the cardholder must
be aware of their spending limit and seek adjustments as necessary. Any
"overlimit" fees shall be the responsibility of the cardholder and a second
"overlimit" expenditure on your card may be grounds for its revocation.
   (D)   We hope that you find the card an effective and efficient tool in
expediting routine purchases. Please feel free to contact the Clerk-Treasurer's
Office if you have questions, observations or suggestions concerning the card
or its use.
(Ord. 40-2005, passed 10-11-05; Am. Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-13)
§ 33.167 FINANCE AND SUPPORT.
   The Procurement Card shall be issued through and supported by a provider
approved by the Board of Works. The Procurement Card Program will be managed by
the Clerk-Treasurer's Office.
(Ord. 40-2005, passed 10-11-05; Am. Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-13)
§ 33.168 PROCUREMENT CARD APPROVAL.
   (A)   Cards are issued at the discretion of the department head.
   (B)   Before a card is issued, the department head must be able to provide
the following:
      (1)   Assurance that the card will be used only for allowable
transactions and that supporting documentation which substantiates the
allowability, allocability and reasonableness of every transaction will be on
file. (see Appendix F, as attached to Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-13).
      (2)   Assurance that cardholders and other department office personnel
are properly trained in Procurement Card processes and procedures.
(Ord. 40-2005, passed 10-11-05; Am. Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-13)
§ 33.169 CARD CONTROLS.
   (A)   One of the benefits of a Procurement Card is the restrictions that can
be placed on any one card. Dollar limits can be set by transaction, or billing
month. This is all coded into the card account and is checked by the vendor
with each transaction. It is the responsibility of the cardholder to be aware
of their card limit and seek adjustments as necessary. Any "overlimit" fee
shall be the responsibility of the cardholder. A second "overlimit" expenditure
on the card for the cardholder may be grounds for its revocation.
   (B)   The Procurement Card will be blocked from obtaining cash advances. If
the card is presented for a cash advance, the transaction will be declined. If
the card is declined for any other reason and you feel this should not have
occurred, you may contact the provider's customer service at the number
indicated on the card to determine if it was declined because of the merchant
blocking or if the card has exceeded the monthly credit limit imposed. This
information will be helpful if you need to contact the Clerk- Treasurer's
Office to implement changes.
   (C)   Each department head will assign credit limits to each card. By
assigning a card to an individual, the department head is delegating his or her
approval authority for transactions made using the card. This is important to
consider when determining what limits to place on the use of the card.
(Ord. 40-2005, passed 10-11-05; Am. Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-13)
§ 33.170 HOW TO OBTAIN A PROCUREMENT CARD.
   (A)   Complete and sign the City of Bedford Procurement Card Agreement/
Application (Appendix A, as attached to Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-13).
   (B)   The agreement form needs the signature of the department head. They
will establish monthly dollar limits for the card.
   (C)   Forward original signed application forms to the Clerk-Treasurer's
Office, City Hall.
   (D)   The Clerk-Treasurer's Office will order the card from the Bank and
notify you when it is available to be picked up.
   (E)   The cardholder should then arrange to participate in training. The
card will not be released until training has been completed.
   (F)   For an individual card, the cardholder must pick up the card in
person, and sign for its receipt. The card will not be mailed. Photo ID will be
required.

§ 33.171 CARD SECURITY AND CANCELING A CARD.
   (A)   Card Security. Each department needs to determine how to secure the
cards. In some areas it is more appropriate for individuals to carry the cards.
In others, the cards are stored in a secure place in the office. In either
case, the credit card number should be protected as any blanket, open vendor
order number, or your own personal credit card has been in the past. Cards must
only be used by the cardholder appearing on the card.
   (B)   Canceling a Card. To cancel a card, the card should be cut in half,
and forwarded to the Clerk-Treasurer's Office. The original Cardholder
Agreement Form will be signed by the Clerk-Treasurer's Office to record proof
of the card return. For immediate cancellation, contact the Clerk-Treasurer's
Office by phone, fax or email. (See Appendix B, as attached to Ord. 13-2013,
passed 6-11-13.)
   (C)   Lost or Stolen Card. If a Procurement Card is lost or stolen,
immediately notify: the provider by calling the phone number on the back of the
card. You can call this number 24 hours/day, 365 days/year. Notify City Police
(275-3311). Also, notify the Clerk-Treasurer's Office (275-1606). Advise if you
will need a replacement card. A new cardholder's agreement will need to be
presented. Card replacement will take 3-5 working days. If you desire 24-hour
priority processing, please be aware there could be a charge for this service.
(Ord. 40-2005, passed 10-11-05; Am. Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-13)
§ 33.172 EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT, AND OTHER CHANGES PLUS CARD RENEWAL.
   (A)   Cardholder Employment Termination. Upon termination of employment of a
cardholder, the department head shall make sure the Procurement Card is
returned to the Clerk-Treasurer's Office in City Hall.
   (B)   If the Cardholder Changes Departments. In the event a cardholder moves
to another city department, the cardholder shall return the Procurement Card to
the Clerk-Treasurer's Office in City Hall. You can submit a new application
with proper approvals to secure a card for your new department.
   (C)   Tracking Cards and Necessary Changes. The Clerk-Treasurer's Office
maintains a record of all cardholders. If changes in the limits established on
the card or other elements (other than card holder name or department) are
required, send a Cardholder Account Change form, Appendix B (as attached to
Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-13), with appropriate signatures, requesting changes
to the Clerk-Treasurer's Office. The Clerk- Treasurer's Office will coordinate
with the bank to make the changes required. Such changes generally take five
working days.
   (D)   Card Renewal. A renewal card will automatically be mailed to the
Clerk-Treasurer's Office in advance of the card expiration date. Again, you
will have to personally pick up your card, and sign for its receipt. Bring
picture I.D.
(Ord. 40-2005, passed 10-11-05; Am. Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-13)
§ 33.173 CARD PURCHASES TO AVOID.
   The following issues should be considered when preparing to use the
Procurement Card for a purchase: As listed on the cardholder agreement form,
the following items ARE NOT to be purchased using this card:
   (A)   Personal or non-business purchases.
   (B)   Cash advances.
(Ord. 40-2005, passed 10-11-05; Am. Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-13)
§ 33.174 FUNDS.
   The usage of a Procurement Card versus any alternate form of procurement
instrument does not change the existing costing, charging, and support
documentation requirements that must be met for a procurement on all accounts.
We are still required to demonstrate that the item procured is allowable on the
account, and that the item purchased is necessary (allocable) for the project.
(Ord. 40-2005, passed 10-11-05; Am. Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-13)
§ 33.175 ORDERING AND RECEIPT OF MATERIALS AND SERVICES.

to Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-13).
   (B)   To help clarify shipping expenses, see Appendix D (as attached to Ord.
13-2013, passed 6-11-13).
   (C)   In the event your receive damaged goods, see Appendix D (as attached
to Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-13).
   (D)   The cardholder is responsible for ensuring receipt of materials and
services and will follow-up with the vendor to resolve any delivery problems or
discrepancies. Notify Clerk-Treasurer's Office of all problems and
discrepancies.
(Ord. 40-2005, passed 10-11-05; Am. Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-13)
§ 33.176 TAX EXEMPTION.
   (A)   BE SURE TO REMIND THE VENDOR OF THE TAX EXEMPT STATUS WHEN MAKING A
PURCHASE.
   (B)   Expenditures from city funds are generally exempted from Indiana Sales
Tax and Federal Excise Tax. Purchases from other states, sent into Indiana, are
also exempt from tax. Our Indiana Sales Tax Exemption Number is: 0031199120019.
   (C)   See Appendix E (as attached to Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-13) for the
tax exempt form which needs to be on file with any vendor so they will not
charge us tax. It may be practical to fax this certificate to the vendor.
(Ord. 40-2005, passed 10-11-05; Am. Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-13)
§ 33.177 DOCUMENTATION.
   (A)   Proper documentation for the Procurement Card is the same as any other
procurement transaction.
   (B)   A record of what is being purchased should be signed by the
cardholder. In addition, it should be noted who placed the order, and the
packing slip, sales receipt, or other receiving papers should complete the
record.
   (C)   To facilitate the reconciliation and payment process, all cardholders
are responsible for forwarding all credit card slips, cash register receipts,
packing slips, etc., to their accounts processor.
   (D)   A mail back list shall be included with any payment to the card
provider. This list shall include cardholder's name, account number and amount
to be applied to that account; this list shall equal your total payment for the
claim period.
   (E)   The cardholder and/or department may also choose to maintain a
transaction log/summary to expedite reconciliation and distribution of charges.
(see Appendix F, as attached to Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-13)
(Ord. 40-2005, passed 10-11-05; Am. Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-13)
§ 33.178 RECONCILIATION AND APPROVAL PROCESS.
   (A)   Transaction statements will be received from the provider on a monthly
basis in paper format. The statements will be sent to the accounts processor
for each department. Each department will need to determine the flow of the
statements to begin the reconciliation process. Each claim period, the
transactions need to be turned into the department's accounts processor for
payment. The accounts processor will make the claim to pay for the items
purchased by the card. Be sure to make a copy of all receipts so that you can
reconcile against the statement at the end of each month. Although only one
claim per payment period per department is required, you may choose to use
multiple claims for your convenience. The correct account line should be used
when making the claim, just as you would if you were paying the vendor
directly.
   (B)   Capital equipment can be purchased on the Procurement Card. Capital
items are generally defined to include items costing in excess of $5,000. A
Fixed Asset Form must be completed as with any capital purchase.
(Ord. 40-2005, passed 10-11-05; Am. Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-13)
§ 33.179 AUDITING PROCUREMENT CARD TRANSACTIONS.
   (A)   For each Procurement Card Transaction, the business office should
retain the originating documentation along with any notes from order placement
as well as the packing slip, and/or cash register receipts.
   (B)   If the vendor name does not agree with the credit slip/packing slip,
check to make sure that there is not another transaction to which it applies.
Example: you may order from Chevrolet Division, but the charge ship will come
back saying General Motors...these turn out to be one and the same business.
You would usually find some reference on the packing slip. If you are unable to
identify a transaction by the vendor, the transaction should be disputed on the
Vendor Dispute Form (See Appendix G, as attached to Ord. 13-2013, passed 6-11-
13). Make sure the dispute form is sent to the Clerk-Treasurer's Office.
   (C)   Like any other purchase, you may experience "Partial Shipments." Note
partial shipment on your record of transactions by using alphabet for entry:
"A" for first charge, "B" second, etc. As partial shipments may span more than
one statement period, keep appropriate copies of the transaction with each
statement reconciliation.
   (D)   Verify extensions and additions on attached receipts, charge/credit
slips, or packing slips. An arithmetic error should be disputed.
   (E)   Each Department should dispute sales tax that may be charged. Keep a
list of vendors that charge tax, and if there is a second occurrence, report
this to the Clerk- Treasurer's Office.
   (F)   If inappropriate purchases appear, justification should be required of
the originator. Insufficient justification may result in the loss of card
privileges or other appropriate disciplinary action.
   (G)   To obtain copy of a charge or credit slip, call the Bank's Customer
Service Department at the number on the back of the card.
   (H)   Disputed billing can result from failure to receive goods or services
charged, fraud or misuse, altered charges, defective merchandise, incorrect
amounts, duplicate charges, credits not processed etc. In the event of
suspected fraud, notify Police and Clerk-Treasurer's Office as soon as
possible.

BLOODBORNE PATHOGEN EXPOSURE CONTROL PLAN
§ 33.185 INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   The purpose of this exposure control plan, developed in accordance
with the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1030, is to eliminate
or minimize employee occupational exposure to blood or other infectious body
fluids. Other potentially infectious body fluids include: semen, vaginal
secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, pericardial
fluid, peritoneal fluid, amniotic fluid, saliva in dental procedures, and any
body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood, and all body fluids in
situations where it is difficult or impossible to differentiate between body
fluids.
   (B)   The Office of Administrative Services and the Safety Committees of
each city department will review the exposure control plan at least on an
annual basis and recommend updates when necessary. This review will take into
account any new or modified tasks and procedures which affect occupational
exposure and new revised employee positions with occupational exposure. It will
also reflect changes in technology that eliminate or reduce exposure to
bloodborne pathogens. Annual consideration and implementation of appropriate
commercially available and effective safer medical devices as well as safer
medical devices designed to eliminate or reduce exposure will also be
documented.
(Ord. 19-2005, passed 5-10-05)
§ 33.186 EXPOSURE DETERMINATION.
   (A)   OSHA requires employers to perform an exposure determination
concerning which employees may incur occupational exposure to blood or other
potentially infectious materials. The exposure determination is made without
regard to the use of personal protective equipment (i.e. employees are
considered to be exposed even if they wear personal protective equipment.) This
exposure determination is required to list all job classifications in which all
employees may be expected to incur such occupational exposure, regardless of
frequency. The following job classifications within the city are in this
category:
      (1)   Police Officers;
      (2)   Firefighters;
      (3)   Sewer Plant Employees;
      (4)   Sewer Distribution Employees;
      (5)   Sanitation Employees;
      (6)   Street Department Employees;
      (7)   Park Maintenance Employees;
      (8)   Lifeguards;
      (9)   Cashiers at the Pool;
      (10)   Transportation Drivers;
      (11)   Custodians;
      (12)   Water Plant Operators;
      (13)   Meter Readers;
      (14)   Golf Course Maintenance Employees;
   (B)   In addition, OSHA requires a listing of job classifications in which
some employees may have occupational exposure. Since not all the employees in
these categories would be expected to incur exposure to blood or other
potentially infectious materials, tasks or procedures that would cause these
employees to have occupational exposure are also required to be listed in order
to clearly understand which employees in these categories are considered to
have occupational exposure. The job classifications and associated tasks for
these categories are as follows: All other employees who are certified in First
Aid/CPR could be faced with an unexpected emergency situation with a patron or
co-worker.
(Ord. 19-2005, passed 5-10-05)
§ 33.187 IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE AND METHODOLOGY.
   OSHA also requires that this plan include a schedule and method of
implementation for the various requirements of the standard. The following
complies with this requirement.
   (A)   Compliance methods.  
      (1)   Universal precautions will be observed at the city in order to
prevent contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials. All blood
or other potentially infectious material will be considered infectious
regardless of the perceived status of the source individual.
      (2)   Engineering and work practice controls will be utilized to
eliminate or minimize exposure to employees at the city. Where occupational
exposure remains after institution of these controls, personal protective
equipment shall also be utilized. The above controls will be examined and
maintained or replaced on a regular schedule by the Safety Committee
Chairperson for each department. Hand washing facilities are also available to
the employees who incur exposure to blood or other potentially infectious
materials. OSHA requires that these facilities be readily accessible after
incurring exposure. Public and private restroom facilities are located in each
department. When hand washing facilities are not feasible, the city is required
to provide either an antiseptic cleanser in conjunction with a clean cloth/
paper towels or antiseptic towelettes. These supplies will be provided by the
Safety Committee Chairperson for each department.
      (3)   If these alternatives are used, then the hands are to be washed
with soap and running water as soon as feasible. Alternatives to readily
accessible hand washing facilities include public services while in city
vehicles. The Safety Committee Chairperson for each department is responsible
to ensure maintenance and accessibility of these alternatives.
      (4)   After removal of personal protective gloves, employees shall wash
hands and any other potentially contaminated skin area immediately or as soon
as feasible with soap and water. If employees incur exposure to their skin or
mucous membranes, then those areas shall be washed or flushed with water as
appropriate as soon as feasible following contact.
   (B)   Needles. Contaminated needles and other contaminated sharps will not
be bent, recapped, removed sheared or purposely broken.
   (C)   Containers for reusable sharps. Contaminated sharps that are reusable
are to be placed immediately or as soon as possible after use into appropriate
sharps containers.
   (D)   Work area restrictions. In work areas where there is a reasonable
likelihood of exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials,
employees are not to eat, drink, apply cosmetics or lip balm, smoke, or handle
contact lenses. Food and beverages are not to be kept in refrigerators,
freezers, shelves, cabinets, or on counter tops or bench tops where blood or
other potentially infectious materials are present. Mouth pipetting/suctioning
of blood or other potentially infectious materials is prohibited. All
procedures will be conducted in a manner that will minimize splashing,
spraying, splattering, and generation of droplets of blood or other potentially
infectious materials.
   (E)   Contaminated equipment. Equipment which has become contaminated with
blood or other potentially infectious materials shall be examined prior to
servicing or shipping and shall be decontaminated as necessary unless the
decontamination of the equipment is not feasible.
   (F)   Personal protective equipment.  
      (1)   All personal protective equipment used by city employees will be
provided without cost to employees. Personal protective equipment will be
chosen based on the anticipated exposure to blood or other potentially
infectious materials. The protective equipment will be considered appropriate
only if it does not permit blood or other potentially infectious materials to
pass through or reach the employees' clothing, skin, eyes, mouth, or other
mucous membranes under normal conditions of use and for the duration of time
which the protective equipment will be used.
      (2)   Protective clothing will be provided to employees by the Safety
Chairperson of each department. A personal protective equipment assessment will
be completed for employees.
      (3)   All personal protective equipment will be cleaned, laundered, or
disposed of by the city at no cost to employees. All repairs and replacements
will be made by the City of Bedford at no cost to employees. All garments which
are penetrated by blood shall be removed immediately or as soon as feasible.
All personal protective equipment will be removed prior to leaving the work
area. All contaminated personal protective equipment will be bagged in
biohazard bags and scheduled for laundry or disposal upon leaving the work
area.
      (4)   Gloves shall be worn where it is reasonably anticipated that
employees will have hand contact with blood, other potentially infectious
materials, non-intact skin, and mucous membranes. Gloves will be available from
the Safety Committee Chairperson for each department. Disposable gloves used at
this facility are not to be washed or decontaminated for re-use and are to be
replaced as soon as practical when they become contaminated or as soon as
feasible if they are torn, punctured, or when their ability to function as a
barrier is compromised. Utility gloves may be decontaminated for re-use
provided that the integrity of the glove is not compromised. Utility gloves
will be discarded if they are cracked, peeling, torn, punctured, or exhibit
other signs of deterioration or when their ability to function as a barrier is
compromised.
      (5)   Masks in combination with eye protection devices, such as goggles
or glasses with solid side shield, or chin length face shields, are required to
be worn whenever splashes, spray, splatter, or droplets of blood or other
potentially infectious materials may be generated and eye, nose or mouth
contamination can reasonably be anticipated.
      (6)   Decontamination will be accomplished by utilizing the following
materials:
         (a)   10% (minimum) solution of chlorine bleach.
         (b)   Lysol or other EPA-registered disinfectant.
      (7)   All contaminated work surfaces will be decontaminated after
completion of procedures and immediately or as soon as feasible after any spill
of blood or other potentially infectious materials, as well as the end of the
work shift if the surface may have become contaminated since the last cleaning.
      (8)   All bins, pails, cans, and similar receptacles shall be inspected
and decontaminated on a regularly scheduled basis by the custodian of the
building.
      (9)   Any broken glassware, which may be contaminated, will not be picked
up directly with the hands. Sweep or brush material into a dustpan.
   (G)   Regulated waste disposal. Regulated waste shall be placed in
appropriate containers.
   (H)   Laundry procedures.
      (1)   Laundry contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious
materials will be handled as little as possible. Such laundry will be placed in
appropriately marked bags at the location where it was used. Such laundry will
not be sorted or rinsed in the area of use.
      (2)   All employees who handle contaminated laundry will utilize personal
protective equipment to prevent contact with blood or other potentially
infectious materials. Laundry will be sent off-site for cleaning. The laundry
service accepting the laundry is to be notified, in accordance with section (d)
of the standard.
   (I)   Hepatitis B vaccine.  
      (1)   All employees who have been identified as having exposure to blood
or other potentially infectious materials will be offered the Hepatitis B
vaccine, at no cost to the employee. The vaccine will be offered within ten
working days of their initial assignment to work involving the potential for
occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials unless
the employee has previously had the vaccine or wishes to submit to antibody
testing which shows the employee to have sufficient immunity.
      (2)   Employees who decline the Hepatitis B vaccine will sign a waiver,
which uses the wording in Appendix A of the OSHA standard. Employees who
initially decline the vaccine but who later wish to have it may then have the
vaccine provided at no cost. The Office of Administrative Services has
responsibility for assuring that the vaccine is offered, the waivers are
signed, etc. as part of the new hire procedure.
   (J)   Post-exposure evaluations and follow-up.  When the employee incurs an
exposure incident, it should be reported to the Safety Committee Chairperson
for that department who will report to the Director of Administrative Services.
All employees who incur an exposure incident will be offered post-exposure
evaluation and follow-up will include the following:
      (1)   Documentation of the route of exposure and the circumstances
related to the incident.
      (2)   If possible, the identification of the source individual and, if
possible, the status of the source individual should be noted. The blood of the
source individual will be tested (after consent is obtained) for the HIV/HBV
infectivity.
      (3)   Results of testing of the source individual will be made available
to the exposed employee with the exposed employee informed about the applicable
laws and regulations concerning disclosure of the identity and infectivity of
the source individual.
      (4)   The employee will be offered the option of having their blood
collected for testing of the employee's HIV/HBV serological status. The blood
sample will be preserved for up to 90 days to allow the employee to decide if
the blood should be tested for HIV serological status. However, if the employee
decides prior to that time that testing will or will not be concluded, then the
appropriate action can be taken and the blood sample discarded.
      (5)   The employee will be offered post-exposure prophylaxis in
accordance with the current recommendations of the U.S. Public Health Service.
      (6)   The employee will be given appropriate counseling concerning
precautions to take during the period after the exposure incident. The employee
will also be given information on what potential illnesses to be alert for and
to report any related experiences to appropriate personnel.
      (7)   The Director of Administrative Services has been designated to
assure that the policy outlined here is effectively carried out as well as to
maintain records related to this policy.
   (K)   Interaction with health care professionals.
      (1)   A written opinion shall be obtained from the health care
professional who evaluates employees of the city. Written opinions will be
obtained in the following instances:
         (a)   When the employee is sent to obtain the Hepatitis B vaccine.
         (b)   Whenever the employee is sent to a health care professional
following an exposure incident.
      (2)   Health care professionals shall be instructed to limit their
opinions to:
         (a)   Whether the Hepatitis B vaccine is indicated and if the employee
has received the vaccine or for evaluation following an incident.
         (b)   That the employee has been informed of the results of the
evaluation.
         (c)   That the employee has been told about any medical conditions
resulting from exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials.
(Note that the written opinion to the employer is not to reference any personal
medical information.)
   (L)   Training. Training for all employees will be conducted prior to
initial assignment to tasks where occupational exposure may occur. Training
will be conducted in the following manner and include the following:
      (1)   An explanation of the OSHA Standard for Bloodborne Pathogens;
      (2)   Epidemiology and symptomatology of bloodborne diseases;
      (3)   Modes of transmission of bloodborne pathogens;
      (4)   This Exposure Control Plan, i.e. points of the plan, lines of
responsibility, how the plan will be implemented, etc.;
      (5)   Procedures which might cause exposure to blood or other potentially
infectious materials at the city;
      (6)   Control methods which will be used at the city to control exposure
to blood or other potentially infectious materials;

RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PLAN
§ 33.195 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
requirements for respiratory protection are presented in 29 CFR 1910.134. The
purpose of this plan is to ensure that all city personnel are afforded
protection from respiratory hazards. The primary objective is to prevent
harmful exposures that might result in occupational diseases caused by
breathing air contaminated with harmful dusts, fogs, fumes, mists, gases,
smokes, sprays, or vapors. This is accomplished as far as possible by accepted
administrative and engineering control measures (for example, general and local
ventilation, enclosure or isolation, and substitution of less hazardous
processes or materials). When effective engineering controls are not feasible,
or while they are being instituted, respirators may be required.
   (B)   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
guide to respiratory protection, publication No.87-116, as revised or updated,
shall be used as an adjunct reference for the implementation of this program.
All respirators used by the city personnel must meet criteria of NIOSH.
   (C)   All city personnel are expected to be aware of this program. All city
personnel who perform or who may be called upon to perform any work or activity
which will expose them to airborne hazardous or toxic material, or significant
amounts of dusts or mists, shall be thoroughly familiar with the contents of
this plan.
   (D)   Copies of the Respiratory Protection Plan are available for review in
the following locations:
      (1)   Office of Administrative Services, City Hall;
      (2)   Police Department;
      (3)   Fire Department;
      (4)   Park Department;
      (5)   Otis Park;
      (6)   Bedford City Utilities Water Plant;
      (7)   Bedford City Utilities Sewer Plant;
      (8)   Bedford City Utilities Water Distribution Building;
      (9)   Bedford City Utilities Sewer Distribution Building.
(Ord. 38-2005, passed 10-11-05)
§ 33.196 SCOPE.
   (A)   This plan covers all personnel, contractors, and visitors who may
become directly or indirectly involved in any activity within the limits of the
geographical areas of responsibility or in any activity undertaken as an
employee or agent of the city which may require the use of a respirator.
   (B)   The OSHA requirements as outlined in 29 CFR 1910.134(c) for an
acceptable respiratory protection program include:
      (1)   Procedures for selecting respirators for use in the workplace;
      (2)   Medical evaluations of employees required to use respirators;
      (3)   Fit testing procedures for tight-fitting respirators;
      (4)   Procedures for proper use of respirators in routine and reasonably
foreseeable emergency situations;
      (5)   Procedures and schedules for cleaning, disinfecting, storing,
inspecting, repairing, discarding, and otherwise maintaining respirators;
      (6)   Procedures to ensure adequate air quality, quantity, and flow of
breathing air for atmosphere-supplying respirators;
      (7)   Training of employees in the respiratory hazards to which they are
potentially exposed during routine and emergency situations;
      (8)   Training of employees in the proper use of respirators, including
putting on and removing them, any limitations on their use, and their
maintenance; and
      (9)   Procedures for regularly evaluating the effectiveness of the
program; and
      (10)   The designation of a program administrator who is qualified by
training or experience that is commensurate with the complexity of the program
to oversee and administer the respiratory protection program and conduct the
required evaluations of program effectiveness.
(Ord. 38-2005, passed 10-11-05)
§ 33.197 RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTHORITY.
   (A)   Director of Administrative Services. The Director of Administrative
Services is responsible for the safety and health of all city personnel.
   (B)   (1)   Safety Department Chairperson/Training Officer. The Safety
Department Chairperson/Training Officer is directly responsible to the Director
of Administrative Services for the City of Bedford Respiratory Protection
Program and has full authority to make necessary decisions to ensure the
success of this program. This authority includes approving equipment purchases
necessary to implement and operate the program. The Safety Department
Chairperson/Training Officer will develop and maintain written detailed
instructions covering each of the required elements of this plan and can
suggest amendments to this plan. The Director of Administrative Services has
expressly authorized the Safety Department Chairperson/Training Officer to halt
any operation or activity within the City of Bedford geographical areas of
responsibility where there is danger of serious personal injury or illness.
This authority includes activities with respiratory hazards. Director of
Administrative Services and the Safety Department Chairperson/Training Officer
will provide technical assistance as required and requested to assist
individual departments in determining the need for respirators, selection of
approved/certified respirators, and scheduling of training and quantitative fit
testing.
      (2)   At the time of writing of this Respiratory Protection Program,
Misty Adams is the Director of Administrative Services and is specifically
named as the Program Administrator as required under 29 CFR 1910.134(c)(3).
   (C)   Supervisory personnel. Supervisory personnel are responsible for
ensuring that respirators are available as needed, that personnel assigned to
or visiting their areas of responsibility wear respirators as required, for
scheduling the inspection of respirators on a regular basis, and for providing
the Director of Administrative Services with a list of personnel who require
initial and annual training or fitting. Additionally, supervisory personnel are
responsible for assuring that employees who desire to use respirators for their
individual comfort or convenience at times when and in places where respirators
are not required contact the Program Administrator and comply with Appendix D
to 29 CFR 1910.134, (Non-Mandatory) Information for Employees Using Respirators
When Not Required Under the Standard (as attached to Ord. 38-2005, passed 10-
11-05).
   (D)   Each individual. Each individual is responsible for using the
respirator provided to her or him in accordance with instructions and training,
for cleaning, disinfecting, inspecting, and storing his or her respirator, and
for reporting any respirator malfunction to her or his supervisor. Each
individual choosing to use a respirator for personal comfort or convenience at
times when and in places where respirators are not required must so inform her
or his immediate supervisor and must contact the Program Administrator and
comply with Appendix D to 29 CFR 1910.134, (Non-Mandatory) Information for
Employees Using Respirators When Not Required Under the Standard (as attached
to Ord. 38-2005, passed 10-11-05).
(Ord. 38-2005, passed 10-11-05)
§ 33.198 GENERAL.
   (A)   The purpose of the Respiratory Protection Program is to ensure that
viable procedures are established and maintained in accordance with the OSHA
requirements mandated in 29 CFR 1910.134 in order to protect the health of all
city personnel and visitors (as required). The responsibilities for the
management of this program are as outlined in §
33.197 and subsequent taskings as specified throughout this plan.
   (B)   Whenever possible, administrative and engineering controls that do
away with the need to use respirators should be developed and implemented.
(Ord. 38-2005, passed 10-11-05)
§ 33.199 PROCEDURES FOR SELECTING RESPIRATORS FOR USE IN THE WORKPLACE.
   (A)   Choosing the correct equipment involves several steps:
      (1)   Identifying the hazard and its extent;
      (2)   Choosing equipment that is certified/approved for the function; and
      (3)   Assuring that the device is performing the function it is intended
to perform.
   (B)   In identifying the hazard it is necessary to assess the work
environment by determining the nature and extent of the hazard, work rate, area
to be covered, existing space and ventilation, mobility, work requirements and
conditions, as well as the limitations and characteristics of the available
respirators are selection factors. If a specific standard exists for the hazard
(e.g. lead, asbestos), the guidelines or requirements in the standard must be
followed. Also the chemical and physical properties of a harmful, irritating,
or nuisance airborne material as well as the published Threshold Limit Values
(TLV), Permissible Exposure Limits (PEL), or any other available exposure
limits or estimates of toxicity for the materials and the amount of oxygen
present must be considered.
   (C)   Although there are many kinds of respirators used for protection,
there are two basic types—air-purifying and atmosphere-supplying respirators.
      (1)   Air-purifying respirators use filters or absorbents to remove
limited concentrations of contaminants from the breathing air. They range from
simple disposable masks to half- and full-face respirators to sophisticated
positive pressure, blower-operated units. Air purifying respirators may not be
used in an oxygen deficient atmosphere or under immediately dangerous to life
or health (IDLH) conditions. OSHA defines an IDLH atmosphere as any atmosphere
that poses an immediate threat to life, would cause irreversible adverse health
effects, or would impair an individual's ability to escape from a dangerous
atmosphere.
      (2)   Atmosphere-supplying respirators are designed to provide breathing
air from a clean source outside of the contaminated work area. They include
supplied air respirators (SAR) and self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).
   (D)   The time needed to perform a given task usually determines the length
of time for which respiratory protection is needed, including the time
necessary to enter and leave a contaminated area. An SCBA or chemical cartridge
respirator provides respiratory protection for relatively short periods,
whereas an airline respirator provides protection for as long as the face piece
is supplied with an adequate quantity of respirable air. For protracted periods
of use, positive pressure supplied air respirators offer the advantage of
longer use in highly contaminated areas and minimize the need for concern
regarding sensory warning properties of the airborne toxic materials. Positive
pressure supplied air respirators also cause less discomfort than air-purifying
respirators because the wearer need not overcome filter resistance in order to
inhale.
   (E)   Some type of service life warning indicator is available for all SCBA
and some chemical cartridge respirators. The warnings usually are an audible
alarm based on remaining pressure for SCBA and a color-change indicator for
cartridges. The user must understand the operation and limitations of each type
of warning device and of each type of respirator. Air-purifying respirators
present minimal interference with the wearer's movement while SCBA present size
and weight (35 lbs) penalties.
   (F)   Three types of respirators generally are available at the city for
general and type-specific uses. The Director of Administrative Services must be
contacted concerning the selection or use of any type of respirator.
      (1)   Negative pressure respirators. The air pressure inside the
respiratory inlet covering is negative with respect to ambient air during
inhalation. Negative Pressure Regulators are the dust filter masks used by
buildings and grounds personnel while cutting grass etc.
      (2)   Positive pressure respirators. The air pressure inside the
respiratory inlet covering normally is positive with respect to ambient air
pressure. These are the SCBA utilized by the city for emergency response
operations involving unknown or suspected IDLH hazards or confined space entry/
rescue.
      (3)   Air-purifying respirators. Inhaled air is drawn through a canister/
cartridge which contains chemicals and a filter that removes or neutralizes
agents present. These units are used by the city for task specific non-IDLH
conditions.
   (G)   The decision to use negative pressure, positive pressure, or air-
purifying respirators will be based on whether or not the work involved will be
considered IDLH, has specific respirators designated, or is of a routine nature
with published TLV's, PEL's, etc. which can be used to determine the
appropriate protection factor (PF).
   (H)   The Director of Administrative Services will provide assistance in
determining the correct type respirator for routine use. This assistance will
include working with the appropriate Safety Department Chairperson/Training
Officer to evaluate the respiratory hazards in the particular workplace with
regard to selecting the general type of respirator required to assure worker
safety under the OSHA standard.
   (I)   All emergency situations will be handled as IDLH unless the exact type
and, if possible, concentration of the substance is known. Any IDLH entry
requires one standby person in a safe area with SCBA for each person working in
the entry or clean-up phases of the emergency operation.
(Ord. 38-2005, passed 10-11-05)
§ 33.200 MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE.
   (A)   OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134(b)(10) states that no one should be assigned a
task requiring use of a respirator unless that person is found physically able
to do the work while wearing the respirator. In addition, some regulatory
standards for specific substances and occupations may also contain requirements
for medical examinations. Both types of standards declare that a physician or
other licensed healthcare professional should determine what health and
physical conditions are pertinent and that respirator wearers' medical status
should be reviewed periodically. Ideally pre-placement medical examinations
should identify those persons who are physically or psychologically unfit to
wear respirators. As another part of the examination, medical tests pertinent
to the respiratory hazards which may be encountered should be made to obtain
baseline data against which to assess physiological changes in respirator
wearers. In addition, the previous medical and employment histories of the
individual should be considered.
   (B)   It is the policy of the city that a physician or other licensed
healthcare professional determines if a person should or should not wear a
respirator.
   (C)   All city personnel who may be required to wear respirators in the
course of their work responsibilities will be provided medical examinations in
accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134. The medical examinations will be provided free
of charge to the individual and will be scheduled during the course of the work
day as much as possible. Records associated with these examinations are
maintained by the examiner. The Office of the Director of Administrative
Services will be given the federally mandated respiratory clearance. These
records are accorded the highest degree of confidentiality.
   (D)   Appendix A (as attached in Ord. 38-2005, passed 10-11-05) to this plan
is the Mandatory Medical Evaluation Questionnaire presented in 29 CFR 1910.134
Appendix C. This questionnaire will be given to each person being evaluated for
respirator use and forwarded to the physician or other licensed healthcare
professional. In some cases, after reviewing the questionnaire, the physician
or other licensed healthcare professional might not require a face-to-face
meeting or examination, but that decision rests with the physician or other
licensed healthcare professional. If an employee desires to discuss any aspect
of the medical evaluation process with the physician or other licensed
healthcare professional, the employee will be allowed to do so during normal
working hours as a normal course of employment. The physician or other licensed
healthcare professional performing the medical evaluation also will be provided
with a general description of the activities that require a respirator that the
employee is likely to perform.
   (E)   New medical evaluations will be required of all respirator users:
      (1)   At intervals not to exceed two years;
      (2)   Whenever an employee reports medical signs or symptoms that are
related to the ability to use a respirator;
      (3)   Whenever the physician or other licensed healthcare professional,
program administrator, or immediate supervisor informs the employee that a
reevaluation is necessary;
      (4)   Whenever information from the respiratory protection program
indicates a need for reevaluation; and
      (5)   Whenever a change occurs in workplace conditions that may result in
a substantial increase in the physiological burden placed on the employee.
(Ord. 38-2005, passed 10-11-05)
§ 33.201 FIT TEST PROCEDURES.
   (A)   This program anticipates that the vast majority of fit tests required
will be Quantitative Fit Tests. The individual quantitative fit tests will be
administered by an individual who has received training in quantitative fit
testing or by other individuals specifically approved by the Program
Administrator. Fit tests will follow the protocols set forth in 29 CFR 1910.134
(f).
   (B)   Fit tests will be repeated annually for all persons with a continuing
need to use a respirator.
   (C)   All persons should remember that it is not the employee who passes or
fails a fit test, it is the respirator. Employees should be cognizant that
"fudging" to pass the fit test puts the employee at risk as a respirator that
does not fit properly will not afford the respirator's user the maximum level
of protection.
(Ord. 38-2005, passed 10-11-05)
§ 33.202 PROCEDURES FOR THE PROPER USE OF RESPIRATORS IN ROUTINE AND REASONABLY
FORESEEABLE EMERGENCY SITUATIONS.
   (A)   Respirators with tight-fitting face pieces may not be used by
employees who have facial hair that comes between the sealing surface of the
face piece and the face or that interferes with the function of any component
of the respirator or who have any condition that interferes with the face-to-
face piece seal or valve function of the respirator.
   (B)   If an employee wears corrective glasses or goggles or other personal
protective equipment, that equipment must be worn so that it does not interfere
with the seal of the face piece to the face of the user. In the case of
employees who need to wear corrective lenses and a full-face respirator, the
appropriate corrective lense kit will be provided along with the respirator.
   (C)   Every user of a tight-fitting respirator is required to perform a user
seal check (or fit check) each time the respirator is put on. The user seal
check will follow the procedures in Appendix B-1 on 29 CFR 1910.134 which is
reproduced in Appendix B (as attached in Ord. 38-2005, passed 10-11-05).
   (D)   The Program Administrator will work with the Safety Department
Chairperson/Training Officer to assure that persons knowledgeable of respirator
use and the requirements thereof observe employees from time to time as they
use respirators so as to enable an ongoing evaluation of the effectiveness of
respirator use. Should problems be noted, they will be brought promptly to the
attention of the Program Administrator who will consult with the employee, the
employee's supervisor, and others as necessary to develop procedures to correct
the problems and to improve the effectiveness of the respirator.
   (E)   Employees using respirators will leave the respirator use area:
      (1)   Whenever they need to wash their faces and the respirator face
pieces in order to prevent eye or skin irritation associated with respirator
use;
      (2)   If they detect vapor or gas breakthrough in the respirator, changes
in breathing resistance, or leakage of the face piece; or
      (3)   To replace respirator filter or similar elements.
   (F)   If the employee detects vapor or gas breakthrough, changes in
breathing resistance, or leakage of the face piece, the respirator must be
replaced or repaired before the employee is allowed to return to the respirator
use area.
   (G)   As stated above, work in IDLH atmospheres is not anticipated as a
regular occurrence at the city. In the event that work is necessary in an IDLH
atmosphere the following procedures will be followed.
      (1)   There will be a comparably and fully equipped worker ready
immediately outside the IDLH area for each worker in the IDLH area ("one in one
out"). The "outside" member of the pair will be trained and equipped to provide
effective rescue of the "inside" member of the pair.
      (2)   Positive visual, voice, including radio or telephone, or signal
line communication will be maintained between the persons inside the IDLH area
and their opposite members outside the IDLH area.
      (3)   All work inside an IDLH atmosphere will utilize positive pressure
SCBA or a positive pressure, supplied-air system with an auxiliary ("escape")
SCBA.
(Ord. 38-2005, passed 10-11-05)
§ 33.203 MAINTENANCE AND CARE OF RESPIRATORS.
   (A)   Respirators will be cleaned, inspected, and maintained in accordance
with 29 CFR 1910.134 (h). Although it is the responsibility of the individual
respirator user to clean, inspect, and maintain his or her respirator, the
employee's immediate supervisor will develop a plan to assure that the
appropriate tasks are performed as required.
   (B)   Appendix C (as attached in Ord. 38-2005, passed 10-11-05) contains the
cleaning procedures specified in Appendix B-2 of 29 CFR 1910.134.

completed.
(Ord. 48-2005, passed 11-8-05)
§ 33.233 SHIFT AND PERSONNEL CHANGES.
   Employers must ensure the continuity of employee protection by providing for
the orderly transfer of lockout or tagout device protection between off-going
and incoming employees. This will help to minimize exposure to hazards from the
unexpected energization or start-up of the machine or equipment or the release
of stored energy.
(Ord. 48-2005, passed 11-8-05)
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
§ 33.235 POLICY AND PROCEDURES.
   (A)   To ensure the greatest possible protection for our employees in the
workplace, the cooperative efforts of the city as well as our employees will
help in establishing and maintaining a safe and healthful work environment. The
Office of Administrative Services and the Safety Committee are responsible for:
      (1)   Performing a hazard assessment of the workplace to identify and
control physical and health hazards;
      (2)   Identifying and providing appropriate PPE for the employees, some
of which will be of no cost to the employee;
      (3)   Training employees in the use and care of the PPE;
      (4)   Maintaining PPE, including replacing worn or damaged PPE; and
      (5)   Periodically reviewing, updating and evaluating the effectiveness
of the PPE program including a review of injury and illness records.
   (B)   Employees are responsible for:
      (1)   Properly wearing PPE;
      (2)   Attendance at training sessions on PPE;
      (3)   Care for, clean and maintain PPE; and
      (4)   Informing a supervisor of the need to repair or replace PPE.
   (C)   This subchapter represents the policy and procedures in regard to
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as set forth by the city in compliance with
the standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
OSHA requires that many categories of PPE meet or be equivalent to standards
developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The city is
responsible for providing some categories at no cost to the employee. PPE that
is supplied by the city must be used as opposed to employee-owned PPE.
   (D)   Personal Protective Equipment is defined as follows: Safety related
devices which will protect the employee from workplace hazards such as
machines, work procedures, hazardous substances, and interior structural
firefighting that can cause injury. Examples of these types of safety devices
are: safety glasses or goggles, face shields, hard hats, safety shoes, gloves,
protective clothing, ear plugs and ear muffs.
   (E)   All employees of the city will be required to adhere to and comply
with all safety guidelines and regulations that are expected of them. These
guidelines are set down by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) and are in no way flexible in their usage. Failure to comply with these
safety regulations will result in disciplinary action which can range from a
verbal warning to termination. Also, failure to comply with these safety
regulations could negate any "worker's compensation" claim that an employee may
have if it can be proven that the employee was not acting in accordance with
the PPE safety policy and procedures.
   (F)   All employees will be issued the proper safety equipment for the job
that they are performing at the time of assignment, or the department may
choose to issue the equipment individually for the employee to keep in a
personal locker or storage space. Either way, the supervisor is responsible for
making sure that all employees have access to the appropriate equipment. If,
for any reason, an employee does not have the proper safety equipment for an
assigned job, the employee is to notify their supervisor immediately. DO NOT
proceed to complete the assigned job without the proper safety equipment.
Failure to notify a supervisor about the lack of proper PPE devices and
continuing an assigned job will be seen as negligence on the part of the
employee.
   (G)   All employees will be trained to know at least the following:
      (1)   When PPE is necessary;
      (2)   What PPE is necessary;
      (3)   How to properly put on, take off, adjust and wear the PPE;
      (4)   The limitations of the PPE; and
      (5)   Proper care, maintenance, useful life and disposal of PPE.
   (H)   Documentation of the training of each employee required to wear and
use PPE will be recorded. It is in the best interest of the employee and
supervisor to cooperate with one another in regards to personal protective
equipment, as a good PPE program can greatly reduce the number of job-related
accidents.
   (I)   Personal Protective Equipment can be broken down into areas of the
body. The areas discussed in this document are labeled as:
      (1)   Eye and Face Protection;
      (2)   Head Protection;
      (3)   Foot and Leg Protection;
      (4)   Hand and Arm Protection;
      (5)   Body Protection;
      (6)   Hearing Protection; and
      (7)   Department Issue Protection.
   (J)   Each of these areas discussed will provide the employee with the
description of a work environment that would require usage of personal
protective equipment. The employee will also be given numerous examples of tool
usage and job duties that would require the employee to wear a PPE. It is
impossible to list every single job that an employee may run across where
protective gear would be required, so the employee will need to communicate
with his/her supervisor to determine if unlisted activities require a PPE. Once
the supervisor has made the determination of whether or not the activity is
subject to the PPE requirements the employee will be bound by that decision
from that point on. In other words, if using a circular saw was not listed as
an activity requiring safety glasses and the supervisor made it clear that the
employee needed to wear safety glasses, then using a circular saw would be
become bound under the PPE policy even though it wasn't listed in the initial
policy. At this point it is the supervisor's responsibility to inform all
employees about the new requirement and make documentation with signatures
showing that they were informed.
(Ord. 49-2005, passed 11-8-05)
§ 33.236 EYE AND FACE PROTECTION.
   (A)   Any employee who is actively working in or near a work environment
where there is a potential for airborne dust, flying debris, molten metal,
liquid chemicals, acids or caustic liquids, chemical gases or vapors,
potentially infected material or potentially harmful light radiation must wear
protective eyewear that meets the requirements for ANSI Z87.1-1989. Examples of
activities which would require the use of protective eyewear include:
      (1)   Sawing, cutting, drilling, sanding, grinding, hammering, chopping,
abrasive blasting, weed-eating, mowing, chiseling and chipping brush;
      (2)   Chemical splashes from corrosive substances, hot liquids, solvents
or other hazardous solutions;
      (3)   Objects swinging into the eye or face, such as tree limbs, chains,
tools or ropes;
      (4)   Radiant energy from welding, harmful rays from the use of lasers or
other radiant light as well as heat, glare, sparks, splash and flying
particles; and
      (5)   Fire brigade members when performing operations where the hazards
of flying or falling materials which may cause eye and face injuries are
present.
   (B)   Full facepieces, helmets, or hoods of breathing apparatus that meet
the ANSI requirements above shall be acceptable as meeting the eye and face
protection requirements for fire brigade members.
   (C)   Everyday use of prescription corrective lenses will not provide
adequate protection. Employees must wear eye protection that incorporates the
prescription into the design or must wear additional eye protection over their
prescription lenses.
   (D)   Any employee who is actively working in or near a work environment
where there is a potential to be hit or splashed in the face with chemicals or
hot materials or any other damaging material must wear a protective mask which
meets the requirements for ANSI Z87.1-1989. Examples of activities which would
require the use of a protective mask are changing acid barrels, welding or
cutting with an acetylene torch and fire brigade members performing interior
structural firefighting.
(Ord. 49-2005, passed 11-8-05)
§ 33.237 HEAD PROTECTION.
   (A)   Any employee who is actively working in or near a work environment
where there is a potential for an impact and penetration hazard as well as from
electrical shock and burn hazards must wear head protection.
   (B)   Head protection that meets the requirements of ANSI Z89.1-1986 must be
worn if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Objects might fall from above and strike them on the head;
      (2)   They might bump their heads against fixed objects, such as exposed
pipes or beams; or
      (3)   There is a possibility of accidental head contact with electrical
hazards.
   (C)   Examples of activities where this would apply are: trimming tree limbs
or cutting down trees, chipping brush, electrical work, entering a confined
space and any construction where there is work going on overhead which
increases the likelihood of a potential injury from a dropped object.
   (D)   Fire Brigade members head protection shall consist of a protective
head device with ear flaps and chin strap which meet the performance,
construction, and testing requirements of the U.S. Fire Administration.
(Ord. 49-2005, passed 11-8-05)
§ 33.238 FOOT AND LEG PROTECTION.
   (A)   Any employee who is actively working in or near a work environment
where there is a potential for foot or leg injuries from falling or rolling
objects or from crushing or penetrating materials is required to wear
protective footwear that meets the requirements of ANSI Z41-1991. Examples of
activities where this would apply are: downing trees, cutting logs, jack-
hammering, construction, and fire brigade interior structural firefighting.
   (B)   Any employee who is actively working in or near a work environment
where there is a potential for the employee's legs to be injured by a blade or
flying debris will be required to wear long pants which fully cover the legs.
Examples of activities where long pants will be required are weed-eating, jack-
hammering or use of any industrial saw (concrete saw, chain-saw, etc.). When
the employee is using a chain-saw he/she will be required to wear the
protective chaps to give added protection against leg injuries.
   (C)   Some jobs within departments are not required to wear long pants at
all times. However, if the employees abuse this privilege by ignoring
situations which require them, this privilege will be revoked and employees
will be required to wear long pants at all times. Also, steel-toed boots are
only required in certain departments and job environments and because of this
the safety chairperson will advise each department on the footwear they choose
to wear. NO OPEN-TOED shoes or sandals will be allowed at any time or place in
the workplace. The same requirements apply to footwear as to long pants, if the
employee abuses this privilege it will be revoked and the employees will wear
steel-toed boots at all times.
   (D)   Fire brigade members foot and leg protection shall consist of
protective boots worn in combination with protective trousers that meet the
body protection requirements in this policy. In addition, protective footwear
shall be water-resistant for at least five inches above the bottom of the heel
and shall be equipped with slip-resistant outer soles.
(Ord. 49-2005, passed 11-8-05)
§ 33.239 HAND AND ARM PROTECTION.
   Any employee actively working in a work environment where there is a
potential for injury to the employee's hands or arms must wear the appropriate
protective gear. Anytime an employee is working with sharp objects, loading/
unloading any material that could cut or puncture skin, and heat penetration
there will be a requirement to wear gloves made of a thick protective material
(leather). Glove or glove system for fire brigade shall be tested in accordance
with the test methods contained in the NIOSH 1976 publication, the development
of Criteria for Firefighter's Gloves; Volume H, Part II: Test Methods. One
activity in particular that requires the use of protective gloves is dumping
trash barrels. Anytime an employee is working with a corrosive liquid or acid,
the employee is required to wear rubber gloves that will protect the hands and
arms. Anytime an employee is welding or cutting with an acetylene torch the
employee will be required to wear protective gloves and/or shirt that will
adequately protect the hands and arms. When an employee is at risk of exposure
to bloodborne pathogens, the employee is required to wear protective latex
gloves or its equivalent.
(Ord. 49-2005, passed 11-8-05)
§ 33.240 BODY PROTECTION.
   Any employee actively working in or near a work environment where there is a
potential of injury to the body must wear protective gear or clothing. Body
protection includes laboratory coats, coveralls, vests, jackets, aprons, gowns,
full body suits, and fire-resistive coats in combination with protective
trousers which meet the performance, construction, and testing of NFPA standard
No. 1971-1975, protective clothing for structural firefighting for fire
brigades. Examples of this type of environment are potential impacts from
tools, machinery and materials, hazardous chemicals and structural
firefighting. As an example, the employee will be required to wear an apron
which will prevent loose clothing from being wound up in the grinding wheel
which can lead to serious injury. Employees will be required to wear a shirt at
all times (NO EXCEPTIONS). Employees will be required to wear vests which are
colored fluorescent orange when they are working alongside a roadway. Also, any
employee who uses the bucket truck for any reason shall wear a safety harness
and be tied off at all times while in the bucket.
(Ord. 49-2005, passed 11-8-05)
§ 33.241 HEARING PROTECTION.
   Any employee who is actively working in or near a work environment where
there is the potential for hearing damage or loss, either from short-term or
long-term exposure, will be required to wear ear plugs or ear muffs.
Environments that have the potential to cause hearing damage would be the pump
rooms, weed-eating, mowing and operating saws and other loud industrial
equipment. The OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.95 requires the use of hearing
protection when the employee's noise exposure exceeds an eight-hour time-
weighted average sound level (TWA) of 90 dBA (dose of 100 percent).
Nonetheless, it is in the best interest of the employee to wear ear protection
in virtually all work environments.
(Ord. 49-2005, passed 11-8-05)
§ 33.242 DEPARTMENT ISSUE PROTECTION.
   Police and Fire Department personnel have standard operating procedure and
rules and regulations manuals. Personal Protective Equipment listed in those
manuals in addition to this policy shall be followed.
(Ord. 49-2005, passed 11-8-05)

(Ord. 50-2005, passed 11-8-05)
§ 33.253 FIRE PREVENTION AND WORKPLACE HAZARDS.
   (A)   Smoking allowed only in designated areas. "Smoking" means the carrying
or holding of a lighted cigarette, cigar, pipe, or any other lighted smoking
equipment, or the inhalation or exhalation of smoke from any lighted smoking
equipment. The official in charge of a public building shall designate a
nonsmoking area and may designate a smoking area in the building. When smoking
and nonsmoking areas are designated, the official in charge of a public
building may take reasonably necessary measures to accommodate both smokers and
nonsmokers. If a public building consists of a single room, any part or all of
the room may be reserved and posted as a nonsmoking area. A person who smokes
in a public building, except in an area designated as a smoking area commits a
Class B infraction. However, the violation is a Class A infraction if the
person has at least three previous unrelated judgments for violating this
section that are accrued within the 12 months immediately preceding the
violation. The official in charge of a public building shall do the following:
      (1)   Post conspicuous signs that read "Smoking Is Prohibited By State
Law Except In Designated Smoking Areas" or other similar language;
      (2)   Request persons who are smoking in violation of this section to
refrain from smoking; and

   (I)   Each supervisor will be responsible for his or her shift employees to
handle, store, and maintain hazardous materials properly.
(Ord. 50-2005, passed 11-8-05)
§ 33.255 MAINTENANCE OF FIRE EQUIPMENT AND SYSTEMS.
   (A)   Safety Committee member/members will designate an employee who will
conduct monthly inspection of fire extinguishers for their department. Tags
will be initialed each month after inspection, A master list per department
with location will be compiled. Any questions or problems should be conveyed
back to the Safety Committee member.
   (B)   An outside safety firm will run annual checks on all fire extinguisher
equipment. The master list will be checked to assure fire extinguishers have
not been missed.
   (C)   There are basically four different types or classes of fire
extinguishers, each of which extinguishes specific types of fire. Newer fire
extinguishers use a picture/labeling system to designate which types of fires
they are to be used on. Older fire extinguishers are labeled with colored
geometrical shapes with letter designations. Both of these types of labels are
shown below with the description of the different classes of extinguishers.
   (D)   Additionally, Class A and Class B fire extinguishers have a numerical
rating which is based on tests conducted by Underwriter's Laboratories that are
designed to determine the extinguishing potential for each size and type of
extinguisher.
   (E)   Fire Extinguisher Ratings.
      (1)   Class A Extinguishers will put out fires in ordinary combustibles,
such as wood and paper. The numerical rating for this class of fire
extinguisher refers to the amount of water the fire extinguisher holds and the
amount of fire it will extinguish.

   (2)   Class B Extinguishers should be used on fires involving flammable
liquids, such as grease, gasoline, oil, etc. The numerical rating for this
class of fire extinguisher states the approximate number of square feet of a
flammable liquid fire that a non-expert person can expect to extinguish.

      (3)   Class C Extinguishers are suitable for use on electrically
energized fires. This class of fire extinguishers does not have a numerical
rating. The presence of the letter "C" indicates that the extinguishing agent
is non-conductive.

      (4)   Class D Extinguishers are designed for use on flammable metals and
are often specific for the type of metal in question. There is no picture
designator for Class D extinguishers. These extinguishers generally have no
rating nor are they given a multi-purpose rating for use on other types of
fires.
   (E)   Multi-Class Ratings.
      (1)   Many extinguishers available today can be used on different types
of fires and will be labeled with more than one designator, e.g. A-B, B-C, or
A-B-C. Make sure that if you have a multi-purpose extinguisher it is properly
labeled.

      (3)   This is the new style of labeling that shows whether this
extinguisher may be used on Ordinary Combustibles, Flammable Liquids, or
Electrical Equipment fires. This is the new labeling style with a diagonal red
line drawn through the picture to indicate what type of fire this extinguisher
is NOT suitable for. In this example, the fire extinguisher could be used on
Ordinary Combustibles and Flammable Liquids fires, but not for Electrical
Equipment fires.

   (F)   Types of Fire Extinguishers.
      (1)   Dry chemical extinguishers are usually rated for multiple purpose
use. They contain an extinguishing agent and use a compressed, non-flammable
gas as a propellant.
      (2)   Halon extinguishers contain a gas that interrupts the chemical
reaction that takes place when fuels burn. These types of extinguishers are
often used to protect valuable electrical equipment since they leave no residue
to clean up. Halon extinguishers have a limited range, usually four to six
feet. The initial application of Halon should be made at the base of the fire,
even after the flames have been extinguished.
      (3)   Water extinguishers contain water and compressed gas and should
only be used on Class A (ordinary combustibles) fires.
      (4)   Carbon Dioxide (CO2) extinguishers are most effective on Class B
and C (liquids and electrical) fires. Since the gas disperses quickly, these
extinguishers are only effective from three to eight feet. The carbon dioxide
is stored as a compressed liquid in the extinguisher; as it expands, it cools
the surrounding air. The cooling will often cause ice to form around the "horn"
where the gas is expelled from the extinguisher. Since the fire could re-
ignite, continue to apply the agent even after the fire appears to be out.
   (G)   How to Use a Fire Extinguisher.
      (1)   Even though extinguishers come in a number of shapes and sizes,
they all operate in a similar manner. Here's an easy acronym for fire
extinguisher use: PASS — Pull, Aim, Squeeze, and Sweep.
      (2)   Pull the pin at the top of the extinguisher that keeps the handle
from being accidentally pressed.
      (3)   Aim the nozzle toward the base of the fire.
      (4)   Stand approximately eight feet away from the fire and squeeze the
handle to discharge the extinguisher. If you release the handle, the discharge
will stop.
      (5)   Sweep the nozzle back and forth at the base of the fire. After the
fire appears to be out, watch it carefully since it may re-ignite!
      (6)   Congratulations -- you did it!!!

§ 33.256 EMERGENCY PROCEDURE FOR HAZARDOUS SPILLS/LEAKS.
   Notify Emergency Control person(s) of the location, material identity, and
approximate amount spilled. Unless immediate evacuation is necessary, obtain
the MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) book to determine the actual response
necessary for that particular spill/leak. Follow MSDS instructions. Should an
external leak/spill occur such as gas or other hazardous chemicals follow the
direction of emergency personnel. If an evacuation is ordered, follow
notification of emergency warning and evacuation procedures as previously noted
in this subchapter.
(Ord. 50-2005, passed 11-8-05)
§ 33.257 INCLEMENT WEATHER.
   (A)   The following processes and procedures shall represent the weather
related closing policies of the City of Bedford.
   (B)   The City of Bedford serves the citizens of our city and it is very
important our departments remain open whenever possible. This policy relates to
non-essential employees only. Essential personnel must report to work as
scheduled during inclement weather. This would include police and dispatch,
firemen, water plant and street department drivers who are called to duty. Such
essential designations may change from time to time, depending upon the
particular circumstances of each situation. In addition to receiving their
regular daily salary or wage for such a day, those "essential" employees who
are working when the emergency is declared, or who report to work for any shift
during the emergency, shall be entitled to compensatory time off or overtime
equal to the number of hours actually worked during the emergency as stipulated
in our overtime policy. "Non-essential" employees who are not called in to work
shall receive their regular pay for such day. Those "non-essential" employees
who, nonetheless, voluntarily report to work on such a day shall not receive
any compensation in addition to their regular rate of pay.
   (C)   In the event inclement weather threatens after a work day has begun,
the Mayor may order an early closure of offices to enable the safe travel home
by employees. When such an order has been issued, the Department Heads will be
notified and they in turn will notify their employees. Staff will be paid for
the entire work day in cases such as this. An employee on previously approved
vacation or sick leave will not be affected by such a decision. An early
closure or late opening time is not a "bonus" time but time to be used for the
safety of those at work.
   (D)   If in the opinion of the Mayor, inclement weather prohibits the
opening of the offices at the usual time or prohibits the opening of the
offices for an entire day, notification of the department heads will be made as
early as possible. Department Heads should establish a calling procedure for
employee notification. Notification will also be placed on the following radio
stations, WBIW and WQRK in Bedford, and will specifically be stated as City of
Bedford Offices.
   (E)   If offices are closed for an entire work day, non-essential employees
will be paid for the entire day. If offices are opened on a late schedule, non-
essential employees reporting to work at the designated time will be paid for
the full day. Non-Essential Employees not able to make it in to the office will
not be disciplined for failing to be at work and will be allowed to take
accrued leave for the balance of the day in full or half day increments.

HAZARD COMMUNICATION PROGRAM
§ 33.265 STATEMENT OF NEED.
   There are two primary reasons why the city has implemented a Hazard
Communication Program (HCP). One, the employer must comply with the Federal
OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.1200 (general industry). Additionally, a Hazard
Communication Program will assist the city in achieving our overall goal of a
safer work place.
(Ord. 51-2005, passed 11-8-05)
§ 33.266 ANTICIPATED BENEFITS.
    Several benefits are anticipated with the implementation of the Hazard
Communication Program.
      (1)   Prevention of chemical related illnesses and injuries;
      (2)   Overall improvement of the company safety program;
      (3)   Improvement of employer-employee relations by establishing regular
lines of communications; and
      (4)   Avoidance of OSHA citations, violations, and related problems.

§ 33.269 WARNING.
   (A)   Chemicals will not be used until the following requirements are met:
      (1)   All affected employees are properly trained to use the chemicals;
      (2)   A material safety data sheet (MSDS) is obtained for each chemical;
      (3)   Each chemical is added to the inventory list; and
      (4)   Proper personal protective equipment has been selected and issued
to affected employees.
   (B)   Chemicals which do not meet the four requirements will be stored at
one of the above locations and marked "Do Not Use" until Hazard Communication
and Personal Protective Equipment Requirements are met by the Safety Committee
Chairman of each department.
(Ord. 51-2005, passed 11-8-05)
§ 33.270 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Hazard Communication Program is to ensure that the
hazards of chemicals located in each department are evaluated and that
information concerning physical and health hazards is transmitted to
potentially exposed employees. It is not only the intent of the city to fully
comply with the OSHA Standard 1910.1200 and
1926.59, but also to improve the overall safety of our company. A successful
Hazard Communication Program will reduce potential incidents of chemical source
illnesses and injuries.
(Am. Ord. 33-1990, passed 12-11-90; Am. Ord. 51-2005, passed 11-8-05)
§ 33.271 AUTHORITY.
   The Hazard Communication Program is required by the Indiana Occupational
Safety and Health Administration; pursuant to Title 29 CFR Subpart Z part
1910.1200 and/or 29 CFR 1926.59.
(Ord. 51-2005, passed 11-8-05)
§ 33.272 SUMMARY.
   (A)   The passage of OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard gives the city the
responsibility to establish a written, comprehensive program which includes
provisions for container labeling, material safety data sheets, and employee
information and training. The written program must contain a list of the
hazardous chemical(s) in each work area, the means used to inform employees of
hazards of non-routine tasks, the hazards associated with chemicals contained
in unlabeled pipes in their work area, and methods used to inform contractors
in the facilities of chemical hazards to which they may be exposed. This
written Hazard Communication Program outlines the plan to establish the
objectives of the standard. Each objective will be defined and discussed in
this subchapter and are specifically discussed in §§
33.274 through
33.280. Additionally, this written program shall be reviewed during employee
training. This written plan will be reviewed every year for accuracy and
completeness. The written plan and its elements will be updated in the
following situations:
      (1)   New chemicals are introduced into the workplace;
      (2)   When new processes involving chemicals are introduced;
      (3)   When program job duties are changed;
      (4)   When locations mentioned in the program are changed; or
      (5)   When any other elements are changed.
   (B)   A record of the last change which includes the date and change will be
recorded, and kept with this program by the Director of Administrative
Services.
(Ord. 51-2005, passed 11-8-05)
§ 33.273 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ABSOLUTE GRAVITY. Refers to the density or specific gravity of a fluid at
standard conditions; for example, with gases, at 760 mm Hg (pressure) and 0
degrees Centigrade (temperature). Also known as absolute density.
   ACGIH. American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists: an
organization of professional personnel in governmental agencies or educational

developing rapidly and coming quickly to crisis. Usually occurs following a
single exposure to a chemical. Also see "chronic effect."
   ACUTE TOXICITY. The adverse (acute) effects resulting from a single dose of,
or short exposure to, a substance.
   AEROSOL. An airborne solid or liquid substance.
   ALKALI. A compound that has the ability to neutralize an acid to form a
salt. A substance that is bitter in a water solution, and somewhat irritating
or corrosive to the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. This type of substance

of Administrative Services and the Training Officer. The new chemicals will be
added on the hazard communication program list form.
(Ord. 51-2005, passed 11-8-05)
§ 33.275 MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEETS (MSDS).
   (A)   Each department designee listed in this program is in charge of MSDS
acquisition for their department. Material Safety Data Sheets are the keystone
to a successful hazard communication program. MSDSs are designed to provide the
information needed to handle chemicals safely. They provide the necessary
information for training, hazard evaluation, proper handling, emergency
procedures, and employee personal protective equipment. The following
procedures will be implemented to ensure that the city maintains a MSDS for all
chemicals identified on the hazard communication chemical list and the chemical
purchase list. Chemical manufacturers, importers, or distributors supplying the
city with products are required by law to send MSDSs with the first shipment.
As MSDSs are checked off against the chemical inventory, missing MSDSs should
be requested first by telephone from the manufacturer, importer or distributor
of the chemical. A written record of the phone call, including the name of the
contact person, should be placed in a special file. If the telephone request is
not successful, a formal letter should be written to request the MSDS. A copy
should be placed in the special file.
   (B)   The MSDS designated employee will document all attempts to obtain all
MSDSs.
   (C)   The designated employee for each department will require a MSDS for
each new chemical purchased, as well as updated MSDSs for existing chemicals.
   (D)   If it is not possible to obtain a MSDS for a chemical, the following
action will need to be taken by the MSDS designated employee: contact the
department head about using a new or alternate chemical which has an available
MSDS.
   (E)   MSDSs for chemicals which are part of an employee exposure record, but
no longer used shall be filed by the MSDS designated employee. An exposure
record concerns information when an employee is exposed to a chemical. A more
complete definition can be found in 29 CFR 1910. 20 (c) (8) and (10). If the
MSDS was involved with an employee exposure record, the MSDS must be handled in
one of the following methods:
      (1)   Kept in an "old MSDS" file with a reference to the exposure record;
or
      (2)   Kept with the exposure record with a reference, or copy in the "old
MSDS" file.
   (F)   Old MSDSs linked to an exposure record must be maintained for at least
30 years.
   (G)   MSDSs for chemicals no longer used and not linked to an employee
exposure record will be maintained in one of two ways:
      (1)   Place the old MSDS in a special "old MSDS" file; or
      (2)   Make a record of the MSDS and maintain it for 30 years (as per
1910.20 (d) (1) (ii) (B) and referenced by 1926.33) with the following
information:
         (a)   Identity (chemical name if known);
         (b)   Where used (site and building); and
         (c)   When used.
   (H)   A glossary of MSDS terms is found in §
33.273.
   (I)   Updated MSDSs and new MSDSs will be immediately placed in binders in
the locations the chemicals are used listed in this program and be available to
employees at all times.
   (J)   The employer will rely on each chemical manufacturer's testing and
hazard evaluation of chemical products used throughout the facility. The MSDS
designated employee will ensure that MSDSs are supplied and that information
contained on all MSDSs is complete.

the MSDS designated employee should be immediately notified. They will check
the program chemical list to ensure that the proper MSDSs and labels have been
received and updated for the product.
      (3)   Secondary container labeling.
         (a)   Secondary containers of chemicals should be marked in the
following situations:
            1.   More than one employee uses the container; or
            2.   The container is used longer than one shift, or left in a work
area.
         (b)   If one employee uses the chemical without exposing others and
either returns the contents to the original container, or disposes of the rest
of it, labeling of the secondary container is not necessary.
         (c)   The secondary label should contain the following information,
which can be obtained from the original container, or the MSDS:
            1.   Identity of the chemical as specified on the MSDS;
            2.   Hazard warning - physical hazard or illness; and

wants those employees to be aware of this and the protective equipment use
which may include face shields, glasses, splash goggles, respirators, gloves,
rubber boots, full-body suits, aprons, or maybe only one or two of the above.
Then in case of accident, the city wants the employees to know what to do to
protect themselves from these hazardous chemicals.
   (D)   Special training and hazard assessment for the use of personal
protective equipment will be conducted as specified in 29 CFR 1910.132 through
.138.
   (E)   Many of you do not work with hazardous chemicals. Nevertheless, as
employees of the city, we want to advise you about chemicals used by the city.
Also, this information may be helpful in the use of chemicals in your homes,
and in your yards and gardens. There are many hazardous chemicals used in the
home.
   (F)   Part of our program relates to what we call MSD sheets. MSDS stands
for Material Safety Data Sheets. MSDSs deal with how we use the chemicals and
the personal protective equipment in case of an accident. Therefore, discussing
how to read an MSD sheet is a vital part of this program.
   (G)   You may breathe chemicals into your lungs. Chemicals can also enter
through the skin, nose, mouth, eyes, and elsewhere.
   (H)   Chemicals may affect your lungs, heart, skin, kidneys, brain, nervous
system, liver, eyes, and other parts of your body.
   (I)   If you work with chemicals, learn or post emergency procedures,
emergency telephone numbers, and how to read labels. If you transfer to another
work location with new chemicals, learn how to safely use those chemicals.
   (J)   If new chemicals are brought into your work place, learn the hazards
of these and how to safely handle them, what protective equipment to use and
what to do in case of an emergency. If you encounter a new chemical that you
are not familiar with, contact your supervisor about proper training before
using the chemical.
   (K)   Each of you will be presented with a MSD sheet as part of the
training. All data will be discussed on the MSD sheet.
   (L)   The location in your department where hazardous chemicals are used and
the proper and safe work procedures for these chemicals will also be discussed.
The proper use of personal protection equipment will be discussed. Also, in
case of an accident, you will be advised about safety precautions to be taken
to protect yourself from serious injury.
   (M)   You will also be advised on the location in the department where the
MSD sheets are kept, along with the city written program for hazardous
chemicals. You are entitled to look at this data at any time should you wish to
know about the chemicals in your work place. Contact your supervisor in these
cases to see these records.
   (N)   You will also be advised about how the department is labeling these
materials and how to detect hazards by visibility and odors.
   (O)   Generally speaking:
      (1)   Know if you are working with hazardous materials;
      (2)   Know how to recognize them by sight, by labels, by odors, etc;
      (3)   Know how to use the chemicals safely; and
      (4)   Know what to do in case of a chemically related accident.

(Ord. 24-1997, passed 10-14-97; Am. Ord. 15-2003, passed 8-12-03)
§ 34.04 DESIGNATION OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TARGET AREAS AND GRANTING OF TAX
ABATEMENTS.
   (A)   Delegation of responsibility.  The Bedford Common Council designates
the City of Bedford Planning Department and the Office of the Mayor as the
entities for administration and processing of applications for Economic
Development Target Area. The City of Bedford Planning Department and Office of
the Mayor process the application with a recommendation to the Bedford Historic
Review for their recommendation. The application is then submitted to the
Bedford Common Council for final approval.
   (B)   Application fees.
      (1)   In order to defray costs incurred by the city in processing
applications for designation of Economic Development Target Areas the following
shall apply:
         (a)   Applicants shall pay a non-refundable filing fee of $50.
         (b)   Applicants for amendments to a Statement of Benefits Form shall
pay a non-refundable filing fee of $50.
      (2)   All filing fees shall be made payable to the "City of Bedford" at
the time the application is submitted to the City of Bedford Mayor’s Office.
   (C)   Ineligible projects.  The Bedford Common Council shall not review
applications for Economic Development Target Area status for any package liquor
store that holds a liquor dealer’s permit under I.C. 7.1-3-10 or any other
entity required to operate under a license issued under I.C. 7.1 et. seq. or
for abatement of taxes on improvements to owner occupied residential space.
   (D)   Eligible projects. Decisions to designate areas as Economic
Development Target Areas are determined on a project by project basis for any
project. Each project is reviewed on its own merits and the effect of the
project on revitalization of the surrounding areas and employment is
considered. Applications for Economic Development Target Area designation may
be submitted for projects in the eight blocks surrounding the Lawrence County
Courthouse Square. This area is bounded by 14th Street on the north, H Street
to the east, 17th Street to the south, and K Street to the west. It excludes
the block where the Lawrence County Courthouse is located. This area has been
identified as an area which has suffered slow growth and deterioration of
improvements. Through the creation of Economic Development Target Areas in this
area, the city seeks: to encourage retention of existing businesses and expand
employment opportunities; to encourage the re-habilitation, preservation, and
restoration of historic properties; to promote housing opportunities and
economic development activities within the downtown; and to utilize vacant land
for new development. In order for a project to be eligible for Economic
Development Target Area designation, rehabilitation projects must have a
construction cost of $50,000 or more and new construction projects must have a
construction cost of $200,000 or more; and the owner must petition the Bedford
Historic Review Board to establish a historic district consisting of the
property on which the project is sited. Project plans must meet Bedford
Historic Review Board standards.
   (E)   Review of Economic Development Target Area eligibility by Council.
      (1)   After review of the information provided in the application, the
Bedford Common Council may find that the real estate under consideration meets
the definition and standards of an Economic Development Target Area as defined
in I.C. 6-1.1-12.1-7, as amended, and in this section. In such case the Bedford
Common Council shall pass a resolution declaring the area an Economic
Development Target Area. The declaring resolution must:
         (a)   Contain a description of the affected area.
         (b)   Be filed with the Lawrence County assessor.
      (2)   Alter approval of a declaratory resolution, the Bedford Common
Council shall publish notice in accordance with I.C. 5-3-1, as amended. The
notice must state that a description of the affected area is available and can
be inspected in the county assessor’s office. The notice must also name a date
when the Bedford Common Council will hold a public hearing for the purpose of
receiving and hearing any and all remonstrances and objections from interested
persons.
      (3)   In reviewing the evidence the Bedford Common Council shall also
review the Statement of Benefits Form. The Bedford Common Council shall
determine whether the area should be designated an Economic Development Target
Area and whether a deduction should be allowed for the project, based on (and
after it has made) the following findings:
         (a)   Whether the estimate of the value of the redevelopment or
rehabilitation is reasonable for projects of that nature.
         (b)   Whether the estimate of the number of individuals who will be
employed or whose employment will be retained can be reasonably expected to
result from the proposed described project, or
         (c)   Whether the annual salaries of those individuals who will be
employed or whose employment will be retained can be reasonably expected from
the proposed described project.
         (d)   Whether any other benefits about which information was requested
are benefits that can be reasonably expected to result from the proposed
described project.
         (e)   Whether the totality of benefits is sufficient to justify the
deduction.
      (4)   It is the policy of the Bedford Common Council to have the
applicant or a designated representative of the applicant present at the public
hearing of the Bedford Common Council to answer any questions the Bedford
Common Council may have and to further clarify the project at that time. The
applicant should also plan to attend the Bedford Economic Development
Commission and Bedford Historic Review Board meetings.
      (5)   After considering all evidence presented, the Bedford Common
Council shall take final action to determine whether the qualifications for an
Economic Development Target Area have been met and to confirm, modify and
confirm, or rescind the declaratory resolution. Such action may include:
         (a)   Adoption by confirmation of the declaratory resolution. Said
confirming resolution shall include the reasons upon which the determination is
made.
         (b)   A finding that there is insufficient information and a deferral
of action on the matter. The applicant shall be provided written notice of the
reasons for deferral within ten days of that action.
         (c)   A determination that the real estate should not be designated as
an Economic Development Target Area. The applicant shall be provided with
written notice thereof.
      (6)   Upon confirming, modifying and confirming a declaratory resolution
by the procedures set forth herein, both the Lawrence County Auditor and the
Bedford Common Council shall keep a permanent record of the designation of the
subject Economic Development Target Area. The Bedford Common Council shall also
provide the Lawrence County Auditor with a final designation packet to be
utilized in the review of applications for deduction pursuant to state code.
   (F)   Designation periods. Designation periods for newly designated Economic
Development Target Areas shall expire on December 31, 2005 unless otherwise
specified by the Bedford Common Council in its confirming resolution.
   (G)   Deduction period for real property. In the absence of any sufficient
extenuating circumstances, the Bedford Common Council shall allow projects
within a designated Economic Development Target Area to receive a ten-year
abatement period.
   (H)   Compliance with the statement of benefits.
      (1)   All deduction applications filed with the Lawrence County Auditor
for projects designated by the Bedford Common Council as Economic Development
Target Areas must include a correct and complete Compliance with Statement of
Benefits Form (CF-1) as prescribed by the Indiana State Board of Tax
Commissioners. The Compliance with Statement of Benefits Form must be filed
with both the Lawrence County Auditor and with the City of Bedford Mayor’s
Office according to the filing schedule listed in I.C. 6-1.1-12.1-5.2 and I.C.
6-1.1-12.1-5.5, as applicable.
      (2)   Compliance with Statement of Benefits Forms filed by an applicant
must show the extent to which there has been compliance with the Statement of
Benefits Form (SB-1) approved by the Bedford Common Council in designating the
area an Economic Development Target Area. The Compliance with Statement of
Benefits Form must be updated per I.C. 6-1.1-12.1 et seq. The Bedford Common
Council shall monitor for substantial compliance those projects it designates
as Economic Development Target Areas.
      (3)   Property owners that have not substantially complied with the terms
of their original Statement of Benefits Form may have the remainder of their
tax abatement rescinded by the Bedford Common Council.
      (4)   (a)   An applicant that has received a deduction for real property
or personal property and:
            1.   Ceases operations at the facility for which the deduction was
granted; and
            2.   Is found to have intentionally provided false information
concerning plans to continue operations at the facility,
         (b)   May be determined by Common Council to be subject to repayment
to the Lawrence County Treasurer of those property taxes that were deducted per
the formula given in I.C. 6-1.1-12.1-12(e).
   (I)   Amending Statements of Benefits.
      (1)   Amendments to Statement of Benefits Forms are required if the
designation period initially granted is insufficient to complete the project as
stated in the initial Statement of Benefits Form; and/or the project scope has
changed significantly resulting in a total project investment amount more than
150% of that originally projected; and/or if the numbers of jobs to be created
or retained by the project will decrease by more than 25% of that originally
planned.
      (2)   It is the policy of the Bedford Common Council that no application
from an applicant to amend a Statement of Benefits Form will be accepted after
the expiration of the designation period stated in the Confirming Resolution
granting Economic Development Target Area status.
   (J)   Compliance with state and federal law.  If any part of this policy and
section is found to be in noncompliance with any state or federal statue, then
such noncompliant part shall be declared void without any effect on the
validity of the remaining portions of this section. Should the Indiana Code
sections referenced in this section be modified and/or recodified, then this
section shall be deemed to refer to the recodified sections of same.

§ 34.09 DISHONORED CHECK, DRAFT, ORDER OR LIKE INSTRUMENT.
   (A)   Surcharge for dishonored check, draft, order or like instrument.
      (1)   Application. This division applies to any person who tenders a
check, draft, order or like instrument to any department of the city.
      (2)   Surcharge. If a check, draft, order or like instrument tendered to
the City of Bedford is dishonored or returned unpaid for any reason, the city
may charge and collect from the maker or drawer, or the person for whose
benefit the instrument was given, an amount not to exceed $20, plus an amount
equal to the actual charge by the depository institution for each returned or
dishonored instrument. The charge shall not be considered an interest charge, a
finance charge, a time-price differential, or any charge of a similar nature.
      (3)   Notice—collection by city—referral of dishonored checks to
prosecuting attorney. When a surcharge is imposed under division (2), the city
shall notify the maker or drawer, or the person for whose benefit the
instrument was given, to inform them that the instrument was dishonored or
returned unpaid and that the person has ten days after the date the notice is
mailed to pay the total amount due, including the surcharge, either in cash or
by certified check or money order. If the person fails to make payment within
the ten-day period, the city shall, pursuant to I.C. § 36-1-8-13, refer the
matter to the prosecuting attorney not later than 90 days from the date the
city received the dishonored check.

or like instrument.
      (1)   General. This policy provides authorizations and guidelines for the
write-off of uncollectible bad debts due to dishonored check, draft, order or
like instrument. It identifies the steps to be taken to collect payment of
amount owed, establishes conditions under when a debt may be written-off, and
defines authorization for write-offs.
      (2)   Collection procedures.
         (a)   Collection procedures are initiated by the department for which
the dishonored check, draft, order or like instrument was received. The
procedures listed under division (A) shall be executed.
         (b)   Once all of the above have been exhausted without successful
collection, the bad debt will be deemed uncollectible and submitted to the
Clerk-Treasurer's Office to be written-off as bad debt expense.
      (3)   Write-off procedure.
         (a)   Some situations which may result in the recommendation to write-
off uncollectible receivables include:
            1.   All collection methods are deemed to be exhausted;
            2.   Cost to the city to collect exceeds the value of the debt; and
            3.   Information that prosecutors office requires is unobtainable;
driver's license number, social security number, birth date.
         (b)   Once it has been determined that all collection methods have
been exhausted, the recommendation to write-off the bad debt will be forwarded
with all documentation to the Clerk-Treasurer's Office. The Clerk-Treasurer
will ensure that a journal entry is done and the accounts receivable is
adjusted to reflect the write-off. If new developments arise suggesting that
there is a possibility for collection, the collection process will be resumed.

§ 34.093 PURCHASING AND PROCUREMENT POLICY.
   (A)   For purchasing with no federal involvement, the city will follow state
law outlined in I.C. § 5-22, et seq., as well as any other applicable state
provisions.
   (B)   For purchasing involving federal funds or federal oversight, the
following procedure shall be followed:
      (1)   The city will maintain records sufficient to detail the history of
procurement. These records will include, but are not necessarily limited to,
the following:
         (a)   Rationale for the method of procurement;
         (b)   Selection of contract type;
         (c)   Contractor selection or rejection; and
         (d)   The basis for the contract price.
      (2)   Informal procurement methods. When the value of the procurement for
property or services under a federal award does not exceed the simplified
acquisition threshold (SAT), as defined by federal law, formal procurement
methods are not required. The city may use informal procurement methods to
expedite the completion of its transactions and minimize the associated
administrative burden and cost. The informal methods used for procurement of
property or services at or below the SAT include:
         (a)   Micro-purchases.
            1.   Distribution. The acquisition of supplies or services, the
aggregate dollar amount of which does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold
established by federal law. To the maximum extent practicable, the city should
distribute micro-purchases equitably among qualified suppliers.
            2.   Micro-purchase awards. Micro-purchases may be awarded without
soliciting competitive price or rate quotations if the city considers the price
to be reasonable based on research, experience, purchase history or other
information and documents it files accordingly.
            3.   Micro-purchase thresholds. The city adopts the federally-
determined threshold for micro-purchases, reserving the right to increase the
threshold based on an evaluation of risk.
            4.   If the city decides on a threshold above the federal standard,
the city must include any of the following:
               a.   A qualification as a low-risk auditee, in accordance with
the federally-set criteria for the most recent audit;
               b.   An annual internal institutional risk assessment to
identify, mitigate, and manage financial risks; or
               c.   For public institutions, a higher threshold consistent with
state law.
            5.   If the city increases the micro-purchase threshold over
$50,000, it must be approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. The
city must submit a request with all federal requirements. The increased
threshold is valid until there is a change in status in which the justification
was approved.
         (b)   Small purchases.
            1.   Small purchase procedures. The acquisition of property or
services, the aggregate dollar amount of which is higher than the micro-
purchase threshold but does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.
Price or rate quotations must be obtained from an adequate number of qualified
sources as determined appropriate by the City Council.
            2.   Simplified acquisition thresholds. The city adopts the federal
simplified acquisition threshold.
         (c)   Formal procurement methods. When the value of the procurement
for property or services under a federal financial assistance award exceeds the
SAT, formal procurement methods are required. Formal procurement methods
require following documented procedures. Formal procurement methods also
require public advertising unless a non-competitive procurement can be used in
accordance with federal law. The following formal methods of procurement are
used for procurement of property or services above the simplified acquisition
threshold or a value below the simplified acquisition threshold:
            1.   Sealed bids. Bids shall be publicly solicited and a firm
fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible
bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and conditions of the
invitation for bids, is the lowest in price.
            2.   Sealed bids applicability. Sealed bids will be used when the
following conditions are present:
               a.   A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or
purchase description;
               b.   Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to
compete effectively for the business; and
               c.   A firm fixed-price contract and the selection of the
successful bidder can be made principally on the basis of price.
            3.   If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:
               a.   Bids must be solicited from an adequate number of qualified
sources, providing them sufficient response time prior to the date set for
opening the bids, for local and tribal governments, the invitation for bids
must be publicly advertised;
               b.   The invitation for bids, which will include any
specifications and pertinent attachments, must define the items or services in
order for the bidder to properly respond;
               c.   All bids will be opened at the time and place prescribed in
the invitation for bids, and for local and tribal governments, the bids must be
opened publicly;
               d.   A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing
to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding
documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life cycle costs
must be considered in determining which bid is lowest. Payment discounts will
only be used to determine the low bid when prior experience indicates that such
discounts are usually taken advantage of; and
               e.   Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound
documented reason.
            4.   Proposals. A procurement method in which either a fixed-price
or cost-reimbursement type contract is awarded. Proposals are generally used
when conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealed bids. They are
awarded in accordance with the following requirements:
               a.   Requests for proposals must be publicized and identify all
evaluation factors and their relative importance. Proposals must be solicited
from an adequate number of qualified offerors. Any response to publicized
requests for proposals must be considered to the maximum extent practical;
               b.   The city will hire experts to provide technical evaluations
of the proposals received and advice making selections;
               c.   Contracts must be awarded to the responsible offeror whose
proposal is most advantageous to the city, with price and other factors
considered; and
               d.   The city may use competitive proposal procedures for
qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E)
professional services whereby offerors’ qualifications are evaluated and the
most qualified offeror is selected, subject to negotiation of fair and
reasonable compensation. The method where price is not used as a selection
factor can only be used in procurement of A/E professional services. It cannot
be used to purchase other types of services though A/E firms that are a
potential source to perform the proposed effort.
         (d)   Noncompetitive procurement. There are specific circumstances in
which noncompetitive procurement can be used. Noncompetitive procurement can
only be awarded if one or more of the following circumstances apply:
            1.   The acquisition of property or services, the aggregate dollar
amount of which does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold;
            2.   The item is available only from a single source;
            3.   The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not
permit a delay resulting from publicizing a competitive solicitation;
            4.   The federal awarding agency or pass-through entity expressly
authorizes a noncompetitive procurement in response to a written request from
the city; or
            5.   After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is
determined inadequate.
      (3)   The city shall conduct procurement in a manner that prohibits the
use of statutorily or administratively imposed state, local, or tribal
geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in
those cases where applicable federal statutes expressly mandate or encourage
geographic preference.
      (4)   When contracting for architectural and engineering (A/E) services,
geographic location may be a selection criterion provided its application
leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of
the project, to compete for the contract.
      (5)   The city will follow procedures outlined in CFR 180.300,
particularly that it will verify that the person with whom the city intends to
do business is not excluded or disqualified, by checking:
         (a)   SAM exclusions; or
         (b)   Collecting a certification from that person; or
         (c)   Adding a clause or condition to the covered transaction with
that person.

§ 35.02 POLICE PENSION FUND.
   (A)   There is hereby created a Policemen’s Pension Fund and a Board of
Trustees for the Policemen’s Pension Fund in the city, as provided by I.C. 36-
8-6-1 et seq., and all acts supplemental thereto and amendatory thereof.
   (B)   The Common Council hereby fixes and determines the benefits and
payments and hereby authorizes the Board of Trustees of the Police Pension Fund
to pay the same in the following respective amounts:
      (1)   The Common Council authorizes the Board of Trustees of the
Policemen’s Pension Fund to pay funeral benefits to the heirs or estates of any
active or retired member of the police force who has suffered death from any
cause, after June 30, 2008, in an amount equal to the difference between
$12,000 and any lesser amount paid to such heirs or estates by the Public
Employees’ Retirement Fund of the state.
      (2)   (a)   In addition, a payment shall be made to the surviving spouse
of a member who dies after December 31, 1988, an amount per month, during the
spouse’s life, equal to the greater of:
            1.   Forty percent of the monthly pay of a first class patrolman;
or
            2.   Fifty-five percent of the monthly benefit the deceased member
was receiving or was entitled to receive on the date of the member’s death.
         (b)   However, if the deceased member was not entitled to a benefit
because the member had not completed 20 years of service, for the purposes of
computing the amount under division (B), the member’s benefit shall be
considered to be 50% of the monthly salary of a first class patrolman. The
amount provided for in this division is subject to adjustment as provided in
division (5) below.
      (3)   A payment shall also be made to each child of a deceased member
under the age of 18 years, in an amount equal to 15% of the monthly pay of a
first class patrolman per month to each child:
         (a)   Until the child reaches the age of 18; or
         (b)   During the entire period of the child’s physical or mental
disability; whichever period is longer. However, the total of benefits under
this division added to the benefits under division (B)(2) may not exceed the
maximum benefits computed under I.C. 36-8-6-9 for pension payments to a member
who retires from active service after 20 years or more of active service.
      (4)   If a deceased member leaves no surviving spouse and no child under
the age of 18 years but does leave a dependent parent or parents, an amount
equal to 20% of the monthly pay of a first class patrolman per month from the
time of his death shall be paid to the dependent parent or parents during their
dependency. When both parents survive, the total amount is still 20%, to be
paid to them jointly. In all cases of payment to a dependent relative of a
deceased member, the Board is the final judge of the question of necessity and
dependency and of the amount to be paid. The Board may also reduce or terminate
temporarily or permanently a payment to a dependent relative of a deceased
member when it determines that the condition of the fund or other circumstances
makes this action necessary.
      (5)   If the salary of a first class patrolman is increased or decreased,
the pension payable under this section shall be proportionately increased or
decreased.
   (C)   (1)   If a member died in the line of duty, the surviving spouse is
entitled to an additional monthly benefit, during the spouse’s lifetime, if the
surviving spouse did not remarry before September 1, 1983, equal to the
difference between:
         (a)   The benefit to which the member would have been entitled on the
date of his death, but no less than 50% of the monthly wage received by a first
class patrolman; and
         (b)   The amount received by the spouse under I.C. 36-8-6-9.8(b). If
the surviving spouse remarried before September 1, 1983, benefits ceased on the
date of remarriage.
      (2)   The children of a spouse receiving benefits under this section may
not receive more than a total of 30% of the monthly wage received by a first
class patrolman. However, this limitation does not apply to the children of a
spouse receiving benefits under this section who are physically or mentally
disabled.
      (3)   For purposes of this section, “dies in the line of duty” means
death that occurs as a direct result of personal injury or illness resulting
from the member’s action in his capacity as a police officer in responding to
an offense or a reported offense.
   (D)   All benefits paid hereunder shall be subject to § 401 of the Internal
Revenue Code.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 51.001 PURPOSE.
   (A)   This chapter sets uniform requirements for discharges into the
wastewater collection and treatment system and enables the agency to comply
with the administrative provisions set forth in the current National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, those provisions as set forth
under Public Law 92-500, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of
1972 (FWPCAA), all national standards of performance, toxic and pretreatment
effluent standards, and any and all other discharge criteria required or
authorized by federal, state, or local laws and regulations; and to serve the
maximum public benefit by regulating the quality and quantity of wastewater
discharged into those systems.
   (B)   This chapter also provides for the issuance of permits to certain
users. Revenues derived from the application of this chapter shall be used to
defray the cost of operating and maintaining an adequate wastewater collection
and treatment system, and to provide sufficient funds for capital outlay, bond
service costs, capital improvements, and depreciation.

RATES AND CHARGES
§ 51.020 ESTABLISHMENT.
   (A)   Water obtained from the city's water utility. The sewer charges made
for sewerage service rendered to each lot, parcel of real estate, or building
having any connection with the city's sewerage system or otherwise discharging
sewage into that system, either directly or indirectly, shall be based upon the
quantity of water presumed to enter the public sewers after being used in or on
the property, as that quantity is measured by the water meter or meters therein
used by the city's water utility, except as herein otherwise provided.
   (B)   Water obtained from other sources. Where the property obtains any part
or all of the water used from sources other than the city's water utility, the
owner or the tenant may be required by the city to install and maintain at his
own expense a meter or meters acceptable to the city for the purpose of
measuring the quantity of water obtained from these other sources, or the city
may determine the quantity of the water by whatever means and methods it may
find practicable.
   (C)   Exempt water. where a significant portion of the metered water does
not and cannot enter the sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, and
where the quantity of water entering the premises averages more than 30,000
gallons per month, the person having charge of the property may request
permission from the city to install at his own expense either an approved meter
or meters to determine the quantity of water that cannot enter the sewerage
system or an approved sewage-measuring device or devices to determine the
volume of sewage that actually enters the sewerage system. When appropriate,
the city reserves the right to determine by whatever other means and methods it
may find practicable the percentage of the property's metered water that enters
the sewerage system. In any case the user charge shall be applied to the
quantity of water that can or actually does enter the public sewers.
(Ord. 22-1978, passed 2-13-78)
§ 51.021 SCHEDULE OF RATES AND CHARGES.
   (A)   For the use of and the service rendered by the sewage works, sewer

   (B)   In addition to the monthly rates of charges, as set out in division
(A) above, there is hereby fixed and established a sewer connection charge in
the sum of $1,200 for each 4-inch sewer service connection which shall be paid
in full to the city before each sewer service connection is effected. The
charge for a sewer connection larger than 4-inch will be the cost of labor and
materials, but not less than the charge for a 4-inch sewer service connection.
The term "sewer service connection" upon which the charge is hereby imposed
refers to any connection that is accomplished by a direct tap into or other
direct connection with a city main or lateral sewer, or a street, public alley,
or other public property by a direct tap into or other direct connection with a
stub or house sewer leading from a city main or lateral sewer. The sewer
service connection charge shall not apply to, and is not imposed upon, any
connection accomplished at a point upon private property by a direct connection
with a stub or house sewer leading from a city main or lateral sewer into the
private property. No person, firm or corporation shall connect more than one
lot and the principal building and accessory buildings located thereon to the
municipal sewer system by means of one house sewer or one sewer service
connection to a city main or lateral sewer. The Sewer Superintendent may reduce
the tapping fee, in an amount within the discretion of the Sewer
Superintendent, in cases where a developer is furnishing the labor and/or
materials to effect the tapping connection.
    (C)   Where a metered water supply is used for fire protection as well as
for other uses, the city may, in its discretion, make adjustments in the
minimum charge and in the user charge as may be equitable.
   (D)   For the service rendered to the city, the city shall be subject to the
same sewer charges provided in division (A) above, or to sewer charges
established in harmony therewith.
   (E)   Whenever for any cause a water meter fails to operate, a reasonable
estimate shall be made by the Water Department of the amount of water supplied
during the period the meter fails to operate, and the user shall pay a rate
based in whole or in part upon that estimate of the amount of water supplied as
the case may be.

(Ord. 22-1978, passed 2-13-78)
§ 51.024 STRENGTH-OF-WASTES SURCHARGE.
   (A)   Liability.  Each industrial or nonindustrial user who discharges
wastes into the sewerage system shall be subject to a surcharge, in addition to
the regular sewer charges, based on both the biochemical oxygen demand ( or on
the chemical oxygen demand where BOD cannot be determined) and the suspended
solids content of the wastes, when it can be determined that these wastes have
a concentration greater than the following.
      (1)   A biochemical oxygen demand of 250 milligrams per liter. Where BOB
cannot be determined, then, in lieu of BOD, a chemical oxygen demand of 500
milligrams per liter.
      (2)   A suspended solids content of 250 milligrams per liter.
      (3)   A phosphate content of six milligrams per liter.
   (B)   Computation.  The surcharge shall be determined as follows. The excess
pounds of BOD and Cod and of suspended solids will each be computed by first
multiplying the customer's billing sewage volume measured in units of 1,000
gallons for the current billing period by the factor 0.00834 and then by
multiplying this product by the difference between the concentrations set out
in Division (A) above. The surcharge for each constituent will then be
determine by multiplying the excess pounds of each constituent by the
appropriate rate of surcharge set out in division (C) below.
   (C)   Rates.  The rate of surcharge for each of the aforementioned
constituents shall be as follows.
      (1)   For biochemical oxygen demand (BOD): $.163 per pound.
      (2)   For chemical oxygen demand (COD) where BOD cannot be determined:
$.163 per pound.
      (3)   For suspended solids: $.142.
      (4)   For phosphates: $.820 per pound.
   (D)   Revision of rates. Prior to May 1 of each year, the Clerk-Treasurer
shall submit to the Common Council a comparison of the calculated unit costs
for removing BOD and the suspended solids from the wastewater treatment plant
influent during the previous calendar year with the unit charges currently in
effect in order to determine whether the current rates of surcharge are
adequate or should be changed by the Common Council.

and billed by the city along with the bills for water service and shall be
payable at the same time as the water bills.
('67 Code, § 51.04)
   (B)   Liability for payment. The sewer charges for sewerage service shall be
billed to the person being billed for water service unless, by the contract
with the utility, another person assumes this responsibility. If a tenant is
billed, the owner shall in no way be relieved of liability in the event payment
is not made by the tenant as herein required. The owner shall have the right to
examine the city's collection records to ascertain whether the charges have
been paid.
('67 Code, § 51.05)
   (C)   First billings.  The sewer charges and surcharges fixed in this
chapter shall be extended to and cover any additional premises hereafter served
without the need for nay hearing or notice. If the first billing to a new
customer covers a period other than a full billing month, then the sewer
charges for this billing shall be made in keeping with the standard practice in
the water utility. Subsequent sewerage service billings shall be for periods
coinciding with the billing periods for water service. If the sewer charges or
surcharges are changed, the first billing after the change may also be for a
period other than a full billing month in order to keep the sewerage billing
periods coincident with the water billing periods.

to community-owned treatment works, are required to adopt the best practicable
control technology currently available, as defined by the Administrator
pursuant to section 304 (b) of the Act. Where the Board of Public Works and
Safety's treatment works was designed to treat the four pollutants listed in
the definition for compatible pollutants in §
50.002, which are BOD, suspended solids, pH, and fecal coliform bacteria, it is
not appropriate to require the industrial user to achieve the best practicable
control technology currently available, since this would lead to uneconomical
duplication of treatment facilities.
   (C)   While the term “substantial removal” is not subject to precise
definition, it generally contemplates removals in the order of 80% or greater.
Minor incidental removals in the order of 10% to 30% are not considered
“substantial”.
   (D)   For some industrial categories, it may be necessary to define
pretreatment guidelines for problems that may arise as a result of any
adjustments required for particular industrial categories, which should be
considered in connection with the Board's requirements rather than the national
pretreatment standard. Limitations on wastewater strength in §
51.069 may be supplemental, with more stringent limitations pursuant to §
51.082, if the following occur.
      (1)   The Board determines that the limitations in §
51.069 may not be sufficient to protect the operation of the Board's treatment
works; or
      (2)   The Board determines that the limitations in §
51.069 may not be sufficient to enable the Board's treatment works to comply
with water quality standards or effluent limitations specified in its National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit.

§ 51.074 RIGHT TO IMPOSE SURCHARGE ON, OR REJECT WASTE.
   (A)   The city shall have the right to impose a surcharge for waste
discharged into the sewage system whose strength or character is such that the
introduction of the waste into the sewage system may cause additional costs to
the system.
   (B)   The city shall have the right to reject waste and prohibit the
introduction of rejected waste into the sewage system, or the city may require
pretreatment of the waste when the strength or character of the waste is such
that it could cause damage to or interfere with the operation of the sewage
system.
   (C)   The industrial pretreatment surcharge for all industry discharging
more than 50,000 gallons annually shall be 0.1720 cents per 1000 gallons.
(Ord. 27-1978, passed 12-12-78; Am. Ord. 9-1985, passed 5-14-85)
§ 51.075 INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER MONITORING AND REPORTING.
   (A)   Discharge reports.
      (1)   Every major contributing industry shall file a monthly discharge
report with the Pretreatment Program Administrator. The Administrator may
require any other industrial users discharging or proposing to discharge into
the treatment system to file periodic reports on forms provided by the
Administrator. The Administrator may require less frequency reporting for those
industries who self-monitor less than once per month.
      (2)   The discharge report shall include, but shall not be limited to,
nature of process, volume, rates of flow, mass emission rate, production
quantities, hours of operation, concentrations of controlled pollutants, or
other information which relates to the generation of waste. The reports may
also include the chemical constituents and quantity of liquid materials stored
on-site even though they are not normally discharged. In addition to the
discharge reports, the Administrator may require information in the form of
industrial discharge permit applications and self- monitoring reports.
   (B)   Compliance schedule reports for noncategorical industries. Any
noncategorical industry which is not in compliance with the city's ordinance
limitations must develop a compliance schedule during which time the industry
must meet the city's standards. The schedule should contain increments of
progress (hiring engineers, starting construction, and the like), which
correspond to specific dates for their completion. These represent major events
leading to the operation of pretreatment equipment to meet the city's
pretreatment standards. All industrial users subject to these conditions must
submit a progress report to the city no later than 14 days following each date
in the compliance schedule. This report must include whether it complied with
the increment of progress to be met on that date, the reason for delay if the
date was not met, and the steps being taken to return to compliance. In no
event can more than nine months elapse between progress reports.
   (C)   Baseline reports.  Within 180 days after the effective date of a
categorical pretreatment standard or 180 days after the final administrative
decision made on a category, whichever is later, existing industrial users
subject to the categorical pretreatment standards shall submit to the city a
report containing the information listed in paragraph (b)(1)-(7) of paragraph
403.12(b) of the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR 403).
   (D)   Compliance schedule reports for categorical industries.
      (1)   Whenever an industrial user subject to categorical pretreatment
standards is not meeting the standards at the time of promulgation of the
standard, a compliance schedule report shall be filed with the Administrator.
The schedule shall contain increments of progress, such as hiring an engineer,
completing plans, commencing construction, completing construction, and the
like, which correspond to specific dates for their completion.
      (2)   All industrial users subject to these conditions must submit a
progress report to the control authority no later than 14 days following each
date in the compliance schedule including the final date for compliance. This
report must include, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress to be met on that date and, if not, the date on which it
expects to comply, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the
industrial user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no
event can more than nine months elapse between the progress reports.
   (E)   Compliance date report.
      (1)   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with an
applicable pretreatment standard, any industrial user subject to these
standards must submit to the control authority a report indicating the nature
and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge generated from the
regulated process which are limited by categorical pretreatment standards.
      (2)   The report must also state whether applicable standards are being
met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operation and
maintenance or pretreatment is necessary to bring the discharge into
compliance. This statement should be signed by an authorized representative of
the industrial user.

§ 51.076 RECORDS AND MONITORING.
   Records shall be made available upon request by the Administrator. All
records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made
available to officials of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency upon demand.
A summary of data indicating the industrial user's compliance with this chapter
shall be prepared semi-annually and submitted to the Administrator as a part of
the discharge report. All records must be kept on file for a period of three
years. If any action is being taken, records must be kept through a period in
which all appeals have been exhausted.

place in violation of the admissibility requirements prescribed in §§
51.064,
51.066, and
51.069, or in violation of the provisions of a major contributor permit, the

specific actions, acceptable to the Board, which the user shall take in order
to prevent or correct a violation of requirements.
      (2)   When the city finds that a discharge of wastewater has taken place
or is likely to take place in violation of the admissibility requirements of §§
51.064,
51.066, and

the user not complying with the requirements comply forthwith, comply with a
time schedule set forth by the Board, or take appropriate remedial or
preventive action.
      (3)   When the city finds that a discharge of wastewater is in violation
of the admissibility requirements of §§
51.064,
51.066, and
51.069, or in violation of the provisions of a major contributor permit, or
otherwise causes or threatens to cause a condition of pollution or nuisance,
the Board, on behalf of the city, may petition any court of proper jurisdiction
for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both, as may be
appropriate, in restraining the continuance of the discharge.
      (4)   The city may revoke any major contributor permit or terminate or
cause to be terminated wastewater service in whole or in part if a violation of
any provision of this chapter or the major contributor permit is found to
exist, or if a discharge causes or threatens to cause a condition of pollution
or nuisance as defined in this chapter, or causes the city to violate the terms
of its NPDES permit or any state or federal law or regulation.
      (5)   When a discharge of wastes causes an obstruction, damage, or any
other impairment to the Board facilities, the Board may assess a charge against
the user for the work required to clean or repair the facility and shall add
the charge to the user's charges and fees.
   (B)   Any user affected by any decision, action, or determination, including
cease and desist orders, made by the Sewer Superintendent, interpreting or
implementing the provisions of this chapter, any permit issued herein, or any
regulation of the Board adopted pursuant hereto, may do the following.
      (1)   File with the Board a written request for review and
reconsideration within ten days of the decision, action, or determination,
setting forth in detail the facts supporting the user's request for
reconsideration.
      (2)   If the ruling made by the Board is unsatisfactory to the person
requesting reconsideration, he may, within ten days after notification of Board
action, file a written appeal to the Board's governing body. The governing body
shall make a final ruling on the appeal within ten days of the close of the
meeting. The Board's decision, action, or determination shall remain in effect

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 52.01 CUSTOMER-DISPUTED BILLING.
   (A)   A utility customer may dispute the correctness of all or part of the
monthly billing charged for utility service, in accordance with the procedure
set forth in this section. The utility customer aggrieved by an error in the
monthly billing shall notify the Utility Billing Office within the time
permitted; otherwise, the right to dispute the billing shall be deemed waived.
A utility customer who has disputed all or part of a monthly billing, pursuant
to this section, shall not be entitled to dispute these amounts when carried
forward as a part of a subsequent billing.
   (B)   The procedure to resolve disputed billing charges shall be as follows.
      (1)   A customer aggrieved by a monthly billing shall notify the Utility
Billing Office in writing within 14 calendar days from the date the billing was
issued. The notice shall state the portion of the billing amount which is in
dispute, and set forth the reasons the customer believes he is not obligated to
pay as billed.
      (2)   If the Utility Billing Office determines that the dispute is timely
filed, and is not an attempt to re- challenge amounts disputed under a previous
billing, a representative of the Utility Billing Department shall schedule an
informal meeting between the customer and the Utility Billing Manager. This
meeting shall be held within seven days from the receipt of the customer's
notice, and shall be scheduled at the convenience of the Utility Billing
Manager.
      (3)   The customer and the Utility Billing Manager shall review the
utility's records, the customer's allegations, and all other relevant materials
available to the Utility Billing Manager. The Utility Billing Manager shall
attempt to resolve the dispute in a manner satisfactory to the customer, and
shall have full authority to adjust disputed billings where appropriate. If an
agreement is reached, a written memorandum stating the terms of the agreement,
initialed by the parties, shall be recorded in the Utility Billing Office. If
an agreement is not reached, the Utility Billing Manager shall summarize his
decision resolving the dispute, and within five days after the meeting mail a
copy of his decision to the customer and the Utility Superintendent.
      (4)   If the decision is unsatisfactory to the customer, the customer
shall within five days of receipt of the Utility Billing Manager's decision,
file with the Utility Billing Office a written request for a formal hearing
before the Utility Superintendent. The customer shall be given notice of the
time and place of the hearing and advised to bring all information relevant to
the dispute. Hearings shall be scheduled twice monthly on a weekday closest to
the fifteenth and twenty-eighth of each month. Failure of the customer to
timely request a hearing shall render the decision of the Utility Billing
Manager final and binding on the customer and the utility.
      (5)   At the hearing, the utility and the customer shall be entitled to
present all evidence that is, in the Utility Superintendent's view, relevant
and material to the dispute, and to examine and cross-examine witnesses. A
written record of the hearing shall be maintained.
      (6)   Based on the record established at the hearing, the Utility
Superintendent, within five days of the completion of the hearing, shall issue
his written decision formally resolving the dispute. His decision shall be
final and binding on the utility and the customer.
   (C)   Until the date of the Utility Superintendent's or the Utility Billing
Manager's decision, whichever is later, the utility shall not terminate the
customer's utility service, and shall not issue a notice of termination solely
for nonpayment of the disputed amounts.
   (D)   Utilization of this dispute procedure shall not relieve the utility
customer of his obligation to timely and completely pay all other undisputed
utility billing charges or installments and surcharges, and the undisputed
portions of billings which are the subject of the present dispute. Failure by
the customer to timely and completely pay all such undisputed amounts shall
subject the customer to termination of utility service in accordance with the
provisions of this section.
(Ord. 35-1982, passed 12-14-82)
§ 52.02 INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION OF UTILITY SERVICE.
   (A)   When a utility customer has not timely challenged all or part of a
monthly billing, pursuant to §
52.01, and the customer has become 30 days delinquent in the payment of the
account, the Utility representative shall initiate the termination of utility
service by attempting notification by phone, cell phone, text messaging, e-
mail, or mailing to the customer a notice of termination.
   (B)   Where a utility customer has challenged a billing pursuant to §
52.01, and the matter has been finally resolved by either the Utility Director
or the Utility representative, the Utility representative shall, within five
days after the final decision is issued, mail to the customer a notice of
termination.
   (C)   The notice of termination shall contain the following information.
      (1)   The date the notice of termination was issued.
      (2)   The date on which a termination of utility service shall occur. The
date of termination shall be at least five calendar days after the date on
which the notice of termination was issued.
      (3)   A statement that, unless the Utility representative receives full
payment on the account the notice was issued prior to the date of termination,
utility service will be terminated.
      (4)   The telephone number of the Utility Billing Office.
      (5)   A reference to the pamphlet of the rules furnished to the customer.
   (D)   If, prior to the date of termination, the utility has not received
complete payment of the amount on the account, and the customer has not
requested the establishment of a deferred payment plan, then the Utility
representative shall terminate utility service provided to the customer on the
date of termination.
   (E)   Offers, by customers, of partial payment, other than under a deferred
payment plan provided for in this section, shall be rejected. If the Utility
representative received payment of the entire amount shown on the account prior
to the date of termination, the payment shall be considered timely and shall
halt the termination process.
   (F)   A service fee pursuant to §
50.20 will be charged once the service representative leaves the utility office
with the certified shut-off list.
   (G)   The following limitations shall apply to use of the utility
termination procedure. Utility service shall be terminated between the hours of
8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., and only on a day that the utility office is open to
the public. Also, service may not be disconnected for nonpayment after noon of
the day before any day that the utility office is closed to the public. (In
other words, if a utility’s offices are closed on a particular Friday, it can
not disconnect service after noon on the Thursday before.)

2009, passed 3-10-09)
§ 52.03 DEFERRED PAYMENT PLANS.
   (A)   A customer who temporarily becomes unable to timely and completely pay
a monthly bill charge when due may contact the Utility representative and file
a written application for the establishment of a deferred payment plan to
enable the customer to pay the account and avoid termination of utility
service. The Utility representative shall review all applications to determine
if the customer is eligible for a deferred payment plan.
   (B)   The following classes of customers are ineligible to request deferred
payment plans.
      (1)   A customer whose utility service has been terminated for nonpayment
of all or part of a monthly billing, or other amount owed the utility, until
all arrearages have been fully and completely paid.
      (2)   A customer with an account that is otherwise current who has
defaulted in his or her obligation to make timely payments under a prior
deferred payment plan within one year of the customer’s current request.
      (3)   A customer who is currently making installment payments under a
prior deferred payment plan.
      (4)   A customer who has an old outstanding final bill for service
rendered at a different metering point, residence, or location if such bill has
remained unpaid.
   (C)   When an application for a deferred payment plan is received from an
ineligible customer, the Utility representative shall notify the customer of
the reason the customer is ineligible. The Utility representative shall proceed
as if the customer had not made the request.
   (D)   The Utility representative shall schedule an appointment with eligible
customers, who have timely filed an application for a deferred payment plan, to
discuss the matter with the customer and determine a suitable plan. The plan
shall be submitted to the customer and the customer shall execute the plan
within five calendar days of its submission to the customer. The plan shall
become effective on the signing of the agreement by the Utility representative
and the customer. A customer’s failure to execute a deferred payment agreement
within five calendar days shall permit the utility to proceed as if no
application for a deferred payment plan had been submitted.
   (E)   No deferred payment plan shall be established which does not meet the
following minimum requirements.
      (1)   An initial payment of 16.667% of the outstanding balance covered
under the deferred payment plan, payable at the time of the customer’s written
acceptance of the deferred payment agreement.
      (2)   Five equal subsequent monthly installment payments under the
deferred payment plan; each installment due 30 days after payment of the prior
payment.
      (3)   An agreement between the customer and the utility, that the
customer’s failure to make timely payments in accordance with the deferred
payment plan, shall subject the customer to summary termination of utility
service within 72 hours after the default under the plan, in lieu of the
procedure under §
52.02.
      (4)   An agreement between the customer and the utility that the customer
agrees to pay all undisputed future bills for service as they come due.
      (5)   The customer has not breached any similar agreement with the
utility made pursuant to this rule within the past 12 months.

§ 52.04 SUMMARY TURN-OFF; TERMINATION.
   It is the policy of city utilities to notify customers prior to termination
of service. In certain circumstances, delivery of written notice may be
impossible or impractical when balanced against the need to protect the system
against waste of water, leaks, contamination, or other hazard.
   (A)   Grounds for summary turn-off without notice.
      (1)   The superintendent of the utility may direct the temporary turn-off
of service to one or more customers where the following conditions exist.
         (a)   Leaks, brakes, or failure in the mains, services, pumping
machinery, or other equipment require a partial or total discontinuance in
service.
         (b)   Instances where contaminates dangerous to health have entered
the water system, necessitating a total or partial discontinuance of service.
      (2)   In the event service is interrupted for one of these reasons the
superintendent shall provide affected customers with notice of the reason for
turn-off, and the expected duration of the interruption of service by the most
practical medium.
   (B)   Summary turn-off termination with notice.
      (1)   In certain circumstances enumerated below, the utility customer’s
interest in continued service may be lost because of intentional or negligent
misconduct as defined in this section, which interferes with the maintenance,
orderly operation, or quality of product of the water utility. Notice must have
been given as provided in division (B)(2) below.
         (a)   Tampering (other than by qualified personnel effectuating
repair) with any main, service line, tap, pipe, meter, curb box, valve, or any
other appurtenance connected with, or the property of the utility.
         (b)   Employing an unauthorized connection, cross-connection, or
interconnection with any main, service line, or other appurtenance connected
with, or owned by the water utility.
         (c)   On abandonment of a premises without notice by the customer,
service to the vacant property may be terminated where the Superintendent of
the Utility determines damage might result to the building or utility property.
         (d)   Failure to promptly repair leaky service lines, after being
notified by the utility in writing to do so. A notice to repair shall specify a
period for repair which shall not exceed 30 days.
         (e)   Failure to provide a reasonable and safe entrance to a service
premises for the purposes of reading, inspection, maintenance, and removal of a
meter, inspection of piping, or other inspection necessary to assure compliance
with these regulations, after having received two written requests from the
utility to provide access.
      (2)   Before service is terminated for any of the above reasons, a
utility representative shall deliver a written notice to the premises, and
attempt to inform an adult on the premises of the pending turn-off of service.
The notice shall state the reason for the turn-off, and the right to challenge
the turn-off before the Utility Superintendent within three business days after
receipt of the turn-off notice. If no hearing is requested, or the Utility
Superintendent determines the turn-off was justified; the service contract and
service to the premises shall be terminated.
      (3)   A duplicate copy of the notice shall be sent by certified mail to
the customer the following day. Hearings before the Utility Superintendent
shall be informal, and the superintendent of the utility, and the customer,
shall present evidence which supports their positions. The customer shall be
notified by the Utility Superintendent of his decision in writing, either at or
after the meeting. Termination of service shall be effectuated no sooner than
24 hours after the Utility Superintendent's decision.
(Ord. 35-1982, passed 12-14-82)
§ 52.05 REINSTATEMENT OF UTILITY SERVICE.
   When a customer has been terminated for a default in payment, and the
customer has completely paid all arrearages due on the account, including fees
associated with the restoration of service, the Utility Billing Office shall
reinstate utility service to the customer as soon as it is practical. In the
event service is terminated under §
52.04, service shall not be reinstated until the grounds justifying the turn-
off have been eliminated by the customer, and all fees associated with the
restoration of service have been paid. The Utility Billing Office shall
reinstate utility service to the customer as soon as practical thereafter.
(Ord. 35-1982, passed 12-14-82)
§ 52.06 TAMPERING WITH UTILITY EQUIPMENT.
   No person shall tamper with or cause damage to a water main, lateral,
service line, stop, valve, box, manhole, fire hydrant, meter, or any other part
of the city water line system.

LEAK ADJUSTMENTS FOR LOSS TO WATER AND SEWER BILLS
§ 52.15 THRESHOLD CONSIDERATIONS.
   (A)   Conditions. Leak adjustments to water and sewer bills will be
considered when all of the following threshold conditions have been met:
      (1)   Water use volume is 200% of previous 12 months usage history, or
the previous full billing period if no history exists.
      (2)   Bedford City Utilities staff verifies the leak if applicable and
the account holder (or third party, such as renter, contractor, power company,
and the like) must provide written documentation in the form of a bill with a
detailed statement of repairs from a licensed plumber or from the customer
requesting the adjustment that provides documentation that leak has been
repaired (if leak identified). If homeowner fixes leak, bills for materials are
required.
      (3)   Bedford City Utilities will not consider lack of proper maintenance
or negligence by account holder (or third party, such as renter, contractor,
power company, and the like) which culminates in a water loss as being
appropriate for approving an adjustment in the bill.
      (4)   Account holder must submit a “Request for Water/Sewer Leak
Adjustment Form” in writing before due date.
      (5)   Account must not be delinquent (only the current month usage is
owed) but an approved payment plan agreed upon by the customer does not
constitute delinquency.
      (6)   Account holder has not received an adjustment within the last 12
months.

or in combination, only the colors green, red, or yellow may be used, except
for special pedestrian signals under I.C. 9-21-17-2, and the lights indicate
and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows.
      (1)   Green indication.
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left, unless a sign at that place prohibits
either turn.
         (b)   Vehicular traffic including vehicles turning right or left,
shall yield right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within
the intersection or an adjacent sidewalk at the time the signal is exhibited.
         (c)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time.
         (d)   Vehicular traffic shall yield the right- of-way to pedestrians
lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the
intersection.
         (e)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a
turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked
crosswalk.
      (2)   Steady yellow indication.
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow
arrow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being
terminated and that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow
signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, are thereby
advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red
indication is shown, and no pedestrian may start to cross the roadway at that
time.
      (3)   Steady red indication.
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone
shall stop at clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to
proceed is shown except as provided in division (b) below.
         (b)   Except when a sign is in place prohibiting such a turn,
vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal, after coming to a complete stop,
may cautiously enter the intersection to do the following, but such vehicular
traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic using the intersection.
            1. Make a right turn.
            2. Make a left turn if turning from the left lane of a one-way
street into another one-way street with the flow of traffic.

enter the roadway.
      (4)   No indication or conflicting indications.
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing an intersection having a signal that
displays no indication or conflicting indications, where no other control is
present, shall stop before entering the intersection.
         (b)   After stopping, vehicular traffic may proceed with caution
through the intersection and shall yield the right-of-way to traffic within the
intersection, or approaching so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard.
      (5)   Non-intersection installations. The provisions of this section
apply to traffic-control signals located at a place other than an intersection
except those provisions which by their nature have no application. Any stop
required under this division must be made at the signal except when the signal
is supplemented by a sign or pavement marking indicating where the stop must be
made.
   (B)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

the roadway in the direction of the signal, but any pedestrian who has
partially completed his crossing on the “walk” signal shall proceed to a
sidewalk or safety island while the “don’t walk” signal is showing.

notice or further action by the Commission.

§ 97.06 SIDEWALK/RETAINING WALL PROGRAM.
   To promote sidewalks and encourage landowners to replace unsafe sidewalks
and retaining walls, the Street Department has developed a sidewalk/retaining
wall program for landowners in the city. The city will remove existing public
sidewalks and retaining walls (two feet tall or less) at a landowner's request
and provide the materials to install new sidewalks to the landowner. The city
will not provide materials to construct new retaining walls. To qualify for the
city's sidewalk/retaining wall program, the landowner must agree to the
following conditions:
   (A)   All sidewalks must be open to the public and be constructed pursuant
to the city's specifications.
   (B)   Any retaining walls must be located adjacent to a public sidewalk or
city street and must be constructed pursuant to the city's specifications.
   (C)   The landowner shall be responsible for hiring and paying a qualified
contractor to construct the new walk or retaining wall.
   (D)   Contractors must be qualified to perform sidewalk or retaining wall
construction.
   (E)   Contractors who wish to participate in this program must furnish
references for sidewalks or retaining walls constructed at other locations.
   (F)   The amount of concrete furnished by the city will be determined by a
formula multiplying the length, width and depth of the sidewalk to be
constructed, not to exceed 100 linear feet. Any additional concrete required
due to a contractor's failure to maintain the proper depth with stone will be

COMPLETE STREETS POLICY
§ 97.40 DEFINITION.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definition shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   COMPLETE STREETS. Streets that are designed and operated to enable safe
access for all users, in that pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and public
transportation users of all ages and abilities are able to safely move along
and across a street.
(Ord. 10-2018, passed 4-10-18)
§ 97.41 POLICY.
   The city shall develop a safe, reliable, efficient, integrated, and
connected multi-modal transportation system that will promote access, mobility,
and health for all users, and will ensure that the safety and convenience of
all users of the transportation system are accommodated, including pedestrians,
bicyclists, users of mass transit, people of all ages and abilities, motorists,
emergency responders, freight providers, and adjacent land users.
(Ord. 10-2018, passed 4-10-18)
§ 97.42 VISION AND GOALS.
   Thoughtful street design can have significant positive effects on the
social, economic, and environmental qualities of a community. As such, this
complete streets policy directs the city to develop and maintain a safe,
reliable, and efficient, multi-modal transportation system that people of all
ages and abilities can access, utilize, and enjoy. The specific goals are to:
   (A)   Provide a variety of choices for active, non-motorized transportation
to routine destinations;
   (B)   Improve health and physical fitness among city residents;
   (C)   Create aesthetically beautiful and physically pleasant streets for
walking, biking, bussing, and driving;
   (D)   Enhance roadway safety for pedestrians, bicyclists, and cars;
   (E)   Preserve the natural environment of the city and reduce greenhouse gas
emissions; and
   (F)   Improve the local economy by creating quality of life resources for
city residents.
(Ord. 10-2018, passed 4-10-18)
§ 97.43 ALL USERS AND MODES.
   (A)   The transportation system shall be designed and operated to ensure the
safety, accessibility, comfort, and convenience of all users, including
pedestrians, bicyclists, public transit users, people of all ages, people with
disabilities, skateboarders, horse-drawn carts, farm equipment, motorists,
emergency responders, freight providers, adjacent land users, and users of
other common modes of transportation.
   (B)   When there are conflicting needs among users and modes, the following
prioritization will apply:
      (1)   Above all, safety is paramount, followed by mobility;
      (2)   Among modes, pedestrians shall come first citywide, followed by the
next most vulnerable types of users; and
      (3)   Seek balance among all modes involved. It is recognized that all
modes cannot receive the same type of accommodation and space on every street,
but the overall goal is that everyone, young, old, and of varying ability, can
safely and conveniently travel across the network using whatever mode they
choose.
(Ord. 10-2018, passed 4-10-18)
§ 97.44 PROJECTS AND PHASES.
   The city shall approach every transportation improvement and project phase
as an opportunity to create safer, more accessible streets for all users. These
phases include, but are not limited to, scoping, planning, programming, design,
right-of- way acquisition, subdivision and land development, new construction,
construction engineering, reconstruction, operation, repair, and maintenance.
Other changes to transportation facilities on streets and right-of-way,
including capital improvements, re-channelization projects, major utility work,
and major maintenance, should also be included.

   (C)   Exceptions will only be considered when the project involves:
      (1)   A roadway that prohibits, by law, use by specified users, such as
an interstate freeway or pedestrian mall. In such cases, an effort shall be
made to accommodate those specified users elsewhere in close proximity;
      (2)   A safety issue that outweighs the proposed benefit of implementing
a complete streets element or component;
      (3)   Costs of accommodation that would be excessively disproportionate
to the need or probable use. Excessively disproportionate is defined here as
exceeding 10% of the total cost of the project, except in the case of stand-
alone projects;
      (4)   Scarcity of population, travel, or destinations, both existing and
planned, that demonstrates an absence of current and future need;
      (5)   Routine maintenance of the transportation network that does not
change the roadway geometry or operations, such as mowing, sweeping, and spot
repair; or
      (6)   Low volume, rural, or low speed situations where having vehicles
and bicycles share the travel lane may be appropriate and considered a
reasonable integration of multi-modal needs.
   (D)   Exceptions will only be granted as long as they do not negatively
affect performance measures listed later in this subchapter.
   (E)   Biannually, the Complete Streets Task Force shall post allowed
exceptions on the city website.
(Ord. 10-2018, passed 4-10-18)

§ 97.48 DESIGN.
   (A)   The city shall use the best design standards and recommendations
available to maximize design flexibility and innovation for balanced user and
modal needs in our rural community. This includes a shift toward designing at
the human scale for the needs and comfort of pedestrians. Street layout, width,
operating speeds, hierarchy of streets, and connectivity should consider all
types of travelers, not just cars. Design criteria shall not be purely
prescriptive but shall be based on the thoughtful application of engineering,
architectural, urban, and rural design principles.
   (B)   At a minimum, design components should include:
      (1)   Sidewalks and crosswalks;
      (2)   Bike and shared lanes;

storm water infrastructure shall be integrated in to the construction,
reconstruction, or retrofit of a street.
      (2)   Attention to aesthetic. Complete streets are beautiful,
interesting, and comfortable places for people. The design of a city begins
with the design of streets, as a community places where people want to be. As
part of the city's public realm, streets shall be held to a higher standard for
design at a human scale. Multi-modal accommodations and all city projects in
the right- of-way shall be approached as opportunities to enhance the aesthetic
qualities of the city through the thoughtful creation of place. Wherever
feasible, streetscapes shall include:

§ 97.60 PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to protect, maintain, and enhance
the public health, safety, and general welfare by establishing minimum
standards for construction of all required by the Bedford Unified Development
Code, and procedures to control, review, and approve the construction of these
public improvements as well as procedures for the control and maintenance of
the city rights-of-way.
   (B)   The City of Bedford is responsible for maintaining all streets and
structures accepted within the Bedford rights-of-way and it is therefore
necessary to set minimum standards for the construction of all improvements for
which the city will be responsible, in order to avoid assuming unnecessary
maintenance costs and inconvenience to the citizens and businesses of the City
of Bedford.
   (C)   All improvements intended for public use, to be constructed in a city
right-of-way or easement, or to be constructed as a privately maintained
improvement must conform to city standards according to the Planning Commission
requirements, the Bedford Unified Development Code, and shall conform to or
exceed the standards as set forth in this subchapter.
   (D)   The standards set forth in this subchapter are intended to be minimum
standards. Variances from these standards may be considered by the Bedford
Board of Public Works and Safety upon written application to the Board citing
unusual conditions justifying changes based upon sound engineering practices.
Proposed variances shall have been reviewed by the Planning and Zoning
Department, as appropriate, before consideration by the Board of Public Works
and Safety.
   (E)   All improvements shall be constructed to conform to the current
standard specifications of the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT),
referred to in this subchapter as “standard specifications”, except where
deviations are hereinafter allowed, or variances granted. The standard
specifications can be found on the INDOT website.

inch layer of concrete one and one-half inch below grade as per Table A2. The
Board of Public Works and Safety or the Street Commissioner, and/or his or her
representative, herein referred to as “city,” shall review and approve any
exceptions. If an exception is granted, the following procedure would be
utilized: number eight or nine stone compacted every six inches with an eight
inch layer of concrete one and one-half inch below grade. A bed for the pipe
will be allowed using sand, number 11 or number nine stone per Table A2 in the

wind, flood, or by any other cause, to such an extent that the structural
strength or stability thereof is materially less than it was before the
catastrophe, and is less than the minimum requirements for new buildings of a
similar structure, purpose, or location.
      (5)   Whenever any portion, member, or appurtenance thereof is likely to
fail, to become detached or dislodged, or to collapse, and thereby injure
persons or damage property.
      (6)   Whenever any portion of a building, or any member, appurtenance, or
ornamentation on the exterior thereof is not of sufficient strength or

likely to cause sickness or disease.
      (16)   Whenever any building or structure, because of obsolescence,
dilapidated condition, deterioration, damage, inadequate exits, or lack of
sufficient fire-resistive construction is determined by the fire official to be
a fire hazard.

ARTICLE I: GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-1-4-11
granted the power to local government units to control land use within their
jurisdictions. Therefore, the Common Council of the City of Bedford does hereby
adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
   (B)   Findings of fact. The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed,
or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health.
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions.
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains.
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
area.
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas.
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained.
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain.
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible.
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (D)   Methods of reducing flood loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities.
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters.
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage.
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters, or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

flood prone areas. The term describes such state or local regulations in any
combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage
prevention and reduction.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.

cumulative increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.

facilities.
   HARDSHIP. As related to variances of this chapter, the exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city
requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the
property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:

evaluation. ICC-ES REPORTS provide information about what code requirements or
acceptance criteria were used to evaluate a product, and how the product should
be identified and installed.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They are broken down into the following categories:

letter from FEMA stating that a proposed structure that will be elevated by
fill would not be inundated by the base flood.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a building or area of land
is not located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation
data. A LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
      (4)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT OUT AS SHOWN (LOMA-OAS). An official
determination by FEMA that states the property or building is correctly shown
outside the SFHA as shown on an effective NFIP map. Therefore, the mandatory
flood insurance requirement does not apply. An out-as-shown determination does
not require elevations.
      (5)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (6)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). FEMA’s modification
of the SFHA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill outside the
existing regulatory floodway.

or exceed the following criteria:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
         (b)   At least two openings are designed and maintained for the entry
and exit of floodwater; and these openings provide a total net area of at least
one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of all
such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher. Doorways
and windows do not qualify as openings.
      (6)   The first floor of a building elevated on pilings or columns in a
coastal high hazard area (as that term is defined in 44 CFR 59.1), as long as
it meets the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3.

any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE PERCENT (1%) ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of
being equaled or exceeded in any given year. See REGULATORY FLOOD.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community’s FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain
boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These
changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements,
annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base
flood elevations or SFHAs.

   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement. The date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,

on the Lawrence County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map
dated December 3, 2010 shall be determined from the 1% annual chance flood
profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Lawrence County, Indiana and
Incorporated Areas and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) dated
December 3, 2010 as well as any subsequent updates, amendments, or revisions,
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date.
Should the floodway limits not be delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
for a studied SFHA designated as an “AE Zone”, the limits of the floodway will
be according to the best available flood layer as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.
   (B)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each
of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the city delineated as an “A Zone” on

revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best available flood layer provided by
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage
area from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available flood layer data, the party needs to replace
existing data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and subsequently approved.
   (C)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification
on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of
any watercourse in the community’s known flood prone areas shall be according

this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
   (M)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (N)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request.

ARTICLE III. PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 151.40 GENERAL STANDARDS; SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   (A)   Floodways (riverine). Located within SFHAs, established in §
151.04, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. Under the provisions of the
Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1) a permit for construction in a floodway from
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance
of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or
obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation
activities such as filling, grading, clearing, and paving undertaken before the
actual start of construction of the structure. General licenses and exemptions
to the requirements of the Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1 and 312 IAC 10) may
apply to qualified additions/improvements to existing lawful residential
structures, rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland restoration, utility line
crossings, outfall projects, creek rock removal, and prospecting.
      (1)   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in §
151.04, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources and apply for approval for construction in a
floodway, provided the activity does not qualify for a general license or
exemption (I.C. 14-28-1 or 312 IAC 10).
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. The floodplain
development permit shall meet the provisions contained in this subchapter.
      (3)   The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than
an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to qualify for
a general license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site/
project. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
      (4)   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development shall cause
no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge
without first obtaining a Conditional Letter of Map Revision and meeting
requirements of §
151.29(A). A Conditional Letter of Map Revision cannot be issued for
development that would cause an increase in flood levels affecting a structure
and such development should not be permitted.
      (5)   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet identified on the
effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity
of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation
of the regulatory flood of at least fifteen-hundredths of a foot as determined
by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that
under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
      (6)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
   (B)   Fringe (riverine). If the site is in the fringe (either identified on
the FIRM or identified by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources through
detailed or approximate studies and not identified on a FIRM), the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in this subchapter have been met.
   (C)   SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/
fringes (riverine).
      (1)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile.
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade
has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be
issued, provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this subchapter have been
met.
      (2)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile.
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
         (b)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this
subchapter have been met.
   (D)   SFHAs not identified on a map.
      (1)   f a proposed development site is near a waterway with no SFHA
identified on a map, the Floodplain Administrator shall verify the drainage
area upstream of the site. If the drainage area upstream of the site is
verified as being greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade
has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper written
approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain analysis/
regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be issued,
provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not less
restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and the provisions contained in this subchapter have been met.

§ 151.02 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to guide development in the flood hazard
areas in order to reduce the potential for loss of life and property, reduce
the potential for health and safety hazards, and to reduce the potential for
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief. Under the
authority granted to local units of government to control land use within their
jurisdiction, which includes taking into account the effects of flooding, the
Bedford City Council hereby adopts the following floodplain management
regulations in order to accomplish the following:
   (A)   To prevent unwise developments from increasing flood or drainage
hazards to others;
   (B)   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage;
   (C)   To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding;
   (D)   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects,
repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and
relief operations;
   (E)   To maintain property values and a stable tax base by minimizing the
potential for creating flood blighted areas; and
   (F)   To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures
and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the National
Flood Insurance Program.

Department of Natural Resources for review and approval.
   (A)   The regulatory flood elevation and floodway limits for the SFHA's of
Leatherwood Creek shall be as delineated on the 100 year flood profiles in the
Flood Insurance Study of the city dated September 4, 1987 and the corresponding
FIRM dated September 4, 1987, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
   (B)   The regulatory flood elevation for each SFHA delineated as an “AH
Zone” or “AO Zone” shall be that elevation delineated on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map of the city.
   (C)   The regulatory Flood Elevation for each of the remaining SFHA's
delineated as an “A Zone” on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the city shall be
according to the best data available as provided by the Department of Natural
Resources.
   (D)   The regulatory flood elevation and floodway limits for the SFHA's of

(Ord. 2-1993, passed 1-12-93)
§ 151.06 IMPROVEMENT LOCATION PERMIT.
   No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by state law
shall commence any “development” in the SFHA without first obtaining an
Improvement Location Permit from the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning
Administrator shall not issue an Improvement Location Permit if the proposed
“development” does not meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (A)   The application for an Improvement Location Permit shall be
accompanied by the following:
      (1)   A description of the proposed development.
      (2)   Location of the proposed development sufficient to accurately
locate property and structure in relation to existing roads and streams.
      (3)   A legal description of the property site.
      (4)   A site development plan showing existing and proposed development
locations and existing and proposed land grades.
      (5)   Elevation of the top of the lowest floor (including basement) of
all proposed development. Elevation should be in National Geodetic Vertical
Datum of 1929 (NGVD) or North American Vertical Datum (NAVD). In either case
the conversion formula should be included.
   (B)   Upon receipt of an application for an Improvement Location Permit, the
Zoning Administrator shall determine if the site is located within an
identified floodway, floodway fringe or within the floodplain where the limits
of the floodway have not yet been determined.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodway the Zoning Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Department of Natural Resources and
apply for a permit for construction in a floodway.
         (a)   Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1, a permit from the Natural
Resources Commission is required prior to the issuance of a local building
permit for any excavation, deposit, construction or obstruction activity
located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as
filling, grading, clearing and paving and the like, undertaken before the
actual start of construction of the building.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Zoning Administrator until a
permit has been issued by the Natural Resources Commission granting approval
for construction in the floodway. Once a permit has been issued by the Natural
Resources Commission, the Building Official may issue the local Improvement
Location Permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
151.07 and
151.08 have been met. The Improvement Location Permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit issued by the Natural Resources Commission.
      (2)   If the site is located in an identified floodway fringe, then the
Zoning Administrator may issue the local Improvement Location Permit provided
the provisions contained in §§
151.07 and
151.08 have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of
any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the Flood
Protection Grade (FPG).
      (3)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and floodway fringe have not yet been determined (shown as Zone A on
the Flood Insurance Rate Map), and the drainage area upstream of the site is
greater than one square mile, the Zoning Administrator shall require the
applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and
specifications, to the Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.
         (a)   No action shall be taken by the Zoning Administrator until
either a permit for construction in the floodway or a letter of recommendation
citing the 100 year flood elevation and the recommended Flood Protection Grade
has been received from the Department of Natural Resources.
         (b)   Once the Zoning Administrator has received the proper permit or
letter of recommendation approving the proposed development, an Improvement
Location Permit may be issued provided the conditions of the Improvement
Location Permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in §§
151.07 and
151.08 have been met.
      (4)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and the floodway fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage
area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Zoning
Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis
showing the limits of the floodway, floodway fringe and 100-year elevation for
the site.

§ 151.07 PREVENTING INCREASED DAMAGES.
   No development in the SFHA shall create a damaging or potentially damaging
increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health and safety.
   (A)   Within the floodway identified on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map
or the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the following standards shall apply:
      (1)   No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in
combination with existing or future development, will cause any increase in the
elevation of the regulatory flood; and
      (2)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the city shall submit the date and request that the Federal Emergency
management Agency revise the regulatory flood data.
   (B)   (1)   Within all SFHA's identified as A Zones (no 100 year flood
elevation and/or floodway/floodway fringe delineation has been provided) the
following standard shall apply.
      (2)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the regulatory flood elevation more than one-tenth of one foot and will not
increase flood damages or potential flood damages.
   (C)   Public Health Standards in all SFHA's.
      (1)   No development in the SFHA shall include locating or storing
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, pollutants, or
other hazardous or toxic materials below the Flood Protection Grade, unless
such materials are stored in a floodproofed storage tank or building
constructed according to the requirements of §
151.08.
      (2)   New and replacement sanitary sewer lines and on-site waste disposal
systems may be permitted providing all manholes or other above ground openings
are located above the FPG, or those which are located below the FPG are
watertight.

situations:
      (1)   Construction or placement of any new building having a floor area
of greater than 400 square feet;
      (2)   Structural alterations made to an existing building that increase
the market value of the building by more than 50% (excluding the value of the
land);
      (3)   Any subsequent alterations;
      (4)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged building that are
valued at or more than 50% of the market value of the building (excluding the
value of the land) before damage occurred;
      (5)   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured
home on an existing site. This chapter does not apply to returning the existing
manufacture home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it was removed to
avoid flood damage; and
      (6)   Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site for
more than 180 days.
   (B)   This building protection requirement may be met by one of the
following methods. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain a record of

         (a)   The building or improvements shall be elevated on posts, piers,
columns, extended walls, or other types of similar foundation provided:
            1.   Walls of any enclosure below the elevated floor shall be
designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on the walls by
allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters, through providing a minimum of
two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) having a total area of one
square foot for every two square feet of enclosed area subject to flooding. The
bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
            2.   Any enclosure below the elevated floor is issued for storage
of vehicles and building access.
         (b)   The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored and
aligned in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures so as to minimize
exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as buoyancy, current, waves, ice,
and floating debris.
         (c)   All areas below the FPG shall be constructed of materials
resistant to flood damage. The top of the lowest floor (including basement) and

§ 151.10 VARIANCES.
   (A)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may consider issuing a variance to the
terms and provisions of this chapter provided the applicant demonstrates that:
      (1)   There exists a good and sufficient cause for the requested
variance;
      (2)   The strict application of the terms of this chapter will constitute
an exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      (3)   The granting of the requested variance will not increase flood
heights, create additional threats to public safety, cause additional public
expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public, or
conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
   (B)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may issue a variance to the terms and
provisions of this chapter subject to the following standards and conditions:
      (1)   No variance or exception for a residential use within a floodway
subject to §
151.07 (A) or (B) may be granted.
      (2)   Any variance or exception granted in a floodway subject to §

recipient of a variance or exception that the proposed construction will be
subject to increased risks to life and property and could require payment of
increased flood insurance premiums.
(Ord. 2-1993, passed 1-12-93)
§ 151.11 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this chapter does not create any
liability on the part of the community, Natural Resources, or the State of
Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
(Ord. 2-1993, passed 1-12-93)
§ 151.98 VIOLATIONS.
   Failure to obtain an Improvement Location Permit in the SFHA or failure to
comply with the requirements of a permit or conditions of a variance shall be
deemed to be a violation of this chapter. All violations shall be considered a
common nuisance and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of the
Zoning Code for the City of Bedford.
   (A)   The Bedford City Planning Commission shall inform the owner that any
such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and
therefore may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be
suspended.
   (B)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.
(Ord. 2-1993, passed 1-12-93)

hearing. The applicant shall bear the cost of the public notice.
   (E)   Preliminary approval.  After the Plan Commission has reviewed the
preliminary plat, construction plans, reports received from the appropriate
committee and other agencies, and heard testimony submitted at the public
hearing, the applicant shall be advised of any required additions. The
Commission shall approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the preliminary
plat. The Plan Director shall return one copy of the proposed preliminary plat
and construction plans to the developer with the date of approval, conditional
approval, or disapproval and the reasons therefore, in writing, accompanying
the plat.
   (F)   Public improvements and performance bond.
      (1)   Subsequent to preliminary approval but before the final plat is
signed by the President and Secretary of the Commission, all applicants shall
be required to complete all streets, curbs, sidewalks, sanitary and storm
sewers, waterlines, street signs, and other public improvements on the
individual lots of the subdivision as required in this chapter, specified in
the final subdivision plat, and as approved by the Commission.
      (2)   The Commission in its discretion may waive the requirement that the
applicant complete all public improvements prior to the approval of the final
subdivision plat, and that, in lieu thereof, the applicant shall post bond
securable by the city, hereinafter referred to as a performance bond, in an
amount equivalent to 110% of the estimated cost of completion of the required
public improvements, which shall be sufficient to secure to the participating
jurisdiction the satisfactory construction and installation of the uncompleted
portion of required public improvements, as provided for in §§
152.65 -
152.70.
      (3)   In lieu of a bond, the developer may submit a certified check made
payable to the city in an amount equivalent to 110% of the estimated cost of
completion of the uncompleted portion of required public improvements as
provided for in§ §
152.65 -
152.70. Any such check shall be held by the City Clerk.
      (4)   In lieu of a bond, the developer may submit irrevocable letters of
credit on behalf of the developer and securable by the city in an amount
equivalent to 110% of the estimated cost of completion of the uncompleted

152.65 -
152.70. In the event an irrevocable letter of credit is utilized, it shall be
written for a maximum length of one year; and the Commission shall after a
period of ten months determine if the public improvements have been accepted
for maintenance by a governmental unit having jurisdiction over the public
improvement. If they have not been accepted, the Commission shall notify the
subdivider of intent to secure the funds and then commence procedures to secure
the funds pledged by the letter of credit, or at the discretion of the
Commission to grant an extension for a period fixed by the Commission, not to
exceed one year, and the subdivider filing with the Commission a new letter of
credit for the period so fixed.
      (5)   In lieu of a bond, the subdivider may submit a certificate of
deposit made out to the city and the developer, to be held by the City Clerk
and in an amount equivalent to 110% of the cost of completion of the
uncompleted portion of required public improvements as provided for in §§
152.65 -
152.70.
      (6)   The performance bond shall comply with all statutory requirements
and shall be satisfactory to the Commission Attorney as to form, sufficiency,
and manner of execution as set forth in this chapter. The period within which
required public improvements must be completed shall be specified by the
Commission in the resolution approving the preliminary subdivision plat and
shall be incorporated into the bond and shall not in any event exceed two years
from the date of final approval, except as provided for in the irrevocable
letter of credit. The bond shall be approved by the participating jurisdiction
as to amount. The Commission may, upon proof of difficulty, grant an extension
of the completion date set forth in the bond for a maximum period of one
additional year, provided that the bond submitted for this extension period
meets all other requirements herein. The Commission may, at any time during the
period of the bond, accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond.
   (G)   Effective period of preliminary approval. Unless extended, the
approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of one year at
the end of which time final approval on the subdivision must have been obtained
and certified by the President and Secretary of the Commission. Any plats not
receiving final approval within the period of time set forth herein shall be
null and void, and the developer shall be required to resubmit a new plat for
preliminary approval subject to all new zoning restrictions and subdivision
regulations. Upon request of the applicant, the Commission may extend the
approval of a preliminary plat in increments of one year beyond an expiration
date without further notice and public hearing.
   (H)   Zoning ordinances. Every plat shall conform to existing zoning
ordinances and subdivision regulations applicable at the time of final
approval, except that any plat which has received preliminary approval shall be
exempt from any subsequent amendments to the zoning ordinances which would
otherwise render the plat nonconforming as to size, shape, or use.
   (I)   Grading of site prior to final plat approval. Subsequent to final
approval, the developer may apply for an earthwork (topsoil and excavation)
permit from the Building Commissioner or such other agency as the governing
body has designated, and upon receipt of the permit may commence construction
to the grades and elevations required by the approved preliminary plat.
   (J)   Model homes.  For the purpose of allowing the early construction of
model homes in a subdivision, the Commission, at its discretion, may permit a
portion of a major subdivision involving no more than two lots to be created in
accordance with the procedures for minor subdivisions, provided that the
portion derives access from an existing public street, and provided that no
future road or other improvement are anticipated where the lots are proposed.
The subdivision plat for the minor portion shall be submitted to the Commission
simultaneously with the preliminary plat for the entire major subdivision.
Subsequent to the preliminary approval, the model home or homes may be
constructed, subject to additional requirements that the Commission may
require.

   (J)   Sectionalizing of plats.
      (1)   Subsequent to granting preliminary approval of a major subdivision
plat, the Commission may permit the plat to be divided into two or more
sections and may impose the conditions upon the filing of the sections as it
may deem necessary to assure the orderly development of the plat. The
Commission may require that the performance bond or other instrument be in such
amount as is commensurate with the section or sections of the plat to be filed
and may defer the remaining required performance bond principal amount until
the remaining sections of the plat are offered for final approval. The same
policy shall apply to installation of improvements.
      (2)   The developer may also file irrevocable offers to dedicate streets
and public improvements in the sections offered to be filed and defer filing
offers of dedications for the remaining sections until the sections, subject to
any conditions imposed by the Commission, shall be granted final approval.

   (A)   Option. As provided in §
152.22(F), the subdivider has the option of either installing all required
public improvements prior to final approval of the plat, or, in lieu of
installation, posting a bond in an amount sufficient to assure completion of
the improvements.
   (B)   Posting of performance bond.  The Plan Commission, at its discretion,
may waive the requirement that the applicant complete and dedicate all public
improvements prior to the signing of the subdivision plat, and that, as an
alternative, the applicant post a performance bond.
   (C)   Completion of improvement.
      (1)   The applicant shall build and pay all costs for temporary
improvements required by the Plan Commission and shall maintain the temporary
improvements for the period specified by the Commission. Prior to construction
of any temporary facility or improvement, the developer shall file with the
city a separate suitable bond for temporary facilities, which bond shall ensure
that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained, and
removed.
      (2)   For subdivisions for which no performance bond has been posted, if
the improvements are not completed within the period specified by the Plan
Commission in the resolution approving the plat, the approval shall be deemed
to have expired, and the final plat void.
      (3)   In those cases where a performance bond has been posted but the
required improvements have not been installed within the terms of the
performance bond, the city may thereupon declare the bond to be in default and
require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the
building development at the time the bond is declared to be in default.
   (D)   Inspection of improvements.
      (1)   The Plan Commission shall provide for periodic inspection of
required improvements during construction to ensure their satisfactory
completion.
      (2)   If the City Engineer finds upon inspection that any of the required
improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the construction
standards and specifications, the applicant shall be responsible for correcting
any errors in construction and completing the improvements in accordance with
the standards and specifications. Wherever the cost of improvements is covered
by a performance bond, the applicant and the bonding company shall be severally
and jointly liable for completing the improvement according to specifications.
   (E)   Acceptance of dedication offers.
      (1)   Acceptance of formal offers of dedication of streets, public areas,
easements, and parks shall be by official action of the City Council.
      (2)   The approval by the Plan Commission of a subdivision plat shall not
be deemed to constitute or simply the acceptance of the city of any street,
easement, or other public areas shown on the plat.
   (F)   Release or reduction of performance bond.
      (1)   The City Council shall not accept dedication of required
improvements, nor release nor reduce a performance bond, until the City
Engineer has submitted a certificate stating that all required improvements
have been satisfactorily completed and until the applicant's engineer has
certified to the City Engineer that the layout of all public improvements are
in accordance with construction plans for the subdivision and that the
improvements have been completed, are ready for dedication to the city, and are
free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances. The City Council shall
thereafter accept the improvements for dedication in accordance with the
established procedure.
      (2)   A performance bond may be reduced upon actual dedication and
acceptance of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the dedicated
public improvements bear to the total public improvements for the plat.

improvements on the subdivided areas and, if required, provide for snow removal
and traffic control on streets and sidewalks until acceptance of the
improvements by the Board of Public Works and Safety.
   (B)   Posting of maintenance bond. The applicant shall be required to file a
maintenance bond with the Board of Public Works and Safety prior to dedication,
in an amount considered adequate by the City Engineer, in order to assure the
satisfactory condition of the required improvements, including all lot
improvements on the individual subdivided lots for a period of three years
after the date of their acceptance by the Board of Public Works and Safety and
dedication of same.
(Ord. 29-1984, passed 8-14-84)
Penalty, see § 152.99
§ 152.32 DEFERRAL OR WAIVER OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   General conditions.  The Plan Commission may defer or waive at the
time of final approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provisions of
any or all such improvements as, in its judgment, are not requisite in the
interest of public health, safety, and general welfare, or which are
inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities.
   (B)   Assurance for future completion. Whenever it is deemed necessary by
the Plan Commission to defer the construction of any improvement required
herein because of incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or lack of
connecting facilities, or for other reasons, the applicant shall pay his share
of the costs of the future improvements to the city or county prior to signing
of the final subdivision plat, or the applicant may post a bond ensuring
completion of the improvements upon demand of the city or county.

local Governmental Attorney that access is legally established, and from the
Governmental Engineer that the access road is adequately improved, or that a
performance bond has been duly executed and is sufficient in amount to assure
the construction of the access road.
      (2)   Lot lines shall be laid out so as not to cross boundary lines
between adjacent units of local government which have separate governing bodies

(Ord. 29-1984, passed 8-14-84)
Penalty, see § 152.99
§ 152.41 SUBDIVISION AND LOT LAYOUT.
   (A)   Street location and arrangements. Within a proposed subdivision,
arterial and collector streets shall be dedicated to the public in all cases.
In general, all other streets, including new collectors and locals, shall also
be dedicated to public use. The street layout shall conform to the following.
      (1)   Where applicable, subdivision streets shall conform generally to
the adopted thoroughfare plan.
      (2)   Local streets shall be so arranged as to discourage their use by
through traffic.
      (3)   Streets in new subdivisions should extend to the boundary line of
the tract to provide for the future extension of the streets into adjacent
areas.
      (4)   Local streets shall be arranged in proper relation to topography in
a manner which results in usable lots, safe streets, and acceptable gradients
without unnecessary destruction of drainage courses, trees, and other natural
features of land.
      (5)   Alleys shall be provided in multiple dwelling or commercial
subdivisions unless other provisions are made for service access and off-street
loading and unloading. Dead-end alleys shall be prohibited.
      (6)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an arterial street, it shall
be required that frontage roads be constructed approximately parallel to and on
each side of the arterial street. The Commission may require such other
treatment as is necessary for the adequate protection of residential properties
and to separate through traffic from local traffic. A single row of lots
backing up to the arterial will not be discouraged. However, vehicular access
from the lots to the arterial shall be prohibited.
      (7)   No intersection shall be constructed with more than four approach
legs, and the development of three- legged "T" intersections is encouraged due
to the increased safety of the intersections.
      (8)   Half streets shall be prohibited except where unusual circumstances
make such a facility necessary to the reasonable development of a tract in
conformance with these regulations and where satisfactory assurance for
dedication of the remaining part of the street is provided. Whenever a tract to
be subdivided borders on an existing half or partial street, the other part of
the street shall be dedicated within such tract.
      (9)   Whenever a proposed subdivision borders an existing street, the
Commission may require the reconstruction or widening of such street as a
condition of plat approval. Additional dedication of right-of-way may also be
required.
         (10)   When there is a situation of unusual physical conditions or a
controlled design environment in evidence and it can be satisfactorily
demonstrated to the Commission that a private street is the only feasible
solution, the private streets may be authorized provided pavement construction
standards shall be the same as the minimum public standard, and adequate
covenant provisions are made for direct responsibility and control by the
property owners involved to provide for the perpetual operation, liability, and
maintenance of the private streets at no expense to the city.
   (B)   Lot arrangements.
      (1)   The lot arrangements shall be such that there will be no
foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in
securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the zoning
code and other regulations and in providing safe driveway access to buildings
on the lots from an approved street.
      (2)   Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the
zoning code.
      (3)   Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be discouraged
except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from
arterial streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and
orientation.
      (4)   Lots shall not generally derive access exclusively from an arterial
or major collector street. Where driveway access from an arterial or major
collector street may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the Plan
Commission may require that the lots be served by a common and combined
driveway in order to limit possible traffic hazards on the street.
      (5)   Lots shall be laid out to provide positive drainage away from all
buildings. Individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general storm
drainage pattern for the area.
      (6)   Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots or used as
spoil, but shall be redistributed to provide at least six inches of cover on
the lots and at least four inches of cover between the sidewalks and curbs, and
shall be stabilized by seeding or planting.
      (7)   No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones, soil, junk,
rubbish, or other waste materials of any kind shall be buried in any land, or
left deposited on any lot or street at the time the buildings are ready for
occupancy.
      (8)   Where individual septic tanks have been authorized, sufficient area
shall be provided for a replacement sewage disposal system.
   (C)   Block arrangements.
      (1)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots
of appropriate depth. Exceptions to this prescribed block width may be
permitted in blocks adjacent to major transportation facilities, water courses,
and industrial and commercial areas.
      (2)   Whenever practical, blocks along arterials and major collector
streets shall not be less than 1,000 feet in length. As a general rule, blocks
in other residential areas shall not be more than 1,000 nor less than 400 feet
in length.
      (3)   In long blocks the Plan Commission may require an easement through
the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, or pedestrian
walkways.
      (4)   Where blocks are developed along arterial streets or highways that
shall contain alleys, those alleys shall run parallel to the arterial and not
perpendicular or radial to it so as to create an intersection between the
arterial and alley.
   (D)   Subdivision and street names.
      (1)   The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate the name
of any other subdivision in the area covered by these regulations. The Plan
Commission shall have final authority to approve the name of the subdivision
which shall be determined at the time of preliminary plat approval.
      (2)   Street names shall not duplicate any existing name within the area
covered by these regulations except where a new street is a continuation of an
existing street. Street names that may be spelled differently but sound the
same as existing streets shall not be used.
      (3)   The Plan Commission shall have final authority to name all streets
in the case of conflict upon recommendation of the Technical Committee at the
time of preliminary plat approval.
   (E)   Public sites and open spaces.
      (1)   Where it is determined that a proposed park, playground, school, or
other public use as shown on the local government’s plan is located in whole or

§ 152.52 STREETS AND ROADS.
   (A)   General. In order to provide for streets of suitable location, width,
and improvement to accommodate expected traffic and afford satisfactory access
to police, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation, and road maintenance
equipment, and to coordinate street development so as to compose a convenient
system, avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, and assure compatibility
with long-range comprehensive plans, all streets shall be designed according to
the geometric standards set forth in these regulations.
   (B)   Principles of design.
      (1)   Subdivision street design is the design of local and minor
collector streets which are part of a functionally classified street and road
system of an area (see App. §§ 4 and 5 for average dimensions by functional
classifications). In designing and approving subdivision streets, the following
factors shall receive consideration.
         (a)   Safety for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
         (b)   Efficiency of service for all users.
         (c)   Livability or amenities as affected by traffic elements in the
circulation system.
         (d)   Economy of both construction and use of land.
      (2)   Design of major collector and arterial streets shall require
special design and approval by the City Engineer. The following design
guidelines are, therefore, specifically intended for streets within the
subdivision, i.e., minor collectors and locals.
   (C)   Interpretation of design tables.  The tables in App. §§ 4 and 5
represent average conditions and are included in these regulations to
illustrate the hierarchy of functional classification. The figures in App. §§ 6
and 7 represent specific design standards for minor collectors and local
streets, respectively. Design variation or control is based on terrain
classification and development density as described below.
      (1)   Definitions of terrain classifications.
         (a)   Level. Cross slopes range of 0% to 8%.
         (b)   Rolling. Cross slopes range of 8.l% to 15%.
         (c)   Hilly.  Cross slope of over 15%.
      (2)   Definitions of density classification in terms of gross land area.
         (a)   Low. 2 or less dwelling units per acre.
         (b)   Medium.  2.l to 6.0 dwelling units per acre.
         (c)   High.  Over 6.0 dwelling units per acre.
   (D)   Design traffic volumes.  The design hourly volume (DHV) or average
daily traffic (ADT) is the accepted basis for design. In rural areas, the City
Engineer may amend the design standards as determined by traffic demand
analysis. However, the traffic volume does not always determine the type of
curves to be used in designing low volume residential local and minor collector
streets. Traffic volumes are a major factor to be considered for streets
serving commercial and industrial areas, and the City Engineer is required to
give special attention to these areas.
   (E)   Design speeds. Design speeds are not a major factor for urban
residential local and minor collector design. As a general rule, the same rule
can be applied to rural low volume roads in subdivision design. The sight
distances and curve radii in App. §§ 6 and 7 are commensurate with average
acceptable design speeds.
   (F)   Vertical grades.  Drainage design may become critical where grades
exceed 4%. For this reason, grades lower than the suggested tabular values are
encouraged. Commercial and industrial streets shall be held to a maximum grade
of 4%. Residential streets shall in no case exceed the tabular values. In order
to provide for proper drainage, the minimum grade should be held to 0.5%. The
maximum grade on the approach leg of any intersection shall not exceed 5% in
hilly terrain and 2% in level terrain.
   (G)   Superelevation. Superelevation is usually not required in residential
areas. It should be considered in commercial and industrial areas and for
collector streets where operating speeds may exceed 30 to 35 miles per hour.
Where superelevation is used, street curves should be designed for a maximum
superelevation rate of 0.04 to 0.06 foot per foot (urban) and 0.08 to 0.12 foot
per foot (rural).
   (H)   Horizontal alignment.  Minimum centerline radii for horizontal curves
shall be 225 feet. The minimum tangent distance between reverse curves shall
be:
      (1)   Residential local, 100 feet.
      (2)   Residential minor collector, 150 feet.
      (3)   Commercial industrial collector, 200 feet.
   (I)   Intersections.
      (1)   Intersections, including median openings, should be designed with
adequate corner sight distance. The recommended minimum corner sight distance
is 200 feet for local streets and 300 feet for minor collectors. In order to
maintain these distances, the City Engineer may recommend regulations to
restrict the height of embankment, location of buildings and screening fences
and landscaping, and other provisions necessary for intersection sight control.
      (2)   The minimum intersection angle shall be 75 degrees.
      (3)   Closely spaced offset intersections are undesirable. The minimum
intersection centerline offset (jog) shall be 150 feet. To accommodate
transitional tapers, turning lanes, and other potential roadway design
requirements where needed, the City Engineer may recommend longer offsets.
      (4)   The minimum curb return radius at local streets shall be 15 feet
and at residential collector streets 20 feet. The desirable radius is 25 and 30
feet, respectively. On commercial and industrial streets, the radius shall be
30 feet, except where traffic conditions may warrant a smaller radius. The use
of three-centered curves may be required in commercial and industrial areas to
accommodate the largest vehicles expected.
   (J)   Cul-de-sacs.
      (1)   The maximum length of a residential local street cul-de-sac shall
be 600 feet. Wherever a minor collector street serves exclusively an industrial
or commercial area, a cul-de-sac may be allowed and the length may be increased
to 1,000 feet. This special provision shall be allowed only in areas which have
a difficult access or are otherwise unsuitable for normal subdividing. However,
a 48-foot pavement shall be required in all cases under this special provision.
      (2)   The minimum radii for cul-de-sacs shall be as follows.
         (a)   Local.
            1.   Right-of-way or outside, 55 feet.
            2.   Back-to-back of curb, 45 feet.
         (b)   Commercial/industrial.
            1.   Right-of-way or outside, 60 feet.
            2.   Back-to-back of curb, 50 feet.
         (c)   Chapter 152, Appendix § 7 represents specific design standards
for residential (TYPE-1) and all other (TYPE-2) subdivisions.
   (K)   Auxiliary lanes.  The City Engineer shall require construction of
parking and turning lanes and transitional tapers where warranted.
   (L)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be provided along both sides of streets
used for pedestrian access, such as to schools, parks, or commercial areas. In
all residential areas, the Commission may allow for a sidewalk on one side
only. Minimum thickness shall be four inches Portland Cement Concrete. Minimum
width shall be five feet.
   (M)   Subgrades and pavements.
      (1)   Minimum specifications. Minimum specifications for construction and
materials shall be as set forth in the applicable sections of Standard
Specifications of the State Highway Commission, except where the city has
adopted a set of standards and specifications which are more stringent.
      (2)   Rigid pavements. Rigid pavements (air-entrained plain cement
concrete) shall meet the following minimum requirements.
         (a)   Pavement thickness.
            1.   Eight inches on local streets.
            2.   Nine inches on residential collector streets.
            3.   Ten inches on commercial/industrial collector streets.
            4.   Special design on all other streets.
         (b)   Contraction joints.
            1.   Placed at a spacing of 20 feet or less.
            2.   Placed at every catch basin and manhole in line of pavement.
            3.   Extend throughout side strips and curbs to full width of
pavement.
         (c)   Expansion joints.
            1.   With approved dowel bar assembly, shall be placed at street
intersections.
            2.   Where shown on plans.
      (3)   Flexible pavements.
         (a)   Flexible pavements may be used and the construction of full
depth asphalt pavements is encouraged. For full depth hot asphaltic concrete or
hot asphalt emulsion, the minimum pavement thickness shall be the following.
            1.   Nine and one-half inches on local streets.
            2.   Eleven and one-half inches on residential collector streets.
            3.   Fourteen inches on commercial/industrial collector streets.
            4.   Special design on all other streets.
         (b)   In lieu of full depth asphalt construction, other flexible
pavement types may be used as follows:
            1.   Nine inches crushed stone, three inches asphalt base mix, and
one and one-half inches asphalt surface mix on local streets.
            2.   Nine inches crushed stone, four inches asphalt base mix, and
one and one-half inches asphalt surface mix on residential collector streets.
            3.   Ten inches crushed stone, six inches asphalt base mix, three
inches asphalt binder mix, and one and one-half inches asphalt surface mix on
commercial/industrial collector streets.
         (c)   In no case shall the maximum lift exceed three and one-half
inches.
      (4)   Remote local streets. Where, in the opinion of the Commission, a
gravel street would be sufficient because of its remote location in the county,
such gravel street construction standards must, at least, meet county gravel
road specifications.

§ 152.53 DRAINAGE FACILITIES.
   (A)   General. The Plan Commission shall not recommend for approval any plat
of a subdivision which does not make adequate provision for storm or flood
water runoff. The drainage system shall be separate and independent of any
sanitary sewerage system. Storm sewers, where required, shall be designed
according to the methods recommended by the City Engineer, endorsed by the Plan
Commission Advisory and approved by the Plan Commission, and a copy of the
design computations shall be submitted along with plans. Inlets shall be
provided so that surface water is not carried across or around any
intersection, nor for a distance of more than 400 feet in any gutter. Surface
water drainage patterns shall be shown for each lot and block.
   (B)   Requirements for storm sewers.
      (1)   The applicant may be required by the Plan Commission to carry away
by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist either
previously to, or as a result of, the subdivision. The drainage facilities
shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual
unobstructed easements of appropriate width. Drain facilities shall be provided
under driveways so that the flow of water in ditches is not impeded.
      (2)   Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall
install storm sewer facilities; or, if no outlets are within a reasonable
distance, adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm waters
subject to the specifications of the City Engineer.
      (3)   Where conditions exist that would require a sewer size larger than
what is normally required for a particular size subdivision, the city or county
shall bear the additional cost for the oversized facility, over and above what
would be required for the subdivision alone.
      (4)   If the Commission determines that a connection to a public storm
sewer will eventually be provided as shown in existing local plans and
programs, the developer shall make arrangements for future storm water disposal
in the subdivision by a public sewerage system at the time the plat receives
final approval. Provision for the connection shall be incorporated by inclusion
in the performance bond required for the subdivision plat.
   (C)   Poor drainage areas. Whenever a plat is submitted for an area which is
subject to ponding, the Plan Commission may approve the application provided
that the applicant fills the affected area of the subdivision to an elevation
as determined by the City Engineer.
   (D)   Flood plain areas. The Plan Commission shall, when it deems it
necessary for the health, safety, or welfare of the present and future
population of the area and necessary to the conservation of water, drainage and
sanitary facilities, prohibit the subdivision of any portion of the property
which lies within the flood plain. Any approvals within the flood plain shall,
at a minimum, meet the requirements of the State Department of Natural
Resources.
   (E)   Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse,
drainageway, channel, or stream, the subdivider shall provide a storm water
easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such
watercourse, and of such width and construction as will be acceptable to the
City Engineer. The easement shall be adequately monumented; and, whenever
possible, it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by open channel with
landscaped banks.

§ 152.54 WATER FACILITIES.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   Necessary action shall be taken by the applicant to extend or
create a water supply system capable of providing water for domestic use and
fire protection. Where a public water main is accessible, the subdivider shall
install adequate water facilities, including fire hydrants, subject to the
specifications of state and local authorities.
      (2)   The location of fire hydrants and all water supply improvements
shall be shown on the preliminary plat, and the cost of providing and
installing same shall be included in the performance bond.
   (B)   Individual wells and central water systems.  In low density zoning
districts and in outlying or rural areas where a public water system is not
available, in the discretion of the Plan Commission individual wells may be
used or a central water system provided in such a manner that an adequate
supply of potable water will be available to every lot in the subdivision.
Individual wells and central water systems shall be sampled and approved by the
appropriate health authorities.
   (C)   Fire hydrants.  Fire hydrants shall be required for all subdivisions
except those coming under division (B) above. Unless otherwise specified by
local fire regulations, fire hydrants shall be located no more than 1,000 feet
apart and within 500 feet of any structure and shall be approved by the local
fire protection unit.
(Ord. 29-1984, passed 8-14-84)
Penalty, see § 152.99
§ 152.55 SEWERAGE FACILITIES.
   (A)   General. The applicant shall install sanitary sewer facilities in a
manner prescribed by the city or county construction standards as approved by
the City Engineer. All plans shall be designed and sewer facilities (including
laterals in the right-of-way) installed, subject to the specifications, rules,
regulations, and guidelines of the City Engineer and appropriate health and
other officials. Where conditions exist that would require a sewer size larger
than what is normally required for a particular size subdivision, the city
shall bear the additional cost between what would normally be required for the
subdivision and the oversized facility.
   (B)   High density residential and nonresidential districts. Sanitary sewer
facilities shall connect with public sanitary sewer systems. Sewers shall be
installed to serve each lot and to grades and sizes required by appropriate
local officials and agencies. No individual disposal system or treatment plants
(private or group disposal systems) shall be permitted.
   (C)   Low and medium density residential districts. Sanitary sewer systems
shall be constructed as follows.
      (1)   Where a public sanitary sewer system is reasonably accessible (as
determined by the Plan Commission), the applicant shall connect with same and
provide sewers to each lot in the subdivision.
      (2)   Where public sanitary sewer systems are not reasonably accessible
but will become available within a reasonable time not to exceed 15 years, the
applicant may choose to install one of the following alternatives.
         (a)   Central sewerage system with the maintenance cost to be assessed
against each property benefited. Where plans for future public sanitary sewer
systems exist, the applicant shall install the sewer lines, laterals, and mains
in conformance with the plans and ready for connection to the future sewer
mains.
         (b)   Individual sewage disposal systems, provided the applicant shall
install sanitary sewer lines, laterals, and mains to a point in the subdivision
boundary where a future connection with the public sewer main shall be made.
Sewer lines shall be laid from the individual dwellings to the street line, and
a connection shall be available in each dwelling to connect from the individual
disposal system to the sewer system when the public sewers become available.
The sewer systems shall be appropriately capped until ready for use.
      (3)   Where sanitary sewer systems are not reasonably accessible and will
not become available within an estimated 15-year period, the applicant may
install sewerage systems as follows.
         (a)   Medium Density Residential Districts shall have a central
sewerage system. No individual disposal system will be permitted. The
Commission may, however, where plans exist for a public sewer system to be
built beyond a period of 15 years, require that the applicant install all sewer
lines, laterals, and mains in conformance with the plans and ready for
connection to the public sewer mains.
         (b)   Low Density Residential Districts may have individual sewage
disposal systems or a central sewerage system can be used.
   (D)   Mandatory connections to public sewers.  If a public sanitary sewer is
accessible and a sanitary sewer is placed in a street or alley abutting upon a
property, the owner thereof shall be required to connect to the sewer for the
purpose of disposing of waste. It shall be unlawful for any owner or occupant
to maintain upon the property an individual sewage disposal system.
   (E)   Individual disposal system requirements.  Minimum lot areas shall
conform to the requirements of the zoning code, and test holes and percolation
tests shall be made as directed by the City Engineer in conformance with Health
Department regulations. There shall be at least one percolation test for every
three lots, and the test holes shall be distributed throughout the subdivision
and not concentrated in any one location. Distribution should be approved by
the City Engineer. Should the test indicate poor percolation in the
subdivision, percolation tests may be required on each lot by the Commission.

§ 152.56 NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for
commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect
to the land shall make such provision as the Plan Commission may require.
      (2)   A nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all the
requirements of site plan approval set forth in the zoning code. Site plan
approval and nonresidential subdivision plat approval may proceed
simultaneously at the discretion of the Commission. A nonresidential
subdivision shall also be subject to all the requirements of these regulations,
as well as additional standards required by the Commission, and shall conform
to the proposed land use and standards established in the comprehensive plan
and other plans of the city.
   (B)   Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in these
regulations, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the
applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commission that the
street - parcel -block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses
anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following
principles and standards shall be observed.
      (1)   Each nonresidential area or parcel shall be shown and marked on the
plat as to its intended use.
      (2)   Proposed parcels shall be suitable in area and dimensions to the
types of development anticipated.
      (3)   Special requirements may be imposed by the city with respect to
street, curb, driveway, and sidewalk design and construction.
      (4)   The City Engineer shall approve in writing prior to final plat
approval a provision that the proposed nonresidential development will not
conflict with traffic circulation patterns, and the requirements for driveway
location and design can reasonably be implemented at no cost to the city.
      (5)   Special requirements may be imposed by the city with respect to the
installation of public utilities, including water, sewer, and storm water
facilities.
      (6)   Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas
from potential nuisance from a proposed nonresidential subdivision, including
the provision of extra depth in parcels backing up on existing or potential
residential development and provisions for a permanently landscaped buffer
strip when necessary.
      (7)   Truck routes shall be established so as to prevent industrial
traffic from encroaching into adjacent residential areas.
      (8)   To the greatest degree possible, nonresidential subdivisions shall
be located on major thoroughfares or arterials; and local residential streets
shall not, to the extent feasible, be extended into nonresidential
subdivisions.

§ 152.57 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Purpose.  This section outlines additional requirements whenever a
planned unit development application is submitted to the Plan Commission for
approval. The Commission shall have the responsibility of identifying various
types of developments that normally pose special concerns to the local
government and require of the applicant such special reports and documents as
may be deemed appropriate to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of
all citizens, and to preserve, retain, enhance, and promote the existing and
future appearance of land and its resources.
   (B)   Standards. In addition to the principles and standards set forth in
these regulations, and in the zoning code, planned unit zoning subdivisions
shall be subject to the following requirements.
      (1)   The Commission may request that the applicant provide, along with
the preliminary plat, special reports on the geology, soils, hydrology, and
other features of the land in order to determine the suitability of the land
for its proposed use. All reports shall be certified by a professional engineer
unless information is available through the State Department of Natural
Resources, Soil Conservation Service, or other government agency.
      (2)   The Commission may reduce or amend the geometric design standards
for streets and may allow the development of one-way streets as well as streets
with a variable median width. However, in no case shall a one- way street be
less than 16 feet wide between the banks of curbs.
      (3)   The Commission may allow combinations of collective private
driveways, cluster parking areas, parallel or diagonal parking bays, and other
special provisions in order to reduce traffic conflicts on through streets and
optimize design and aesthetics. In no case, however, shall the areas be
accepted for public maintenance.
      (4)   The Commission may require that storage areas be provided for
anticipated needs of boats, campers, and trailers. At a minimum, for typical
residential development, one adequate space shall be provided for every two
living units.
      (5)   The Commission may require that a maintenance building be provided,
the size and location of which to be suitable for the service needs that are
necessary for the repair and maintenance of all common areas.

§ 152.67 ADVISORY MEETING WITH PLAN DIRECTOR.
   Whenever the owner of any tract or parcel of land in the planning or
corporate limits of the city intends to make a major subdivision or planned
unit development (PUD), the subdivider shall, before preparing a preliminary
plat, meet and consult informally with the Plan Director for the purpose of
ascertaining the locations of proposed major streets, parks, playgrounds,
school sites, and other planned projects which may affect the property being
considered for subdivision. At this meeting, the Plan Director will identify
environmental conditions of the proposed site and discuss potential problems of
the site with the developer. At the same meeting, the subdivider should review
with the Plan Director the minimum standards of subdivision design set forth in
§§
152.40 and
152.41. This informal review should prevent unnecessary and costly revisions in
the layout and development of the subdivision. The subdivider is encouraged to
provide a sketch plan of the development.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.01 PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TAX ABATEMENT.
    (A)   A property owner that receives a deduction under I.C. 6-1.1-12.13 or
6-1.1-12.1-4.5 is subject to an annual fee imposed by the Bedford City Council,
with the consent of the property owner authorized by I.C. 6-1.1-12.1-14. The
percentage to be applied by the Lawrence County Auditor will be established
into its initial approval of the property owner's statement of benefits and
deduction at the time of that approval.
   (B)   During each year in which a property owner's property tax liability is
reduced by a deduction applied under this procedure, the property owner shall
pay to the Lawrence County Treasurer a fee in an amount determined by the
Lawrence County Auditor. The Lawrence County Auditor shall determine the amount
of the fee to be paid by the property owner according to the following formula:
      (1)   Determine the additional amount of property taxes that would have
been paid by the property owner during the year if the deduction had not been
in effect.
      (2)   Multiply the amount determined under division (1) by the percentage
determined by the Bedford City Council which may not exceed 15%. The percentage
determined by the Bedford City Council remains in effect throughout the term of
the deduction and may not be changed.
      (3)   Determine the lesser of the division (2) product or $100,000.
   (C)   Fees collected under this section must be distributed to one or more
public or nonprofit entities established to promote economic development within
the corporate limits of the City of Bedford. The City of Bedford shall notify
the Lawrence County Auditor of the entities that are to receive distributions
under this section and the relative proportions of those distributions. The
Lawrence County Auditor shall distribute fees collected under this section in
accordance with the City of Bedford instructions.
   (D)   If the City of Bedford determines that a property owner has not paid a
fee imposed under this section, the City of Bedford may adopt a resolution
terminating the property owner's deduction under I.C. 6-1.1-12.1-3 or 6-1.1-
12.1-4.5. If the City of Bedford adopts such a resolution, the deduction does
not apply to the next installment of property taxes owed by the property owner
or to any subsequent installment of property taxes.

Industrial Reserve (I-2) as shown on the zone map of the Planning Commission of
Bedford, and as filed with the County Assessor, shall be eligible to be
designated as Economic Development Areas and shall be entitled to qualify for
property tax deduction.
   (B)   A property owner within the designated areas wishing to apply for tax

final action by the City Council on the application is delayed so as to create
an economic hardship upon applicant.
   (D)   Determination of tax abatement.

§ 154.01 INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   The fundamental purpose of all public, physical improvements in a
community is to serve the needs or desires of the residents. It follows,
therefore that the preparation of a sound community plan require the study of
past population trends, present conditions, and an estimate of the probable
size, distribution, and other characteristics of the future residents.
Population analysis also enables one to see, to a degree, the type and
character of people with which one is dealing so proposed improvements or
changes will be on a sound, social basis.
   (B)   Studies of the population within the planning area are essential to
estimate how much land will be necessary for future uses and activities; to
establish standards for various public facilities and services, streets,
sewers, water supply, schools, and parks; and to serve as a guide in
determining the approximate location and size of business and industrial
district. Estimates of future probabilities with respect to numbers,
distribution in the community, and age composition are essential to avoid
prematurely opening up land for urban development, entailing excessive costs of
public services and facilities; ensure within practicable limits that public
facilities such as schools, recreation areas, water supply, sewage facilities,
and others, will be of sufficient size; and prevent mislocating or
overextending business or industrial zones. All of these are becoming
increasingly common mistakes in both urban and non-urban areas. The table below
shows the population trend from 1880-2000 for the planning area.

§ 154.02 HISTORIC GROWTH CHARACTERISTICS.
   (A)   City/county comparison. Both the city and county have maintained a
steady population growth rate. The table below illustrates the statistics for
both jurisdictions from 1940 to 1980.

Source: U.S. Census of Population, 1940 to 1980.
      (1)   From 1940 to 1980, the city’s population increased 1,896 persons,
approximately 15%. The largest recent growth period occurred between 1970 and
1980, when the city grew by 10.0%.
      (2)   The county, during the same time period, grew just under 12%.
Between 1940 and 1950 the county lost population; however, after reaching that
low point, each decade has seen an increase.
      (3)   The city, it is noted, has stayed between 33% and 37% of the entire
county population during the last 50 years.
   (B)   Population projection. Utilizing the previously outlined data,
population was projected for the city. The projections were calculated in two
ways. Both methods utilized the existing corporate boundaries and did not
provide for annexation.
      (1)   The first method utilized the historic growth of the city as a
share of the county. Data was compared to county growth projections for the
county prepared by Indiana University in 1978.
      (2)   The second technique was based solely on the city’s rate of growth
since 1940. This method of projection utilizes a well-known mathematical
approach called least squares to determine the future rate of growth.
      (3)   The results of this projection techniques are presented for the
city below.

5 A Comprehensive Community Plan, Bedford, Indiana (1968).
 
         (a)   Both methods used for the city project an increase in
population. The percentage share method indicates an increase of just under
2,300 persons over the 20-year period. The least squares method indicates an
increase of nearly 6,100 persons. It appears that the percentage share method
of projecting is more realistic than the least squares method.
         (b)   The percentage share method is believed to be more accurate and
realistic because it reflects a period of moderate growth of approximately 16%;
the slowdown in homebuilding is expected to continue, the national economy is
not expected to improve sufficiently to have a drastic effect on the city; and
the migration is not expected to increase. Consequently, the majority of the
increase will be from within the city. It is anticipated that there will be an
overall increase of the city population; however, the percentage share method
projects a trend that is very similar to the present trend.
(Res. 17-1984, passed 8-14-84)
§ 154.03 JURISDICTIONAL PLANNING AREA.
   (A)   For the purposes of this study, the jurisdictional planning area (JPA)
relates to the area beyond the city corporate limits over which the city has
taken planning responsibility. This area varies by distance but generally
follows a line approximately one mile from the corporate limits.
   (B)   While population statistics are not specifically available for this
area, a housing count was conducted by HNTB. Based on this count, it was
established that there are some 280 households in the JPA. According to 1980
census statistics, the average household size of Shawswick Township homes was
2.82 persons. Using this density, it can be noted that some 790 persons reside
in the city’s JPA. Using county population projection ratios, a slow 20-year
growth rate of 1.4% is projected. The growth rate will result in a net addition
of only 12 more persons or roughly four more households. Based on a review of
trends in building permit records, it is believed that the rate of growth will
be higher than 1.4%, although a slow to moderate rate is all that is expected.
(Res. 17-1984, passed 8-14-84)
§ 154.04 HISTORIC OVERVIEW OF LAND USE.
   (A)   The City of Bedford has been the cultural and educational center of
Lawrence County for approximately 150 years. Established early in the 19th
century, the newly created county seat was named for Bedford County, Tennessee
by Mr. Joseph Rawlins, the city’s first settler. In 1826, a log courthouse was
constructed on the public square; the first school was established; and a
Methodist Church was also developed. Three years later a log jailhouse was
constructed, and the first stone cutters’ shop was opened. In 1832, Doctor
Winthrop Foote recognized the potential commercial value of limestone. He is
recognized historically as the father of the limestone industry in Lawrence
County. The 1830's also brought a woolen mill, the first newspaper, a bank, the
first brick courthouse, a cotton factory, and the transporting of limestone to
other towns by ox cart. During the 1860's and 1870's, the town became
incorporated, a new courthouse was constructed of local limestone, and a new
high school was built. The establishment of a railroad gave a big boost to the
limestone industry. From 1880 to 1910, the city became incorporated, elected
its first mayor, and experienced tremendous growth and prosperity.
   (B)   The city developed many various cultural and recreational activities,
in addition to the economic and population growth. In 1880, the Bedford Opera
House was opened. A grant was received from the Carnegie Institute for a
library. A book collection started in Palestine in 1819 was transferred to the
new building.
   (C)   By 1900, Bedford was a thriving city. Several streets were paved and
sanitary sewers had been installed. Up until World War II, records clearly
indicate that the city’s economy was dependent on the limestone industry. Since
World War II, there has been a diversification of the industrial sector of the
economy, leading to a more stable local economy.
   (D)   Bedford is unique in that it was developed in accordance with an
overall plan. After the original county seat was determined to be unhealthy
because it was located adjacent to the East Fork of the White River, the city
was established as the county seat of Lawrence County by the State Legislature
in 1825. The legislature decreed that the new town should be plotted in all
respects to be similar to Palestine, the previous town, with regard to size,
number, and location of lots, as well as the public square. It was further
required that lot owners in Palestine should have the privilege of exchanging
property there for lots correspondingly situated in the new town.
(Res. 17-1984, passed 8-14-84)
§ 154.05 STATUS OF PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Formal methods of planning in Bedford date back to 1825. At that time,
the citizens of Palestine selected a centrally located site of 200 acres on
high ground to relocate the county seat. The City of Palestine, the original
county seat, had been located in a flood plain and had to be moved because of
health problems. It was designed in accordance with state statutes for county
seats. The Courthouse was placed at the center in a square using a grid street
pattern. The lots were similar in size, number, and location to those in
Palestine. Several factors controlled the development of Bedford, other than
the state statutes, including the terrain, existing land use or ownership, and
transportation facilities.
   (B)   In 1945, the city created a Plan Commission. Subsequently, the city
adopted a comprehensive plan, subdivision regulations, and a zoning ordinance.
The latest edition for all three was prepared in 1984. Lawrence County has a
Planning Commission and development controls such as zoning and subdivision
controls. At the present time, the Commission is inactive, and the documents
were never adopted. The county is located within the jurisdiction of Region 13A
Southern Indiana Development Commission. This agency is responsible for
developing policies at the regional level related primarily to land use issues.
In 1976, the Southern Indiana Development Commission prepared a housing
inventory and analysis for the city of Bedford planning area. Following is a
list of appropriate land use planning or implementing agencies in the area:

§ 154.06 EXISTING LAND USE.
   (A)   Designed with a grid street pattern, as required by the Legislature,
it surrounded the county courthouse following a north-south alignment. As the
population increased, the basic grid pattern has been expanded to accommodate
the growth.
   (B)   The development pattern of the city has been greatly influenced by
natural and man-made features. The man- made features included the Milwaukee
and Monon Railroad tracks and numerous major highways and quarries.
   (C)   Natural features include the valleys for Leatherwood, Salt, Spider,
and Pleasant Run Creeks. In some cases, they pose insurmountable barriers to
the development of major thoroughfares. Another natural barrier to development
is the Karst topography in the area. “Sinkholes,” formed by the natural
enlargement of fractures by the underground drainage of rainwater, can be very
treacherous for development.
   (D)   Commercial goods and services were primarily concentrated around the
courthouse square forming the Central Business District (CBD). Other commercial
establishments have developed adjacent to the major arterials. A shopping
center has developed in recent years on the western perimeter of the city near
the intersection of S.R. 37 and 450. Another center was to have developed south
of Pumphouse Road, east of S.R. 36. However, upon completing the
superstructure, the project was discontinued.
   (E)   The CBD is in very good shape from both a physical and an economic
viewpoint. Many communities are having difficulty keeping businesses in the
CBD; however, Bedford does not appear to have that problem because there are
relatively few vacancies around the square. Although the structures in the CBD
represent several different architectural designs, without a particular
pattern, they do appear to be well-maintained. Some of the structures have had
aluminum siding or another material placed to hide the original material. A big
drawback for the center of the city is the L & N Railroad which extends from
22nd to 12th Streets parallel to J Street. The tracks, at street level, are
quite disruptive because the trains stop all east- west movement for 15 to 20
minutes several times each day.
   (F)   The CBD continues to function as the primary commercial and
governmental center of the area. However, any revitalization programs should
focus on the specific role of the CBD. Potential for multi-uses should be
addressed, such as residential over commercial uses.
   (G)   Within the corporate limits of the city, there are approximately 7,000
acres. Approximately 3,400 acres are developed with urban uses. The remainder
is in non-urban uses such as vacant, water bodies, or agricultural uses. The
percentage of each use is presented in division (I) below.
   (H)   Of the urban uses, residential activities use the most land, with
streets and alleys a close second. In the industrial sector, there are 400
acres; 179 acres are used for commercial goods and services.

§ 154.07 LAND USE CATEGORIES.
   (A)   Residential. Predominantly a single-family residential community, the
city contains over 500 multi- family units with several more planned. The
multi-family units are concentrated near the Central Business District (CBD)
and on the west side near S.R. 37. Some two-family structures are scattered
throughout the city. There are few individual mobile home units within the
city, with a concentration of individual units found southwest near Washington
Avenue. Many are found in East Oolitic where they are moved in and out
frequently, making it difficult to police for the purpose of certification.
There are several mobile home parks within the city. The development of mobile
home parks in the city will help the areas of conventional homes maintain their
values.
   (B)   Commercial.
      (1)   Commercial land uses are an important element of the local economy;
however, they do not occupy a large part of the total urbanized portion of the
planning area. There are approximately 179 acres devoted to commercial uses.
The largest and most historic commercial concentration, the CBD, consists of
retail goods and services establishments. A second commercial area has evolved
dramatically in the past ten years and is located near the western edge of the
city along 16th Street. This district, serving more of a regional need, has
occurred due to the completion of S.R. 37 west of the city.
      (2)   While shopping centers are not a recent phenomenon in the city,
they do not appear to have yet detracted from the CBD development and trade.
Many convenience goods shops are not situated in local shopping centers or
commercial districts but are scattered throughout the community. Highway
service commercial development is also found throughout the city adjacent to
the major arterials. The existing land use map, App. § 2., illustrates that the
CBD pattern of development is relatively compact. However, as in most
communities, there are some land use conflicts at the edge of the CBD. There
should be a transition or buffer zone between the exclusive commercial and the
exclusive residential areas. At present, there is a mixing of commercial and
single-family residential uses. This has a depreciating influence on the value
of both uses.
   (C)   Industrial.  Industrial land uses occupy a very small area in
comparison to its importance to the economy of the area. For many years,
industrial activities have developed throughout the city, mixing with and many
times conflicting with other types of land uses. In recent years, however, the
city has attempted to concentrate the industrial uses in areas which are more
conducive to such development. One such area is located at approximately 3700
South between the new and old routes of S.R. 37. Included within this
industrial park is a heliport which supplements the air facilities at the
Virgil Grissom Airport southeast of the city. Industries in the city range in
employment from as few as two to as many as 1,700 employees at the General
Motors Central Foundry. As the largest single industry, it is related to
automotive activities. The industry with the greatest number of establishments
is that related to limestone processing. With the industries spread throughout
the city, there are several areas where the heavy industrial traffic disrupts
adjacent residential neighborhoods. Adequate access and good internal
circulation are essential for good industrial development. These requirements
should be considered when planning for future industrial development in the
community, as well as eliminating existing bottlenecks.
   (D)   Recreational. Primarily used during leisure hours, recreation land
provides an escape from job pressures and other problems. The quality of the
health and general welfare of the residents are found to be closely related to
the type and amount of recreation facilities available to them. This
classification of land use includes public and semi- public lands devoted to
parks, school grounds, golf courses, and ball fields. The various public
facilities are listed in the table below with the acreage.

l The recreational facilities at the various schools are ballfields and
playground apparatus.
 
   (E)   Vacant, agricultural, and water areas. Within the corporate limits
there are approximately 3,910 acres. Much of this land is in the western one-
half of the city adjacent to S.R. 37 by-pass. The land is primarily vacant and
fallow. Much of it is undevelopable hillsides which are major barriers to urban
development.
   (F)   Public and semi-public.  This category of land use includes land used
by all government bodies; churches; and electric, gas, and telephone utilities.
Within the city, there are 167 acres devoted to these various uses. Included in
this acreage are over 30 churches.
(Res. 17-1984, passed 8-14-84)
§ 154.08 UNINCORPORATED AREA EXISTING LAND USE.
   (A)   Location and size.  The unincorporated portion of the planning area
lies within a band approximately one mile wide adjacent to the corporate
limits. There are approximately 16,600 acres in the unincorporated area.
   (B)   Uses.
      (1)   Residential uses.
         (a)   One- and two-family structure. The one- and two-family structure
is the most common residential use. The majority of the units are found on
farms. For the purpose of this chapter, farmsteads were counted as single-
family dwellings on two-acre parcels. Remaining acreage of each farm is counted
as agricultural land. There are approximately 740 acres in this residential
category.
         (b)   Mobile homes.  Approximately 20 acres are devoted to mobile
homes. Most units are in mobile home parks. There are no multi-family
developments.
      (2)   Commercial. This development is found on a total of ten acres
spread throughout the unincorporated area. This development includes small
grocery stores and taverns.
      (3)   Industrial. Involving 36 acres, this category of land use includes
limestone processing activities and other manufacturers scattered throughout
the unincorporated area.
      (4)   Recreational. There is relatively little land devoted to structural
recreational uses in this portion of the planning area. There are only 5.2
acres devoted to this use.
      (5)   Vacant, agricultural, and water areas.  Just over 13,600 acres of
this portion of the planning area are devoted to this category. The water area
involved in this is primarily the East Fork of the White River and some man-
made ponds. The majority of the land is vacant or agricultural.
      (6)   Public and semi-public uses. This category includes nearly 90 acres
of land. Most of the land is under county and utility ownership.
   (C)   Unincorporated area existing land use, 1982.

§ 154.10 SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES.
   There are several environmental features which have a significant effect on
development in the planning area. The primary features include soils, terrain,
and streams.
   (A)   Soils. Soils in the planning area include primarily Bedford silt loam,
Frederick silt loam, and Hagerstown silt loam. Other soils are found in the
area to a lesser degree. Each has different capabilities for urban development
and should be tested before being developed to establish what the limitations
really are. For example, many of the soils are not suited for septic tanks
because of slow permeability. They may, however, be suitable for urban
development with sanitary sewer. A detailed soils map is currently in the
process of being published. When completed, land use decisions outside the
corporate area should utilize this information.
   (B)   Terrain. Another limitation to development is the terrain. In the
southern and western parts of the planning area there are areas of relatively
rugged terrain. There are areas with a slope in excess of 15%, which are
considered to be unsuitable for urban residential development. Other areas
which have a slope between 10 and 15% are considered suitable for urban
residential development. However, development costs are above average and
maintenance costs would be above average because of the nature of the terrain.
Again, when development is being considered, topographical maps currently in
the Plan Director’s office should be reviewed.
   (C)   Streams. The city is developed on a ridge between Salt and Leatherwood
Creeks, from which several streams have their beginning. While the streams do
not bisect the city, they do influence the development. Several have very steep
banks which prohibit development. Salt Creek, Pleasant Run, Leatherwood and
East Fork of the White River bound Bedford on west, north, east and southeast.
The only direction for expansion is northeasterly. If the land adjacent to the
stream is relatively flat, there is a danger of flooding. Therefore, it is best
to preserve the floodplains and the steep banks. One way is through zoning the
lands for preservation with floodplain zoning and slope requirements.
   (D)   Karst topography. Karst topography is the result of the underground
drainage of surface water eroding the limestone. It results in sinkholes in the
surface. Even when the holes are not visible on the surface, there is always
the threat of a cave-in because of the weakening of lower layers of the soil
making it unsafe to develop for urban uses.
   (E)   Limestone quarry. As one of the major limestone quarrying areas of the
world, the city has a significant number of active and inactive quarries across
its landscape. Usually filled with water, these quarries function as places to
swim, although their depth and isolation pose formidable safety problems. In
many areas across Indiana such a man-made lake can be made attractive for
waterside residential development. Beyond these uses, development is not
realistic due to the expense related to filling and grading these areas.
(Res. 17-1984, passed 8-14-84)
§ 154.11 COMPATIBILITY OF LAND USES.
   (A)   Communities are constantly changing. As a community grows, it inherits
the desirable characteristics of the past as well as some of the problems.
Today, many communities are experiencing undesirable strip development,
incompatible land use relationships, and traffic congestion on streets
inadequately designed for current volumes. The primary cause for these problems
is a lack of foresight and concern for general community goals. The result is
lower property values, unequal taxing and general confusion about the function
of an area. Compatible land uses are those which are similar to or complement
each other. For example, high density residential uses adjacent to a service
commercial area are generally compatible with regard to traffic volumes.
However, a low density residential development would conflict with a large
industrial operation. On the edge of a community, there is generally a problem
if a residential subdivision is developed adjacent to an existing agricultural
operation. If there is cropland, the farmer will have to plow and fertilize the
crops. This leads to complaints of dust and odor from the adjacent residents.
If the agriculture operation is a feedlot, there are usually complaints about
the odor.
   (B)   Many methods are available which can be used to modify or eliminate
the effects of incompatible land uses. One accepted method is the development
of a buffer zone between the incompatible uses. The buffer zone may consist of
a type of development which is compatible to both uses or it may simply be a
wide belt of open land developed with trees and shrubs and earth mounds.
   (C)   The primary areas of conflict between various land uses in the city
include the area around the Central Business District (CBD), the urban
development fringe, numerous industrial operations throughout the city, and
areas between the concentrations of the various land uses. For example, there
is not a clearly defined transition area between the CBD commercial uses and
adjacent residential development. In many cases, there are residences mixed
with incompatible commercial uses. This is true in other areas of the community
where there is an abrupt change in land uses. This tends to have a depreciating
effect on the assessed value of all properties in the immediate area. When an
industrial use is permitted to infringe on an area which is exclusively one-
and two-family residential, both categories of land use suffer. The increased
traffic from the industrial use makes the area undesirable for residences and
deteriorates streets made for fewer and smaller vehicles. The narrow streets
and domestic activities of a residential area make it very difficult for
delivery trucks and workers to drive to the industrial area.
   (D)   This problem can be overcome by establishing buffer or transition
areas between uses which are significantly different.
(Res. 17-1984, passed 8-14-84)
§ 154.12 LAND USE PLAN.
   (A)   Residential. One- and two-family residential may be the dominant land
use in the future only because it has a head start on other development. It
appears there will have to be changes in methods of financing homes, reduced
construction costs, and new construction methods if people are to afford new
detached housing in the future. As a result, there will have to be more multi-
family unit development. Much of this development should be placed with easy
access to S.R. 37 or the other major arterial routes. One- and two-family
development should be provided space for construction within subdivisions
adjacent and abutting older developments. Individual lot divisions should be
discouraged in an attempt to promote efficient development. Mobile homes should
be required to be constructed in a mobile home subdivision. Manufactured homes
should be permitted in conventional subdivisions where the scale of the homes
is consistent and materials compatible.
   (B)   Commercial.
      (1)   Efforts to upgrade the Central Business District (CBD) should
continue, with more effort toward coordination of the structural rehabilitation
and development of the CBD with its own identity to make it unique and
different from shopping centers that may be developed in the area.
      (2)   The regional commercial strip centered along 16th Street by S.R. 37
should continue to be encouraged as a regional center not in conflict with the
downtown shopping area. A third major commercial area should be allowed to
develop along 29th Street. This area shall provide for commercial development
which for various reasons cannot occur in the downtown or regional commercial
areas. A buffer commercial zoning classification shall be developed. The intent
of commercial zones shall be to provide for various office and professional
uses which are more compatible as a buffer between residential and more
intensive land uses. Professional office uses should be encouraged around
certain segments of the CBD and also adjacent to the hospital.
      (3)   It must be noted that the indiscriminate location of commercial
establishments is not in the city’s interest. Instead, an attitude must be
recognized that the size of a community’s population correlates most closely
with how much commercial space is needed and that in many instances the
allowance of retail establishments anywhere only takes away from commercial
uses already located and operating in the city.
   (C)   Industrial.  Currently, a significantly high amount of land in the
city Planning Area is zoned for industrial. Upon review of these areas, one can
quickly note that many of these areas are within floodplains, are on steep
slopes, have poor soils, or are not adjacent to major rail or automotive
roadways. In view of these conditions, land use zoned for industrial purposes
should be sited where development can be sustained. Specifically, industrial
concentrations should occur near S.R. 37, the newly developed industrial park,
and existing industrial areas which are located along railways.
   (D)   Recreational. Currently, land utilized for recreational purposes
appears adequate to meet the needs of area residents. In view of this and
current economic conditions, emphasis should be placed on maintenance versus
expansion of recreational land.
   (E)   Vacant, agricultural, and water areas.  As noted previously, large
areas of the Planning Area have environmental limitations such as poor soils, a
flood plain, steep slopes, and the like. To assure that these areas are not
inappropriately developed, they should be limited through zoning. Specifically,
flood hazard areas should be zoned as such. This classification does not
preclude development, but rather forewarns developers of the hazards of
building in these areas. Any development in flood hazard areas must first be
reviewed by the State Department of Natural Resources to assure that the
structure is floodproof or built- up at an elevation above the flood elevation.
Other areas having environmental limitations should be identified as allowing
only low-density residential development.
   (F)   Public and semi-public. Governmental uses should be located in the CBD
in an attempt to centralize like activities. Other uses should be developed in
areas that will relate to the service provided. Schools should be located in
accordance with adopted school standards.
   (G)   Site plan review. Finally, to assure compatibility of land uses, a
site planning review process should be instituted. The site plan review should
consider factors as drainage, landscaping, internal circulation, and lighting.
The intent of a site plan review process is to systematically review how new
land uses will impact on adjacent uses and to assure compatibility. The map in
App. § 3. depicts this proposed land use plan.

DISTRICT REGULATIONS
§ 155.015 ZONING DISTRICTS.
   The city is divided into the districts stated on the table in §
155.021 as shown by the district boundaries on the zoning map. Following is an
overview of the purpose of each district established.
   (A)   OS Open Space District.  The purpose of the Open Space District is to
provide areas for recreation, farming, and conservation purposes, and areas
suitable for noncommercial recreation. This zone includes the flood hazard
areas as delineated in the city by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   (B)   RA Residential Agriculture. The purpose of the RA District is to
permit some degree of development in the rural areas where public utilities are
not available. By placing a maximum gross density of one dwelling per ½- acre
on this district, problems may be alleviated.
   (C)   R-1 Single-Family Residence District.  The purpose of this district is
to preserve those areas of the city which have been developed for low density
single-family use, and encourage residential development on vacant parcels
which is compatible with existing residential densities.
   (D)   R-2 Low Density Residential District.  This district is intended to
provide for the development of single- family and two-family dwellings in areas
of the city historically developed at a higher density.
   (E)   R-3 Medium Density Residential District.  The Medium Density
Residential District has been established to provide for a wide range of
dwelling unit types so as to meet the diverse housing needs of present and
future city residents.
   (F)   R-4 High Density Residential District. The purpose of this district is
to encourage the development of multi-family residential structures within and
adjacent to the downtown business district of the city.
   (G)   MH Mobile Home Park District. This district is established to provide
for the location of mobile homes within the city, by designating areas suitable
for the development of mobile home parks.
   (H)   PR Professional-Residential District.  The Professional-Residential
District is intended primarily as a buffer zone which, because of its proximity
to business uses, public uses, and residential uses, is designed to serve a
transition function. The character which shall prevail in this district shall
be of professional and business services.
   (I)   B-1 Convenience Business District. The purpose of this district is to
provide convenience business and service uses in neighborhood areas.
   (J)   B-2 Central Business District. The Central Business District is
established to provide for the special needs of the downtown business area of
the city, by waiving certain requirements in regard to parking, building
setbacks, and the like, which are necessary in other commercial districts.
   (K)   B-3 Planned Business District. This district is established to provide
for retail shopping facilities in planned shopping centers or clusters of
buildings, which are designed to share such things as parking and access.
   (L)   I-1 Light Industrial District. The purpose of the Light Industrial
District is to encourage the development and expansion of manufacturing and
wholesale business establishments which are clean, quiet, and free of hazardous
or objectable elements; operate entirely within enclosed structures; and
generate little industrial traffic.
   (M)   I-2 General Industrial District. This district is provided to
encourage the development and expansion of major industrial operations which
utilize both enclosed and unenclosed space for storage, fabricating, and
manufacturing.
(Ord. 28-1984, passed 8-14-84)
§ 155.016 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   District boundaries shown on the lines of roads, streams, and transportation
rights-of-way shall be deemed to follow the centerlines. The vacation of roads
shall not affect the location of such district boundaries. When the Zoning
Administrator cannot definitely determine the location of a district boundary
by the centerlines, by the scale of dimensions stated on the zoning map, or by
the fact that it clearly coincides with a property line, he shall refuse
action; and the Board of Zoning Appeals, upon appeal, shall interpret the
location of the district boundary with reference to the scale of the zoning map
and the purposes set forth in all relevant provisions of this chapter.

§ 155.030 NONCONFORMING USES.
   The following provisions shall apply to all nonconforming uses.
   (A)   A nonconforming use of land or structure or both in combination may be
continued but may not be extended, expanded, or changed unless to a conforming
use, except as specified herein or as permitted by the Board of Zoning Appeals
after recommendations by the Plan Commission in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter.
   (B)   An existing nonconforming use which occupies only a portion of an
existing structure may be extended throughout the structure, provided the
change or extension does not eliminate, displace, prevent, or restrict the
continuance of any then existing use being concurrently carried on in the
structure which conforms with the requirement of this chapter.
   (C)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and land, may be changed to another nonconforming use
provided that the Board of Zoning Appeals approves of the change as a special
exception. In reviewing specific cases, the Board shall only approve a proposed
use if it is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the
existing or former nonconforming use. In addition, the Board may require
appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
   (D)   If any nonconforming use of land, or structure, or both in combination
ceases for any reason for a period of more than 12 consecutive months, the
land, structure, or structure and land in combination shall not thereafter be
used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is

single-family dwelling and customary accessory structures may be erected on any
single lot of record as of the effective date of the adoption of this chapter.
The lot must be in separate ownership and not of contiguous frontage with other
lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though the lot
fails to meet the requirements for area or width or both that are generally
applicable to the district. Yard dimensions, including yard requirements not
involving area or width of the lot, shall conform to the regulations for the
district in which the lot is located. Variance of any requirements other than
area or width stated in the appropriate district regulations shall be obtained
through the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (B)   If two or more lots, or combination of lots and portions of lots, with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage of
this chapter, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements for
lot area and width as established by this chapter, the land involved shall be
considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this chapter; and no
portion of the parcel shall be used or sold which does not meet lot width and
area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of the
parcel be made which leaves remaining any lot with width or area below the
requirements stated in this chapter.

      (1)   If the City Building Commissioner determines that an illuminated
sign is in violation of this ordinance, the Commissioner shall notify the owner
of the sign in writing of the violation and grant the property owner five days
to remove the sign. The owner shall remove the illuminated sign within five
days of receipt of the notice of violation. If the property owner fails to
remove the sign within the five day period, in addition to any civil penalty
allowed under this chapter, the City Building Commissioner may remove and store
the sign. The property owner shall be responsible for all costs associated with
removing and storing the illuminated sign.
      (2)   If the City Building Commissioner determines that a sign is a
nuisance or a safety hazard, the City Building Commissioner or his authorized
agent may remove the sign without first delivering notice to the property
owner.
   (G)   Permits. Applications for a sign permit shall be processed through the
City Planning Department. Applications for sign permits shall include drawings
or sketches of the construction and design of the sign and shall be accompanied
by such fee as may be established by the Common Council. The city shall notify
the applicant in writing of its decision within 30 days of the applicant
submitting the application and fees. If no decision is made within 30 days, the
application shall be deemed granted.
   (H)   Nonconformity and modification.
      (1)   Where a permanent sign or structure is nonconforming to the
requirements of this ordinance for any reason and is located within a non-
residential Zoning District, and a proper building permit or sign permit was
issued authorizing the placement of the sign or structure prior to the passage
of this section, the sign or structure may remain in its nonconforming
condition so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
         (a)   No such sign or structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity.
         (b)   Any nonconforming sign or structure damaged by fire, flood,
explosion, or other casualty may be reconstructed and used as before if the
reconstruction is performed within three months of the casualty, and if the
restored sign or structure has no greater coverage and contains no greater
cubic content than before the casualty, subject to approval of required
variances by the Board of Zoning Appeals; and
         (c)   If the nonconforming sign or structure is modified or removed,
any new sign in the same location shall comply with this chapter and this
nonconforming exception shall no longer apply.
      (2)   Unless otherwise provided herein, within 30 days after the
effective date of this section, property owners shall either remove or bring
into compliance all signs which violate this section on the date this section
is passed and adopted by the Common Council.

         (a)   A planted visual barrier or landscape screen shall be provided
and maintained by the owner or lessee of a property located between any
commercial or industrial district and contiguous residentially zoned districts,
except where natural or physical man-made barriers exist. This screen shall be
composed of plants and trees arranged to form both a low-level and a high-
level screen. The high-level screen shall consist of trees planted with
specimens no younger than three years in age and planted at intervals of not
more than ten feet. The low- level screen shall consist of shrubs or hedges
planted at an initial height of not less than two feet and spaced at intervals
of not more than five feet. The low-level screen shall be placed in alternating
rows to produce a more effective barrier. All plants not surviving one year
after planting must be replaced.
         (b)   Any existing business affected by these regulations at the time
of passage of this chapter shall not be required to comply with the above
screening requirements, except in case of enlargement or major alterations of
such business. Similarly, for any zoning district boundary change after the
passage of this chapter initiated by a residential developer abutting a
commercial or industrial zone property for which these regulations apply, these
screening requirements shall not be imposed upon the commercial or industrial
property.
      (2)   Storage. Any article or material stored temporarily outside an
enclosed building as an incidental part of the primary commercial operation
shall be so screened by opaque ornamental fencing, walls, or evergreen
planting, that it cannot be seen from adjoining public streets or adjacent
lots, when viewed by a person standing on ground level during any season of the
year. All organic rubbish or storage shall be contained in airtight, vermin-
proof containers which shall also be screened from public view.
      (3)   Landscaping.
         (a)   Any part or portion of the site which is not used for buildings,
other structures, loading or parking spaces and aisles, sidewalks, and
designated storage areas shall be planted with an all-season ground cover and
shall be landscaped with trees and shrubs in accordance with an overall
landscape plan and shall be in keeping with natural surroundings.
         (b)   Any off-street parking area with five or more spaces shall
retain at least 5% of the area for landscaping which shall be in addition to
open area requirements of the district. At least one tree per five parking
spaces, or portions thereof, shall be provided within the parking area.
      (4)   Shopping cart storage.  Any establishment which furnishes carts or
mobile baskets as an adjunct to shopping shall provide definite areas within
the required parking space areas for storage of the carts. Each designed
storage area shall be clearly marked for storage of shopping carts.
      (5)   Lighting. All parking areas, driveways, and loading areas shall be
provided with a lighting system which shall furnish an average minimum of 2.0
footcandles within the areas during hours of operation, with lighting standards
in parking areas being located not more than 80 feet apart. All lighting shall
be completely shielded from traffic on any public right-of-way and from any
residential district.
      (6)   Interior circulation. The interior circulation of traffic in
commercial areas shall be designated so that no driveway or access lane
providing parking spaces shall be used as a through street. If parking spaces
are indicated by lines with angles other than 90°, then traffic lanes shall be
restricted to one-way permitting head-in parking. No driveway or street used
for interior circulation shall have traffic lanes less than ten feet in width.
      (7)   Traffic control.  No design shall be approved which is likely to
create substantial traffic hazards endangering the public safety. Safety
requirements which may be imposed in a review shall include traffic-control
devices, acceleration or deceleration lanes, turning lanes, traffic and lane
markings, and signs. The developer shall be responsible for the construction of
any traffic-control devices.
      (8)   Drainage. A plan for drainage shall be provided in accordance with
the requirements specified in the subdivision regulations provided in Ch. 152.

lot in any residential district, or on any lot abutting a residential district,
except in a carport or in an enclosed building or in the rear yard. Major
recreational vehicles or equipment should not be parked or stored on the street
or in any front yard (this includes driveways). This provision, however, does
not restrict the parking of a recreational vehicle on a residential lot for a
period of not to exceed 48 hours during loading and unloading. No such vehicle
shall be used for living or housekeeping purposes when parked or stored on a
residential lot, or any location not approved for such use.

MANUFACTURED HOUSING AND MOBILE HOME REGULATIONS
§ 155.060 MANUFACTURED HOUSING REGULATIONS.
   (A)   History.  Recent conditions have dramatically altered the housing
construction industry. Due to higher labor and materials costs, as well as
higher interest rates, home buyers have searched for less expensive housing
alternatives. To a certain extent, manufactured housing (see §
155.002) has provided a less costly alternative. Historically, however,
manufactured housing was defined as a mobile home and thereby significantly
restricted as to its placement. In 1981, the State General Assembly passed a
new law, P.L. 312 effective July l, 1982, which provides that local zoning
ordinances cannot totally exclude all manufactured housing. Consistent with
P.L. 312, manufactured homes shall be permitted as detailed in §§
155.017 and
155.018 provided the homes shall meet the following requirements and
limitations.
      (1)   The dwelling shall meet the appropriate exterior appearance
standards as set forth in division (B) below.
      (2)   The dwelling shall be sited in a district where the use is
permitted in §§
155.017 and
155.018.
      (3)   The dwelling shall receive a required permit and conform with the
comprehensive plan and other ordinances of the county.
   (B)   Exterior appearance standards. Manufactured homes shall be classified
as to acceptable compatibility or similarity in appearance with site-
constructed residences as follows.
      (1)   A type I manufactured home shall:
         (a)   Have more than 950 square feet of occupied space in a double-
section or larger multi-section unit.
         (b)   Be placed onto a permanent foundation.
         (c)   Utilize a permanent perimeter enclosure in accordance with
approved installation standards, as specified in §
155.062.
         (d)   Be anchored to the ground, in accordance with the one- and two-
family dwelling code and to the manufacturer’s specifications.
         (e)   Have wheels, axles, and hitch mechanisms removed.
         (f)   Have utilities connected, in accordance with the one- and two-
family dwelling code and manufacturer’s specifications.
         (g)   Have siding material of a type customarily used on site-
constructed residences. The Plan Commission’s designated administrator may
compile a list of approved materials meeting the compatibility test (see
approved materials list).
         (h)   Have roofing material of a type customarily used on site-
constructed residences. The Plan Commission’s designated administrator may
compile a list of approved materials meeting the compatibility test (see
approved materials list).
      (2)   A type II manufactured home shall:
         (a)   Have more than 320 square feet of occupied space in a single,
double, expando, or multi- section unit, including those with add-a-room units.
         (b)   Be placed onto a support system, in accordance with approved
installation standards, as specified in §
155.062.
         (c)   Be enclosed with foundation siding/skirting, in accordance with
approved installation standards, as specified in §
155.062.
         (d)   Be anchored to the ground, in accordance with manufacturer’s
specifications or the ANSI/NFPA 501 A Installation Standards.
         (e)   Have utilities connected in accordance with manufacturer’s
specifications or the ANSI/NFPA 501 A Installation Standards.
         (f)   Have siding material of a type customarily used on site-
constructed residences. The Plan Commission’s designated administrator may
compile a list of approved materials meeting the compatibility test (see
approved materials list).
         (g)   Have roofing material of a type customarily used on site-
constructed residences. The Plan Commission’s designated administrator may
compile a list of approved materials meeting the compatibility test (see
approved materials list).

respecting the following installation standards.
   (A)   Permanent perimeter enclosure. Those manufactured homes designated in
this chapter as requiring a permanent perimeter enclosure must be set onto an
excavated area, with foundations, footings, and crawl space or basement walls
constructed in accordance with the terms of the one- and two-family dwelling
code. The space between the floor joists of the home and excavated underfloor
grade shall be completely enclosed with the permanent perimeter enclosure,
except for required openings.

shall be weather-resistant, noncombustible or self- extinguishing materials,
which blend with the exterior siding of the home. Below grade level and for a
minimum distance of six inches above finish grade, the materials shall be
unaffected by decay or oxidation. The siding shall be installed in accordance
with manufacturer’s recommendations or approved equal standards.
      (2)   The siding shall be ventilated by openings, which shall have a net
area of not less than 1-½ square feet for each 25 linear feet of exterior

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
§ 155.080 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to provide regulation for planned unit
developments (PUD) which are of a significantly different character than
traditional land development. Specific standards and exceptions have been
developed to govern the actions and recommendations of the Plan Commission
regarding these developments.
(Ord. 28-1984, passed 8-14-84)
§ 155.081 POLICY.
   It shall be the policy of the city to promote progressive development of
land and construction thereon by encouraging planned unit developments to
achieve the following.
   (A)   A maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of
housing and building types and permitting an increased density per acre and a
reduction in lot dimensions, yards, building setbacks, and area requirements.
   (B)   A more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas and, if
permitted as part of the project, more convenience in the location of accessory
commercial uses and services.
   (C)   A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural topography
and geologic features, scenic vistas, trees, and other vegetation, and prevents
the disruption of natural drainage patterns.
   (D)   A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved through
conventional development resulting in substantial savings through shorter
utilities and streets.
   (E)   A development pattern in harmony with land use density, transportation
facilities, and community facilities objectives of the comprehensive plan.
(Ord. 28-1984, passed 8-14-84)
Penalty, see § 155.999
§ 155.082 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT RESTRICTIONS.
   Whenever there is a conflict or difference between the provisions of this

section shall prevail. Subjects not covered by this section shall be governed
by the respective provisions found elsewhere in this chapter. A planned unit
development shall conform to the following.
   (A)   The number of dwelling units erected shall not exceed the number
permitted by the regulations of the district in which it is located unless a
density increase is permitted as per §
155.083.
   (B)   All uses that may be allowed within the land use district may be
permitted within a PUD.
   (C)   Up to 10% of the gross land area in a residential district may be
directed to commercial, industrial, public, and quasi-public uses that are not
allowed within the land use district, provided there is a favorable finding by
the Plan Commission, as provided below.
      (1)   The uses permitted by the exceptions are necessary or desirable and
are appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of residential development.
      (2)   The uses are not of such nature or so located as to exercise a
detrimental influence on the development nor on the surrounding neighborhood.
      (3)   The uses are intended to serve principally the residents of the
PUD.
      (4)   The uses are planned as an integral part of the PUD.
      (5)   The uses be located and so designed as to provide direct access to
a collector or an arterial street without creating traffic congestion or
hazard.
   (D)   A minimum parcel area of ten acres is required for PUD.
   (E)   There shall be at least 10% of the land area in the development
provided for park and recreational purposes which shall not be covered by
buildings, parking lots, driveways, or streets. No more than 50% of this usable
open space shall be covered by water.
   (F)   If any open space or recreational facility is to be used solely by the
residents of the project, adequate provisions shall be made for assessments
against the property within the project so that such facilities can be properly
maintained and operated. In the event that an organization established to own
or maintain common open space, or any successor organization, shall at any time
after establishment of the PUD fail to maintain the common open space in
reasonable order and condition in accordance with the development plan, the
city shall take remedial actions to cause the common open space to be properly
maintained, the cost of which shall be borne by the residents of the PUD.
   (G)   All utilities, including communication and electric systems, shall be
placed underground within the limits of the development. Appurtenances to these
systems which can be effectively screened may be excepted.
   (H)   The design and designation of private streets shall be subject to the
approval of the Plan Commission.
   (I)   The development plan shall include a common water supply and
distribution system, either public or private, which shall meet the approval of
the Plan Commission and shall be built at no expense to the local government.
   (J)   The development plan shall include a sanitary sewer system connected
to a public sewer system, if available within a reasonable distance from the
project, or it shall provide for a central collection and treatment system in
accordance with the requirements of the Plan Commission.
   (K)   The plan of the project may provide for the integral and harmonious
design of buildings in commercial and industrial areas, and the parcels shall
be developed in park-like surroundings utilizing landscaping and existing
woodlands as buffers to screen lighting, parking areas, loading areas, and
other such features from the adjoining and surrounding residential areas.
   (L)   No building is permitted to exceed the height limit of the district in
which it is located by more than 10%.
   (M)   All previously noted parking standards shall remain in effect for all
PUDs.
   (N)   Nonresidential areas must be developed in equal ratio to residential
areas. This is required to avoid the total development of residences without
the accompanying services.

Penalty, see § 155.999
§ 155.083 INCREASED RESIDENTIAL DENSITY THROUGH DESIGN INCENTIVES.
   To provide for an incentive for quality PUD, the Plan Commission may
authorize an increased residential density of up to 20% of the allowable number
of dwelling units. In allowing for density increase, the Commission shall be
guided by the following criteria.
   (A)   If open space provided exceeds 20% of land area, additional 5%
increase in residential density allowed.
   (B)   If land donated or dedicated and accepted for public purposes such as
public buildings, schools, and parks, an additional 5% increase in residential
development is allowed.
   (C)   If there is significant landscaping, screening, and site planning in
development, an additional 5% increase in residential development is allowed.
   (D)   If community facilities and amenities as trails, lakes, plaza
fountains, tennis courts, and the like, are provided in PUD, an additional 5%
increase in residential development is allowed.

§ 155.115 RENEWABLE ENERGY CONDITION FOR CERTAIN PERMITS.
   (A)   Condition for Planned Unit Development (PUD) approval. The city may
require on-site renewable energy systems, zero-net-energy (ZNE) or zero-net-
carbon (ZNC) building designs, solar-synchronized electric vehicle charging or
other clean energy systems as a condition for approval of a PUD permit to
mitigate for:
      (1)   Impacts on the performance of the electric distribution system;
      (2)   Increased local emissions of greenhouse gases associated with the
proposal;
      (3)   Need for electric vehicle charging infrastructure to offset
transportation-related emissions for trips generated by the new development;
and
      (4)   Other impacts of the proposed development that are inconsistent
with the city's Comprehensive Plan.
   (B)   Condition for conditional use permit. The city may require on-site
renewable energy systems or zero net energy construction as a condition for a
rezoning or a conditional use permit.
(Ord. 23-2022, passed 12-19-22)
§ 155.116 SOLAR ROOF INCENTIVES.
   The city encourages incorporating on-site renewable energy system or zero
net energy construction for new construction and redevelopment. The city may
require on-site renewable energy or zero-net-energy construction when issuing a
conditional use permit where the project has access to local energy resources,
in order to ensure consistency with the city's plan to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions.
   (A)   Density bonus. Any application for subdivision of land in the
districts that will allow the development of at least four new lots of record
shall be allowed to increase the maximum number of lots by 10% or one lot,
whichever is greater, provided all building and wastewater setbacks can be met
with the increased density, if the applicant enters into a development
agreement guaranteeing at least three kilowatts of PV for each new residence
that has a solar resource.
   (B)   Solar-ready buildings. The city encourages builders to use a solar-
ready design in buildings. Buildings that submit a completed U.S. EPA Renewable
Energy Ready Home Solar Photovoltaic Checklist (or other approved solar- ready
standard) and associated documentation will be certified as a city solar ready
home, and be eligible for low-cost financing through the city's Economic
Development Authority. The designation will be included in the home's permit
history.
   (C)   Solar access variance. When a developer requests a variance from the
city's subdivision solar access standards, the zoning administrator may grant
an administrative exception from the solar access standards provided the
applicant meets the conditions of divisions (C)(1) and (2) below:
      (1)   Solar access lots identified. At least 20% of the lots, or a
minimum number of lots to be determined by the city.
      (2)   Covenant assigned. Solar access lots are assigned a covenant that
homes built upon these lots must include a solar energy system. Photovoltaic
systems must be at least three KW in capacity.
      (3)   Additional fees waived. The city may waive any additional fees for
filing of the covenant.

§ 156.01 PURPOSE AND USE.
   (A)   The purpose and use of the following preservation guidelines is to
establish a standard of appropriate physical design to improve and maintain a
certain quality of a given historic district. The Historic Review Board
realizes that these guidelines cannot cover every situation but will make every
effort to work with you, the property owner, in achieving the desired goals
while also preserving the historic integrity of the properties referred to in
Ordinance No. 13- 2000, part of the Bedford Courthouse Square Historic
District.
   (B)   As the property owner of the properties referred to in Ordinance No.
13-2000, you must apply for a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) and the
Historic Review Board must approve and issue the COA before the Planning
Department issues a building permit, or any work begins on any of the following
changes to the property: demolition, moving, additions, new construction,
reconstruction, alteration, color change or any conspicuous change in the
exterior appearance of the existing building, including windows, doors and all
exterior features, walls or fences.
   (C)   All work to the properties referred to in Ordinance No. 13-2000, part
of the Courthouse Square Historic District, should conform to The Secretary of
the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation.  When considering a rehabilitation
project, or any work to your property, consult the Historic Review Board first
for free advice on proper methods and materials, answers to your "how to"
questions and ways to save you money.

§ 156.02 EXISTING STRUCTURE.
   (A)   Awnings and canopies.
      (1)   Awnings should be mounted so that the valance is about seven feet
above the sidewalk and project four to seven feet off the building. Awnings and
canopies should complement the facade, not overwhelm it. Awnings and canopies
should not cover important architectural elements. Match the awning or canopy
with the shape of an opening. Coordinate awnings on upper and lower floors by
using similar materials and colors. The color of the awning or canopy should
complement the colors of the building. When deciding on a pattern, simple and
restrained patterned awnings are preferred.
      (2)   Signs should be sewn or painted on an awning or canopy. Lettering
should be no more than 24 inches to cover no more than one-third of the awning
or canopy area. Appropriate materials include canvas, vinyl- coated canvas and
acrilan, or other durable materials. Cedar shake, concrete, fiberglass,
plastic, aluminum or other non- traditional materials are not appropriate.
Appropriate shapes include standard, dome, concave, convex, bullnose, and
marquee. Theme designs and backlit awnings are not appropriate.
   (B)   Building materials.
      (1)   All attempts shall be made to retain exterior building materials.
Deterioration of original masonry and wood materials shall be prevented through
repair, cleaning and painting. Building materials that are deteriorated beyond
repair and preservation shall be replaced with similar or like materials
duplicating the original in design and style.
      (2)   The original architectural detail around windows and doors,
storefront and cornice shall be preserved or replaced by replicas of the same
design and materials when deteriorated beyond repair.
      (3)   The masonry of the building shall be maintained, tuckpointed and
properly cleaned when necessary. Mortar joints shall be repointed only when
there is evidence of moisture problems or when sufficient mortar is missing to
allow water to stand in the mortar joint. Original mortar shall be duplicated
in composition, color, texture, joint size and method of application and joint
profile. The masonry shall be cleaned only when necessary to halt deterioration
or to remove stains and shall be done with the gentlest method possible, such
as low pressure water and soft bristle brushes. Abrasive cleaning methods such
as sandblasting shall be avoided and will only cause severe damage by eroding
the protective surface of the masonry. Do not paint masonry surfaces unless
they were previously painted.
   (C)   Cornice, roof and roofing.
      (1)   Cornices are important elements to historic commercial buildings
because they form a visual "cap" on a building, can identify a building, and
contribute to the horizontal alignment of the streetscape. Retain and repair
the existing original cornice. If the cornice is deteriorated beyond repair,
the new cornice should match the original in size, proportion, massing and
materials.
      (2)   The original roof shape shall be retained. Architectural features
that give the roof its essential character, such as its shape, fascia, and the
like shall be retained. Nothing shall be done to change the essential character
of the roof by adding architectural features or roofing materials inappropriate
to the style of building. The roof shall not be stripped of architectural
features important to its character.
   (D)   Mechanical systems.  Required mechanical systems should be placed in
areas that will result in not changing the appearance of the building. Holes
should not be cut through walls in areas that can be seen from the street to
accommodate an air conditioner or other mechanical equipment.
   (E)   Paint colors.
      (1)   Although paint colors are reversible and have no permanent effect
and have usually changed many times throughout the history of a building, they
are important in defining certain architectural styles and their elements. A
paint palette of appropriate and pre-approved colors is available to the
property owner. The palette consists of various colors and groupings and is
developed to assist you in choosing appropriate colors. When applying for a
certificate of appropriateness, the palette will assist you to choose a color
scheme that has already been approved by the Historic Review Board.
      (2)   Repaint with colors commonly in use at the time the building was
constructed. Consider using different shades of the same color when variation
in color is desired. However, there is a danger of the color scheme becoming
too busy.
   (F)   Signage.  Signs should be indicative of the period of the structure.
Spaces of a commercial building where signage was typically placed are the
entablature, pediments or portions of the cornice, the facade area between
floors, window and door glass, and panels hung on the building facade, either
flat or at right angles. Awnings were also used for signage. Some temporary
signs were leaned against the building, stood up on the sidewalk, or were
paraded by sandwich men. A storefront shall not have more than two signs -- one
primary and one secondary. Appropriate signs include flush-mounted wall signs,
window and door signs, transom, painted wall signs, or projecting signs. Signs
should complement and fit in with existing facade in color, composition and
materials. Signs should not cover architectural elements or obscure the display
area.
   (G)   Storefront.  The storefront’s configuration and proportion should be
based on historic documentation or appropriate historic designs relating to the
building facade. A storefront should fit inside the original opening and not
extend beyond it.
   (H)   Windows and doors. The original windows and exterior doors, including
sash, lintels, sills, and hardware, shall be retained or replaced with replicas
of the same design. If new sash and doors must be used they shall replicate the
original design and materials and should retain the original hardware. Original
windows and doors should not be discarded when they can be restored and re-used
in place. New window or door openings that would alter the scale and proportion
of the building as viewed from the street shall not be introduced. Transom
windows may be of clear, beveled, prism, etched or art glass. Avoid adding
shutters unless they appeared on the building in the past. Shutters should
appear operable and be the right length and width to cover a window when
closed. Storm windows should have minimal visual impact on the historic
windows.
(Ord. 13-2000, passed 6-13-00)
§ 156.03 NEW CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   Building materials. Exterior materials used in additions or other new
construction should be compatible in scale, texture, color and other visual
characteristics with the building materials used in the original building or
buildings.
   (B)   Compatibility of exterior design. Additions and new buildings
constructed on the site should be designed to be harmonious in style but
visually different from the existing buildings. Contemporary designs that take
into consideration the surrounding site, building materials, height and
proportion of existing buildings are encouraged. The style of additions or new
construction will develop as a result of implementation of the aforementioned
criteria.
   (C)   Height and proportion.
      (1)   The height and proportion of an addition to the original building
or separate building constructed on the site should be compatible with the
original in regard to facade proportion and window patterns; size, shape and
proportions of entrances and porch projections; and roof forms.
      (2)   Additions or new buildings that would add height or change the
scale and architectural character of the original building should not be
constructed.
(Ord. 13-2000, passed 6-13-00)
§ 156.04 DOWNTOWN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TARGET AREA.
   The following additional requirements apply because the property is located
inside the Downtown Economic Development Target Area:
   (A)   The building front must adjoin the sidewalk across the width of the
building, and there must be a continuous storefront along the sidewalk, except
for traditional piers and recessed entries. Projects that include parking lots
adjacent to the sidewalks do not qualify, subject to the Board’s right to waive
this restriction.
   (B)   Residential uses are encouraged above the street level. Residential
uses are permitted in the rear of ground floor areas, but the first 1,000
square feet from the front of the building is to be reserved for retail or
office space and is not to be residential.
   (C)   Street facades, particularly at the street level, should include
windows, signs and architectural details that can be appreciated by people on
the sidewalks.
   (D)   Historically significant buildings should be preserved. New buildings
should be compatible with these buildings, but not the same style or styles.
(Ord. 13-2000, passed 6-13-00)
§ 156.05 PRESERVATION OBJECTIVE.
   The subject structure and district, exterior features, architectural and
historic character thereof shall be preserved as significant resource(s) of
Bedford according to guidelines set forth above. The properties referred to in
Ordinance No. 13-2000 are identified and designated as part of the Bedford
Courthouse Square Historic District.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 157.001 AUTHORITY; TITLE.
   (A)   This chapter is adopted in accordance with statutory authority granted
to the City of Bedford under "Home Rule" and further is required by Phase II of
the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Stormwater program (40 CFR
Parts 9, 122,123, and 124; December 8,1999) authorized by the 1987 amendments
to the Clean Water Act, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management's
(IDEM) Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) General Permit (MS4 GP), and
the Indiana Department of Environmental Management's Construction Stormwater
General Permit (CSGP). Based on this authority and these requirements, this
chapter regulates:
      (1)   Discharges of prohibited non-stormwater flows into the storm drain
system.
      (2)   Stormwater drainage improvements related to development of lands
located within the corporate boundaries of the city.
      (3)   Drainage control systems installed during new construction and
grading of lots and other parcels of land.
      (4)   Stormwater, including stormwater runoff, snowmelt runoff, and
surface runoff and drainage, associated with construction activity.
      (5)   Stormwater discharges from construction support activities directly
related to construction sites subject to this chapter.
      (6)   Erosion and sediment control systems installed during new
construction and grading of lots and other parcels of land.
      (7)   The design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater drainage
facilities and systems.
      (8)   The design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater quality
facilities and systems.
   (B)   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the City of Bedford
Stormwater Management Ordinance. Once adopted, this chapter will supersede any
conflicting ordinances previously adopted by the city.
(Ord. 6-2024, passed 3-19-24)
§ 157.002 APPLICABILITY; EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   This chapter shall regulate all development and redevelopment
occurring within the city. No building permit shall be issued, and no land
disturbance started for any construction in a development, as defined in §
157.005, until the plans required by this chapter for such construction have
been accepted in writing by the city. With the exception of the requirements of
§§
157.015 through
157.021, single-family dwelling houses and duplexes in accepted subdivisions,
and land-disturbing activities affecting less than one acre of area shall be
exempt from the requirements of this chapter. Also exempt from this chapter
shall be agricultural land-disturbing activities.
   (B)   In addition to the requirements of this chapter, compliance with all
applicable ordinances of the city as well as with applicable federal, State of
Indiana, and other local statues and regulations shall also be required. Unless
otherwise stated, all other specifications referred to in this chapter shall be
the most recent edition available. The city capital improvement projects shall
be exempt from obtaining a permit but are expected to meet all applicable
technical requirements of this chapter. If the project site is located within a
Lawrence County Regulated Drain Watershed, the applicant will need to check
with the Lawrence County Surveyor's Office to learn if additional Surveyor's
Office requirements specific to that regulated drain would apply to the site.
In case there are conflicts between the requirements contained in this chapter
and applicable requirements contained in other regulatory documents referenced
above, the most restrictive shall prevail.
   (C)   Any construction project which has had its final drainage plan
accepted by the city within a two-year period prior to March 19, 2024 shall be
exempt from all requirements of this chapter that are in excess of the
requirements of ordinances in effect at the time of acceptance. Such an
exemption is not applicable to the requirements detailed in §
157.015 through
157.021.
   (D)   The city has the authority to modify, grant exemptions, and/or waive
any and all the requirements of this chapter. A pre-submittal meeting with the
city may be requested by the applicant to discuss the applicability of various
provisions of this chapter with regards to unique or unusual circumstances
relating to a project. However, any initial determination of such applicability
shall not be binding on future determinations of the city that may be based on
the review of more detailed information and plans.
(Ord. 6-2024, passed 3-19-24)
§ 157.003 FINDINGS.
   The city finds that:
   (A)   Water bodies, roadways, structures, and other property within the city
or its planning jurisdiction boundary are at times subjected to flooding;
   (B)   Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is
also a danger to the natural resources of the region;
   (C)   Land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds,
resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, increased flooding,
increased stream channel erosion, and increased sediment transport and
deposition;
   (D)   Soil erosion resulting from land-disturbing activities causes a
significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to be transported off-site
and deposited in ditches, streams, wetlands, lakes, and reservoirs;
   (E)   Increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments and
pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects
within Lawrence County will, absent reasonable regulation and control,
adversely affect the city water bodies and water resources;
   (F)   Pollutant contributions from illicit discharges within the city will,
absent reasonable regulation, monitoring, and enforcement, adversely affect the
city's water bodies and water resources;
   (G)   Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, non-point source pollution, and
illicit sources of pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation
of stormwater management;
   (H)   Adopting the standards, criteria, and procedures contained and
referenced in this chapter and implementing the same will address many of the
deleterious effects of stormwater runoff and illicit discharges;
   (I)   Adopting this chapter is necessary for the preservation of public
health, safety, and welfare, for the conservation of natural resources, and for
compliance with state and federal regulations.
(Ord. 6-2024, passed 3-19-24)
§ 157.004 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the city through the regulation of
stormwater and non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system and to
protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land and water
resources within the city. This chapter establishes methods for managing the
quantity and quality of stormwater entering into the storm drain system. The
objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To reduce the hazard to public health and safety caused by excessive
stormwater runoff.
   (B)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain system
from construction site runoff.
   (C)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain system
from runoff from new development and re-development.
   (D)   To prohibit illicit discharges into the storm drain system.
   (E)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, monitoring,
and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.

§ 157.021 INSPECTIONS AND MONITORING.
   (A)   Storm drainage system. The city has the authority to periodically
inspect the portion of the storm drainage system under the city's control, in
an effort to detect and eliminate illicit connections and discharges into the
system. This inspection will include a screening of discharges from outfalls
connected to the system in order to determine if prohibited flows are being
conveyed into the storm drainage system, it could also include spot testing of
waters contained in the storm drainage system itself to detect the introduction
of pollutants into the system by means other than a defined outfall, such as
dumping or contaminated sheet runoff.
   (B)   Potential polluters. If, as a result of the storm drainage system
inspection, a discharger is suspected of an illicit discharge, the city may
inspect and/or obtain stormwater samples from stormwater runoff facilities of
the subject discharger, to determine compliance with the requirements of this
chapter. Upon request, the discharger shall allow the city's properly
identified representative to enter upon the premises of the discharger at all
hours necessary for the purposes of such inspection or sampling. The city's or
its properly identified representative may place on the discharger's property
the equipment or devices used for such sampling or inspection. Identified
illicit connections or discharges shall be subject to enforcement action as
described in §
157.101 through
157.104 and
157.999 .
   (C)   New development and re-development. Following the final completion of
construction and the receipt of as-built drawings by the city, the city has the
authority to inspect new development and re-development sites to verify that
all on-site stormwater conveyances and connections to the storm drainage system
are in compliance with this subchapter.

STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT
§ 157.035 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   The storage and controlled release of excess stormwater runoff shall be
required for all new business, institutional developments, commercial and
industrial developments, residential subdivisions, planned development, rural
estate subdivisions, and any redevelopment or other new construction located
within the city. The city, after thorough investigation and evaluation, may
waive the requirement of controlled runoff for minor subdivisions and
parcelization. Additional potential exemptions regarding the detention
requirements are provided under §
157.036.
(Ord. 6-2024, passed 3-19-24) Penalty, see §
157.999
§ 157.036 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that most streams and drainage channels serving the
city do not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey stormwater runoff
resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, the storage and controlled
release of excess stormwater runoff as well as compensation for loss of
floodplain storage shall be required for all developments and redevelopments
(as defined in §
157.005) located within the city.
   (B)   Due to unknowns regarding the future development patterns and the
associated proposed stormwater quantity management systems within a watershed,
it is the policy of the city to discourage direct release of runoff from a new
development or redevelopment without providing detention. However, in rare
circumstances, where a comprehensive watershed-wide hydrologic study or
watershed plan of a major stream (not a "beat the peak" analysis) adopted by
the city substantiates the benefits of (or allows for) direct release for a
proposed development located adjacent to a major stream, the detention
requirements set in this chapter may be waived. Other special circumstances
when such a waiver may be considered by the city include situations where the
design of a regional pond has already taken into account the provision of
direct release in certain areas in the watershed.

157.999
§ 157.056 POLICY ON STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION.
   (A)   Effective stormwater pollution prevention on construction sites is
dependent on a combination of preventing movement of soil from its original
position (erosion control), intercepting displaced soil prior to entering a
waterbody (sediment control), and proper on-site materials handling.
   (B)   For land disturbance of one acre or more, the developer must submit to
the city, a SWPPP with detailed erosion and sediment control plans as well as a
narrative describing materials handling and storage, and construction
sequencing. The SWPPP and the project management log must be retained for at
least three years from the date the project permit is terminated.

§ 157.057 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   In calculating the total area of land disturbance, for the purposes of
determining applicability of this subchapter to a project, the following
guidelines should be used:
      (1)   Off-site construction activities that provide services (for
example, road extensions, sewer, water, offsite stockpiles, and other
utilities) to a land disturbing project site, must be considered as a part of
the total land disturbance calculation for the project site, when the activity
is under the control of the project site owner.
      (2)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by this
subchapter, the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the
total area of land disturbance for improvements, such as, roads, utilities, or
common areas, and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as
determined by the following:
         (a)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
one-half acre or more, one-half acre of land disturbance must be used as the
expected lot disturbance.
         (b)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
less than one-half acre in size, the total lot must be calculated as being
disturbed.
         (c)   To calculate lot disturbance on all other types of project
sites, such as industrial and commercial projects project sites, a minimum of
one acre of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance,
unless the lots are less than one acre in size, in which case the total lot
must be calculated as being disturbed.
   (B)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction sites shall meet
the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the Indiana
Storm Water Quality Manual and the product guidance/specifications of the
manufacturer. The methods and procedures included in these two references are
in keeping with the above stated policy and meet the requirements of the IDEM's
CSGP. A copy of the Indiana Storm Water Quality Manual may be obtained online
through IDEM.
   (C)   The design requirements that would apply to all land-disturbing
activities and shall be considered in the selection, design, and implementation
of all stormwater quality and management measures contained in the SWPPP are
contained in the refer to the latest edition of the Indiana LTAP Stormwater
Drainage Manual.

inspections of the site to ensure full compliance with the provisions of this
section, the approved stormwater pollution prevention plan, the Indiana Storm
Water Quality Manual, and the terms and conditions of the approved permit.
   (B)   A self-monitoring program (SMP) must be implemented by the project
site owner to ensure the stormwater pollution prevention plan is working
effectively. A trained individual, acceptable to the city, shall monitor and
manage project construction and stormwater activities. Details regarding the
required monitoring activities are contained in the Indiana Storm Water Quality
Manual.
   (C)   The stormwater pollution prevention plan shall serve as a guideline
for stormwater quality but should not be interpreted to be the only basis for
implementation of stormwater quality measures for a project site. The project
site owner is responsible for implementing, in accordance with this section,
all measures necessary to adequately prevent polluted stormwater runoff.

the city as part of the stormwater management permit application, must also
include post-construction stormwater quality measures. These measures are
incorporated as a permanent feature into the site plan and are left in place
following completion of construction activities to continuously treat
stormwater runoff from the stabilized site. Any project located within the
corporate boundaries of the city that includes clearing, grading, excavation,
and other land disturbing activities, resulting in the disturbance of one acre
or more of total land area is subject to the requirements of this subchapter.
This includes both new development and redevelopment, and disturbances of land
less than one acre square feet of total land area that are part of a larger
common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately
disturb one acre or more of total land area. In addition, regardless of the
amount of disturbance, the city reserves the right to require pretreatment BMPs
for proposed hot spot developments in accordance with provisions contained in
the Indiana Quality Storm Water Manual.
   (B)   The requirements under this subchapter do not apply to the following

§ 157.071 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to undeveloped
areas, generally have increased imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates,
increased runoff rates, and increased concentrations of pollutants such as
fertilizers, herbicides, greases, oil, salts and other pollutants. As new
development and redevelopment continues within the corporate boundaries of the
city, measures must be taken to intercept and filter pollutants from stormwater
runoff prior to reaching regional creeks, streams, and rivers. Through the use
of appropriate Best Management Practices (BMPs), stormwater runoff will be
filtered and harmful amounts of sediment, nutrients, and contaminants will be
removed.
   (B)   The project site owner must submit to the city a stormwater pollution
prevention plan (SWPPP) that shows placement of appropriate BMP(s) from a pre-
approved list of BMPs specified in the Indiana Quality Storm Water Manual. The
SWPPP submittal shall include an Operation and Maintenance Manual for all post-
construction BMP(s) included in the project and a notarized Maintenance
Agreement, consistent with the sample agreement provided in the Indiana Quality
Storm Water Manual, providing for the long-term maintenance of those BMPs, both
of which shall be recorded with the deed for the property on which the project
is located. The noted BMP(s) must be designed, constructed, and maintained
according to guidelines provided or referenced in the Indiana Storm Water
Quality Manual. Practices other than those specified in the pre-approved list
may be utilized. However, the burden of proof, as to whether the performance
and ease of maintenance of such practices will be according to guidelines
provided in the Indiana Quality Storm Water Manual, would be placed with the
applicant. Details regarding the procedures and criteria for consideration of
acceptance of such BMPs are provided in the Indiana Storm Water Quality Manual.
   (C)   Gasoline outlets and refueling areas must install appropriate
practices to reduce lead, copper, zinc, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in
stormwater runoff. These requirements will apply to all new facilities and
existing facilities that replace their tanks, regardless of the size of the
facility.
   (D)   Discharges from new development and redevelopment sites will not be
allowed directly into karst features without pre-treatment.

§ 157.086 PERMIT PROCEDURES.
   This section applies to all development, or re-development of land, that
results in land disturbance of one acre or more. Figure 1 is a flowchart
summarizing the plan review/permit approval/project termination compliance
process for land disturbance of one acre or more and can be found at the end of
§
157.093.
   (A)   General procedures.
      (1)   The project site owner shall submit an application for a stormwater
management permit to the city. The application will include a completed
application checklist, construction plan sheets, a stormwater drainage
technical report, a stormwater pollution prevention plan, and any other
necessary support information. Specific information to be included in the
application can be found in §
157.087. One copy of each application must be submitted to the city.
Additionally, a digital copy of the construction plans is required in a format
accepted by the city.
      (2)   After the city’s receipt of the application, the applicant will be
notified as to whether their application was complete or insufficient. The
number of copies required as part of the stormwater management applicant will
be asked for additional information if the application is insufficient. If the
application is complete, it will be reviewed in detail by the city and/or its
plan review consultant(s). Once all comments have been received and review
completed, the city will either approve the project, request modifications or
deny the project. If the applicant does not agree with or accept the review
findings and wishes to seek an appeal, the city will place the project on the
agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the city Board of Works and
Safety, provided the agenda for the meeting has not yet been advertised or
published. If time for notification does not allow, the project shall be placed
on the following regularly scheduled meeting of the city Board of Works and
Safety. If the project must go through a scheduled meeting, the city will
furnish the applicant a complete list of comments and objections to the plans
and accompanying data prior to the scheduled meeting. After the scheduled
meeting, the city will either issue a permit, request modifications to the
construction plans, or deny the project.
      (3)   The project site owner must notify the city and IDEM before
beginning construction. Notification to the city shall be in the form of an
email and phone call while the notification to IDEM shall be in the form of an
online IDEM NOI submittal. Once a permit has been issued and the pending
construction notifications submitted to the city and IDEM before the beginning
of construction, construction may commence. Once construction starts, the
project owner shall monitor construction activities and inspect all stormwater
pollution prevention measures in compliance with this chapter and the terms and
conditions of the approved permit. Upon completion of construction activities,
a certification of completion and compliance and as built plans must be
submitted to the city. Once the construction site has been stabilized and all
temporary erosion and sediment control measures have been removed, a
notification shall be sent to the city, requesting a termination inspection.
The city, or its representative, shall inspect the construction site to verify
that the completed project is fully stabilized and meets the requirements of
the city's storm water ordinance and that the terms and conditions of the
permit. Once the applicant receives a signed copy of the termination inspection
checklist confirming compliance, they must forward a copy to IDEM along with
the required IDEM NOT form. Permits issued by the city under this scenario will
expire five years from the date of issuance. If construction is not completed
within five years, an updated permit application must be submitted to the city
and an updated NOI must be resubmitted to IDEM at least 90 days prior to
expiration.
   (B)   SWPPP review time limits.
      (1)   Pursuant to I.C. 13-18-27, an MS4-designated entity or other review
authority such as SWCD must make a preliminary determination as to whether the
construction plan associated with SWPPP is substantially complete before the
end of the tenth working day after the day on which the construction plan
associated with SWPPP is submitted to the review authority, in the case of a
less than five acres construction activity site or the fourteenth working day
after the day on which the construction plan associated with SWPPP is submitted
to the review authority, in the case of a five acres or larger construction
activity site. Depending on the outcome of the SWPPP review, the following
scenarios may play out:
         (a)   No SWPPP review notification received. If the review authority
does not notify of its preliminary determination as to whether the construction
plan is substantially complete within either ten or 14 days as noted above, the
project site owner may submit a notice of intent letter to IDEM including the
information required by this chapter and the city, and after submission of the
notice of intent letter to IDEM, may begin the construction project, including
the land disturbing activities of the construction project.
         (b)   SWPPP not substantially complete. If the review authority
notifies the construction not substantially complete, the project site owner
may not submit a notice intent letter to IDEM until the review authority makes
a conclusive favorable determination concerning the construction plan under
this chapter and the city.
         (c)   Unfavorable SWPPP. If the review authority notifies the
construction plan is substantially complete; and makes a conclusive unfavorable
determination concerning the construction plan under this chapter; the land
disturbing activities of the construction project must stop when the review
authority notifies the project site owner of the review authority's conclusive
unfavorable determination concerning the construction plan.
      (2)   Note that the above time limits only apply to the SWPPP portion of
the overall stormwater permit submittal and does not affect any official or
non-official permit review timelines set by the entity for other aspects of the
stormwater permit application.

§ 157.090 REQUIRED ASSURANCES.
   As a condition of approval and issuance of the permit, the city shall
require the applicant to provide assurance in form of an irrevocable letter of
credit or a bond when the stormwater management plan has been accepted and
before construction begins. The assurance will guarantee a good faith execution
of the stormwater drainage plan, the stormwater pollution prevention plan, the
stormwater quality management plan, and any permit. The assurance shall be for
an amount equal to 110% of the total costs of all stormwater management
measures for the entire project. The abovementioned costs shall be based on an
estimate as prepared by a registered engineer or land surveyor. The costs shall
be for the installation and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of erosion
control measures and the construction and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of
storm drainage infrastructure, detention/retention facilities, and stormwater
quality BMPs, as regulated under this chapter, until the construction is
completed, the site is stabilized, and as built plans are accepted by the city.
Assurances shall be for a minimum of $5,000. All other performance bonds,
maintenance bonds or other assurances required by the city in accordance with
any and all other ordinances shall also apply and so be required. Local govern
mental jurisdictions may require additional performance and/or maintenance
assurances. The intent of this assurance is not only to complete the
installation of storm drain infrastructure for the project, but also to assure
that adequate stormwater pollution prevention measures are properly installed
and maintained. If adequate assurances are set aside by the project site owner
for the overall project, proof of total assurance can be submitted in place of
an individual stormwater assurance.
(Ord. 6-2024, passed 3-19-24) Penalty, see §
157.999
§ 157.091 TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PERMITS.
   (A)   In granting a stormwater management permit, the city may impose such
terms and conditions as are reasonably necessary to meet the purposes of this
chapter. The project site owner shall ensure compliance with such terms and
conditions. Non-compliance with the terms and conditions of permits will be
subject to enforcement as described in §§
157.101 through
157.104 and
157.999.
   (B)   The project site owner shall inform all general contractor,
construction management firms, grading or excavating contractors, utility
contractors, and the contractors that have primary oversight on individual
building lots of the terms and conditions of the storm water management permit
and the schedule for proposed implementation.
   (C)   In the event that a project site is determined to impact or discharge
to a sensitive area or is located in an impact drainage area, the city may
require more stringent stormwater quantity and quality measures than detailed
in this chapter or in the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual.
   (D)   Determination of sensitive areas. Sensitive areas include highly
erodible soils, wetlands, karst areas, threatened or endangered species
habitat, outstanding waters, impaired waters, recreational waters, and surface
drinking water sources. Any discharge from a stormwater practice that is a
Class V injection well shall meet the Indiana groundwater quality standards and
registered with US EPA as required by the IDEM. If wetlands are suspected on a
site, a wetland delineation should be completed in accordance with the
methodology established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE). The need for
the applicant to check for the presence of threatened or endangered species
habitat will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Special terms and
conditions for development determined to impact or discharge to any sensitive
area shall be included in the stormwater management permit.
   (E)   Determination of impact drainage areas.
      (1)   The following areas shall be designated as impact drainage areas,
unless good reason for not including them is presented to the city.
         (a)   A floodway or floodplain as designated by the most updated FEMA
Code dealing with floodplain regulation and/or by the Best Available Data
through IDNR.
         (b)   Land within 25 feet of each bank of any ditch within the city's
system.
         (c)   Land within 15 feet of the centerline of any stormwater
infrastructure or enclosed conduit within the city's system.

         (e)   Land within 50 feet of a natural drainageway.
         (f)   Land within 75 feet of the centerline of any tiled regulated
drain.
      (2)   The city or a city contracted engineer is authorized, but is not
required, to classify certain geographical areas as impact drainage areas. In
determining impact drainage areas, the city may consider such factors as
topography, soil type, capacity of existing drains, and distance from adequate
drainage facility.
      (3)   Land that does not have an adequate outlet, taking into
consideration the capacity and depth of the outlet, may be designated as an
impact drainage area by the city. Special terms and conditions for development
within any impact drainage area shall be included in the stormwater management
permit.
   (F)   Determination of designated drainage areas served by regional
facilities. The city is authorized, but is not required, to classify certain
geographical areas as designated drainage areas that are or will be served by
regional facilities, such as a regional pond. In such cases, an infrastructure
development fee (IDF) rate may be established for the designated drainage area.

§ 157.093 POST-PROJECT MAINTENANCE BOND AND VERIFICATIONS.
   (A)   In addition to as-built plans and the certification of completion and
compliance, following the release of performance assurances, the property
owner, developer, or contractor shall be required to file a two-year
maintenance bond or other acceptable guarantee with the city in an amount not
to exceed 25% of the cost of the stormwater management system located outside
the public road rights-of-way, and in a form satisfactory to the city in order
to assure that such stormwater system installation was done according to
standards of good workmanship, that the materials used in the construction and
installation were of good quality and construction, and that such project was
done in accordance with the accepted plans, and this chapter and that any off-
site drainage problems that may arise, whether upstream or downstream of such
project, will be corrected if such drainage problems are determined by the city
to have been caused by the development of such project. The bond or other
acceptable guarantee shall be in effect for a period of two years after the
date of the release of required performance assurances referenced in §
157.090. The beneficiary of all maintenance bonds shall be the Board of Works
and Safety of the city.
   (B)   To verify that all stormwater infrastructure is functioning properly,
visual recordings (via closed circuit television) of such infrastructure,
including all subsurface drains, shall be required twice, once following the
completion of installation of the stormwater management system and submittal of
as-builts, and the second time before release of maintenance bonds. These
visual recordings will be scheduled by the city and paid for by the developer.
Notices shall be provided to the city within 72 hours following the completion
of installation and again at least 60 days prior to the expiration date of the
maintenance bond so that the noted recordings may be scheduled. Reports
summarizing the results of the noted visual recordings shall be reviewed and

COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 157.101 COMPLIANCE WITH THIS CHAPTER.
   In addition to the requirements of this chapter, compliance with the
requirements set forth in the local zoning ordinances is also necessary.
Compliance with all applicable ordinances of the city as well as with
applicable State of Indiana statues and regulations shall also be required.
Unless otherwise stated, all other specifications referred to in this chapter
shall be the most recent edition available. Violations of the requirements of
this chapter are subject to the penalties listed below.
   (A)   Violations. Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of
this chapter, the requirements of an approved stormwater management design plan
or permit, and/or the requirements of a recorded stormwater maintenance
agreement may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this subchapter
and §
157.999. Any such action or inaction is deemed to be a public nuisance and may
be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of any of the
penalties described below shall not prevent such equitable relief.
   (B)   Warning notice. When the city finds that any person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued
hereunder, the city may serve upon that person a written warning notice,
specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting
the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution
whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of
the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the alleged
violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of
the warning notice. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
city to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement
action, without first issuing a warning notice.
(Ord. 6-2024, passed 3-19-24) Penalty, see §
157.999
§ 157.102 ENFORCEMENT OF THIS CHAPTER.
   (A)   Notice of violation/citation.
      (1)   If the city of Bedford determines that an applicant or other
responsible person has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a
permit, an approved stormwater management design plan, a recorded stormwater
management maintenance agreement, or the provisions of this chapter, it shall
issue a written notice of violation to such applicant or other responsible
person and the owner of the property. Where a person is engaged in activity
covered by this chapter without having first secured a permit therefor, the
notice of violation shall be served on the owner or the responsible person in
charge of the activity being conducted on the site.
      (2)   The city Storm Water Coordinator, Planning and Zoning Director,
Building Inspector or other city authorized storm water inspector is authorized
to issue municipal civil infraction citations to any person alleged to be
violating any provision of this chapter. The notice of violation can be in the
form of a citation ticket and/or a written letter that would contain detailed
inspection findings, conclusions of law, disposition of warning or fines
assessed, stipulated remedial actions as discussed with the responsible party
representative, reasonable deadlines for those remedial actions, and the date
of re-inspection.
   (B)   Compensatory action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties,
and remedies authorized by this chapter, the city may impose upon a violator
alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at
compliance workshops, creek cleanup, public education, and the like.
   (C)   Stop work order.
      (1)   In addition to the penalties listed in §
157.999 (A), if land disturbance activities are conducted contrary to the
provisions of this chapter or accepted final stormwater management plans, the
city may order the work stopped by notice in writing served on any person
engaged in the doing or causing of such work to be done, and any such persons
shall forthwith stop such work until authorized by the city to proceed with the
work. A stop work order will be posted on the site by the city, and it is
unlawful for any person to remove the notice or continue any work on the site
without permission from the city. The city may also undertake or cause to be
undertaken, any necessary or advisable protective measures to prevent
violations of this chapter or to avoid or reduce the effects of noncompliance
herewith. The cost of any such protective measures shall be the responsibility
of the owner of the property upon which the work is being done and the
responsibility of any person carrying out or participating in the work.
      (2)   For construction projects that are operating under a SWPPP approved
by the city, if a stop work order is issued on the grounds that the erosion and
sediment control measures included in the construction plan are not adequate,
the project site owner must be notified in writing of the inadequacies in the
erosion and sediment control measures and the project site owner has 72 hours
after receiving written notice to resolve the identified inadequacies before
the stop work order can take effect.
      (3)   The 72-hour period to resolve identified inadequacies on a
construction project does not apply if the stop work order is issued to a
construction project where the project site owner is creating a public health
hazard or safety hazard.
   (D)   Withhold certificate of occupancy. The city may refuse to issue a
certificate of occupancy for the building or other improvements constructed or
being constructed on the site until the applicant or other responsible person
has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has
otherwise satisfied the requirements of this chapter as determined by the city.
   (E)   Suspension, revocation, or modification of permits. The city may
suspend, revoke, or modify any existing permit that the violator may also have
been previously granted. A suspended, revoked, or modified permit may be
reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the
remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured
the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated upon
such conditions as the city may deem necessary to enable the applicant or other
responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such
violations.
   (F)   Suspension of access to the stormwater drainage system.
      (1)   Emergency cease and desist orders.
         (a)   When the city finds that any person has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or
that the person's past violations are likely to recur, and that the person's
violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened
discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to
present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or to the environment, the city may issue an order to the violator
directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing
the violator to immediately comply with all chapter requirements and take such
appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing
or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or
terminating the discharge.
         (b)   Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under
this division (F)(1) shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its
endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately
comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the city may take such steps as
deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the stormwater drainage system
or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to persons or to the
environment, including immediate termination of a facility's water supply,
sewer connection, or other municipal utility services.
         (c)   The city may allow the person to recommence its discharge when
it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated
against the discharger under this chapter. A person that is responsible, in
whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall
submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful
discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city
within five days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency
cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the violator.
      (2)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The
city may, without prior notice, suspend stormwater drainage system discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
stormwater drainage system or waters of the state if the violator fails to
comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the city may take such
steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the stormwater
drainage system or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to persons.
      (3)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the stormwater drainage system in violation of this chapter may
have their stormwater drainage system access terminated if such termination
would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The city will notify a violator of
the proposed termination of its stormwater drainage system access. The violator
may petition the city for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an
offense if the person reinstates stormwater drainage system access to premises
terminated pursuant to this division (F)(3), without the prior approval of the
city.

157.999
§ 157.103 COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION.
   (A)   In addition to any other remedies, should any owner fail to comply
with the provisions of this chapter, the city may, after giving notice and
opportunity for compliance, have the necessary work done, and the owner shall
be required to promptly reimburse the city for all costs of such work.
   (B)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other
lawful action as may be necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. All costs
connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. Costs
include, but are not limited to, repairs to the stormwater drainage system made
necessary by the violation, as well as those penalties levied by the EPA or
IDEM for violation of the city's NPDES permit, administrative costs, attorney
fees, court costs, and other costs and expenses associated with the enforcement
of this chapter, including sampling and monitoring expenses.
   (C)   If the amount due for abatement of the violation is not paid within a
timely manner as determined by the decision of the city or by the expiration of
the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special
assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for
the amount of the assessment.

§ 157.104 APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeal of notice of violation. Any person to whom any provision of
this chapter has been applied may appeal in writing, not later than 30 days
after the action or decision being appealed from, to the appropriate board of
the city the action or decision whereby any such provision was so applied. Such
appeal shall identify the matter being appealed, and the basis for the appeal.
The appropriate board of the city shall consider the appeal and make a decision
whereby it affirms, rejects or modifies the action being appealed, in
considering any such appeal, the appropriate board of the city may consider the
recommendations of the city staff and the comments of other persons having
knowledge of the matter. In considering any such appeal, the appropriate board
may grant a variance from the terms of this chapter to provide relief, in whole
or in part, from the action being appealed, but only upon finding that the
following requirements are satisfied:
      (1)   The application of the chapter provisions being appealed will
present or cause practical difficulties for a development or development site;
provided, however, that practical difficulties shall not include the need for
