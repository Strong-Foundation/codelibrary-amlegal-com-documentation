purposes of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of

§ 30.04 COMMUNITY SERVICES PLAN.
   The early intervention plan, as submitted by the Early Intervention Team, is
as follows:
   Early Invention Plan
   The purpose of this document is to establish a community services plan for
early intervention to provide services to adjudicated delinquents, alleged
delinquents, or children identified to be at risk of becoming delinquents or
children in need of services in Bartholomew County, Indiana.
   The Early Intervention Team consisted of: Juvenile Referee Jim Holland,
Chief Probation Officer, Victor Parker, Child Welfare Supervisor, Helen
Jackson, Bill Barton representing Bartholomew Consolidated School Corporation,
Amy Keller representing Flat Rock-Hawcreek School Corporation, Eugene Eckrote
and Joe Bill Whipker representing the Bartholomew County Council, Cindy Helmich
representing Step Ahead,(Shirley Arney representing Quinco Community Health
Center, Therese Farley, CASA director, and County Director Keith Weedman,
(Hereafter, referred to as “the team”).
   The team reviewed and considered existing publicly and privately funded
programs that are available or that could be made available in the county to
provide supportive services to or for the benefit of children above described
without removing the children from the family home.
   The programs reviewed were:
      After care services
      Alcohol and drug education program
      Alternative education programming
      Anger management
      CASA and GAL services
      Case management services
      Community Based Family Resource
      Community service work
      Crisis intervention services
      Custody home studies
      Day treatment services
      Detention services
      Developmental services
      Diagnostic and evaluation services
      Domestic Violence Prevention and Treatment Fund
      Emergency shelter care services
      Family Planning of Central and Southern Indiana
      Family Services of Bartholomew Co.
      First Steps Program
      Flat Rock-Hawcreek Family Center
      Head Start
      Healthy Families Program
      Home based services
      Home based services funded through Medicaid Rehabilitation Option
      Homemaker services
      House arrest
      Independent living skills training
      Job search and job retention services
      Local Prevention Services Coalitions
      Mentoring
      Out patient counseling services
      Parent/child interactions
      Parenting classes
      Preventative care services
      Recreational activities
      Respite care
      Sexual Offense Services Prevention grant
      Short term emergency psychiatric care
      Study groups
      Supervised visitation
      Teen Court
      Work crew
      Youth Challenge Program
      Youth Services Bureau
   The objectives of the plan are:
      1.   Promoting the welfare of children and self sufficiency of families,
with children at risk of abuse or neglect, dependency, or delinquency;
      2.   Preventing or reducing the number of cases of child abuse,
delinquency, or neglect that may require juvenile court intervention;
      3.   Coordinating available resources to promote efficiency and avoid
duplication of programs and services;
      4.   Reducing or minimizing the cost of providing services to children
and families with children who are or may become delinquent children; and
      5.   Reducing or eliminating to the extent possible the need to remove
children from their parents, guardians, or custodians for foster home care or
institutional placement.
   The team shall meet, at least, annually.
   The team recommends the following:
      1.   The Step Ahead Council must take a leading role in coordinating the
community’s efforts to intervene earlier in the lives of children at risk. The
council could possibly become a clearing house, or establish one, concerning
services to children. The council should encourage agencies to come together to
address the community’s needs. Cooperation between ail agencies affecting
children must be encouraged. Whenever possible, eliminate duplicity of services
and case managers.
      2.   There should be a coordinated community effort to follow up on
referrals made to the Bartholomew County Office of Family and Children (OFC)
and the Probation Department when they do not become formally involved with the
child because of unsubstantiated abuse, neglect or delinquency. The Probation
Department and OFC should make referrals to other agencies and programs in the
community at en early stage in the child's fife rather than waiting for the
problems to escalate.
      3.   We support the efforts of the Bartholomew Consolidated School
Corporation and Flatrock Hawcreek School Corporation to design a program to
address non attendance issues in the community. Bartholomew County needs one
(1) or more full time attendance officers to cooperate with law enforcement and
other agencies to keep children in school.
      4.   The Bartholomew County Office of Family and Children and Probation
Department should work closely with other community agencies.
      5.   The Bartholomew County Department of Public Health needs to be
responsive to issues involving children when requested.
      6.   First Call for Help should be incorporated into early Intervention
efforts.
      7.   Wise use of fiscal resources should always be an underlying theme in
all efforts made toward early intervention.

state code to not make property information associated with a home address
accessible by means of removing the link between name and parcel information.
      (2)   The county may not be held liable for failure to timely restrict
disclosure of an address under this chapter unless the county's act or omission
constitutes gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct.
   (F)   Reversal of privacy settings.
      (1)   The public access of removed information can only be done at the
request of the original covered person. Per the state code, an individual may
request reinstatement of their excluded information.
      (2)   Should any changes to the title of a covered parcel be made, the
existing residence will be removed from the list of confidential properties. A
new request will need to be made in order to have the parcel covered again.
   (G)   Confidentiality. All requests made to the Auditor's Office by a
covered person are confidential.
   (H)   Excluded properties. This policy is in effect for requestor's primary
residence only per I.C. 36-1-8.5-7. If the requestor owns or is involved in
additional properties that utilize the primary home address as the mailing
address, they will be displayed. If the requestor wishes to have those
addresses removed as well, the $50 fee will apply to each submission.

internet access and disclosure of electronic mail messages sent or received by
county employees with use of the county e-mail system.
      (2)   The county respects the individual privacy of its employees;
however, employee privacy does not extend to the employees’ work-related
conduct or to the use of county-provided equipment, services or supplies.
County personnel and employees should be aware that the following guidelines
may affect their privacy in the workplace.
   (B)   Provision of internet access. As a condition of providing internet
access to its personnel and employees, the county places certain restrictions
on workplace use of the internet. The county encourages appropriate employee
use of the internet as follows:
      (1)   To communicate with fellow employees and clients regarding matters
within an employee’s assigned duties;
      (2)   To acquire information related to, or design to facilitate the
performance of regular assigned duties; and
      (3)   To facilitate performance of any task or project in a manner
approved by an employee’s supervisor or department head.

uses any service provided by the county, it should be for county business
related activity.

systems may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections and should be
treated like other shared filing systems. All system password and encryption
keys must be available to the county management, and your passwords or
encryption keys must be available to your supervisor and department head.
Failure, upon request of the employee’s supervisor or department head, to
promptly make available system password and encryption keys shall subject the
employee to discipline up to and including discharge.
      (3)   All e-mail messages are county records. The contents of e-mail,
properly obtained for legitimate purposes, may be disclosed within the county
without your permission. You should not assume that messages are confidential.
Backup copies of e-mail may be maintained and referenced for business and legal
reasons.
   (F)   Personal use of e-mail.
      (1)   Because the county provides the electronic mail system to assist
personnel and employees in the performance of their job, the electronic mail
system should be used only for official county business.
      (2)   Incidental and occasional personal use of e-mail is permitted by
the county, but these messages will be treated the same as other messages.
      (3)   The county reserves the right to access and disclose, as necessary,
all messages sent over its e-mail system, without regard to content.

prohibited from the unauthorized use of the passwords and encryption keys of
other employees to gain access to the other employee’s e-mail messages.
   (H)   Downloading of software. Due to risk of virus, copyright and license
violation, downloading or installation of any materials or programs from the
internet or any other sources other than the County Information Services
Department is not permitted. If any applications or materials are desired to be
installed onto any county computer system, it must be evaluated and installed
by a member of the County Information Services Department.
   (I)   Waiver of privacy.
      (1)   The county has the right, but not the duty, to monitor any and all
aspects of its computer system, including, but not limited to, monitoring sites
employees visit on the internet, reviewing material downloaded or uploaded by
employees and reviewing e-mails sent and received by employees.
      (2)   Employees waive any right to privacy in anything they create,
store, send or receive on the computer or the internet.
   (J)   Amendments. This policy may be amended or revised from time to time.

policy.

OPERATION AND USE OF COUNTY-OWNED VEHICLES
§ 33.080 MARKING COUNTY-OWNED VEHICLES.
   (A)   On all vehicles of any kind which are owned by the county and which
are normally operated on public streets and highways, the words “Bartholomew
County”, the name of the department or agency normally using the vehicle, and
the words “For Official Use Only” shall be conspicuously imprinted or affixed.
This provision shall not apply to Sheriff’s Department, fire or other emergency
vehicles which because of sirens, emergency lights, departmental decals or
other devices are clearly marked as such. This provision also does not apply to
unmarked vehicles which have been officially designated by the County Sheriff
for use in law enforcement functions.
   (B)   It is the intent of the Board of Commissioners that all county-owned
vehicles will be marked in a distinctive manner that, by reason of their
nature, they will not be susceptible to personal use; that they will qualify as
“qualified nonpersonal use vehicles” for purposes of § 274 of the Internal
Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended; and that they will be exempt from
the substantiation requirements of § 274.
(Prior Code, § 2-496) (Res. 1992-03, passed 4-13-1992)
Statutory reference:
   Mileage allowance for certain county officials, see I.C. 36-2-7-3 and 36-2-

§ 33.081 PROHIBITION ON PERSONAL USE.
   No employee, agent or official of the county shall use any county-owned
vehicle for any personal, non-business purpose (other than de minimis use, such
as stopping for a meal between business functions). Except as specifically
provided in these rules, when a county-owned vehicle is not being used for
business purposes, it must be kept on county premises at a location designated
by the county official or department head normally responsible for controlling
the use of the vehicle unless the vehicle is temporarily located elsewhere for
repairs. As stated in §
33.080, the Board of Commissioners believes that, because of the distinctive
markings required under §
33.080, county-owned vehicles will not be susceptible to personal use and it is
highly unlikely that the personal use will occur.
(Prior Code, § 2-497) (Res. 1992-03, passed 4-13-1992)
§ 33.082 CERTAIN EMPLOYEES PERMITTED TO TAKE VEHICLES TO THEIR RESIDENCES.
   (A)   The Board of Commissioners may specifically authorize and require an
employee to take a county-owned vehicle to his or her residence when the
employee is not working if it is determined that the employee must have the
vehicle available in order to immediately respond from his or her residence to
emergency situations involving his or her job duties.
   (B)   In such cases, once the vehicle is taken to the employee’s residence,
the employee may not use the vehicle for personal purposes. It is the intent of
the Board of Commissioners that any use of a county-owned vehicle authorized
under this section shall be considered a bona fide business requirement of the
county and, therefore, any value to the employee attributable to the use shall
be excludable from the employee’s income as a “working condition fringe
benefit” under the provisions of § 132(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, as now
or hereafter amended.
(Prior Code, § 2-498) (Res. 1992-03, passed 4-13-1992)
§ 33.083 USE OF SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT VEHICLES BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS
DURING NON-WORKING HOURS.
   (A)   Any law enforcement officer employed by the County Sheriff’s
Department may be assigned the use of a Departmental vehicle from time to time
by the County Sheriff and may be permitted by him or her to take the assigned
vehicle to his or her home when the employee is not on his or her regular
shift. This will enable the off-duty law enforcement officer to immediately
respond from his or her residence to emergency situations requiring a law
enforcement officer. The Board of Commissioners recognizes that law enforcement
officers do not work 24 hours a day, but it also recognizes that a law
enforcement officer has arrest powers and a duty to enforce the laws even when
not working his or her regular shift. Thus, the county’s interest in law
enforcement is served whenever a law enforcement officer is traveling the
public streets and highways if the officer, under departmental regulations,
still has the authority to make arrests. Therefore, the County Sheriff may
adopt rules whereby law enforcement officers employed by the Sheriff’s
Department may be permitted to use department vehicles to travel within the
county, even though the employees are not on their regular shifts if, under
Departmental regulations, the employees still have the authority to make
arrests.
   (B)   The rules, if adopted, shall contain the following conditions.
      (1)   The police radio must be turned on and at an audible level so the
operating officer can hear it at all times.
      (2)   While off duty, the officer must respond to emergency calls or
complaints if he or she is in the general vicinity.
      (3)   If the officer is responding to a life-threatening situation, he or
she must use due caution and remove all non-police personnel from the vehicle
at the earliest convenient moment.
      (4)   Off-duty use of any department vehicle will be restricted to any of
the contiguous counties surrounding the county. These are Jackson, Brown,
Johnson, Shelby, Decatur and Jennings Counties. Use of any Department vehicle
outside of these counties will be authorized on an individual basis and
approved by the Sheriff or his or her designee.
      (5)   A designee is any officer who holds the rank of sergeant or above.
It will be the responsibility of that officer to notify the Sheriff in a timely
manner either in writing or verbally of the out-of-contiguous county use.
      (6)   If the officer uses the vehicle out of the contiguous county area
and needs fuel, it will be the responsibility of that officer to refuel the
vehicle at his or her own expense.
   (C)   It is the intent of the Board of Commissioners that any use of a
departmental vehicle authorized under this section shall be considered a bona
fide business requirement of the county and, therefore, any value to the
employee attributable to the use shall be excludable from the employee’s income
as a “working condition fringe benefit” under the provisions of § 132(d) of the
Internal Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended.

§ 33.084 MILEAGE REIMBURSEMENT.
   The County Council, being the county fiscal body, hereby determines that the
mileage to be paid to officers, department heads and employees of the county,
except for the Sheriff, Surveyor and Coroner, and their employees, shall be
$0.40 per mile, for the actual miles driven by the person in the person’s own
motor vehicle in the course of performance of official duties of employment
with the county when the county has not furnished a motor vehicle that is
available for the person’s use which shall not include miles driven from the
person’s residence to the person’s place of work nor from the person’s place of
work to the person’s residence.

TAKING COUNTY-OWNED VEHICLES TO RESIDENCES
§ 33.095 DETERMINATION OF NEED TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCY SITUATION.
   The Board of Commissioners, having conducted an investigation and having
reviewed the work of the various offices and departments of the county, hereby
determines that the following officials and employees of the county must be
available to immediately respond from their residences to emergency situations:
   (A)   Superintendent and Assistant Superintendent of the County Highway

   (B)   Immunization representative of the State Board of Health employed by
County Health Department;
   (C)   Animal Control Officer; and

(Prior Code, § 2-528) (Res. passed 7-16-1984)
ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE POLICY AND TESTING PROCEDURE
§ 33.125 STATEMENT OF FACTS.
   (A)   The county is concerned with the public’s safety and workplace safety
for our employees. This alcohol and drug abuse policy is designed to ensure
that employees are fit for duty. The county believes that our employees in
safety sensitive positions cannot safely operate vehicles while under the
influence of any controlled substance or while under the influence of alcohol.
This policy applies to all employees of the County Highway Department who
perform safety sensitive jobs, including mechanics and employees who are
required to hold a Commercial Drivers License (CDL), to perform their job
function. This policy covers truck drivers, mechanics, heavy equipment
operators, and any other positions that require a commercial driver’s license.
Safety sensitive employees are expected and required to be in suitable mental
and physical condition while at work, performing their jobs satisfactorily and
behaving appropriately. When the use of alcohol and other drugs interfere with
such expectations, an employees failure to meet these basic expectations could
result in disciplinary action. It is for this purpose that the county has
implemented the following Substance Abuse Policy which includes testing for the
presence of drugs and alcohol. The intent of the county is to also ensure that
the county is in compliance with federal law.
   (B)   This policy addresses the use of alcohol and illegal drugs or
substances on many fronts. The use, possession, sale, purchase or transfer of
unauthorized or illegal drugs or substances, or the abuse or misuse of legal
drugs on county property, while on county business or while operating vehicles
and equipment, is prohibited. Drinking alcoholic beverages resulting in having
any measurable amount of alcohol, as defined in the federal regulations, in his
or her system during working hours is prohibited, whether on or off county
property. Working hours include all breaks. Off-duty use of drugs and alcohol
is prohibited to the extent it affects an employee’s attendance or performance
and his or her ability to pass required Department of Transportation (DOT)
alcohol and controlled substance tests. Any violation of this policy is grounds
for discipline, up to an including termination. To that extent, the provisions
of this policy shall be deemed as additional requirements to the minimum
requirements of the county personnel policy.
   (C)   Physician-directed use of drugs can affect behavior and performance.
When such use of drugs adversely affects job performance or safety, it is in
the best interest of the employee, co-workers, the public, and the county that
the employee take sick, personal, or vacation days, or if necessary, unpaid
leave in accordance with the personnel policies concerning requesting medical
leaves.
   (D)   The county reserves the right to terminate any employee in a safety
sensitive position who violates the County Drug and Alcohol Abuse Policy.
Reporting to work under the influence of alcohol or nonprescribed drugs or
using the same while on the job are listed as causes for disciplinary action as
stated in §
33.128(E) of the county personnel policy. The Supervisor or his or her designee
is authorized to implement this policy and program, including a periodic review
of the program to address any problems, changes, and/or revisions of it, and
maintenance of all records required by the federal regulations. The Supervisor
or his or her designee is responsible for communicating this policy to all
employees in safety sensitive positions and is accountable for its consistent
enforcement.
   (E)   For purposes of this policy, a safety sensitive position shall be
defined as a position which requires the employee to:
      (1)   Inspect equipment as required by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Regulations (FMCSR’s), or otherwise inspecting, servicing or conditioning any
commercial motor vehicle or County Highway Department vehicle at any time.
      (2)   Operate a commercial motor vehicle or County Highway Department
vehicle, which requires, for its operation, a commercial drivers license (CDL).
      (3)   Spend time, other than driving time, on or in a commercial motor
vehicle or a County Highway Department vehicle.
      (4)   Load or unload a commercial motor vehicle or a County Highway
Department vehicle, supervising or assisting in the loading or unloading,
attending a vehicle being loaded or unloaded, remaining in readiness to operate
the vehicle, or giving receipts for shipments.
      (5)   Perform driver requirements associated with an accident.
      (6)   Repair, obtain assistance for, or remain in attendance upon a
disabled vehicle.
(Res. 1998-02, passed 3-2-1998)
§ 33.126 REGULATIONS; TESTING OF SAFETY SENSITIVE EMPLOYEES.
   All safety sensitive employees will be tested for alcohol and drug abuse in
accordance with the approved procedures when directed by the Supervisor or his
or her designee. The county will specify the testing site and provide tests and
test interpretations at no cost to the employees.
(Res. 1998-02, passed 3-2-1998)
§ 33.127 GUIDELINES FOR TESTING.
   (A)   Pre-employment. Under no circumstance will an individual be placed in
a safety sensitive position without proof of the successful completion of an
alcohol and/or drug test. Any individual who refuses to submit to such tests,
has a detectable amount of alcohol in his or her system, or has a positive
controlled substance test result, as defined by the federal regulations, will
not be considered for employment with the county.
   (B)   Random.
      (1)   A minimum rate of 50% of employees in safety sensitive positions
shall be tested annually for drugs and 25% of employees in these positions
shall be tested annually for alcohol.
      (2)   Random drug and alcohol testing may be combined. For example, when
testing at 50% drug random rate and 25% alcohol random rate, half of the
randomly selected employees chosen for testing would be tested for both drugs
and alcohol, while the rest could be tested only for drugs. Alcohol testing
will be conducted just prior to, during, or immediately following performance
of a safety sensitive function.
      (3)   Random testing selection requires:
         (a)   Employee remains in the pool.
         (b)   Use of a valid random selection process.
         (c)   Dates for testing will not be announced in advance.
         (d)   Testing of 50% of employees for drugs and 25% of employees for
alcohol.
   (C)   Post accident.
      (1)   Employees in safety sensitive positions are required to submit to
drug and alcohol testing as soon as possible following a “DOT” accident which
involves the loss of human life, or the in the event the employee receives a
citation under state or local law for a moving traffic violation arising from
the accident.
      (2)   An employee who is subject to post accident testing shall remain
readily available for such testing for a period up to eight hours or he or she
may be deemed to have refused to subject to testing. Nothing in this section
shall be construed to require the delay of necessary medical treatment or to
prohibit the employee from leaving the scene of an accident for a period
necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident or to obtain
necessary medical care.
      (3)   No employee required to take a post accident alcohol test shall use
alcohol for eight hours following the accident or until he or she undergoes a
post accident alcohol test, whichever occurs first.
      (4)   If an employee is seriously injured and cannot submit to testing at
the time of the accident, he or she shall provide the necessary authorization
for obtaining hospital reports and other documents that would indicate whether
there were any drugs or alcohol in his or her system.
      (5)   The results of a breath or blood test for the use of alcohol, or a
urine test for the use of drugs conducted by federal, state, or local officials
having independent authority for the test, shall be considered to meet the
requirements for post accident testing if the results are obtained by the
county.
   (D)   Actions to take in a post accident testing situation:
      (1)   Treat injuries as necessary.
      (2)   Cooperate with law enforcement.
      (3)   Explain the need for testing.
      (4)   Cooperate with the appropriate medical facility.
      (5)   Collect all specimens promptly.
      (6)   Document all events.
   (D)   Reasonable suspicion.
      (1)   The county is required to test for the use of alcohol and
controlled substances upon “reasonable suspicion”. Reasonable suspicion is
defined to mean, that the county believes the behavior, speech, body odor, or
appearance of an employee while on duty is indicative of the use of alcohol
and/or controlled substances. The conduct must be witnessed by a supervisor, if
so trained. Supervisor(s) will receive at least two hours of training to
further their knowledge of possible signs of alcohol and/or drug abuse that
influences an employee’s fitness for duty. The mere possession of alcohol does
not constitute a need for an alcohol test. The witness must have received
training in the detection of probable alcohol and drug use by observing a
person’s behavior. If it is at all possible, the witness should not conduct the
alcohol test in order to protect the employee.
      (2)   Alcohol testing is authorized only if the observations are made
during, just before, or just after the period of the work day of the employee.
A written record shall be made of the observations leading to a reasonable
suspicion alcohol and/or controlled substance test. This record is to be signed
by the supervisor who requires a reasonable suspicion test and shall include
all observations that culminated in the test(s) being administered.
         (a)   If a reasonable suspicion alcohol test is not administered
within two hours following the observations, the witness shall prepare and
maintain on file a record stating the reasons the alcohol test was not
administered promptly. In addition, if not administered within eight hours, all
attempts to administer the test shall cease. A record shall be prepared and
maintained stating why the alcohol test was not administered.
         (b)   Prior to the start of work, an employee must report to his or
her immediate supervisor, use of any prescription and/or over the counter drugs
which may affect job performance or the safety of others. It is the employee’s
responsibility to obtain from his or her physician a determination as to
whether or not the drug could affect job performance.
         (c)   All information obtained in the course of testing of employees
shall be protected as confidential medical information. No data concerning this
information will be made a part of the employee’s personnel file nor will it be
provided to any other party without the direct written consent of the employee,
unless the results are grounds for discipline and/or the grievance procedure is
requested by the employee.
         (d)   Failure to sign a release for alcohol and drug testing will be
classified as a refusal to carry out an order of a supervisor and the employee
shall be terminated.
         (e)   Refusal to submit to an alcohol and/or controlled substance test
as required will be recorded as a positive test. Refusal to submit to an
alcohol or controlled substance test means that an employee fails to provide
adequate breath for testing without valid medical explanation after he or she
has received notice of the requirement for breath testing in accordance with
this policy; fails to provide adequate urine for controlled substance testing
without a valid medical explanation after he or she has received notice of the
requirement for testing in accordance with this policy; or engages in conduct
that clearly obstructs the testing process.
         (f)   Urine specimens which the laboratory reports as unacceptable
with regard to measured levels on creatinine, specific gravity or pH will be
issued by the Medical Review Officer as a negative with notation of dilute
status. The county reserves the right to require the employee to provide
another specimen for testing. The employee will be notified of such and have
the opportunity to have the dilute status explained to him or her before
recollection is scheduled. If a dilute specimen is reported, the employee will
be required to submit another specimen unless a medical condition is the cause
of the dilute result. If a second dilute specimen is obtained, the employee may
be suspended from work until a valid specimen is obtained at the employees
expense. If a valid specimen is not obtained within three days from the first
retest, the employees may be terminated.
         (g)   If the Medical Review Officer issues a cancelled test result,
the employee may be asked to submit another specimen depending on the reason
for the cancelled report.
      (3)   As stipulated in the federal regulations, an employee testing
positive for alcohol (.04 or greater) or for a controlled substance shall be
prohibited from driving or performing a safety sensitive function for the
county and be referred to the supervisor. Employees testing .02 or greater, but
less than .04 shall also not drive or perform safety sensitive functions for
the county, nor shall the county permit him or her to perform a safety
sensitive function, until the start of the employee’s next regularly scheduled
duty period, but not less than 24 hours following administration of the test or
until a disposition of possible discipline is decided. Employees may be subject
to discipline, as contained in the county personnel policy.

(Res. 2021-02, passed 3-8-2021)
§ 35.010 ALLOWABLE COSTS POLICY.
   (A)   The application of these cost principles is based on the fundamental
premises that:
      (1)   The non-federal entity is responsible for the efficient and
effective administration of the federal award through the application of sound
management practices;
      (2)   The non-federal entity assumes responsibility for administering
federal funds in a manner consistent with underlying agreements, program
objectives, and the terms and conditions of the federal award;
      (3)   The non-federal entity, in recognition of its own unique
combination of staff, facilities and experience, has the primary responsibility
for employing whatever form of sound organization and management techniques may
be necessary in order to assure proper and efficient administration of the
federal award;
      (4)   The application of these cost principles should require no
significant changes in the internal accounting policies and practices of the
non-federal entity. However, the accounting practices of the non-federal entity
must be consistent with these cost principles and support the accumulation of
costs as required by the principles, and must provide for adequate
documentation to support costs charged to the federal award;
      (5)   In reviewing, negotiating and approving cost allocation plans or
indirect cost proposals, the cognizant agency for indirect costs should
generally assure that the non-federal entity is applying these cost accounting
principles on a consistent basis during their review and negotiation of
indirect cost proposals. Where wide variations exist in the treatment of a
given cost item by the non-federal entity, the reasonableness and equity of
such treatments should be fully considered;
      (6)   For non-federal entities that educate and engage students in
research, the dual role of students as both trainees and employees (including
pre-and post-doctoral staff) contributing to the completion of federal awards
for research must be recognized in the application of these principles; and
      (7)   The non-federal entity may not earn or keep any profit resulting
from federal financial assistance, unless explicitly authorized by the terms
and conditions of the federal award.
   (B)   Composition of costs; total cost. The total cost of a federal award is
the sum of the allowable direct and allocable indirect costs less any
applicable credits.
   (C)   Factors affecting allowable costs. Except where otherwise authorized
by statute, costs must meet the following general criteria in order to be
allowable under these principles:
      (1)   Be necessary and reasonable for the performance of the federal
award and be allocable thereto under these principles;
      (2)   Conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in these
principles or in the federal award as to types or amounts of cost items;
      (3)   Be consistent with policies and procedures that apply uniformly to
both federally-financed and other activities of the non-federal entity;
      (4)   Be accorded consistent treatment. A cost may not be assigned to a
federal award as a direct cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose
in like circumstances has been allocated to the federal award as an indirect
cost;
      (5)   Be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP), except, for state and local governments and Indian tribes
only, as otherwise provided for in this part;
      (6)   Not be included as a cost or used to meet cost sharing or matching
requirements of any other federally-financed program in either the current or a
prior period;
      (7)   Be adequately documented; and
      (8)   Cost must be incurred during the approved budget period. The
federal awarding agency is authorized, at its discretion, to waive prior
written approvals to cany forward unobligated balances to subsequent budget
periods.
   (D)   Factors affecting reasonable costs. A cost is reasonable if, in its
nature and amount, it does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent
person under the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision was made to
incur the cost. The question of reasonableness is particularly important when
the non-federal entity is predominantly federal-funded. In determining
reasonableness of a given cost, consideration must be given to:
      (1)   Whether the cost is a type generally recognized as ordinary and
necessary for the operation of the non-federal entity or the proper and
efficient performances of the federal award;
      (2)   The restraints or requirements imposed by such factors as: sound
business practices; arm’s-length bargaining; federal, state, local, tribal and
other laws and regulations; and terms and conditions of the federal award;
      (3)   Market prices for comparable goods or services for the geographic
area;
      (4)   Whether the individuals concerned acted with prudence in the
circumstances considering their responsibilities to the non-federal entity, its
employees, where applicable its students or memberships, the public at large
and the federal government; and
      (5)   Whether the non-federal entity significantly deviates from its
established practices and policies regarding the incurrence of costs, which may
unjustifiably increase the federal award’s cost.
   (E)   Factors affecting allocable costs.
      (1)   A cost is allocable to a particular federal award or other cost
objective if the goods or services involved are chargeable or assignable to
that federal award or cost objective in accordance with relative benefits
received. This standard is met if the cost:
         (a)   Is incurred specifically for the federal award;
         (b)   Benefits both the federal award and other work of the non-
federal entity and can be distributed in proportions that may be approximated
using reasonable methods; and
         (c)   Is necessary to the overall operation of the non-federal entity
and is assignable in part to the federal award in accordance with the
principles in this division.
      (2)   All activities which benefit from the non-federal entity’s indirect
cost, including unallowable activities and donated services by the non-federal
entity or third parties, will receive an appropriate allocation of indirect
costs.
      (3)   Any cost allocable to a particular federal award under the
principles provided for in this part may not be charged to other federal awards
to overcome fund deficiencies, to avoid restrictions imposed by federal
statutes, regulations, or terms and conditions of the federal awards, or for
other reasons. However, this prohibition would not preclude the non-federal
entity from shifting costs that are allowable under two or more federal awards
in accordance with existing federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and
conditions of the federal awards.
      (4)   Direct cost allocation principles. If a cost benefits two or more
projects or activities in proportions that can be determined without undue
effort or cost, the cost must be allocated to the projects based on the
proportional benefit. If a cost benefits two or more projects or activities in
proportions that cannot be determined because of the interrelationship of the
work involved, then, notwithstanding division (E)(3) above, the costs may be
allocated or transferred to benefitted projects on any reasonable documented
basis. Where the purchase of equipment or other capital asset is specifically
authorized under a federal award, the costs are assignable to the federal award
regardless of the use that may be made of the equipment or other capital asset
involved when no longer needed for the purpose for which it was originally
required.
   (F)   This policy outlines the allowable cost with regards to federal
grants.

   (A)   The standard of prudence to be used for managing the county's
investment program is the Prudent Investor Rule applicable to a trustee, as set
forth in the Indiana Uniform Prudent Investor Act (I.C. 30-4-3.5). I.C. 30-4-
3.5-2a states that "A trustee shall invest and manage trust assets as a prudent
investor would, by considering the purposes, terms, distribution requirements,
and other circumstances of the trust. In satisfying this standard, the trustee
shall exercise reasonable care, skill, and caution."
   (B)   The county's overall investment program shall be designed and managed
with a degree of professionalism that is worthy of the public trust. The county
recognizes that no investment is totally without risk and that its investment
activities are a matter of public record. Accordingly, the county recognizes
that occasional measured losses may occur in a diversified portfolio and shall
be considered within the context of the overall portfolio's return, provided
that adequate diversification has been implemented and that the sale of a
security is in the best long-term interest of the county.
   (C)   The Treasurer and other authorized persons acting in accordance with
written procedures and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal
responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price
changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion
to the Board of Finance and appropriate action is taken to control adverse
developments.

business activity that could conflict with proper execution of the county's
investment program or that could impair or create the appearance of an
impairment of their ability to make impartial investment decisions. They shall
disclose to the Board of Finance any material financial interest they have in
financial institutions that conduct business with the county, and they shall
subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of the county's.

needs.

CAPITAL ASSET POLICY
§ 35.095 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this policy is to facilitate the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
(Res. 2023-14, passed 11-13-2023)
§ 35.096 CLASSIFICATION OF ASSETS.
   Capital assets are personal and real property used in the operations of
government that have an expected estimated useful life beyond a single period.
Capital assets are to include any item that falls into one of the following
categories:
   (A)   Land;
   (B)   Buildings;
   (C)   Machinery and equipment;
   (D)   Vehicles;
   (E)   Computer software;
   (F)   General infrastructure; and
   (G)   Construction in progress.
(Res. 2023-14, passed 11-13-2023)
§ 35.097 CAPITALIZATION THRESHOLDS.
   (A)   To be considered a capital asset for financial reporting purposes, an
item must be at or above the capitalization threshold. Assets will remain as
part of the property record until they are retired or are disposed of, sold,
traded-in, and the like, regardless of net book value amount.
   (B)   The capitalization threshold for the following classes of assets shall
be:
      (1)   Land: N/A.
      (2)   Building improvements: $100,000.
      (3)   Machinery and equipment: $10,000.
      (4)   Vehicles: $15,000.
      (5)   Computer software: $50,000.
      (6)   General infrastructure improvements: $100,000.
      (7)   Construction in progress: N/A.
   (C)   With regard to improvements to buildings and general infrastructure, a
capital outlay must be significant and increase capacity, increase efficiency,
or extend the asset's estimated useful life beyond the original expectation.
   (D)   A change in capacity increases the level of service provided by the
assets. A change in efficiency increases the level of service but without
increasing the size of the asset or the change maintains the same level of
service at a lower cost. For example, an addition to a building provides
increased square footage, hence, the capacity is increased and the capital
outlay is capitalized. An extended estimated useful life involves a significant
alternation, structural change or improvement.
   (E)   While substantial repairs and renovations will be reviewed for
potential capitalization, it is anticipated that most will be expensed in the
current year. These expenses often merely restore the asset to the original
service potential but do not necessarily improve the asset.
   (F)   All land, including rights-of-way, is capitalized at the time of
acquisition regardless of historical costs or fair value if donated.
(Res. 2023-14, passed 11-13-2023)
§ 35.098 HISTORICAL COST OR ESTIMATED HISTORICAL COSTS.
   (A)   Annual updating and reporting. Capital assets are recorded at
historical cost which includes any ancillary charges necessary to place the
asset into its intended location and condition for use. Ancillary charges
include, for example, freight and transportation charges, site preparation
costs, and professional fees. Engineering costs (internal and external) include
related preliminary project and environmental studies; project estimating,
design, and planning (drawings and specifications); and construction
engineering, construction management, construction inspection and project
payment. Donated capital assets are recorded at their estimated fair value at
the time of acquisition.
   (B)   Retroactive reporting at transition of GASB Statement No. 34. When
actual historical cost source data was unavailable, estimated historical cost
was developed utilizing a normal costing approach. With this method of
estimating historical costs, a current replacement cost was ascertained. An
appropriate cost index (including Consumer Price Index and federal highway
price trends) corresponding to an estimated date of acquisition/construction
was then applied to “deflate” the replacement cost to an estimated historical
cost.
(Res. 2023-14, passed 11-13-2023)
§ 35.099 ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF DEPRECIABLE ASSETS.
   Capital assets have estimated useful lives extending beyond a single
reporting period (one year) and are depreciated using the straight-line method
with no allowance for salvage value. The estimated useful lives currently used
were developed with the input of knowledgeable staff and reflect our
government’s experience with these assets:
   (A)   Land: non-depreciable.
   (B)   Buildings and improvements: 50 years.
   (C)   Machinery and equipment: five years.
   (D)   Vehicles.
      (1)   Autos and light trucks: five years.
      (2)   Trucks: ten years.
   (E)   General infrastructure: 50 years.
   (F)   Computer software: ten years.
(Res. 2023-14, passed 11-13-2023)
§ 35.100 DEPRECIATION METHOD/CONVENTION.
   Depreciation will be calculated using the straight-line method and full-year
convention. No salvage value or residual value will be recognized.
(Res. 2023-14, passed 11-13-2023)
§ 35.101 RETIREMENTS.
   (A)   Retirements apply to all capital assets including land, buildings,
machinery and equipment, vehicles, and general infrastructure.
   (B)   When an asset is disposed of, scrapped, sold, subject to demolition,
and the like, it is to be removed from the property record and the appropriate
reduction will be made to historical cost, accumulated depreciation, and net
book value amounts.
   (C)   Retirements will reflect the actual historical cost of the asset when
the amount is ascertainable. When historical cost is not ascertainable, an
estimated historical cost will be determined.
(Res. 2023-14, passed 11-13-2023)
§ 35.102 RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROPERTY RECORD MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   The County Auditor will ensure that reporting for capital assets is
being exercised by establishing a capital asset inventory, both initially and
periodically in subsequent years. The County Auditor will further ensure that
the capital asset report will be updated annually to reflect improvements,
additions, retirements, and transfers and to reflect the new, annual capital
asset balance for financial reporting purposes and the annual and accumulated
depreciation calculations and net book value amounts.
   (B)   Day-to-day stewardship of personal property above the capitalization
threshold of $10,000 is the expressed responsibility of the department
utilizing the property.
   (C)   For annual updating of the capital asset report, the departments have
the responsibility to report improvements, additions, retirements, and
transfers in detail to the County Auditor. It is expected that this reporting
will be in a timely manner, as the capital asset record must be updated
annually. These departments include but are not limited to Highway,
Engineering, Planning, Sheriff, Information Technology, and the County Auditor.
Also, the Board of Commissioners will provide input as to additions and
retirements as information becomes available.
   (D)   To restate, additions of assets at or above the unit capitalization
threshold of $10,000 are to be reported to the County Auditor by the
departments upon purchase or receipt of the asset. These will be verified per
the claims process by the County Auditor’s Office. Transfers and retirements of
assets at or above the $10,000 per unit threshold are to be reported as such by
the departments to the County Auditor at the time of the transaction.
(Res. 2023-14, passed 11-13-2023)
§ 35.103 PROPERTY CONTROL.
   (A)   Capital assets below the capitalization threshold of $10,000 on a unit
basis but warranting “control” shall be inventoried at the department level and
an appropriate list will be maintained. Data elements are to include asset
description, location, make, model, serial number, condition, and other
information that assists control or is deemed relevant.
   (B)   Assets below the capitalization threshold but considered sensitive may
include, for example, weapons, radios, personal computers, laptop computers,
printers, fax machines, and small power tools. These minor but sensitive items
shall be inventoried and controlled at the department level. Stewardship of
these minor but sensitive items is the express responsibility of the
departments utilizing these properties.
   (C)   The County Auditor shall have the right to request copies of the
inventory and/or updated inventory of controllable items so as to periodically
review the information and adherence to policy.
(Res. 2023-14, passed 11-13-2023)
 
§ 35.02 INVESTMENT OF COUNTY FUNDS.

under the control of the county from time to time in any or all of the
investments described in I.C. 5-13-9-1 et seq. and all acts amendatory thereof
or supplemental thereto.

of our watercourses and water bodies in a manner pursuant to and consistent
with the Federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq.) and to also
provide for the health, safety and general welfare of citizens of the county,
through the reduction of pollutants in stormwater discharges and the regulation
of non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum extent
practicable. This chapter establishes methods for controlling the introduction
of pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) in order to
comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit process and specifically meet the requirements of the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process.
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To regulate, pursuant to the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management's (IDEM) NPDES Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System General Permit
(MS4GP), the contribution of pollutants to the MS4 by stormwater discharges by
any person;
      (2)   To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the MS4;
      (3)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspections,
surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this
chapter; and
      (4)   To promote public awareness of the hazards involved in the improper
discharge of trash, yard waste, lawn chemicals, pet waste, wastewater, grease,
oil, petroleum products, cleaning products, paint products, hazardous waste,
sediment and other pollutants into the storm drainage system.

§ 53.09 SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
   (A)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The
county may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when
the suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, to
the health or welfare of persons or to the MS4 or other watercourses. If the
violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the
authorized enforcement agency may take steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or other watercourses or to minimize danger to
persons.
   (B)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have his or her MS4
access suspended if the suspension would, in the judgement of the authorized
enforcement agency, abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized
enforcement agency will notify the violator of the proposed suspension of his
or her MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency
for a post-termination hearing regarding the suspension of access. The hearing
shall be conducted in accordance with rules promulgated by the authorized
enforcement agency. A person commits a violation of this chapter if the person
reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to the section, without
the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency.

itself to detect the introduction of pollutants into the system by means other
than a defined outfall, such as dumping or contaminated sheet runoff.
   (B)   Whenever the county has cause to believe that there exists, or
potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition which constitutes a
violation of this chapter, the county or its agent shall have the right to
enter the premises at any reasonable time to determine if the discharger is
complying with all requirements of this chapter. The county or its agent shall
be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this
chapter as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter.
If the facility has security measures in force that require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the person in
control of the premises shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency. In the event that the
owner or occupant refuses entry after a request to enter has been made, the
county is hereby empowered to seek assistance from a court of competent
jurisdiction in obtaining the entry. If a discharge is observed which
represents an immediate hazard to public health or safety, or aquatic life, the

      (4)   The name and telephone number of the person making the report, and
the name and telephone number of a person who may be contacted for additional
information on the matter.
   (B)   A properly reported accidental discharge shall be an affirmative
defense to a civil infraction proceeding brought under this chapter against a
discharger for such discharge. It shall not, however, be a defense to a legal
action brought to obtain an injunction, to obtain recovery of costs, or to
obtain other relief because of or arising out of the discharge. A discharge
shall be considered properly reported only if the discharger complies with all
the requirements of this section and the Indiana Spill Rule (327 I.A.C. 2-6.1).
This requirement does not relieve the discharger from notifying other entities
as required by state or federal regulations.
   (C)   Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to the county at: Bartholomew County MS4
Coordinator, Soil and Water Conservation District, 785 S. Marr Rd, Columbus,

than ten days. All animals which are required to be confined shall be confined
in a completely enclosed building or secure enclosure with no means of escape.
If the owner cannot confine the animal in a completely enclosed building or

certification which states that the animal is not rabid must be presented to
the Environmental Health Division of the County Health Department within four
days of the examination. If the Environmental Health Division of the County
Health Department determines that the animal is no longer suspected of being
rabid, the animal may be released from confinement. The owner of the animal is

RATES FOR BASIC CABLE SERVICE
§ 111.01 SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   This chapter governs the regulation of rates for basic service and
equipment and cable programming services and equipment within the county for
any franchisee which has been notified that:
      (1)   The county has been certified to regulate its basic service and
equipment rates; and
      (2)   The county has adopted regulations governing regulation of basic
service and equipment rates. The provisions set forth below are intended to be
consistent with all Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") regulations
governing the regulation of basic service rates and equipment, and the rules
set forth below will be interpreted, and rates will be regulated, in a manner
consistent with FCC regulations, as if those regulations were set forth in full
herein; a cable franchisee is prohibited from engaging in any activity it is
prohibited from engaging in under FCC rules, as if those rules were set forth
in full herein.
   (B)   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      BASIC SERVICE or BASIC CABLE SERVICE. The same meaning as the term "basic
service" at 47 C.F.R. § 76.901.
      COUNTY COMMISSIONERS. The Board of Commissioners of the County of
Bartholomew.
      EQUIPMENT. All equipment and services subject to regulation under 47
C.F.R. § 76.923.
      TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION. The Bartholomew/Columbus
Telecommunications Commission established by Ord. 1982-1 and as thereafter
amended.
(Prior Code, § 3-98) (Ord. 1993-15, passed 11-1-1993)
§ 111.02 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION.
   (A)   The County Commissioners hereby delegate authority to the
Telecommunications Commission to regulate cable rates as provided in this
chapter and consistent with FCC regulations, subject to ratification by the
County Commissioners of any order of the Telecommunications Commission
approving or denying a rate.
   (B)   The County Commissioners further authorize Telecommunications
Commission to adopt additional rules, regulations and procedures for regulating
rates as are consistent with this chapter and FCC regulations.
(Prior Code, § 3-99) (Ord. 1993-15, passed 11-1-1993)
§ 111.03 FILING AND REVIEW OF RATES.
   (A)   Initial filings by franchisees.
      (1)   Filings; when made. A franchisee that is notified that its basic
service and equipment rates are subject to regulation must file a submission
("the rate filing") within 30 days of the notification, justifying its then-
existing basic service and equipment rates. All rates, for all customer
classifications, must be justified. Once a franchisee has been so notified by
the county that its rates are subject to regulation, it may not thereafter
increase its rates for basic service or equipment without the prior approval of
the Telecommunications Commission. This requirement applies in all cases,
including with respect to increases in rates announced prior to the date the
operator was notified its rates were subject to regulation where the increases
were not implemented prior to the date of notice. A franchisee must submit a
rate filing to justify any increase in basic service or equipment rates or any
new basic service or equipment rate (collectively referred to herein as rate
increases). An "increase" occurs when there is an increase in rates or a
decrease in program or customer services. Rate filings proposing and supporting
rate increases must be filed for review at least 30 days in advance of the
proposed effective date of the increase. This requirement does not alter or
eliminate any other notice requirement.
      (2)   Filings; where made. Every rate filing must be submitted to the
Telecommunications Commission. A rate filing shall be considered filed for
review on the date the rate filing and all required copies are received by the
Telecommunications Commission. Five copies of each rate filing (including all
supporting materials) must be submitted.
      (3)   Filings; contents. Subject to any FCC regulations governing the
burden of proof, a rate filing submitted by a franchisee must show that the
rates the franchisee proposes to charge for basic service and equipment are
reasonable. Except as inconsistent with FCC rules:
         (a)   Every rate filing must clearly state in a covering letter
whether it justifies existing rates; or proposes an increase in rates. The
covering letter must also identify any rate that is derived in whole or in part
based upon cost of service and identify any pages of the rate filing that
contain information that the franchisee claims is proprietary. It must state
whether any part of the proposed increase is based on an inflation adjustment
or an alleged increase in external costs. The cover letter should also contain
a brief, narrative description of any proposed changes in rates or in service;
         (b)   The pages of each rate filing must be numbered sequentially;
         (c)   The rate filing must contain all applicable FCC forms and these
forms must be correctly completed; and
         (d)   If different rates are proposed for basic service for different
classes of customers, the filing must show that the classifications and the
differences in the rate charged are reasonable and consistent with federal law.
      (4)   Reasonable cost recovery. If the franchisee seeks to support a rate
based upon a cost of service, the Telecommunications Commission will establish
a rate that provides the franchisee an opportunity to recover the reasonable
costs associated with providing basic cable service, including a reasonable
profit. An expense or investment is not presumed reasonable merely because the
franchisee has incurred or made it. A franchisee is not entitled to recover
monopoly rents in any form.
      (5)   Complete analysis. In addition to information the
Telecommunications Commission requires the franchisee to provide, and unless
the Telecommunications Commission grants a waiver of this provision, a
franchisee who seeks to justify all or any part of its rates based upon its
cost of service must submit a complete analysis that shows all expenses it
incurs and all revenues derived from the system, directly or indirectly by the
franchisee or any person that constitutes a cable operator of the system within
the meaning of 47 U.S.C. § 522(4). The cost of service must identify the
accounting level (as that term is used in the FCC's regulations) at which each
expense or revenue identified was aggregated and show clearly how the expense
or revenue was allocated. The franchisee may not include costs at an accounting
level unless it also includes all revenues from that same level attributable to
the system or to a group of systems of which the system serving the county is a
part. The replacement cost of a comparable system must be identified and
supported. The franchisee must identify the name and address of any entity with
which it has a contract, other than a programmer, which derives revenues from
the system, and must state whether and how the revenues of that entity were
included in the cost of service. In addition, the cost of service shall clearly
show the derivation of a proposed charge per channel and the application of
that charge to yield a basic service rate. It must also show and support the
derivation and allocation of any amounts included in the derivation of the rate
for:
         (a)   Operation and maintenance expenses;
         (b)   Administrative and general expenses;
         (c)   Programming expenses (identifying retransmission consent costs
and copyright fees separately);
         (d)   Costs for PEG access and any institutional network;
         (e)   Franchise fee expense;
         (f)   Investment in the system and associated depreciation;
         (g)   Other expenses, including federal, state and local taxes,
itemized; and
         (h)   The proposed return on equity and actual interest expense paid
by the franchisee.
      (6)   Applicable forms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a franchisee is
not required to submit the cost of service specified herein for equipment
rates, and instead initially shall complete, submit and support the costs of
equipment using applicable FCC forms. Any cost-of-service filing submitted to
justify basic service rates must show that the cost of service does not include
equipment costs.
   (B)   Initial Telecommunications Commission review.
      (1)   After receiving a rate filing, the Telecommunications Commission
shall promptly cause to be published a notice that a filing has been received
and that, except for those parts which may be withheld as proprietary, it is
available for public review. The notice shall state that interested parties may
comment on the filing and shall provide interested parties seven days to submit
written comments on the filing to the Telecommunications Commission. Any
comments received and any recommendations for action by the Telecommunications
Commission staff shall be made available for public inspection no later than 20
days after the filing. The franchisee may submit a response to public comments
or staff recommendations, but must do so no later than three business days
after the staff recommendations are made available for public inspection. The
response shall be filed with the Telecommunications Commission.
      (2)   Within 30 days of the date of the filing, the Telecommunications
Commission shall issue a written order, which may be in any lawful form,
approving the proposed rate in whole or in part; denying the proposed rate in
whole or in part; or tolling the proposed rate in whole or part. If the
Telecommunications Commission tolls the rate in whole or in part, its written
order shall explain that it requires additional time to review the rate filing,
identify generally any then-known deficiencies in the franchisee's filing and
state that the franchisee may cure any deficiency in its filing by submitting a
supplementary filing as provided herein. With respect to existing rates,
TOLLING means the rates may remain in effect, subject to refund; with respect
to rate changes, tolling means the portion of the rate change that is tolled
may not go into effect.
   (C)   Supplementary filings.
      (1)   If a proposed rate is tolled in whole or in part, the franchisee
shall submit a supplementary filing 20 days from the date the tolling order
issues, containing corrections, if any, to its filing (including any required
supplement to its cost of service filing) and any response to information filed
by interested parties or to the recommendations of the Telecommunications
Commission staff, or any additional information necessary to support the
proposed rate. Supplementary filings must be filed in accordance with division
(A)(2) above.
      (2)   A supplementary filing also must contain information as the
Telecommunications Commission directs the franchisee to provide.
      (3)   In addition to information the Telecommunications Commission
requires the franchisee to provide, and unless the Telecommunications
Commission grants a waiver of this provision, a franchisee who claims that it
is entitled to a rate in whole or in part based upon the adjustments for
inflation and external costs contemplated by 47 C.F.R. § 76.922(d)(1) and (2)
must submit the following:
         (a)   A calculation showing how each part of the adjustment was
derived;
         (b)   A statement itemizing each external cost (as defined by FCC
regulations), the amount of that external costs for the two calendar years
prior to the date of the filing and the year-to-date in which the filing is
made; and the projected amount of the external cost for the remainder of the
year in which the filing is made and for the following calendar year. The
statement must specifically show any increases in revenues from programming
services. REVENUES include all revenues, in whatever form received;
         (c)   If the increase is attributable to any increase in programming
service costs, the contract for each programming service whose cost has
increased; a sworn statement identifying each programming service whose costs
increased where the programmer is an affiliate of the franchisee (as defined by
FCC regulations); and, for any contract that has been in effect less than 12
months, the prior contract for the service; and
         (d)   A sworn statement by the franchisee's chief financial officer or
an independent, certified accountant stating that he or she has examined all
external costs (including all programming costs) and has offset against any
increase claimed, the amount of any decreases in external costs, and the amount
by which any increase in external costs was below the GNP-PI, as required by 47
C.F.R. § 76.922(d)(2); affirming that the franchisee has only sought to recover
any external cost to the extent that cost exceeded the GNP-PI; and affirming
that the franchisee has not attempted to recover any increase in the cost of
programming purchased by an affiliate except as provided in 47 C.F.R. § 76.922
(d)(2)(vi).
      (4)   Upon receiving the supplementary filing, the Telecommunications
Commission shall promptly cause to be published a notice that a filing has been
received and that it is available for public review (except those parts which
may be withheld as proprietary). The notice shall state that interested parties
may comment on the filing, and shall provide interested parties 20 days to
submit written comments on the filing to the Telecommunications Commission. Any
comments received and any recommendations for action by the Telecommunications
Commission staff shall be made available for public inspection no later than 30
days prior to the date the Telecommunications Commission must act under
division (C)(6) below. The franchisee may submit a response to public comments
or the Telecommunications Commission staff's recommendations, but must do so no
later than ten days after those recommendations are made available for public
inspection. The response shall be filed with the Telecommunications Commission.
      (5)   The Telecommunications Commission shall issue a written order,
which may be in any lawful form, approving the proposed rate in whole or in
part; denying the proposed rate in whole or in part; or allowing the rate to go
into effect in whole or in part, subject to refund. If the Telecommunications
Commission issues an order allowing the rates to go into effect subject to
refund, it shall also direct the franchisee to maintain an accounting in
accordance with 47 C.F.R. § 76.933.
      (6)   The order specified in division (C)(5) above shall be issued 90
days after the tolling order for any rate the franchisee justifies based on the
FCC benchmark. The order shall be issued within 150 days of the tolling order
for any rate the franchisee justified with a cost-of-service showing.
(Prior Code, § 3-100) (Ord. 1993-15, passed 11-1-1993)
§ 111.04 RATE ORDERS GENERALLY.
   (A)   Any rate order of the Telecommunications Commission shall be effective
upon ratification thereof by the County Commissioners. Each rate order shall be
released to the public and the franchisee. In any case where the
Telecommunications Commission approves, denies or tolls a rate, orders that a
rate may go into effect subject to refund; or orders refunds or establishes
rates, the Telecommunications Commission shall cause a public notice to be
published stating that the order has issued and is available for review. Any
order shall be in writing.
   (B)   The Telecommunications Commission may take any steps that it is not
prohibited from taking by federal law to protect the public interest as part of
any rate order or by any other means. By way of illustration and not
limitation, it may require refunds, set rates and enforce refund orders. Any
order prescribing a rate must explain why the franchisee's proposed rate was
unreasonable and why the prescribed rate is reasonable. However, before
prescribing ordering a refund to subscribers, the Telecommunications Commission
shall ensure the franchisee has had notice and opportunity to comment on the
proposed rate or refunds. If the recommendations of the Telecommunications
Commission staff propose a refund or a rate, then mailing a copy of the
recommendation to the franchisee at the time they are made available for public
inspection shall be deemed to provide the franchisee this notice and the
franchisee must comment on the refund or rate in its response to the
recommendations.
   (C)   No order approving or setting a rate using the FCC benchmarks shall be
interpreted to establish the just and reasonable rate to subscribers. Every
rate approved or established shall be subject to further reduction and refund
to the extent permitted under applicable laws and regulations, as the same may
be amended from time to time. By way of illustration and not limitation, should
the FCC reduce the benchmarks, the Telecommunications Commission shall have the
right to reduce a franchisee's rates and to require the franchisee to refund
any amounts collected above the benchmark, except to the extent prohibited by
federal law.
(Prior Code, § 3-101) (Ord. 1993-15, passed 11-1-1993)
§ 111.05 FRANCHISEE'S DUTIES.
   (A)   A franchisee must implement remedial requirements, including
prospective rate reductions and refunds, within 60 days of the date the
Telecommunications Commission issues an order mandating a remedy.
   (B)   Within 90 days of the date an order mandating a remedy is issued, a
franchisee must file a certification, signed by an authorized representative of
the cable company, stating:
      (1)   Whether the franchisee has complied fully with all provisions of
the Telecommunications Commission's order;
      (2)   Describing in detail the precise measures taken to implement the
Telecommunications Commission's order; and
      (3)   Showing how refunds (including interest) were calculated and
distributed.
   (C)   It is each franchisee's responsibility to keep accurate and adequate
books and records of account so that it can properly and accurately refund any
amounts owed to subscribers.
   (D)   It is each franchisee's duty to submit as complete and accurate a
filing as possible, and knowingly withholding information or making a filing
that is incomplete or inaccurate under applicable law shall be treated as an
evasion of this chapter.
   (E)   (1)   A franchisee and any other entity that has records of revenues
or expenses that are allocated to the franchisee's system must respond to
requests for information from the Telecommunications Commission by deadlines
established by the Telecommunications Commission. A franchisee is responsible
for ensuring that other entity responds to the Telecommunications Commission's
requests.
      (2)   Because federal law limits the time available for an initial
response to a filing by a franchisee, before the order contemplated hereby
issues, the franchisee must be prepared to respond to requests for information
regarding its filing within five days of the date an information request is
mailed to it. The information may include the information the franchisee would
be required to provide as part of any supplementary filing.
(Prior Code, § 3-102) (Ord. 1993-15, passed 11-1-1993)
§ 111.06 DUTIES OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS CHAIR AND STAFF.
   (A)   The Telecommunications Commission may delegate certain
responsibilities, other than decisions required by §
111.03(B)(2) and (C)(5), to the Chair of the Telecommunications Commission or
to staff. Staff may include consultants.
   (B)   Without limitation and by way of illustration:
      (1)   The Chair or staff shall ensure notices are given to the public and
each franchisee as required herein and by FCC regulations;
      (2)   The Chair or staff may submit requests for information to the
franchisee and establish deadlines for response to them, as provided in §
111.05;
      (3)   For good cause, the Chair may waive any provision herein or extend
any deadline for filing or response except as to matters as are mandatory under
FCC regulations; and
      (4)   The Chair or staff shall prepare any recommendations to the
Telecommunications Commission contemplated hereby. If the Chair or staff
recommends that any proposed rate increase be denied in whole or in part, he or
she shall:
         (a)   Recommend a rate and explain the basis for that recommendation
(the Chair or staff may also recommend that rates remain at existing levels);
and
         (b)   Recommend whether and on what basis refunds should issue; and
         (c)   Notify the franchisee of his or her recommendations at the time
they are submitted to the Telecommunications Commission.
(Prior Code, § 3-103) (Ord. 1993-15, passed 11-1-1993)
§ 111.07 PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.
   (A)   (1)   If these provisions, or any request for information, requires
the production of proprietary information, the franchisee must produce the
information. However, at the time the allegedly proprietary information is
submitted, a franchisee may request that specific, identified portions of its
response be treated as confidential and withheld from public disclosure. The
request must identify specifically what portions of the information are
requested to receive confidential treatment; must state the reason why the
franchisee believes the information should be treated as proprietary; and must
set forth the facts (and legal argument where appropriate) that support those
reasons. The request for confidentiality will be granted if the
Telecommunications Commission determines that the preponderance of the evidence
shows that non-disclosure is consistent with the provisions of the Freedom of
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, The Telecommunications Commission shall place
in a public file for inspection any decision that results in information being
withheld. If the franchisee requests confidentiality and the request is denied:
         (a)   Where the franchisee is proposing a rate increase, it may
withdraw the proposal, in which case the allegedly proprietary information will
be returned to it; or
         (b)   The franchisee may seek review within five working days of the
denial in any appropriate forum.
      (2)   Release of the information will be stayed pending review.
   (B)   Any interested party may file with the Telecommunications Commission a
request to inspect material withheld as proprietary. The Telecommunications
Commission shall weigh the policy considerations favoring non-disclosure
against the reasons cited for permitting inspection in light of the facts of
the particular case. The Telecommunications Commission will then promptly
notify the requesting entity and the cable franchisee that submitted the
information as to the disposition of the request. The Telecommunications
Commission may grant, deny or condition a request. The requesting party or the
franchisee may seek review of the decision by filing an appeal with any
appropriate forum. Disclosure will be stayed pending resolution of any appeal.
(Prior Code, § 3-104) (Ord. 1993-15, passed 11-1-1993)
§ 111.08 PETITION FOR CHANGE IN STATUS.
   Any franchisee may petition for a change in status in accordance with Title
47 of the Code of Federal Regulations and the Telecommunications Commission
shall consider that petition in accordance with Title 47 of the Code of Federal
Regulations. The petition and five copies must be filed with the
Telecommunications Commission.
(Prior Code, § 3-105) (Ord. 1993-15, passed 11-1-1993)
§ 111.09 FILING AND PROSECUTING COMPLAINTS CONCERNING CABLE PROGRAMMING
SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT.
   The Telecommunications Commission is authorized to file complaints at the
FCC regarding the rates charged by cable franchisees for services and equipment
associated with cable programming services. The Telecommunications Commission
may take additional steps as may be appropriate to ensure that a reasonable
rate is established for cable programming services.

entire length of the road based upon the major tendency of the road running
north to south or east to west. Roads which are broken in continuity shall be

geographical grid system described below. The county house numbering grid
system shall consist of a series of parallel lines running due east and west
and due north and south and located every 300 feet. The two base lines to be
used in locating the parallel lines and the grid system shall be a line running
due north and south and a line running due east and west, both of which shall
pass through a reference point located 1,320 feet south of and 1,370 feet east
of the northwest corner of Section 25, Township 9 North, Range 6 East, in the
county. All buildings shall be consistently and consecutively numbered from the
appropriate base line in the manner described below. Each building located on
or having an access road or driveway intersecting a road designated as a north-
south road shall be assigned a north or south number with reference to its
distance, north or south, from the base line described above running due east
and west. Each building located on or having an access road or driveway
intersecting a road designated as an east-west road shall be assigned an east
or west number with reference to its distance, east or west, from the base line
described above running due north and south. Even numbers shall be assigned to
buildings located on or having an access road or driveway intersecting the
north side of an east-west road or the west side of a north-south road. Odd
numbers shall be assigned to buildings located on or having an access road or
driveway intersecting the south side of an east-west road or the east side of a
north-south road.

conspicuous place near the outside front entrance of the building, a number
plainly indicating by appropriate figures the number assigned to the building.
Provided, however, that, if a building is not visible from a road or if a
building is 200 feet or more from a road, the assigned number shall be
displayed at the entrance to the access road or driveway to the building by
means of a separate marker or by means of a mailbox as set forth below. All
numbers attached to a building or placed on a separate marker indicating the
number assigned to the building shall be of durable, weatherproof material and
of a size not less than one and one-fourth inches by two inches. The assigned
numbers shall also be placed on each side of any mailbox serving the building.
   (B)   Where mailboxes are grouped, the numbers shall be displayed on the
front or lid of each box.
   (C)   Where a mailbox is on a different road than the building, the number
of the building and the appropriate road name or number shall also be displayed

   (B)   Upon being informed of the exact existing or proposed location of a
building, the Chief Technical Code Enforcement Officer shall designate and
verify to the owner, occupant or builder of any existing or proposed building
the proper number of the building. Any decision of the Chief Technical Code
Enforcement Officer concerning the numbering of a building may be appealed to
the County Plan Commission for review. In order for any appeal to be considered
by the Plan Commission, the person, firm or corporation seeking the review
shall submit a written statement setting forth in appropriate detail the reason
for the appeal. The Plan Commission shall have the authority to overturn and
change any decision of the Chief Technical Code Enforcement Officer concerning
the numbering of a building. No owner or occupant of a building may change the
number of the building without first obtaining the approval of Chief Technical
Code Enforcement Officer. The Chief Technical Code Enforcement Officer shall
maintain a current set of reproducible maps covering all of the county showing
the numbers assigned to buildings. Copies of the maps may be made available to
persons, firms or corporations requesting the copies upon the approval of the
Board of Commissioners. In order for any request to be considered by the Board
of Commissioners, the person, firm or corporation making the request shall

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 155.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   Findings. The Board of Commissioners of Bartholomew County, Indiana
finds that:
      (1)   Excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing
development for certain non-agricultural uses including but not limited to the
construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings, and industrial plants,
the building of roads and streets, and the creation of recreational facilities;
      (2)   Sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to
pollute and silt rivers, streams, ponds, lakes, and reservoirs;
      (3)   Sediment limits the use of water and waterways for the most
beneficial purposes and has resulted in the deterioration of the water
resources of the county;
      (4)   Sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways, resulting in
increased chances of flooding at risk to public health and safety;
      (5)   Adopting standards, criteria and procedures contained in this
chapter and implementing the same will address many of the detrimental effects
associated with land development;
      (6)   Adopting these standards is necessary for the preservation of the
soils and topography of the county as well as the public health, safety and
welfare; and
      (7)   The county has the authority to adopt an erosion and sediment
control ordinance pursuant to I.C. 36-9-23-1 et seq., by home rule and further
as required by Phase II of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
Stormwater program (40 C.F.R. Parts 9, 122, 123, and 124; December 8, 1999)
authorized by the 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act, the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management's (IDEM) Municipal Separate Storm Sewer
System (MS4) General Permit (MS4 GP), and the Indiana Department of
Environmental Management's Construction Stormwater General Permit (CSGP).
   (B)   Purpose. The Board of Commissioners of the county hereby declares that
the purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum erosion and sediment
control and pollution prevention requirements to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety and welfare of the public by guiding, regulating and
controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of any development or
other land altering activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise
results in the movement of earth within the defined boundaries of the county
and as specified herein.

§ 155.03 GENERAL PRINCIPLES.
   (A)   It is the objective of this chapter to control pollution, soil erosion
and sedimentation caused by land disturbing activities within the county.
Measures taken to control erosion and sedimentation shall be adequate to assure
that pollutants and sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event.
The following principles shall apply to all development activities within the
county's jurisdiction and the preparation of the submissions required under §§
155.15 through
155.25.
   (B)   Development should be related to the existing topography and soils of
the site so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes
where high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible,
and natural contours should be followed as closely as possible.
   (C)   Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible.
Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses should be left unaltered
wherever possible.
   (D)   Topsoil shall be preserved, unless infeasible.
   (E)   Existing natural buffers that are adjacent to waters of the state
shall be preserved to promote infiltration and provide protection of the water
resource, unless infeasible. Activities performed by a county drainage board
under I.C. 36-9-27 are excluded.
      (1)   Natural buffers shall be preserved, including the entire buffer
bordering and/or surrounding the water resource. Existing buffers:
         (a)   50 feet or more in width shall be preserved to a minimum of 50
feet.
         (b)   Less than 50 feet in width shall be preserved in their entirety
and may be enhanced with vegetation that is native and promotes ecological
improvement and sustainability.
      (2)   Runoff directed to the natural buffer shall be:
         (a)   Treated with appropriate erosion and sediment control measures
prior to discharging to the buffer.
         (b)   Managed with appropriate runoff control measures to prevent
erosion from occurring within the buffer area.
      (3)   Further information regarding CSGP buffer requirements is contained
in IDEM's “Implementation of Buffers” guidance document.
   (F)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest
practical time during development.
   (G)   Sediment basins, debris basins, desilting basins or silt traps or
filters should be installed and maintained to remove sediment from runoff
waters from land altering activity or development.
   (H)   The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be
based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events
likely to contribute to erosion, and on evaluation of the risks, costs and
benefits involved.
   (I)   In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics
and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered.
   (J)   Provisions should be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused
by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development.
Drainageways should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant
velocities of discharge will not create additional erosion.
   (K)   Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed as soon as
practical during development.
   (L)   Post construction measures should be considered for their ability to
provide long-term reduction in associated pollutant loading and flow rate of
the waterways.

§ 155.04 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Written deficiency notice.
      (1)   If land disturbance activities are conducted contrary to the
provisions of this chapter or accepted plans approved during review of the
SWPPP, the county may notify the project site owner in writing of the
deficiencies.
      (2)   If the deficiencies are not resolved 72 hours after receipt of the
written notice, a written notice of violation shall be issued and served on any
person engaged in the doing or causing of such work to be done.
   (B)   Notice of violation.
      (1)   Whenever the county or their designee finds that a person has
violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the
county may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible
person.
      (2)   The notice of violation shall be in writing, include a description
of the property for identification and include a statement of the violation(s)
and why the notice is being issued. The notice of violation shall provide at
least ten days to bring the property into compliance.
      (3)   If abatement of violation and/or restoration of affected property
is required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration shall be completed. Said notice shall further advise
that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established
deadline, the work will be done by the county and the expense thereof shall be
charged to the violator.
   (C)   Stop work order.
      (1)   In the event that any person holding site development approval
pursuant to this chapter violates the terms of the approval or implements site
development in a manner as to materially and adversely affect the health,
welfare or safety of persons residing or working in the neighborhood or
development site or so as to be materially detrimental to the public welfare or
injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood, the county may
suspend or revoke the site development approval by issuing a stop-work order.
      (2)   The stop-work order shall be served upon any person engaged in the
accomplishment of the construction activity. The construction activity so
affected shall be stopped forthwith and until a future time as authorization to
resume work is granted by the Engineering Department.

MINOR SUBDIVISIONS
§ 156.035 GENERAL.
   Those subdivisions meeting the definition of “subdivision, minor” contained
in §
156.006 may be considered under the provisions of this chapter. Replats meeting
the conditions of eligibility contained herein also may be considered under the
provisions of this chapter. After a subdivision request has been filed, the
Planning Director shall determine whether the petition may be considered as a
minor subdivision. The Planning Director’s decision may be appealed to the
Commission. Minor subdivisions may receive primary approval by the Plat
Committee or Plan Commission and secondary approval by the official designated
in §
156.213.
(Prior Code, § 8-33) (Ord. 1994-02, passed 1-24-1994)
§ 156.036 CONDITIONS OF ELIGIBILITY.
   Before determining that a subdivision is eligible to be considered under
this chapter, the Planning Director shall find that all of the following
criteria are satisfied.
   (A)   Orderly development. The subdivision will not impede orderly
development of land or the provision of public services and improvements.
      (1)   The subdivision will not interfere with the implementation of the
Comprehensive Plan.
      (2)   The subdivision will not interfere with the provision of streets to
provide access to adjoining or nearby property in the event that the property
is developed in the future.
   (B)   Utilities and drainage. All parcels in the subdivision will have
adequate utilities and drainage.
      (1)   All lots shall be served by a sanitary sewer or other sewerage
system approved by the State Department of Health or they shall have the
capability to contain a subsurface disposal system which complies with all
requirements of the State Department of Health and the County Health
Department. Any subdivision of land which requires the extension of existing
sewers or the construction of new treatment facilities shall be considered as a
major subdivision. If extension of sewer service is found to be a feasible
alternative and is desirable because of soil conditions, topography, lot sizes
or other factors, the petition shall be considered as a major subdivision.
      (2)   All lots shall be served by a public or quasi-public water system
or shall have the capability to contain a well which complies with all
requirements of the State Department of Health and the County Health
Department.
      (3)   All lots shall be provided with drainage improvements as necessary
to comply with the requirements of §§
156.090 through
156.099.
   (C)   Access. All parcels in the subdivision and adjacent land will have
adequate ingress and egress without the construction of any new streets or
substantial improvement to existing streets.
      (1)   All lots will have legal access to a platted private street or to a
public street which has been accepted for maintenance by, or has been
continuously maintained for a period of ten years immediately preceding the
filing of the subdivision, by a public agency regularly having responsibility
for the maintenance.
      (2)   Frontage on limited access streets on which driveways cannot open
shall not constitute legal access.
      (3)   If, by reason of topography, natural or human-made features or
other conditions relating to the property requested for subdivision, better
access can be provided through construction of a new street, the petition shall
be considered as a major subdivision.
         (a)   For the purposes of this division, any subdivision that involves
the cumulative creation of no more than four new buildable lots, excluding any
that are permitted through an administrative subdivision process, shall not
require road improvements or the construction of new streets. Such subdivisions
shall be considered as having been provided with the best possible access
through individual driveways, provided that the areas available for driveway
locations meet all applicable requirements of this chapter, the Zoning
Ordinance and the County Engineer. In no instance shall this be interpreted as
waiving the required dedication of right-of-way along the frontage of any new
lots created, consistent with §
156.092(A)
         (b)   Any subdivision that involves the cumulative creation of more
than four new buildable lots, excluding any that are permitted through an
administrative subdivision process, shall not be approved by the Plat
Committee, but shall instead be forwarded to the Plan Commission. The Plan
Commission shall consider the thoroughfare plan and the specifications of this
chapter for new roads in determining adequate ingress and egress, any needed
road improvements, and whether or not better access can be provided through the
construction of a new street. If the Plan Commission determines that a new
street is required and/or that road improvements are required, and they are
substantial, the application shall be considered a major subdivision and shall
be refiled as such.
         (c)   The four buildable lots shall be calculated from the effective
date of this chapter, October 21, 1986.
         (d)   The use of an access easement, consistent with §
156.096, shall not be considered as the extension or construction of a private
street.
      (4)   All lots will have driveway locations which will provide for
adequate sight distance and will be properly spaced according to county
standards.
      (5)   Land adjacent to the property involved in the subdivision also will
have adequate access according to the criteria contained in this section.
   (D)   Suitability. All lots in the subdivision will provide suitable
building sites for the purpose for which the land is to be used. Land
suitability shall be determined by the criteria contained in §
156.091.
   (E)   Endangerment. The subdivision will not be detrimental to nor endanger
the public health, safety or general welfare.

§ 156.059 MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS WITH AGRICULTURAL REMAINDERS.
   (A)   A major subdivision which has a parent tract remainder meeting the
criteria for an agricultural subdivision may be subdivided under the provisions
of this chapter, with the agricultural portion of the property shown on the
drawing to be recorded based upon an existing deed description.
   (B)   If the size and configuration of the property makes it impractical to
show the agricultural remainder at the same scale as the minor subdivision, a
smaller scale may be used; provided that, except in extreme circumstances, the
scale shall be no smaller than one inch equals 400 feet. The staff may approve
a smaller scale only when the applicant demonstrates that unusual conditions
exist related to the size and configuration of the property which make it
impractical to use the required scale.
(Prior Code, § 8-45) (Ord. 1987-01, passed 7-27-1987)
§ 156.060 PHASES.
   The Commission may permit the development of a subdivision to take place in
phases. In reviewing a request for phased development, the Commission shall
consider the factors listed in this section.
   (A)   Design standards. The relationship of the number and configuration of
the lots in each phase shall conform to the design standards of this chapter.
   (B)   Improvements. The improvements in each phase shall be adequate to
serve the lots to be developed in that phase.
   (C)   Non-completion of subdivision. The Commission shall attempt to ensure
that each phase of the subdivision will conform to the intent and purposes of
this chapter in the event that some phases are not completed.
(Prior Code, § 8-46) (Ord. 1986-7, passed 10-21-1986)
COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL AND MULTI-FAMILY SUBDIVISIONS
§ 156.075 GENERAL.
   (A)   Commercial, industrial and multi-family subdivisions are recognized as
having a different character and different requirements from those established
for residential neighborhoods.
   (B)   Any land zoned or intended to be used for commercial, industrial or
multi-family purposes shall be subject to the requirements of this subchapter,
as well as all other applicable provisions of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 8-50) (Ord. 1986-7, passed 10-21-1986)
§ 156.076 CLASSIFICATION.
   Commercial, industrial and multi-family subdivisions may be classified as
minor or major subdivisions according to the definitions in §
156.006 and are subject to all requirements relating to that classification.
(Prior Code, § 8-51) (Ord. 1986-7, passed 10-21-1986)
§ 156.077 REQUIRED SUBMISSION MATERIALS.
   (A)   Applicants for approval of a subdivision under this subchapter shall
submit all materials specified in this chapter for the appropriate
classification of subdivision.
   (B)   The subdivisions are required to meet the design and improvement
standards for commercial, industrial and multi-family subdivisions as specified
in §§
156.090 through
156.099 and
156.110 through
156.118.
(Prior Code, § 8-52) (Ord. 1986-7, passed 10-21-1986)
DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS
§ 156.090 GENERAL.
   The standards contained in this chapter apply to all minor and major
subdivisions. All subdivisions shall be designed with consideration given to
the topography of the land and other natural characteristics of the site and
surrounding property.
(Prior Code, § 8-55) (Ord. 1986-7, passed 10-21-1986)
§ 156.091 LAND SUITABILITY.
   If the Commission finds that the property requested to be subdivided is
unsuitable for development because of flooding, topography, inadequate water
supply, inadequate sewage disposal or other conditions which may endanger
health, life or property, the Commission shall not approve the land for
subdivision. As a minimum, the Commission is empowered to approve the
subdivision of land only after it finds that the land meets the following
criteria.
   (A)   Steep slopes. For subdivisions with lots which will be served by
individual subsurface disposal systems, each lot will contain a contiguous land
area with slopes of less than 10% providing a suitable site for a filter field
which contains at least the minimum lot area required by the State Department
of Health. The remainder of the lot may contain slopes of 10% or greater. The
soil survey of the county shall be used to determine steep slopes.
   (B)   Water bodies. Each lot will contain a contiguous land area providing a
suitable building site which is at least 75% of the minimum lot size
established by the Zoning Ordinance. The remaining 25% of the required minimum
lot size may contain permanent or seasonal water bodies.
   (C)   Sewage disposal. Each lot will be served by an existing public or
private sewer system or a proposed system design approved by the State
Department of Health and the County Health Department or each lot will contain
enough land of a soil type suitable for septic tanks to permit installation of
an individual subsurface disposal system of sufficient size to accommodate the
wastewater generated by the uses permitted on the property. The permeability
ratings contained in the soil survey of the county shall be used as a basis for
determining land suitability for subsurface disposal systems, unless an on-site
soil evaluation by a qualified soil scientist shows that other soil types are
found on the property. The Department or Commission may request that any
evaluation be reviewed by the Soil Conservation Service. If the soil survey
indicates that absorption fields are to be located in soils having severe
limitations for the systems, each lot will be large enough to accommodate two
absorption fields, each containing at least 1,200 square feet of trench bottom.
   (D)   Water service. Each lot will have an adequate supply of potable water
through a public or community system approved by the State Department of Health
or by individual wells. If the lots are to be served by individual wells, a
letter from the County Health Department certifying that a well meeting the
locational requirements of current applicable regulations can be located on
each lot shall be required.
   (E)   Flood hazards. Each lot will contain enough land which is not located
in a floodway, as defined by the Zoning Ordinance, to accommodate the permitted
use(s) of the property and, if required, an individual subsurface disposal
system. In general, lots consisting entirely of land located in a flood hazard
area shall not be approved for subdivision, unless there is no property
included in the parent tract which is located outside the flood hazard area
which can reasonably be subdivided to provide a building site.
(Prior Code, § 8-56) (Ord. 1986-7, passed 10-21-1986; Ord. 1987-01, passed 1-
26-1987)
§ 156.092 STREETS.
   Streets must be designed with regard to topography, soil characteristics,
natural features, function, clarity of movement and economy of street length.
The layout of new streets shall be designed in relation to existing streets.
Where deemed appropriate by the Commission, access to existing streets shall be
provided. The Commission may require the subdivision to have more than one
point of ingress and egress. The arrangement and character of all streets shall
conform to the Official Thoroughfare Plan of the county.
   (A)   Right-of-way. The owners of property to be subdivided on existing
streets shall dedicate any additional right-of-way necessary to comply with the
minimum standards of the Thoroughfare Plan. Where topography, design features
or other conditions necessitate additional right-of-way or easements to permit
construction of a street to the established standards for the street, the
Commission may require dedication of the right-of-way or establishment of the
easements.
   (B)   Extension of streets. Where the Commission deems appropriate, streets
shall be extended to the subdivision boundary line to provide for existing and
future traffic circulation.
   (C)   Dead-end streets. Permanent dead-end streets shall not be permitted.
Temporary dead-end streets shall be permitted only as part of a continuing
street plan and where more than one lot long must be provided with temporary
turn-arounds meeting the specifications in §
156.133.
   (D)   Alleys. Alleys shall not be permitted in residential subdivisions. The
Commission may permit alleys in commercial or industrial subdivisions if it
finds that alleys are the best means of serving the subdivision. The alleys
shall have a minimum right-of-way width of 20 feet and a minimum pavement width
of 16 feet.
   (E)   Geometric standards. The minimum geometric standards shall be as shown
on
Table § 156.092(1).

NOTES TO TABLE:
(1)   The pavement cross slope shall be between 1/4 inch per foot and 3/8 inch
per foot.
(2)   The shoulder cross slope shall be between ½ inch per foot and one inch
per foot.
(3)   The minimum grade shall be 0.10%.
(4)   For arterial and collector streets, at least 2 feet of the shoulders
shall be stone or paved.
(5)   The right-of-way shall be adequate for construction and maintenance of
pavement, shoulders and ditches. The Commission may require an additional
right-of-way as it deems necessary for these purposes, or may reduce the
required right-of-way widths if the applicant provides justification deemed
adequate by the Commission.
(6)   The pavement widths shown on this table are for streets and roads having
a typical shoulder section. For each parking lane, an additional 8 feet of
pavement shall be provided, and for curb and gutter an additional 2 feet shall
be provided. At least one parking lane shall be provided on all roads with curb
and gutter.
(7)   Residential subdivision streets shall be designed according to the
traffic volumes shown on this table assuming 8 trips per lot per day.
(8)   The minimum outside radius and approach radius of the pavement of a cul-
de-sac shall be 50 feet. Cul-de-sac streets shall not exceed 1,000 feet in
length, and in no case shall more than 15 lots have frontage on a single cul-
de-sac. In all other respects, cul-de-sac streets shall meet all standards for
subdivision streets.
(9)   The minimum outside radius of a temporary turn-around shall be 50 feet.
Any turn-around shown on the construction plans shall be installed in
conformance with the standards set forth in § 156.133.

Vertical alignment with intersection    50% of approach grade
 
   (G)   Vertical alignment. All changes of grade shall be connected by
vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent to 85 times the algebraic
difference in the rate of grade, expressed in feet per hundred, for arterial
streets, 55 times the algebraic difference for collector streets and 35 times
the algebraic difference for local and other minor streets. The minimum length
of the vertical curve shall be 180 feet for arterial, 120 feet for collectors
and 90 feet for local or minor streets.
   (H)   Half-streets. Dedication of new half-streets shall not be permitted.
Where a dedicated or platted half-street is adjacent to a tract being
subdivided, the other half of the half-street shall be platted and constructed.
   (I)   State highways. If any subdivision or any lot therein abuts a state
highway, evidence of compliance with all applicable regulations of the State
Department of Transportation shall be required.
   (J)   Improvements. When subdividing property which involves the
construction of new streets, the subdivider shall be required to install all
improvements specified by the Commission in accordance with this chapter. When
a subdivider owns and proposes to subdivide property on only one side of an
existing street, the subdivider shall be required to install improvements
specified by the Commission in accordance with this chapter for a minimum of
one-half of the road and right-of-way width. The Commission may require the
additional improvements as it deems necessary to make the existing street
suitable for the safe movement of traffic to be generated by the proposed
subdivision. When the Commission deems it in the best interest of the county,
it may require improvements equivalent in cost to the required half right-of-
way improvements to be made over the entire right-of-way or any portion
thereof, or it may accept an equivalent amount of money to be used for county
street improvements.
   (K)   Topography and arrangement.
      (1)   Streets shall be related appropriately to the natural topography.
Where appropriate to the topography, streets shall be arranged so as to provide
building sites which are at or above the grades of the streets to the maximum
practical extent. Grades of streets shall conform as closely as possible to the
original topography.
      (2)   All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of thoroughfares.
      (3)   All arterial and collector streets shall be properly related to
special traffic generators such as industries, business districts, schools,
churches and shopping centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of
existing and proposed land uses.
      (4)   Local and subdivision streets shall be laid out to conform as
nearly as possible to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic and
to permit efficient drainage and utility systems.
      (5)   Proposed collector streets shall, where the Commission deems
appropriate, be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided.
(Prior Code, § 8-57) (Ord. 1986-7, passed 10-21-1986)
§ 156.093 BLOCKS.
   (A)   Width. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of
lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be
permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads and waterways.
   (B)   Arrangement. The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be such as
are appropriate for the locality and the type of development permitted. Block
lengths in residential areas shall not exceed 1,400 feet nor be less than 400
feet in length. Wherever practical, blocks along arterial and collector streets
shall not be less than 1,000 feet in length. Irregularly shaped blocks may be
approved by the Commission if it finds that a pattern is appropriate to the
land to be subdivided and is properly designed.
   (C)   Pedestrian ways. Pedestrian ways not less than ten feet in width may
be required through the center of blocks more than 800 feet long or at other
appropriate locations and at the ends of cul-de-sacs where the Commission deems
the ways desirable to provide for circulation or access to neighboring uses. In
determining whether pedestrian ways are required, the Commission shall consider
methods of maintaining the ways and their usefulness in providing access to any
common open space, water areas, recreation areas, schools, churches and other
surrounding uses.
   (D)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be required on each side of the street when
the subdivision contains three or more lots per acre or is adjacent to
subdivisions containing sidewalks or where necessary to provide access to
school sites.
   (E)   Curb and gutter. Curb and gutter shall be required on all new streets
in subdivisions designed for three or more lots per acre.
(Prior Code, § 8-58) (Ord. 1986-7, passed 10-21-1986; Ord. 1988-08, passed 4-
25-1988)
§ 156.094 UTILITY PARCELS.
   Utility parcels may be provided as locations for utility-owned substations,
sanitary sewer lift stations, water towers, and the like. Utility parcels may
not be provided, however, for drainage ponds or other storm water
infrastructure that is not owned and operated by a public utility. Utility
parcels may not be the location of any non-utility structures and are not
intended for use by utility offices, shop buildings, or other facilities that
are not directly a component of a distribution or collection system. All
utility parcels shall be labeled on all plats as “Utility Parcel - Unbuildable”
followed by the use for which each is established, such as “Water Tower”, “Lift
Station”, and the like. The need for a utility parcel, its size, and cost to
the utility, if any, shall be determined by the property owner and/or property
developer together with the relevant utility. The provisions of this chapter
allowing the creation of utility parcels shall not be interpreted as a
requirement by the county for any property owner to donate a utility parcel.
(Ord. 4, 2021, passed 6-21-2021)
§ 156.095 LOTS.
   (A)   Arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that all lots will have
satisfactory building sites, properly related to topography and surrounding
land and uses. Each lot shall comply with the minimum requirements of the
Zoning Ordinance and with all applicable health regulations. Each lot shall be
capable of providing safe, usable driveway access.
   (B)   Frontage. Each lot shall have its full frontage on a dedicated street
or approved access easement. To the fullest extent practical, residential lots
shall front on residential subdivision streets in a manner as to provide
neighborhood cohesiveness. Lots laid out in long lines along arterial,
collector or local streets shall be avoided.
   (C)   Depth. The depth to width ratio of any single-family residential lot
shall not be greater than three to one for any lot smaller than one acre.
   (D)   Side lot lines. All side lot lines shall be at right angles to street
lines and radial to curved street lines, except where the Commission determines
that a variation to this rule would provide a better layout.
   (E)   Double frontage lots. Double frontage residential lots shall be
avoided, except when the Commission determines that the lots are essential to
provide separation of residential development from streets. The lots shall be
provided with a landscape buffer area at least ten feet in depth which provides
a visual screen and prevents vehicular access to one of the two frontages.
Double frontage non-residential lots are acceptable, however, the Commission
may require a landscape buffer area at least ten feet in depth which provides a
visual screen and prevents vehicular access to one of the two frontages.
   (F)   Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently larger than interior
lots to allow maintenance of setback lines on both streets.
   (G)   Shape. Lots shall be designed to provide suitable building sites and
related yard areas. Irregularly shaped lots may be permitted by the Commission
where it deems a pattern to be more appropriate to the site conditions than
regular shapes. Financial advantage for the subdivider and/or the ability to
create a larger number of lots is not in itself sufficient reason for allowing
irregular shapes.
   (H)   Access from arterial streets. In general, lots shall not derive direct
access from an arterial street. Where driveway access from the street is the
only possible access for several adjoining lots, the Commission may require
that the lots be served by a combined marginal access street in order to limit
the possible traffic hazards from multiple access to the streets. The
Commission may require that driveways be designed and arranged so as to avoid
the necessity for vehicles to back into traffic on arterial, collector or local
streets.
   (I)   Driveway separation. Driveway locations shall conform to the following
requirements for separation:
 
Minimum Distance Between Drives or to Nearest Intersection
Street Type Residential Drive   Commercial or Industrial Drive
Arterial    300 ft.*            600 ft.
Collector   200 ft., if allowed 200 ft.
Local       100 ft.             100 ft.
Subdivision One per lot         100 ft.
NOTES TO TABLE:
*   It is the intent of Ord. 1988-08 to avoid residential driveways directly
onto arterial streets whenever possible. When the driveways are necessary, it
is preferable to have a minimum number of access points. Therefore, in some
cases, it may be preferable to locate two driveways immediately adjacent,
rather than to use the 300 feet separation.

§ 156.096 EASEMENTS AND RESERVED RIGHT-OF-WAY CORRIDORS.
   (A)   Access easements and/or reserved right-of-way corridors. Access
easements and/or reserved right-of-way corridors may be used to provide legal
access to residential lots under the conditions set forth in this section.
These corridors are privately owned but must be available as access to serve
future subdivisions. Access easement and/or reserved right-of-way corridors
providing legal access to land shall, to the fullest extent possible, be so
located as to be suitable for future public streets meeting the standards set
forth in this section. Reserved right-of-way will be required when the Plan
Commission deems it necessary or desirable to provide proper access in the
future.
      (1)   The following standards shall apply to access easement and reserved
right-of-way corridors:
         (a)   Type A corridor. This type is allowed only under the following
conditions:
            1.   When lot size, topography, flood hazard areas, or other
natural or existing features prevent further subdivision. This determination
shall be made by the department pursuant to this section. The owner may appeal
the department’s decision.
            2.   When an existing drive serves an existing house that is being
divided from a parent tract. In this case, the note in §
156.152 shall appear on the recorded subdivision plat or drawing.
         (b)   Type B corridor. This type of corridor is required when further
subdivision and expansion of subject property and or adjacent property is
possible. Any Type B corridor shall be labeled on the plat or drawing as
“access easement” or “reserved right-of-way”. A reserved right-of-way corridor
shall include automatic dedication certificate specified in §
156.152 .
      (2)   Type A and Type B corridors may serve a maximum of ten lots as
specified in Table 8-1, provided that such corridors comply with the minimum
design standards contained in Table 8-1. Higher standards than these minimum
requirements may be applied if the Plan Commission finds that there are special
conditions which necessitate such higher standards.

         (h)   When more than one lot is served by an access easement or
reserved right-of-way corridor, there shall be restrictive covenants adequate
to ensure proper maintenance.
         (i)   Whenever an access easement or reserved right-of-way corridor
crosses a lot or agricultural remainder where future dedication of the corridor
would create separate buildable lot(s), agricultural tract(s), or unbuildable
remnant(s), the land so crossed shall be platted as separate lot(s), tract(s)
or unbuildable parcel(s) at the time the corridor is created.
         (j)   The plat committee may approve subdivisions with a maximum four
lots served by an access easement or a reserved right-of-way corridor. Plats
containing more than four lots served by such corridor may be approved only by
the County Plan Commission. No more than ten lots shall be served by the same
access easement or reserved right-of-way. A public street meeting the standards
of this ordinance is required for any subdivision containing more than ten lots
receiving access from the same corridor.
      (4)   Secondary approval shall not be granted for a subdivision that
requires certified construction plans and improvements, as described above,
unless the owner does the following:

(Prior Code, § 8-60) (Ord. 1986-7, passed 10-21-1986; Ord. 1998-11, passed 8-
17-1998; Ord. 4, 2021, passed 6-21-2021)
§ 156.097 DRAINAGE.
   The Commission shall not approve any subdivision which does not make
adequate provision for installation and maintenance of an adequate storm water
drainage system. A drainage plan shall be submitted with all computations and
backup data describing the storm drainage system. This report shall be reviewed
by the County Engineer and County Surveyor who shall make recommendations
regarding it to the Commission.
   (A)   Methodology. The storm water drainage system shall be separate and
independent of any sanitary sewer system. The storm water drainage system shall
be designed by the Rational Method or other method approved by the County
Engineer and a copy of the design computations shall be submitted with the
plans. Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried across or
around any intersection, nor for a distance of more than 600 feet in a gutter,
or when the encroachment of storm water into the street disrupts traffic. When
calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further
allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point and catch basins or inlets
shall be used to intercept flow at that point. Surface water drainage patterns
shall be shown for each lot and block.
      (1)   Runoff. Drainage systems shall be designed so that there is no
increase in the rate of runoff leaving the property involved in the subdivision
after development. The County Engineer shall review the proposed drainage
facilities and provide the Commission with an opinion as to whether the system
is of sufficient size, based upon the provisions of the required construction
standards and specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed
development permitted by the Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   Downstream areas. The applicant shall provide information for
review by the Department and County Engineer regarding the effect of each
proposed subdivision on existing drainage facilities outside the area of the
subdivision. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the
development of the subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage
facility, the Commission shall not approve the subdivision until provision has
been made for the improvement of the potential condition.
      (3)   Areas of poor drainage. Areas which are not in designated floodway
or floodway fringe areas, but contain soils which are subject to flooding may
be approved for subdivision by the Commission; provided that, the applicant
fills the affected areas of the subdivision to an elevation sufficient to place
building sites (including septic system locations) and streets two feet above
ponding levels.
   (B)   Drainage patterns. Natural drainage patterns and natural stream
channels shall be maintained wherever possible.
   (C)   Blocks and lots. Each block shall be adequately drained, either
through the streets or by the use of a ditch, culvert or other approved method.
Each lot shall be graded in accordance with the standards set forth in the
Erosion Control Handbook.
   (D)   Streets. All roads abutting or included within property to be
subdivided shall be provided with drainage systems in accordance with the
standards contained in this chapter.
   (E)   Erosion control. Any disturbed or graded area shall be protected from
erosion in accordance with the Erosion Control Handbook.
   (F)   Retention ponds. The Commission may require retention ponds to
regulate the flow at the outfall. The ponds shall be protected from erosion in
accordance with the Erosion Control Handbook. The ponds shall be designed and
constructed to enable adequate access for maintenance.
   (G)   Off-road drainage. Off-road drainage systems shall be extended to a
watercourse or ditch of adequate size to receive the storm water.
   (H)   Connections to existing systems. Connection to a state drainage system
is allowed only with written approval from the State Department of
Transportation. Connection to a county legal drain is allowed only with written
approval in accordance with the Indiana Code requirements for local drains.
Connection to a county road ditch is allowed only with written approval from
the County Engineer.
   (I)   Maintenance of drainage systems. The Commission shall not approve any
subdivision for which adequate provision for maintenance of drainage systems
has not been made. The provision may include, but is not limited to, acceptance
of the system by the County Drainage Board or establishment of a lot owners
association with responsibility to set and collect fees for drainage system
maintenance. Roadside ditches shall not be filled without written approval of
the County Engineer.
   (J)   Drainage report. The drainage report shall identify the applicable
areas of concern and problem areas as listed on the selection matrix contained
in the Erosion Control Handbook and shall indicate the control strategies for
these problem areas. The report shall indicate the existing and proposed
drainage conditions and the individual practices to be used to accomplish the
objectives of this chapter. Methods selected to control drainage shall be
consistent with the Handbook. The report shall evaluate the ability of the
proposed water course, channels, drainage tiles, farm tiles, storm sewers,
culverts and other improvements to handle the run-off. A registered
professional engineer or land surveyor shall prepare this report. The report
shall include:
      (1)   Estimates of the water entering the subdivision. Estimates shall
assume that the upper watershed will be fully developed according to the
current land use plan;
      (2)   Conditions of the watershed that may affect run-off such as subsoil
type, positive drainage channels, obstructions and so forth;
      (3)   Quantities of flow at each pickup point or culvert;
      (4)   Description of minor and major drainage systems. The minor system
will usually consist of, but not be limited to, storm sewers, drainage ditches,
drainage swales, storm inlets or infiltration structures. The minor system
shall be designed to handle a ten-year storm. The major system will usually
consist of, but not be limited to, roadways, culverts, bridges or overflow
drainage ways. The major system shall be designed to handle a 50-year storm;
      (5)   The location of all existing subsurface drainage tiles and a plan
to preserve or relocate the tiles; and
      (6)   Proposals which include holding lagoons, storm water ponds or
infiltration facilities shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer
and shall include data coordinating field tests with design assumptions and
estimates of expected annual maintenance costs.
   (K)   Erosion control plan.
      (1)   This plan shall identify the applicable areas of concern and
problem areas as listed on the selection matrix contained in the Erosion
Control Handbook and shall indicate the control strategies for these problem
areas. The plan shall indicate the proposed individual practices to be used to
accomplish the objectives of this chapter.
      (2)   Methods selected to control erosion shall be consistent with the
Handbook.

§ 156.098 MISCELLANEOUS REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Subdivisions crossing municipal or county boundaries. Lots which
straddle municipal or county boundaries should be avoided wherever practical.
If a subdivision is located in more than one jurisdiction, approvals from all
plan commissions in affected jurisdictions shall be required. If access to a
subdivision is required across land in another jurisdiction, the applicant
shall provide evidence that the access is legally established and the access
shall be permitted only if the County Engineer finds that the access road is
adequately improved or a performance bond has been duly executed to assure the
construction of the access road.
   (B)   Maintenance of improvements. Before approving any subdivision, the
Commission shall review the improvement plans and shall ensure that there are
adequate methods to maintain all improvements. The improvements include, but
are not limited to, recreation facilities, common open space, private
pedestrian ways, private sewer and water systems and drainage facilities.
   (C)   Off-site improvements. In reviewing an application for approval of a
subdivision under this section, the Commission shall consider the adequacy of
existing county roads and other facilities to serve the proposed subdivision
and may require the subdivider to make and pay for improvements deemed
necessary by the Commission. In no case shall the county be obligated to make
improvements for the purpose of making private land suitable for development.
   (D)   Oversized improvements. The Commission may require the installation of
oversized improvements where it deems the improvements to be in the best
interests of the county. In the event that the improvements are required, the
county shall be responsible for the additional cost related to the oversizing
of the required improvements.

transportation; areas for drainage runoff and, where applicable, retention
areas; parking; landscape buffers; and utilities.
   (C)   Frontage. Each lot or parcel shall have the full required frontage on
a public road meeting the minimum standards of this chapter.
   (D)   Streets. If access will be required for large trucks and/or heavy
loads, the Commission may increase the construction and design requirements
upon the recommendation of the County Engineer. Roads serving primarily non-
residential traffic, especially truck traffic, shall not normally be extended
to the boundary of adjacent tracts used or zoned for residential purposes, nor
shall primarily residential roads be used for access to industrial
subdivisions. Multi-family dwelling complexes shall be designed to discourage
traffic from using streets designed and constructed primarily for single-family
residential use.
   (E)   Alleys. Alleys may be permitted by the Commission to provide loading
and service areas. The alleys shall have a right-of-way width of at least 20
feet and a pavement width of at least 16 feet.

design or through notations placed upon the plat:
      (1)   Loading docks and parking. Loading docks, truck parking and/or
truck turnaround areas shall be designated by the use of signs and pavement
markings. These areas shall be separated from parking and access areas used by
automobiles or pedestrian traffic. Public streets shall not be used for truck
parking, standing or backing.
      (2)   Fire lanes. Fire lanes shall be required at all entrances and exits
to structures and storage areas and at all locations of hydrants, Siamese
connections, sprinkler controls or other locations deemed appropriate by the
Commission. Fire lanes shall be marked by signs and pavement markings in
accordance with current standards and specifications.
      (3)   Parking lots. Parking lots shall have a hard, dust-free surface and
shall be designed to provide safe, well-defined points of ingress and egress.
The Commission may require physical barriers, pavement markings, signs and
landscaping as it deems necessary to properly channel traffic to designated
parking entrances and exits.
      (4)   Buffers. Subdivisions containing land zoned for commercial or
multi-family use shall contain landscaped buffer areas at least 15 feet in
depth along all lot lines abutting land zoned for single-family or two-family
residential use. Subdivisions containing land zoned for industrial use shall
contain landscaped buffer areas at least 25 feet in depth along all lot lines
abutting land used or zoned for residential use. The subdivision plans must
show the planting details, including the type(s) and height of vegetation and
the caliper of trees to be planted. The landscaped buffer shall be at least six
feet in height and shall consist of materials which will form a dense screen
within two years or an opaque fence shall be constructed to accomplish this
purpose. The design and materials of the fence shall be shown on the plans.
      (5)   Snow storage. Developments which have parking, loading and driveway
areas in excess of 40,000 square feet shall contain snow storage areas.
Drainage plans shall include plans for the disposal of melt water.
   (G)   Drainage. A drainage plan meeting the specifications contained in §
156.097 shall be submitted. The system shall be designed so as to minimize the
disposal of storm water off-site. The system shall make maximum use of on-site
retention ponds or detention basins to minimize the downstream impact of the
drainage from the site.
   (H)   Water and sewer facilities. The Commission may impose requirements as
it deems necessary on the installation of water and sewer facilities.
