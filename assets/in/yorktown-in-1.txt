   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the town, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered, and consolidated into component codes,
titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the “Yorktown
Code,” for which designation “Code of Ordinances,” “Codified Ordinances” or
“Code” may be substituted. Code title, chapter, and section headings do not
constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.

same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.

   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless

   (B)   Any appropriation repealed and reenacted by this code is continued

reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or subsection.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters or sections of this code, as
originally enacted, or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered
by the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only, and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)
§ 10.05 RULES OF INTERPRETATION; DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Rules of interpretation. This code shall be construed by the following
rules unless such construction is plainly repugnant to the legislative intent

usual sense. Technical words and phrases having a peculiar and appropriate
meaning in law shall be understood according to their technical import.
      (2)   Words imputing joint authority to three or more persons shall be
construed as imputing authority to a majority of such persons, unless otherwise
declared in the section giving such authority.
      (3)   Where a section requires an act to be done which, by law, an agent
or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.
      (4)   Words denoting the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the
feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,
and words in the plural shall include the singular; the use of a verb in the
present tense shall include the future, if applicable.

definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.

§ 10.06 SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   If any section of this code now enacted or subsequently amended or its

not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid section
or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is severable.
If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of
whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a section stating that the provisions of an act are
severable as provided in division (B) does not affect the operation of division

§ 10.07 REFERENCE TO OTHER SECTIONS.
   Whenever in one section, reference is made to another section hereof, such
reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified, or renumbered unless the subject matter is
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OFFICES; NAME DESIGNATIONS.
   (A)   Reference to offices. Reference to a public office or officer shall be
deemed to apply to any office, officer, or employee of this municipality
exercising the powers, duties, or functions contemplated in the provision,
irrespective of any transfer of functions or change in the official title of
the functionary.
   (B)   Name designations. Whenever any ordinance or resolution of the Council
refers to any board, bureau, commission, division, department, officer, agency,
authority, or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; or at the time of the effective date of that ordinance or
subsequent thereto, the rights, powers, duties, or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then such named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date
or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which such duties,
liabilities, powers, and rights were transferred.
(I.C. 1-1-6-1)
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express such intent, such spelling shall be corrected and such word
or words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
such error.

reasonable time or requires reasonable notice to be given, reasonable time or
notice shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of such act or the giving of such notice.
   (B)   The time within which an act is to be done, as herein provided, shall
be computed by excluding the first day and including the last. If the last day
be a Saturday, Sunday, or a state holiday, it shall be excluded.
§ 10.11 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under
such section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. Such section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture,
or liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code shall not be affected by

(Ord. 636, passed 3-30-2009)
§ 32.118 STORMWATER SERVICE CHARGE.
   A stormwater service charge shall be imposed on each and every lot and
parcel of land within the town, or served by the town's sewage works, which
directly or indirectly contributes to the stormwater system of the town, which
charge shall be assessed against the property owner thereof, who shall be
considered the user for the purposes of this chapter. This charge is deemed
reasonable and is necessary to pay for the repair, replacement, extension,
planning, improvement, operation, regulation and maintenance of the existing
and future stormwater system.

§ 32.119 STORMWATER SERVICE CHARGE ESTABLISHMENT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Stormwater service charge per ERU. The stormwater service charge shall
be $2 per ERU per month. For the purpose of this chapter, a month shall be
considered 25 through 35 days. Any billings for stormwater service outside this
time shall be on a per diem basis.
   (B)   Basis for charge. The stormwater service charge is designed to recover
the cost of rendering stormwater service to the users of the stormwater system,
and shall be the basis for assessment of the stormwater service charge. This
service charge is established so as to maintain adequate fund reserves to
provide for reasonably expected variations in the cost of providing services,
as well as variations in the demand for services.
(Ord. 636, passed 3-30-2009)
§ 32.120 SERVICE CHARGE STRUCTURE AND CALCULATION.
   (A)   Generally. For the purposes stated in §§
32.115 and
32.119, there is hereby assessed a stormwater service charge for each property
owner owning land situated within the limits of the town, served by the town's
sewage works, including property owners within the corporate boundaries of the
Muncie Sanitary District, and also located within the corporate boundaries of
the town, that contributes directly or indirectly to the stormwater system of
the town, in an amount as determined below.
   (B)   Impervious area. For any such property, lot, parcel of land, building
or premises which contribute directly or indirectly to the stormwater system of
the town, such charge shall be based upon the quantity of impervious area
situated thereon as measured on the records of the Delaware County Assessor.
Impervious area of public rights-of-way and railroad lines (which shall not be
deemed to include adjacent property, such as a railyard, operated by a
railroad), will not be included in the determination of a stormwater service
charge. In addition, the Board shall establish policies and procedures to make
determinations whether commonly-owned, adjoining properties with separate plat
or legal descriptions should be treated as a single parcel of land for purposes
of calculating the stormwater service fees to be charged for such properties.
   (C)   Classification of property. All properties within the town, or served
by the town sewage works, will be assessed a stormwater service charge based on
equivalent residential unit (ERU), or a multiple thereof, with all properties
having impervious area assigned at least one ERU (except as otherwise provided
in division (E)), as follows:
      (1)   A monthly flat-rate charge for stormwater service rendered to
residential properties shall be assessed to each residential property's parcel
within the town limits. All residential properties are hereby assigned one ERU
and a stormwater service charge as described in this subchapter and adjusted
periodically.
      (2)   Other properties. Properties with impervious area other than
residential properties will be assigned an ERU multiple based on the total
amount of impervious area on the properly (measured in square feet and divided
by 2,500 square feet). ERU multiples shall be rounded to the nearest whole
integer.
   (D)   Land alterations. The issuance of any building permit or other action
which results in a land alteration of a property other than residential
properties or a property that currently only contains residential properties
but will be no longer used for such purpose shall be cause for an adjustment of
the stormwater service charge determined under this section. The property owner
shall have the obligation of informing the Board of any such changes.
   (E)   Exceptions/exemptions. Agricultural properties with impervious area
under State Land Use Codes 100 - 199, with the exception of those properties
that qualify as residential property, shall be exempt from the assessment of
stormwater service charges. Except for public rights-of-way, railroad lines and
agricultural properties as defined herein, there shall be no exceptions or
exemptions from the assignment of gross stormwater ERUs for any property with
impervious area except that properties other than single-family residential
parcels with impervious area of less than 500 square feet shall be exempted
from the assignment of an ERU.
   (F)   Contractual billing and collection. The town may delegate the billings
to the County Treasurer to be forwarded to customers semi-annually.
(Ord. 636, passed 3-30-2009)
§ 32.121 BILLINGS; TERMS OF PAYMENT.
   (A)   Billings. All stormwater service bills shall be rendered on a semi-
annual basis unless additional or prorated billing is required to reflect
customer changes, initial billings or is otherwise required to adjust billing
cycles. Charges for miscellaneous services or work performed on behalf of a
stormwater customer by the Department shall be assessed at the time the work is
completed and shall be included in the customer's next stormwater service bill.
Stormwater billing for a new property shall commence with the date the property
is assessed for purposes of property taxes, or date of occupancy, whichever
shall first occur. Additional stormwater charges for an established service
address necessitated by a change in the amount of impervious area at the
properly shall commence on the date the new certificate of occupancy or
compliance is issued. Billing adjustments required to correct impervious area
measurements shall be applied retroactively to the date of the customer's
initial protest.
   (B)   Rights and responsibilities of property owner. Charges for stormwater
service shall remain the ultimate responsibility of the property owner,
including all penalties, recording fees, attorney's fees, interest and court
costs. Other than the property owner, no other person shall be permitted to
inspect, examine or otherwise obtain confidential information including the
social security number of the property owner obtained by the town for the sole
purpose of billing for stormwater system service. Stormwater service charges
attach to the properly.
   (C)   Terms of payment. The stormwater service charges prescribed in §
32.120 shall be due on the payment date set out on the bill. It shall be a
violation of this subchapter to fail to pay a stormwater service bill when due.
All bills for stormwater services not paid on or before the due date shall be
subject to a collection or deferred payment charge of 10% on the outstanding
balance. Moving from one location to another in no way absolves the customer
from responsibility for any unpaid charges incurred at a previous location.
   (D)   Bad check charge. Checks returned for non-sufficient funds will be
subject to reimbursement of the fee the banking institution charges the town
and an administrative charge to be established by the Department not in excess
of the amount provided in Indiana Code. A customer submitting a bad check may
be prohibited from making future stormwater service charge payments by check.
   (e)   Collection. Delinquent stormwater service charges may be collected in
a civil action along with reasonable attorney fees and court costs.
(Ord. 636, passed 3-30-2009)
§ 32.122 APPEALS OF ERU DETERMINATION.
   If, in the opinion of any non-single-family residential property owner, the
ERU multiple assigned to the property of such owner is inaccurate in light of
the amount of impervious area contained on said property, such property owner
shall have the right to contest such ERU determination. The Board shall develop
and promulgate policies and procedures to resolve any such contests, including,
as determined necessary, the conducting of hearings and the making of
determinations with respect to the measurement of impervious area contained on
any property.
(Ord. 636, passed 3-30-2009)
§ 32.123 STORMWATER REVENUE FUND.
   All revenues earned and fees collected for stormwater service, including but
not limited to, drainage service charges, permit and inspection fees, direct
charges and interest earnings on any unused funds shall be deposited in an
account entitled "Town Stormwater Revenue Fund", and shall be subject to the
provisions of I.C. 36-9-23, as amended. Disbursements from this account shall
be authorized by the Town Council. Such disbursements shall be used exclusively
for the operation, maintenance and improvement of the town's stormwater system.
To the extent that there are outstanding revenue bonds of the town issued
pursuant to the provisions of I.C. 36-9-23, as amended, revenues deposited in
the Stormwater Revenue Fund shall be subject to the covenants contained in the
resolution or resolutions authorizing such outstanding bonds.
(Ord. 636, passed 3-30-2009)
§ 32.124 DELINQUENT FEES AND PENALTIES AS LIENS; DUPLICATES; COLLECTION.
   Delinquent charges for stormwater services, and applied penalties, recording
fees and service charges constitute a lien upon the property and may be
collected in accordance with the provisions of I.C. 36-9-23-31, 36-9-23-32, 36-
9-23-33, and 36-9-23-34.
(Ord. 636, passed 3-30-2009)
§ 32.125 VIOLATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT.

violation of this subchapter, which shall be enforced by the Town Manager and
such deputies as the Town Manager may appoint for such purposes.
(Ord. 636, passed 3-30-2009)
§ 32.126 SEVERABILITY.

discharged, to the public sewers, which waters contained the substances or
possess the characteristics enumerated in this section of this subchapter, and
which in the judgment of the Superintendent may have a deleterious effect upon
the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise
create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent
may:
      (1)   Require new industries or industries with significant increase in
discharges to submit information on wastewater characteristics and obtain prior
approval for discharges.
      (2)   Reject the wastes in whole or in part for any reason deemed
appropriate by the town.
      (3)   Require pretreatment of such wastes to within the limits of normal
sewage as defined.

appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense,
and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (G)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this ordinance shall be determined in
accordance with 40 CFR 136, and shall be determined at the control manhole
provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event
that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the
point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out
by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the
sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and
property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24 hour
composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD suspended solids
analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls where pH's are
determined from period grab samples).
   (H)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the town and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the town for treatment, subject to payment therefore, by the
industrial concern, at such rates as are compatible with the rate ordinance.
   (I)   The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass
through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in

   (A)   The Superintendent, Inspector and other duly authorized employees of
the town bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to

(Ord. 708, passed 5-20-2013; Am. Ord. 761, passed 11-20-2017)
§ 51.34 ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.
   The following are the types of enforcement action that may be undertaken by
the POTW consistent with the town's enforcement response plan:
   (A)   Informal notice. An informal notice may be either a documented phone
call, written warning, or a meeting notifying the IU of minor incidences that
have occurred and that need to be corrected. Repeat performance of the same
incidence, or escalation of the incidence will result in escalated enforcement
action.
   (B)   Notice of violation (NOV). A NOV is the initial formal enforcement
action for a violation. The certified letter notifies the IU signatory
authority of the violation and requires the following:
      (1)   Immediate corrective action or steps being taken to correct the
problem;
      (2)   Increased sampling of the parameter in violation within 30 days;
      (3)   Written response within ten business days of receipt of NOV.
   (C)   Administrative order (AO). An administrative order is notification to
the IU to undertake or to cease specified activities by a specified deadline.
It is the first formal response to significant noncompliance (unless factors
necessitate escalated enforcement actions). It may contain compliance
schedules, administrative fines, termination of service and show cause orders.
In addition, it specifies the name of the parties involved, statement of the
facts, the requirement to ensure compliance and the enforcement associated with
any future non-compliance.
   (D)   Compliance schedule. A compliance schedule is a formal time and
management schedule contained in an enforcement order, established for the non-
compliant IU to achieve compliance. It is established for existing IU’s to meet
the categorical pretreatment standards or local standards. It contains
increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion
of major events leading to compliance. In addition, all compliance schedules
shall contain the following:
      (1)   Monitoring requirements with the location for monitoring;
      (2)   How the data will be used for evaluating compliance;
      (3)   Enforcement associated with non-compliance;
      (4)   Closure date after which IU will be considered either non-compliant
with the established compliance schedule, or evaluated for compliance.
   (E)   Show cause hearing. A show cause hearing is when the IU and the POTW
meet to discuss the cause and effect of the violation, as well as the
enforcement action the IU will be subjected to. The IU may present its case as
to why the violation occurred and why further enforcement should not be
applied. Corrective actions to be undertaken by the IU can also be a part of
this meeting.
   (F)   Termination of service. Termination of service is the revocation of an
IU's privilege to discharge non-domestic wastewater into the sewer system.
Termination of service is used when the discharge from an industrial user
presents imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, or the
environment; or threatens to interfere with the POTWs operations; or as an
escalating enforcement action to a significant violation when a noncompliant
industrial user fails to respond adequately to previous enforcement actions.
Termination of service may be accomplished by physical severance of the IU's
connection to the collection system, issuance of an AO (cease and desist order)
which compels the IU to immediately terminate its discharge, revocation of the
IU's discharge permit, or a court ruling.
   (G)   Administrative fines. An administrative fine is a punitive monetary
charge assessed by the town rather than a court. The purpose of the fine is to
recover the economic benefit of noncompliance and to deter future violations.
When assessing an administrative fine the following factors are considered:
      (1)   Type and severity of the violation;
      (2)   Number of violations cited;
      (3)   Duration of noncompliance;
      (4)   Impact of the violation on the receiving water, sludge quality, and
POTW operation;
      (5)   Whether the violation threatened public health;
      (6)   The economic benefit or savings the industrial user gained from the
noncompliance;
      (7)   Compliance history of the industrial user; and
      (8)   Whether the industrial user is making a good faith effort to
comply.
   (H)   Cost recovery. In addition to administrative fines imposed by the
Superintendent, the IU shall be responsible for paying the following (but not
limited to) costs incurred by the town:
      (1)   Cost of mileage and labor incurred in detecting and correcting an
Industrial User's violation or failure to comply;
      (2)   Laboratory analysis costs associated with detecting and correcting
the violation or failure to comply;
      (3)   Additional treatment costs caused by the violation or failure to
comply, or costs associated with detecting and correcting the violation or
failure to comply;
      (4)   Costs of any additional equipment acquired or expended by town for
detecting or correcting the violation or failure to comply;
      (5)   Repair and/or replacement of any part of the sewerage system
damaged by the violation or failure to comply;
      (6)   Any liability, damages, fines or penalties incurred by Town as a
result of the violation or failure to comply;
      (7)   Any and all expenses of outside professionals to include, but not
limited to, engineers, scientists, and/or legal counsel as a result of the
violation or failure to comply;
      (8)   Fees, if necessary, to offset the costs incurred by the town for
administering the pretreatment program requirements;
      (9)   Other costs associated with the detection and correction of the
violations or failures to comply.
   (I)   Judicial action. Judicial Action will be taken when it is deemed
necessary to force the IU to correct the violation and comply with the permit.
Judicial action may consist of civil prosecution; criminal prosecution; or an
action for injunction, at the discretion of the POTW and its counsel. As an
alternative to judicial action, the POTW and IU may agree to a voluntary zero
discharge of industrial waste by the IU pending correction of the violation.
   (J)   Referral to EPA or the state. 
      (1)   Where a POTW does not rely on criminal prosecution for its
enforcement authority, referral to the State or EPA may be made. For violations
that may warrant criminal prosecution, the POTW will refer the case to EPA or
the state for further action. Circumstances that trigger EPA or state referrals
include (but not limited too) evidence of willfulness, evidence of negligence,
and/or bad faith shown by the Industrial User.
      (2)   Violations that threaten health, property or environmental quality
are considered emergencies and will receive immediate responses such as halting
the discharge or terminating service.
   (K)   Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the time limit
provided for in division (A) shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction
thereof shall be fined in an amount not exceeding $1,000 per day, per
violation, in accordance with 40 CFR 403.8 (f)(1)(vi)(A), but no more than
$2,500 per day, per violation for a first violation nor more than $7,500 per
day, per violation for subsequent violations, in accordance with I.C. 36-1-3-8
(a)(10)(B).
   (L)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this subchapter shall
become liable to the town for any expense, loss, or damage occasioned the town
by reason of such violation.
(Ord. 708, passed 5-20-2013; Am. Ord. 761, passed 11-20-2017)
§ 51.35 MORE STRINGENT STANDARDS.

standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose
of this subchapter.

Ord. 506 (§
51.09), an ordinance to reduce inflow and infiltration.
(Ord. 708, passed 5-20-2013; Am. Ord. 761, passed 11-20-2017)
§ 51.99 PENALTY.
   The following penalties are established:
   (A)   If any service rate or charge established shall not be paid within 30
days after the same is due, the Town Council may cause a civil action to be
instituted in the name of the Town of Yorktown, Indiana to recover the amount
thereof, together with a penalty of 10% and reasonable attorney’s fees, as
provided by law, or may enforce collection by any other remedy provided by law;
   (B)   For unauthorized dumping into the town sewage collection system a fine
of up to $500 shall be imposed for illegal dumping into the town sewage system.
The amount of the fine shall be dependent upon the volume and composition of
material. The amount of the fine shall be set by the Town Manager and WWTP
Superintendent.
   (C)   Any person, firm, or corporation violating any provisions of §
51.09 shall be subject to a written warning by the WWTP Superintendent for a
first offense, not less than $200 for a second offense, and not less than $400
for any subsequent offense. Any person who acts as a certified I/I Inspector
and violates any of the provisions of §
51.09 shall be subject to a fine of $1,000 for providing false and misleading
information on the "Certification Form for I/I" or the "Request for Waiver"
form. If said false or misleading information allows any property to be
declared I/I compliant, then the I/I Inspector shall be subject to an
additional $100 fine per month until the town accepts a valid I/
I certification. A firm or corporation that employs a person that violates §
51.09 is also subject to the fines outlined in this section.
   (D)   Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the time limit
provided for in §
51.34(A) shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction thereof shall be

   The Waterworks Utility Fund is established by reference, Ordinance 79, as
adopted in the “Yorktown, Indiana Utilities Legislative Index” and shall be
used by the town for the payment of principal and interest of bonds issued on

   The Town Council shall appropriate revenue from the Fund to retire bonds,
provide construction repair, operation and maintenance of the town waterworks
and may transfer any excess net revenues into a fund for extensions,

however, which will interfere with the required monthly payments of the
Waterworks Sinking Fund or with the operation of the works. All revenues
derived from the operation of the waterworks and from the collection of
waterworks rates and charges shall be segregated and kept in a special fund and
in a separate bank account separate and apart from all other funds of the town.
When all bonds payable from the revenues of the waterworks have been redeemed

shall be collected in the manner provided by law and this chapter. The rates
and charges will be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying the property
served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owners, but such billing
in no way relieves the owner from liability in the event payment is not made as
herein required. The owners of the property served, which are occupied by
tenants, shall have the right to examine the collection records of the town for
the purpose of determining whether such rates and charges have been paid by
such tenants, provided that such examination shall be made in the office in
which said records are kept and during the hours that such office is open for

§ 150.62 CONTINUING MAINTENANCE; MANDATORY AND INVOLUNTARY REGISTRATION.
   (A)   Upon finding a building vacant and abandoned, the Zoning
Administrator/Code Enforcement Officer may issue to the building owner an order
for continuing maintenance pursuant to the Unsafe Building Act, I.C. 36-7-9, as
it may be amended from time to time, or pursuant to similar authority granted
by state statute, this code or other statutes, ordinances and regulations.
   (B)   The owner of a building that is abandoned as defined shall register
with the Zoning Administrator.
   (C)   The owner of a building that is vacant but not abandoned, within the
meaning of this section, may opt to register the building with the Zoning
Administrator/Code Enforcement, so as to notify city officials of the property
manager and exchange other information pertinent to the condition of the
building.
(Ord. 715, passed 2-18-2014)
§ 150.63 PROPERTY MANAGER.
   (A)   The owner of a building required to be registered pursuant to this
subchapter must appoint a property manager residing within 30 miles of the
property. The failure to appoint a property manager is a separate violation of
this section. The property manager may be the owner or an agent of the owner.
   (B)   An agent acting as the property manager must be at least 21 years of
age.
   (C)   The property manager must be available to government officials by
telephone 24 hours a day. The owner’s failure to make certain that such a
property manager is available and maintains the property is a separate
violation of this section.
(Ord. 715, passed 2-18-2014) Penalty, see §
150.99
§ 150.64 INFORMATION REQUIRED WITH REGISTRATION.
   The owner of a building that is vacant and abandoned shall register the
property with the Department of Code Enforcement upon receipt of an order for
registration. Registration shall be on a form provided by the Department of
Code Enforcement, shall be verified under the penalties of perjury, and shall
include the following information:
   (A)   The street address of the property;
   (B)   The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all persons or entities
which hold an ownership, land contract, mortgage, or other lien interesting the
property, and all beneficiaries of any land trust which owns the property;
   (C)   A copy of the most recently executed deed used to transfer title to
the property and the most recently prepared sales disclosure form, if the
disclosure form is reasonably available from the owner;
   (D)   The names and residential and business addresses and telephone numbers
of the property manager;
   (E)   The names and addresses of all persons or entities which hold a lien
interest or a substantial property interest in the property;
   (F)   The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the insurance agent and
the carrier providing insurance coverage for the property as required by this
section;
   (G)   The owner’s plan for maintenance and repair of the property, including
the time within which the owner anticipates completion of all repairs necessary
to bring the property into compliance with all property maintenance codes.
However, the owner’s statement of plan does not relieve the owner of any orders
issued pursuant to the Unsafe Building Law or of any obligations imposed by
statute, ordinance or regulation governing the maintenance of property. The
Department’s receipt of a plan does not constitute approval of the owner’s plan
or of any violation of property maintenance standards; and
   (H)   The owner is responsible for providing an updated registration form to
the Department of Code Enforcement within five business days of any change of
ownership or any information provided by the registration. The failure of the
owner to provide such updated information within five business days of any
change is a violation of this section.
(Ord. 715, passed 2-18-2014) Penalty, see §
150.99
§ 150.65 STANDARDS OF MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   At least once each week, the owner of a property required to be
registered under this section must ensure that the property is inspected and
secured against unlawful entry, that the property is cleaned, vegetation is
mowed, and that the property walkways and driveways have been adequately
cleared of snow and ice. Records of such inspections shall be provided to the
Department of Code Enforcement upon request.
   (B)   The window and door opening of all buildings on the property shall be
secured against unlawful entry by the use of locks designed for such use.
   (C)   In order to protect a building against unlawful entry or vandalism
while it is vacant, an owner may secure the windows and doors of the building
by the use of boarding. If boarding is used to secure the building, the
following standards must be met: Windows shall be framed by two-inch by four-
inch boards secured with plywood to the frame by using six, 7-inch lag bolts
into King studs in all corners and in the center of the vertical boards. The
plywood must be four-ply CDX sheeting or approved equivalent material, no less
than one-half inch in thickness and attached by tamper proof screws no less
than three inches in length. The screws must be type W for wood and type S for
steel, and must be applied to a maximum of eight inches on center.
   (D)   Boarding of a vacant structure is to be considered a temporary and not
a long-term method of securing the building. Any boards applied to secure doors
and windows for more than 30 days must be surface coated with exterior grade
paint so as to reduce the blighting effect on the immediate neighborhood.
   (E)   After six months, all plywood must be removed and replaced with secure
doors or glazed windows.
(Ord. 715, passed 2-18-2014) Penalty, see §
150.99
§ 150.66 REGISTRATION FEE.
   (A)   The owner of any building required to be registered under this
subchapter shall pay an annual registration fee to the town upon registration.
   (B)   If the building is used for or zoned for residential purposes and
contains not more than three residential units, the registration fee shall be
$250 per year.
   (C)   If the building is used or zoned for residential purposes and contains
more than three residential units, or if it is used or zoned for any non-
residential purposes, the fee shall be $500 for the first year or any part
thereof, $1000 for the second year or any part thereof, and $1500 for the third
and each subsequent year or any part thereof that the property is required to
be registered pursuant to this section.
   (D)   The purpose of the registration fee is to reimburse the Zoning
Administrator/Code Enforcement for the costs of monitoring the property and the
additional costs of responding to emergencies and property maintenance
requirements for a vacant and abandoned building. All fees collected shall be
deposited into the General Fund.
(Ord. 715, passed 2-18-2014)
§ 150.67 LIABILITY INSURANCE.
   (A)   The owner of any property required to be registered by this subchapter
must maintain a policy of liability insurance for the building, and must
provide to the Department of Code Enforcement the name, address, and telephone
number of the insurance agent and carrier, along with a copy of the certificate
of or other proof of insurance coverage.
      (1)   Two hundred fifty thousand dollars minimum liability policy for
residential structures;
      (2)   Five hundred thousand dollars minimum liability policy for
commercial structures.
   (B)   The policy of insurance must require the agent or carrier to provide
15 days advance notice of cancellation to the Department of Code Enforcement.
   (C)   These registration fees shall not commence until at least 30 days
after the initial notification is mailed by the town. In the event that real
estate taxes are current on the property, the town (by way of a committee
comprised of the Town Manager, Town Council President and Town Council Vice-
President) shall have the authority to determine that the building is listed
for sale and being actively and reasonably marketed, and to waive the
registration fee for six months, then may waive the registration fee for an
additional six months. The determination for waiver may be based upon a
determination by the Committee as to whether the listing price for the property
is reasonably related to the assessed value of the property.
(Ord. 715, passed 2-18-2014)
§ 150.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Whoever shall violate any provision of this chapter for which no
specific penalty is provided shall be punished as set forth in §
10.99.
   (B)   If any person, firm or corporation shall violate any of the provisions
of §§
150.20 et seq., shall do any act prohibited herein, shall fail to perform any
duty lawfully enjoined, within the time prescribed by the Building Commissioner
or shall fail, neglect or refuse to obey any lawful order given by the Building
Commissioner in connection with the provisions of this code for each such
violation, failure or refusal, such person, firm or corporation shall be fined
in any sum not less than $25 or nor more than $500. Each day of such unlawful
activity as is prohibited by the first sentence of this section shall
constitute a separate offense.
   (C)   Any person who shall prevent or attempt to prevent the posting of any
notice, or who shall remove or deface any notice posted upon any building or
structure, or appurtenance thereto, as provided for in this subchapter, without
written permission of or when acting for the Building Inspector; who shall
remain in, use or enter any such building or structure in violation of any
order thereon as provided in this subchapter; or who shall willfully refuse to
comply with, or shall willfully interfere with or delay the carrying out of any
order finally effective and authorized by this subchapter and I.C. 36-7-9-1; or
who shall violate any other provision of this subchapter or Indiana law by
willfully obstructing, delaying, damaging, injuring or interfering with any
persons engaged or property used in performing any work or duty under or

other pertinent laws shall, in any and each such instance, be deemed guilty of
a Class C infraction pursuant to I.C. 36-7-9-28(4), and upon conviction
thereof, shall be fined in any sum not exceeding $500, and each day that any
such violation shall continue to exist or such distinct repetition of any such
violation shall constitute a separate offense.
   (D)   Violations of §§
150.50 through
150.52 shall be addressed as established in I.C. 36-7-9 as it may be amended
from time to time.
   (E)   Penalties applicable to §§
150.60 through
150.67.
      (1)    An owner of a property that remains a vacant structure or an
abandoned structure for at least 90 consecutive calendar days may be liable for
a civil penalty in the amount of $500 per vacant structure or abandoned
structure, not to exceed $5,000 per structure per year, unless:
         (a)   Documentation has been filed and approved by the town that
indicates the owner’s intent to eliminate the vacant structure or abandoned
structure status of the property;
         (b)   The owner is current on all property taxes and special
assessments; and
         (c)   At least one of the following applies:
            1.   The structure is the subject of a valid building permit for
repair or rehabilitation and the owner is proceeding diligently and in good
faith to complete the repair or rehabilitation of the structure as defined in
the enforcement order;
            2.   The structure is:
               a.   Maintained in compliance with this chapter; and
               b.   Actively being offered for sale, lease, or rent; or
            3.   The owner can demonstrate that the owner made a diligent and
good faith effort to implement actions approved by the enforcement authority.
      (2)   If the structure continues to remain a vacant structure beyond the
initial 90 days described in division (E)(1) above and the owner does not meet
any of the exceptions set forth in this section, the enforcement authority may
continue to assess penalties each year on each structure in the following
amounts:
         (a)   One thousand dollars for the second 90 calendar day period each
structure remains a vacant structure or an abandoned structure;
         (b)   One thousand five hundred dollars for the third 90 calendar day
period each structure remains a vacant structure or an abandoned structure; and
         (c)   Two thousand dollars for the fourth and each subsequent 90
calendar day period thereafter each structure remains a vacant structure or an
abandoned structure.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-1-4-11 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Town Council of the Town of Yorktown does hereby adopt the following floodplain
management regulations.
(Ord. 845, passed 2-20-2024)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The flood hazard areas of the Town of Yorktown are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 845, passed 2-20-2024)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located
in floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
area;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 845, passed 2-20-2024)
§ 151.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters, or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 845, passed 2-20-2024)
§ 151.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A structure with a floor area of 400 square feet or
less that is on the same parcel of property as a principal structure and the
use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure; an ACCESSORY
STRUCTURE specifically excludes structures used for human habitation.
      (1)   ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are considered walled and roofed where the
structure includes at least two outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof.
      (2)   Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES include but are not necessarily
limited to two-car detached garages (or smaller), carports, storage and tool

necessarily limited to, a gazebo, pavilion, picnic shelter, or carport that is
open on all sides (roofed but not walled).
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the ADDITION is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed ADDITION, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   ALTERATION OF A WATERCOURSE. A dam, impoundment, channel relocation, change

   FLOOD or FLOODING.
      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from:
         (a)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters;
         (b)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source; or
         (c)   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by
flooding and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of
normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and
deposited along the path of the current.
      (2)   FLOOD or FLOODING also includes the collapse or subsidence of land
along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion or
undermining caused by waves or current of water exceeding anticipated cyclical
levels that result in a FLOOD as defined above.
   FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Areas subject to the 1% annual chance flood. See SPECIAL
FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available
digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM and
the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. See FLOODPLAIN.
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The BFE plus two feet at any given location in
the SFHA. See FREEBOARD.
   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by water from any source. See FLOOD.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. Zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances
(such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control
ordinance), and other applications of police power which control development in
flood prone areas. The term describes such state or local regulations in any
combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage
prevention and reduction.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE or FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the floodplain lying outside the
floodway.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   HARDSHIP. As related to variances of this chapter, the exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Town of
Yorktown requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to
the property involved. Mere economic or financial HARDSHIP alone is NOT
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional HARDSHIP. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the

floods, flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries, and flood
profiles.
   INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL-EVALUATION SERVICE (ICC-ES) REPORT. A document
that presents the findings, conclusions, and recommendations from a particular
evaluation. ICC-ES REPORTS provide information about what code requirements or
acceptance criteria were used to evaluate a product, and how the product should
be identified, installed.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). FEMA's comment on a
proposed project that would, upon construction, result in modification of the
SFHA through the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
      (2)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (CLOMR-F). A
letter from FEMA stating that a proposed structure that will be elevated by
fill would not be inundated by the base flood.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a building or area of land
is not located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation
data. A LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
      (4)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT OUT AS SHOWN (LOMA-OAS). An official
determination by FEMA that states the property or building is correctly shown
outside the SFHA as shown on an effective NFIP map. Therefore, the mandatory
flood insurance requirement does not apply. An out-as-shown determination does
not require elevations.
      (5)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (6)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). FEMA's modification
of the SFHA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill outside the
existing regulatory floodway.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement

either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet
or exceed the following criteria:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
         (b)   At least two openings are designed and maintained for the entry
and exit of floodwater; and these openings provide a total net area of at least
one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of all
such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher. Doorways
and windows do not qualify as openings; or
      (6)   The first floor of a building elevated on pilings or columns in a
coastal high hazard area (as that term is defined in 44 CFR 59.1), as long as
it meets the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a

installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,

Insurance Rate Map dated July 4, 2011, shall be determined from the 1% annual
chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Delaware County, Indiana
and Incorporated Areas and the corresponding flood insurance rate maps (FIRM)
dated July 4, 2011 as well as any subsequent updates, amendments, or revisions,
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date.
Should the floodway limits not be delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
for a studied SFHA designated as an “AE Zone”, the limits of the floodway will
be according to the best available flood layer as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.
   (B)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each
of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the Town of Yorktown, delineated as an

revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best available flood layer provided by
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage
area from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available flood layer data, the party needs to replace
existing data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and subsequently approved.
   (C)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification
on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of
any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas shall be according
to the best available flood layer as provided by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is
greater than one square mile.
   (D)   Upon issuance of a letter of final determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.

§ 151.09 COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or
structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of
this chapter and other applicable regulations.
   (B)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the most conservative
(highest) base flood elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed
structure; or for other developments, affecting any part of the area of the
development.
   (C)   No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without
full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations.
(Ord. 845, passed 2-20-2024)
§ 151.10 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions
shall prevail.
(Ord. 845, passed 2-20-2024)
§ 151.11 DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND ELEVATIONS.
   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) with base flood elevations provided (riverine or lacustrine Zone AE) on
the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the
profiles or table of still water elevations shall govern.
   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
   (C)   If the natural grade elevation of the site in question is at or above
the base flood elevation and a LOMA or LOMR-FW is obtained, the floodplain
regulations will not be applied provided the LOMA or LOMR-FW is not
subsequently superseded or invalidated.

§ 151.29 MAP MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.
   To meet NFIP minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved
by FEMA, and to ensure that the Town of Yorktown flood maps, studies and other
data identified in §
151.07 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
   (A)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
      (1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         (a)   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         (b)   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area; and
         (c)   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and subdivision or large-scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations.
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have required
technical data for a conditional letter of map revision or letter of map
revision and submitted to FEMA. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources
will review the submittals as part of a partnership with FEMA. The submittal
should be mailed to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources at the address
provided on the FEMA form (MT-2) or submitted through the online letter of map
change website. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall be
the responsibility of the applicant.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a conditional letter of
map revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for
proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood elevation.
      (4)   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map
revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to this section.
   (B)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator may
request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does
not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such
as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the Town Council President and may
be submitted to FEMA at any time.
   (C)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain Administrator
shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the Town of Yorktown
have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an
area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management
regulations for a particular area. In order that the Delaware County, Indiana
and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the Town
of Yorktown boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
Town of Yorktown suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the Town of Yorktown has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
(Ord. 845, passed 2-20-2024)
§ 151.30 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The Town of Yorktown Board of Zoning Appeals as established by the
Town Council of Yorktown shall hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances from requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in
any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Floodplain
Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. Any person
aggrieved by the decision of the Board may appeal such decision to the Delaware
County Circuit or Superior Court.
   (C)   In considering such applications, the Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (2)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (6)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (7)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (8)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (9)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
of transport of the floodwaters at the site; and
      (10)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance.
   (E)   Variances from the provisions of this chapter shall only be granted
when the Board can make positive findings of fact based on evidence submitted
at the hearing for the following:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship as defined in §
151.05; and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
   (F)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §
151.40(A), (C)(1) or (D) may be granted.
   (G)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §
151.40(A), (C)(1) or (D) will require a permit from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources. Variances shall not be issued within any designated
regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
   (H)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §§
151.40  et seq. may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a
lot of one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
   (I)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic
structures" upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure" and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character
and design of the structure.
   (J)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use.
   (K)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (L)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this chapter, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
chapter.
   (M)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (N)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request.
(Ord. 845, passed 2-20-2024)
PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 151.40 FLOODPLAIN STATUS STANDARDS.
   (A)   Floodways (riverine). Located within SFHAs established in §
151.07 are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. Under the provisions of the
Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1), a permit for construction in a floodway from
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance
of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or
obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation
activities such as filling, grading, clearing, and paving undertaken before the
actual start of construction of the structure. General licenses and exemptions
to the requirements of the Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1 and 312 I.A.C. 10)
may apply to qualified additions/improvements to existing lawful residential
structures, rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland restoration, utility line
crossings, outfall projects, creek rock removal, and prospecting.
      (1)   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in §
151.07, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources and to apply for approval for construction in a
floodway, provided the activity does not qualify for a general license or
exemption (I.C. 14-28-1 or 312 I.A.C. 10).
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. The floodplain
development permit shall meet the provisions contained in this subchapter.
      (3)   The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than
an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to qualify for
a general license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site/
project. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
      (4)   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development shall cause
no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge
without first obtaining a conditional letter of map revision and meeting
requirements of §
151.29(A). A conditional letter of map revision cannot be issued for
development that would cause an increase in flood levels affecting a structure
and such development should not be permitted.
      (5)   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet identified on the
effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity
of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation
of the regulatory flood of at least 0.15 of a foot as determined by comparing
the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that under the
natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
      (6)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR 65.12.
   (B)   Fringe (riverine). If the site is in the fringe (either identified on
the FIRM or identified by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources through
detailed or approximate studies and not identified on a FIRM), the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in this subchapter have been met.
   (C)   SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/
fringes (riverine).
      (1)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile.
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade
has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be
issued, provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
      (2)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile.
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
         (b)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this
subchapter have been met.
   (D)   SFHAs not identified on a map.
      (1)   If a proposed development site is near a waterway with no SFHA
identified on a map, the Floodplain Administrator shall verify the drainage
area upstream of the site. If the drainage area upstream of the site is
verified as being greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade
has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper written
approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain analysis/
regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be issued,
provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not less
restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and the provisions contained in this subchapter have been met.

promote the public health, safety and general welfare by preventing the
overcrowding of land; lessening congestion in the streets and highways;
providing for adequate space, light and air; facilitating adequate provision
for water, sewerage, fire protection, parks and recreation areas, sites for

conveyancing by accurate legal descriptions.
(1984 Code, § 16.08.020)
§ 152.003 INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION.
   The provisions of this chapter shall be deemed the minimum requirements for
the promotion and effectuation of the purposes set forth in this chapter.
(1984 Code, § 16.08.030)
§ 152.004 SCOPE.
   Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction or requirement than one
imposed or required by other provisions of law, rules, regulations, covenants
or agreements, the provisions of this chapter shall control, but nothing in
this chapter shall interfere with, abrogate or annul easements, covenants, deed
restrictions or agreements between parties which impose restrictions greater
than those imposed by this chapter.
(1984 Code, § 16.08.040)
§ 152.005 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. When not
inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense shall include
the future; the singular shall include the plural and the plural the singular;
the word SHALL is always mandatory and the word MAY indicates the use of
discretion in making a decision.
   ALLEY. A permanent service way providing a secondary means of access to

subdivider will pay an additional amount or receive a refund if the adjusted
fee differs from the original fee paid. There shall be no refund of any portion
of the fee should the subdivider fail to file a final plat of subdivision. If,
because of the failure of the subdivider to file a final plat within the time
permitted, it is necessary to resubmit a preliminary plat for tentative
approval, the subdivider shall be required to pay, without credit for any fees
previously paid, the fee currently in effect at the time of resubmission.
(1984 Code, Chapter 16.16)
PRELIMINARY PLATS
§ 152.020 FILING.
   A subdivider shall submit to the Secretary of the Plan Commission a written
application for a certificate of approval of the subdivision plat at least ten
days prior to the meeting of the Plan Commission at which it is to be
considered. Three prints of the preliminary plat of subdivision shall be filed
with the Plan Commission at the time application is submitted. The preliminary
plat shall comply with the provisions of §§
152.023 through
152.026. Fees charged for the filing of a subdivision plat shall be paid in
full on the basis of the estimated number of lots created and as specifically
provided in §
152.006, at the time the application is submitted.
(1984 Code, § 16.20.010)
§ 152.021 TENTATIVE APPROVAL.
   The Plan Commission shall approve, approve conditionally or disapprove such
preliminary plat in accordance with its determination of whether or not all
requirements of this chapter are satisfied. Such action shall be taken within
75 days after the subdivider’s application, the preliminary plat and all other
required materials are submitted to the Secretary of the Commission; provided,
however, that the Commission may delay its action at the request of the
applicant.
   (A)   If the preliminary plat is approved with modification or waiver of
certain requirements, the Plan Commission shall set forth in its own records
such modifications or waivers and the reasons therefor.
   (B)   If the preliminary plat is approved conditionally, the Plan Commission
shall set forth in its own records the conditions and reasons therefor and
provide the subdivider with a copy. In any additional approval, the Plan
Commission may require the subdivider to submit a revised preliminary plat.
   (C)   If the preliminary plat is disapproved, the Plan Commission shall set
forth the reasons for such action in its own records and provide the subdivider
with a copy. The Commission should, if possible, make recommendations on the
basis of which the proposed subdivision may be approved.
   (D)   Any person feeling himself or herself aggrieved at any action of the
Commission upon any proposed plat or replat may apply in writing to the
Commission prior to its next regular meeting for modification of the action
complained of, and such application shall be considered by the Commission at
such time and in such manner as it may determine.
   (E)   If the preliminary plat is approved, the Plan Commission shall enter
such action on its official records and notify the applicant of such approval.
   (F)   Approval of a preliminary plat by the Plan Commission is not an
acceptance of the subdivision plat for record and shall not be indicated on the
face of the preliminary plat. Such approval shall be deemed only tentative
approval of the subdivider’s application and shall constitute only an
expression of approval of the general plan as a guide in the preparation of a
final plat for final approval and recording, upon fulfillment of all
requirements of this chapter. Such tentative approval shall not limit the
Commission in introducing changes or revisions which it may subsequently deem
necessary to the interests and needs of the community.
   (G)   Tentative approval shall be effective for a maximum period of 12
months unless, upon written application by the developer, the Plan Commission
grants an extension. If the final plat has not been submitted for final
approval within this time limit, a preliminary plat must again be submitted to
the Plan Commission for tentative approval.
(1984 Code, § 16.20.020)
§ 152.022 PUBLIC HEARING.
   Prior to approval by the Plan Commission of a preliminary plat, the Plan
Commission shall schedule a public hearing on the matter, notifying the
subdivider in writing and notifying by proper publication or otherwise, at
least ten days prior to the date set for such hearing, any person or
governmental unit having a probable interest in the proposed plat. The cost of
publication of the notice of hearing shall be paid by the subdivider to the
publisher at the time such notice is inserted.
(1984 Code, § 16.20.030)
§ 152.023 CRITERIA AND CONDITIONS FOR PLAT APPROVAL.

(1984 Code, § 16.24.090)
DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
§ 152.060 SUITABILITY OF LOCATION.
   No land shall be subdivided if it is considered by the Plan Commission to be
unsuitable for use by reason of nonconformance to the Master Plan or flooding,
collection of groundwater, bad drainage, adverse earth or rock formation or
topography or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety or
welfare of the possible users and the community as a whole. Due consideration
shall also be given by the subdivider, in conjunction with owners of adjoining
property when necessary, for the provision of school sites, park sites, rights-
of-way for public utility lines, sites for business centers, industrial
locations and other features conducive to modern and workable planned
development.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.010)
§ 152.061 STREETS.
   (A)   Generally. The arrangement, character, extent and location of all
streets shall conform to the Master Plan and shall be considered in relation to
existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions and natural terrain
features such as streams, swamps and existing tree growth and to the proposed
uses of the lands to be served by such streets. Streets shall be adjusted to
the contour of the land so as to produce usable lots and streets of reasonable
gradient.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.020)
   (B)   Arrangement. Where it is not shown on the Master Plan, the arrangement
of streets in a subdivision shall either:
      (1)   Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing
principal streets in surrounding areas; or
      (2)   Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the
Plan Commission to meet a particular situation in which topographical or other
conditions make continuation of or conformance to existing streets impractical.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.030)
   (C)   Local streets. Local streets shall be so laid out as to discourage use
by heavy and through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and sewer systems
and to require the minimum amount of street to provide convenient and safe
access to adjacent property.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.040)
   (D)   Collector streets. The designation of collector streets shall be in
accordance with the Master Plan or the prior approval of the Plan Commission.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.050)
   (E)   Major arterial streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an
existing or proposed major arterial street, the Plan Commission, at its
discretion, may require that certain marginal access streets be included along
the margin of the property, may reverse the frontage of lots by adding screen
planting in a no-access reservation along rear property lines which then border
the major street and may require deep lots with rear service alleys or may
require such other treatment as it deems advisable to give adequate protection
to residential properties and to afford separation of through and local
traffic.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.060)
   (F)   Railroad rights-of-way. Where a subdivision borders on or contains a
railroad right-of-way, the Plan Commission, at its discretion, may require that
certain marginal access streets be located approximately parallel to such
right-of-way or may otherwise provide a suitable separation, as permitted for
major arterial streets in division (E) of this section.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.070)
   (G)   Traffic impediments. Devices or features designed to impede, block or
control access to streets are prohibited, except where their control is
distinctly placed with the town under conditions approved by the Plan
Commission.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.080)
   (H)   Street jogs. Street jogs at intersections, where there is less than
125 feet between the centerlines of opposite street entrances, shall be
avoided.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.090)
   (I)   Reverse curves. A tangent at least 150 feet long shall be introduced
between reverse curves on major arterial streets and at least 100 feet on
collector streets.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.100)
   (J)   Sight distance. A minimum vertical sight distance of at least 500 feet
shall be provided on major arterial streets, with clear visibility measured
along the centerline, 300 feet on collector streets and 200 feet on local
streets.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.110)
   (K)   Minimum radii. Where a deflection angle of more than ten degrees
occurs in the alignment of a street, a curve shall be there introduced and the
minimum radii of curvature on the centerline shall not be less than 500 feet on
major arterial streets, 200 feet on collector streets and 100 feet on local
streets.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.120)
   (L)   Intersections. Intersecting streets shall be laid out at as nearly
right angles as possible, and no such angle of intersection shall be less than
60 degrees. Curblines at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius of
at least 15 feet; provided that where the angle of street intersection is less
than 75 degrees, such greater radius shall be required as the Plan Commission
may deem necessary. The Commission may permit chords or cutoffs in place of
rounded corners. Wherever necessary to permit the construction of a curb having
the required radius without curtailing the sidewalk at a street intersection to
less than normal width, the property line at such street corner shall be
rounded or otherwise set back to permit such construction. At alley
intersections, curbline corners shall be rounded by an arc with a radius of at
least ten feet.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.130)
   (M)   Right-of-way and roadway widths. Unless otherwise shown on the Master
Plan, widths or rights- of-way and roadways (vehicle pavement) shall not be
less than the following:

   Marginal acce40 ft.       28 ft.
* A residential street may be designated for “light usage” by the Commission
in special cases where there are a limited number of houses on the street,
such as a cul-de-sac, a short street developed on one side only and the
like. In such cases parking shall be permitted on one side of the street
only.
** The width of major arterials includes allowance for a median strip.
 
(1984 Code, § 16.28.140)
   (N)   Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited except where essential
to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of this chapter and only where the Plan Commission finds it will
be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided. Wherever there exists a half street adjacent to a tract
to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted within such tract.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.150)
   (O)   Dead-end (cul-de-sac) streets. If a street is designed to have one end
permanently closed, such closed end shall be not more than 500 feet from an
intersection of such cul-de-sac with another street. At the closed end there
shall be provided a circular turnaround roadway having an outside diameter
(curb-to-curb) of at least 60 feet, with a diameter between street property
lines of at least 100 feet. Another shape of turnaround may be substituted if
it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Plan Commission to be at least as
safe and convenient as the form specified above.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.160)
   (P)   Street names. No street names shall be used that will duplicate or
that may, in the judgment of the Plan Commission, be confused with the names of
existing streets. Streets that are now or will eventually be continuations of
existing streets shall be called by the names of such existing streets.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.170)
   (Q)   Street grades. No street grade shall be less than 0.5%. No major
arterial or collector street shall have a grade in excess of 5%, and no local
street shall have a grade in excess of 10%.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.180)
   (R)   Vertical curves. All changes in street grade shall be connected by
vertical curves designed to provide a smooth transition in conformance with
sound engineering practice.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.190)
   (S)   Existing streets. In instances where a proposed subdivision is to be
platted so that it utilizes an existing improved street for access to part of
or all the lots, the subdivider, when required by the Plan Commission, shall:
      (1)   Dedicate additional land for right-of-way where existing right-of-
way is not adequate;
      (2)   Make grading improvements in the right-of-way such that adequate
level area for a roadbed is established as required in this chapter. This
grading improvement, once constructed, shall be stabilized and held by an
approved process;
      (3)   Submit engineering and construction drawings concerning these
requirements.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.200)
§ 152.062 ALLEYS.
   (A)   Business and industrial districts. Alleys may be required by the Plan
Commission in the business and industrial districts if no other definite and
assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading and
parking, consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.210)
   (B)   Residential districts. Alleys shall be provided in residential areas
unless deemed necessary by the Plan Commission because of topography or other
exceptional circumstances.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.220)
   (C)   Width. The right-of-way width of alleys shall be 26 feet.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.230)
   (D)   Intersections or alignment changes. Alley intersections and sharp
changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where such intersection or changes
are unavoidable, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe vehicular
movement.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.240)
   (E)   Dead-end alleys. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided, but if unavoidable,
shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the closed end.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.250)
§ 152.063 EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Utility easements. Easements across lots or centered on rear or side
lot lines shall be provided where necessary, in the judgment of the Plan
Commission, for overhead or underground utilities. Such utility easements shall
provide reasonable continuity from block to block and shall be at least 12 feet
wide. Evidence shall be furnished the Plan Commission that easements and any
easement provisions to be incorporated on the plat or in the deeds have been
reviewed by the individual utility companies or the public agencies responsible
for furnishing the required service involved.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.260)
   (B)   Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse,
drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement
or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such
watercourse and such further width or construction or both as will be adequate
for the purpose of widening, deepening, sloping, improving, enclosing,
maintaining or protecting the stream. Parallel streets or parkways may be
required in connection with such drainage easements.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.270)
   (C)   Screen planting easements. A screen planting easement at least ten
feet wide across which there shall be no right of access may be required
between residential and commercial or industrial lots or along lot lines to
discourage the undesirable development of residential lots fronting on traffic
arteries.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.280)
   (D)   Temporary turnaround easements. Whenever any street planned to be
continuous has been temporarily deadened awaiting subdivision of adjacent land,
a turnaround shall be provided by means of an easement which will terminate
upon extension of the street. The dimensions of such turnaround shall meet the
requirements specified in §
152.060.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.290)
§ 152.064 BLOCKS.
   (A)   Length. Block length shall not exceed 1,320 feet may be permitted
where such length is unavoidable necessary in order to achieve conformity with
existing streets. Usual blocks shall be from 560 feet to 800 feet in length.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.300)
   (B)   Width. Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of at
least minimum depth, except where lots front on major arterial streets or in
the presence of adverse topographical conditions or lot size, in which cases
the Plan Commission may approve a single tier of lots of at least minimum
depth.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.310)
§ 152.065 CROSSWALKS.
   Pedestrian crosswalks not less than 15 feet wide may be required in blocks
longer than 900 feet where such crosswalks are deemed by the Plan Commission to
be essential to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping
centers, transportation or other community facilities. Such crosswalks shall
remain inaccessible to all vehicular traffic excepting that required for
maintenance of the crosswalks.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.320)
§ 152.066 NONRESIDENTIAL BLOCKS.
   In areas permitted by an applicable zoning ordinance to be used for business
or industry, blocks intended for such use should be specifically designed for
such purpose with adequate space set aside for off-street parking and loading
facilities.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.330)
§ 152.067 FRONTAGE.
   Where frontage is on a major arterial or collector street, the long
dimension of the block should ordinarily front thereon.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.340)
§ 152.068 LOTS.
   (A)   Dimensions and areas. The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be
such as the Plan Commission deems appropriate for the type of development and
use contemplated, including provisions for off-street parking and loading
facilities; provided, however, that lot dimensions and areas shall not be less
than required by the town Zoning Ordinance, nor shall they be less than
required for proper functioning of the septic tank or other individual sanitary
sewer system, where such is to be used. Lots which are not served by a public
sanitary sewer system shall be at least 10,000 square feet in area. Lots which
are served by neither public water nor public sanitary sewers shall be at least
20,000 square feet in area. Excessive depth in relation to width shall be
avoided. In residential areas, the depth-to-width ratio of lots shall normally
be no greater than 3.5 to 1.0. Corner lots shall be sufficiently wider and
larger to permit the additional width of side yard that may be required by this
chapter.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.350)
   (B)   Business lots. Lot lines for individual business uses need not be
shown on the final plat where there is a comprehensive design of an integrated
shopping center providing off-street parking and loading facilities.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.360)
   (C)   Lot frontage. Each lot shall abut on a public street or a private
street of record. Residential lots having double frontage (front and rear) and
reverse frontage (front-rear axis approximately at right angles to the general
pattern in the area) shall be avoided and will be permitted at the discretion
of the Plan Commission only where necessary to overcome specific disadvantages
of topography and orientation or where a major arterial or railroad right-of-
way exists.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.370)
   (D)   Building lines. Building setback lines shall be provided by the
subdivider and shall conform to those established by the Zoning Ordinance. The
Plan Commission may approve or require greater setback lines when in its
opinion sound planning or factors of the area require such action. Residential
setback lines shall be located at least 50 feet from the street line of major
arterial streets.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.380)
   (E)   Lot lines. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right
angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines. Insofar as
practical, lot lines shall be straight.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.390)
   (F)   Fill and excavation. No lot shall be elevated by filling in or lowered
by removal of soil to any extent that does not conform to the elevation and/or
contour of adjacent properties or streets, without prior approval of the Plan
Commission.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.400)
§ 152.069 SCHOOLS AND RECREATIONAL FACILITIES.
   Where shown on the Master Plan or otherwise deemed essential by the Plan
Commission, upon consideration of the particular type of development proposed
in the subdivision, the Plan Commission may specify provision for schools and
for recreational facilities, including neighborhood parks, playgrounds and
public access to water frontage. Such provision may include a requirement that
not more than 10% of the gross area subdivided be reserved for use as a public
park or playground for a period of one year and that such reservation be
extended for an additional six months if, during the reservation year, a local
governmental agency concerned passes a resolution expressing its intent to
acquire the land so reserved for school or recreational facilities.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.410)
§ 152.070 COMMUNITY ASSETS.
   In all subdivisions, due consideration shall be given to the preservation of
watercourses, large trees and similar natural features.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.420)
§ 152.071 PROTECTION OF RESIDENTIAL AREAS.
   Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas from
potential nuisance from proposed nonresidential subdivisions, including the
provision of extra depth in parcels and landscaped buffer strips where needed.
(1984 Code, § 16.28.430)
IMPROVEMENTS
§ 152.085 PREREQUISITE TO PLAT APPROVAL.
   The Plan Commission shall not give final approval to any application for
approval of a subdivision plat unless the improvements and installations
specified in §
152.086 have previously been completed and are in place; provided, however,
that the Commission may give final approval to such a plat if the applicant
provides a bond which complies with the requirements specified in §
152.047.
(1984 Code, § 16.32.010)
§ 152.086 REQUIREMENTS GENERALLY.
   The following improvements and installations, constructed in accordance with
the requirements and standards of this chapter, shall be included:
   (A)   Street and alley grading and surfacing and stabilization of banks to
prevent wind and water erosion;
   (B)   Curbs and gutters;
   (C)   Storm sewers, culverts, drainage facilities and bridges, retaining
walls or other improvement where necessary in the judgment of the Plan
Commission;
   (D)   Sanitary sewers, unless, in the judgment of the Plan Commission, the
provision of sanitary sewers is impractical, in which case individual lots
shall comply with the size requirement specified in §
152.068 and shall be provided with septic tanks and disposal fields meeting
requirements of the County Health Department and the State Board of Health
prior to or at the time of construction of any building on such lots; provided
further, that a complete sanitary sewage collection system shall be installed
and capped, with capped leads to each lot in accordance with the town
standards;
   (E)   Water mains, unless, in the judgment of the Plan Commission,
connection to a public water supply is impractical, in which case individual
lots shall comply with the size requirements specified in §
152.068, and each lot shall be provided with an individual water supply in
accordance with the requirements of the County Health Department and the State
Board of Health;
   (F)   Crosswalks, as required in §
152.065;
   (G)   Sidewalks, except if deemed unwarranted by the Plan Commission;
   (H)   Street signs and landscaping;
   (I)   Street lighting, as required by the Plan Commission;
   (J)   Monuments.
(1984 Code, § 16.32.020)
§ 152.087 CONSTRUCTION CONTROL.
   The construction of any and all the improvements described in §
152.086 shall be in every case under the direction, inspection and control of
the Plan Commission or its official agents and employees.
(1984 Code, § 16.32.030)
§ 152.088 APPROVAL.
   No improvements or installations shall be made unless and until all
necessary plans, profiles and specifications have been submitted to and
approved by the Plan Commission. In performing its duties of review and
inspection, the Commission may utilize the services of a qualified engineer
employed by the Commission, who shall not have any direct or indirect
relationship to the subdivider or subdivision.
(1984 Code, § 16.32.040)
§ 152.089 FINAL ACCEPTANCE.
   Upon completion of the streets and those other improvements required by this
chapter which are to be maintained directly by the Town Council, acceptance of
such improvements by the Town Council shall be made conditionally, based upon a
two-year maintenance period commencing with the formal date of the acceptance.
A maintenance bond, running to the Town Council, shall be furnished by the
subdivider and accepted by the Council at such time as the streets and
improvements are accepted. At the end of the two-year period, all the accepted
improvements being in satisfactory conditions, the maintenance bond shall be
released. Where improvements such as sewage treatment facilities and water
supply systems are directly operated by an agency other than the Town Council,
such agency may require a similar maintenance bond with respect to the
improvements which it accepts. Prior to the release of the maintenance bonds,
the subdivider shall furnish a final set of the plans and profiles, revised
where necessary to show exactly as built all street improvements, sanitary and
storm sewer improvements, water mains and valves and stubs and such other
permanent improvements that the subdivider installs. This map shall bear the
signature and seal of a registered engineer.
(1984 Code, § 16.32.050)
§ 152.090 COSTS.
   The cost of the improvements, including all publication costs, legal fees,
engineering fees and expenses, shall be paid by the subdivider or developer.
After the above-mentioned plans, profiles and specifications are submitted for
review, the Commission shall have prepared an estimate of the cost of checking
the drawings and field inspection, and the subdivider shall thereupon deposit
with the Commission an amount of money equal to the estimated cost. All work
done in connection with checking, computing and correcting such plans for
improvements and installations and in connection with field inspection of the

VARIANCES
§ 152.120 AUTHORIZED WHEN.
   Where the Plan Commission finds that strict compliance with the requirements
of this chapter would result in extraordinary or undue hardship to the
subdivider or that these conditions would result in retarding the achievement
of the objectives of this chapter, then the Plan Commission may, after written
application by the subdivider, approve variations or exceptions to the
regulations within the limitations and conditions stated in this chapter,
provided that such variations or exceptions shall not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter or the Master Plan.
(1984 Code, § 16.36.010)
§ 152.121 LIMITATIONS.
   The Plan Commission shall approve variations or exceptions to the
regulations of this chapter only where it finds, based upon the evidence
presented in each specific case, that:
   (A)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographic
conditions of the specific property involved a particular hardship to the owner
would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter
of the regulations were carried out; and
   (B)   The variation or exception will not have the effect of reducing the
traffic capacity of any major arterial or collector street; and
   (C)   The variation will not be detrimental to the public safety, health or
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in
which the property is located.
(1984 Code, § 16.36.020)

determines that a proposed subdivision would create only two or three lots and
would not include the creation of any part of any street, public easement or
other right-of-way, whether public or private, for access to or from such lots.
In such cases the Commission may permit an application for approval of the
subdivision to be accompanied by the final plat. The purpose of this variance
is limited to a simplification of procedural requirements in this special class
of cases where submission of a preliminary plat is considered to be
unnecessary. In addition to complying with all requirements of §§
152.045 through
152.048, the final plat in such cases shall also be accompanied by the
materials specified in §
152.026. No other procedural or substantive requirement of this chapter may be
waived for this purpose, including tentative approval, public hearing and final
approval.
