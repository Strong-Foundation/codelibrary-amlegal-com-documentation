   (A)   This code is a codification of previously existing laws, amendments

an integral part of this code and may be altered only by specific amendment.

chapters of this code, as originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not
law and may be altered by the compilers of this or any subsequent codification,
in any official publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These
descriptive headings are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the
meaning, application or construction of the law they precede.
      (3)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent

or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.

upon referral from the Employee and Family Assistance Program, before work
performance becomes affected.

barrier to employment nor a cause for disciplinary action. Employees will not
be disciplined merely because of participation in a rehabilitation program, or
excused from the disciplinary consequences of conduct which is in violation of
this subchapter or any other town policies or job requirements.
   (D)   Any employee identified through a town investigation as having a
substance abuse problem also may not avoid disciplinary action by requesting to
participate in an approved rehabilitation program.

   (A)   The town finds that it is necessary and desirous to adopt a policy of
conduct with regard to nepotism in employment with the town and in contracting
with the town in order to continue to be able to provide local government
services to its residents and to comply with the laws effective July 1, 2012,
known as I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21, respectively.

appointed official of the town who fails to abide by or cooperate with the
implementation, with compliance and with mandated certifications of the
Nepotism Policy may be subject to action allowed by law.
   (I)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, compliance
and certifications connected with the Contracting with a Unit Policy is a

employee or a curative action. An elected or appointed official of the town who
fails to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, with compliance and
with mandated certifications of the Contracting with a Unit Policy may be
subject to action allowed by law.
   (J)   (1)   The policies created by this subchapter are hereby directed to

that is not accessible to persons with disabilities should be directed to the
Clerk/Treasurer.

   The town has adopted an internal grievance procedure providing for prompt
and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by the

Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), being 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131 et seq. and §
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, being 29 U.S.C. § 794.
   (A)   Title II states, in part, that “no otherwise qualified disabled
individual shall, solely by reason of such disability, be excluded from the
participation in, be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination
in programs, services or activities sponsored by a public entity.”
   (B)   Section 504 states, in part, that “no otherwise qualified individual
with a disability in the United States...shall, solely by reason of her or his
disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal
financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any
executive agency or by the United States Postal Service.”
(Ord. 551, passed 9-4-2012; Ord. 2016-4, passed 6-22-2016)
§ 34.084 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE STEP 1: FILE THE GRIEVANCE.
   (A)   Complete the town’s grievance form. The grievance form can be found in
the Clerk’s Office. A grievance may be communicated in writing, by email, by
fax or by telephone, but must follow the format of the grievance form.
   (B)   A grievance concerning the accessibility of the town’s services,
programs or activities should be addressed to the Clerk/Treasurer at 109 South
Main Street, Summitville, Indiana, 46070, or by calling 765-536-2802.
(Ord. 551, passed 9-4-2012)
§ 34.085 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE STEP 2: ACKNOWLEDGMENT.
   A grievance should be filed within 90 days after the grievant party becomes
aware of the alleged violation. The Clerk/Treasurer will send an acknowledgment
of receipt of the grievance within 12 business days.
(Ord. 551, passed 9-4-2012)
§ 34.086 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE STEP 3: INFORMAL RESOLUTION.
   (A)   Following the filing of a grievance, the Clerk/Treasurer shall
determine whether, and to what extent, an investigation of the grievance is
warranted. Any resulting investigation shall be conducted by the Clerk/
Treasurer or his or her designee. In the case of a property or access issue,
the grievance will also be investigated by the Town Building Commissioner. A
thorough investigation affords all interested persons and their representatives
an opportunity to submit evidence relevant to a grievance.
   (B)   The Clerk/Treasurer will complete the investigation within 60 calendar
days of receipt of the grievance. If appropriate, the Clerk/Treasurer will
arrange to meet with the grievant to discuss the matter and attempt to reach an
informal resolution of the grievance. Any informal resolution of the grievance
shall be documented in the Clerk/Treasurer’s file and the case will be closed.
(Ord. 551, passed 9-4-2012)
§ 34.087 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE STEP 4: WRITTEN DETERMINATION.
   If an informal resolution of the grievance is not reached in Step 3 within
60 calendar days of receipt of the grievance, a written determination as to the
validity of the complaint, and a description of the resolution, if appropriate,
shall be forwarded to the Clerk/Treasurer to the Town Council for approval.
(Ord. 551, passed 9-4-2012)
§ 34.088 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE STEP 5: FINAL DETERMINATION AND RESOLUTION.
   (A)   (1)   The Clerk/Treasurer shall communicate the determination and
resolution to the grievant within 60 calendar days of receipt of the grievance
unless the executive officer authorizes additional time for further
consideration of the grievance. Any authorized extension of time will be
communicated to the grievant.
      (2)   Any request for reconsideration of the response to the grievance
shall be at the discretion of the executive officer.
   (B)   (1)   If the grievant is not satisfied with the town’s handling of the
grievance at any stage of the process, or does not wish to file a grievance
through the town’s ADA Title II, being 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131 et seq. or
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, § 504, being 29 U.S.C. § 794, grievance procedures,
the grievant may file a complaint directly with the United States Department of
Justice or other appropriate state or federal agency.
      (2)   Use of the town’s grievance procedure is not a prerequisite to the
pursuit of other remedies.
   (C)   The resolution of any specific grievance will require consideration of
varying circumstances, such as the specific nature of the disability; the
nature of the access to services, programs or facilities at issue; the
essential eligibility requirements for participation; the health and safety of
others; and the degree to which an accommodation would constitute a fundamental
alteration to the service, program or facility, or cause an undue hardship to
the town. Accordingly, the resolution by the town of any one grievance does not
constitute a precedent upon which the town is bound or upon which other
complaining parties may rely.

TITLE VI IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
AND POLICY
§ 34.100 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The town is a local state government entity operating under the laws
of the state. The town receives funds from taxes, fees, grants and donations.
All revenues are accounted for in accordance with state law. Federal and state
grant funds shall only be used in a manner consistent with the grant purpose.
   (B)   The town, through the Title VI Implementation Plan, provides for
compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, being 42 U.S.C. §§
2000d et seq. The town will have copies of the Title VI Implementation Plan and
Policy available at the Offices of the Public Works and Safety Director and the
Clerk/Treasurer during normal business hours.
(Ord. 2016-5, passed 6-22-2016)
§ 34.101 GENERAL COMMITMENT TO NONDISCRIMINATION.
   (A)   The town prohibits discrimination and/or the exclusion of individuals
from its municipal facilities, programs, activities and services based on the
individual person’s race, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, low
income status, sexual orientation and/or limited English proficiency. The town
affirms its commitment to providing meaningful opportunities and access to
municipal facilities, programs, activities and services in an effort to comply
with all laws, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, being 42
U.S.C. §§ 2000d et seq., as amended, and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of
1973, being 29 U.S.C. § 794, as amended, and related statutes, regulations and
directives.
   (B)   The town, in §§
34.080 to 34.089 of this chapter, has already affirmed its commitment to
provide access to services, programs and activities in an effort to comply with
Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, being 42 U.S.C. §§
12131 et seq., as amended.
(Ord. 2016-5, passed 6-22-2016)
§ 34.102 LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY (LEP) POLICY.
   (A)   The town is committed to providing persons who are not proficient in
the English language meaningful access and equal opportunity to participate in
its services, activities and programs. The town will take reasonable steps to
ensure meaningful access to its services, activities and programs.
   (B)   (1)   Which documents must be translated, when oral translation is
necessary and whether such services must be immediately available depend on
many factors and require an individualized assessment. The town is committed to
following the United States Department of Justice (USDOJ) guidance on making
such determinations, which includes balancing the following four factors:
         (a)   The number or proportion of LEP persons eligible to be served or
likely to be encountered by a program, activity or service of the recipient or
grantee;
         (b) The frequency with which LEP individuals come in contact with the
program;
         (c)   The nature and importance of the program, activity or service
provided by the recipient to people’s lives; and
         (d)   The resources available to the recipient and costs.
      (2)   The town recognizes that the intent of this guidance is to suggest
a balance that ensures meaningful access by LEP persons to critical services
while not imposing undue burdens on small local governments like the town.
   (C)   (1)   The town can only provide estimates as to the number of LEP
persons based on statistical data. According to the Census Bureau’s 2010–2014
American Community Survey Five-Year Estimate, the town has an estimated 11
persons over the age of four years old who cannot speak English “very well.”
This corresponds to an approximate LEP percentage of 1.1%*. It is estimated
that all persons who cannot speak English “very well” speak Spanish at home.
      (2)   Therefore, if any interpretation would be required, the town will
likely only have to consider procuring an English-to-Spanish translator or
translator service. Considering that only an estimated 1.1% of the population
of the town are LEP persons, it is not expected that any language translation
or assistance services will be developed for any service, program or activity
provide by the town.
   (D)   However, in an effort to ensure that LEP persons have meaningful
access, the town will reasonably accommodate any and all requests for oral
translation services.
   (E)   Additionally, the town will monitor and collect information on persons
who request language translation services. Any town official or employee will
report to the Clerk/Treasurer when any person requests language translation
services:
      (1)   The language requested (which may be accomplished by using the
Census Bureau’s 2004 I-Speak Card); and
      (2)   What service, program or activity the request was made in relation
to.
(Ord. 2016-5, passed 6-22-2016)
Editor’s Note:
   * The margin of error for the estimated number of
    LEP persons is +/- ten, and for the percentage
    of LEP persons is +/- 1%. Therefore, the town
    may have as little as one person or as many as
    20 persons who cannot speak English very well.
§ 34.103 ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE POLICY.
   (A)   ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE means ensuring that services, programs or
activities of the town that affect human health or the environment do not
directly or through contractual or other arrangements use criteria, methods or
practices that discriminate on the basis of race, color or national origin.
   (B)   Town policies, procedures and programs are consistent with federal and
state environmental justice laws, regulations and requirements, including Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, being 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d et seq., as
amended. The town will maintain compliance with environmental justice laws,
regulations and requirements by ensuring new services, programs or activities
of the town deliver equitable levels of service and benefits to minority and
low-income populations as much as is practicable.
(Ord. 2016-5, passed 6-22-2016)
§ 34.104 CONTACTING THE TOWN.
   Persons with requests for services, with questions or with complaints
concerning the Title VI Implementation Plan or the town’s policies relating to
nondiscrimination in the provision of services, programs or activities of the
town should contact the Title VI Coordinator, being the Public Works and Safety
Director.
(Ord. 2016-5, passed 6-22-2016)
§ 34.105 MONITORING CONTRACTORS AND CONSULTANTS.
   (A)   The town will ensure that all federally funded contracts contain
required Civil Rights Act of 1964 Title VI, being 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d et seq.
assurances prohibiting discrimination in violation of the town’s
nondiscrimination policy. (The town has executed all required assurances.) The
town will monitor contractors and consultants for compliance with the town’s
nondiscrimination policy.
   (B)   The town will promptly investigate any alleged claim of discrimination
by the contractor or consultant and will work with the consultant or contractor
to obtain voluntary compliance with the town’s nondiscrimination policy.
(Ord. 2016-5, passed 6-22-2016)
§ 34.106 COMPLAINT PROCEDURE.

class, has been discriminated against based on race, color, national origin,
gender, age, disability, religion, low income status and/or limited English
proficiency in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, being 42
U.S.C. §§ 2000d et seq., as amended, and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of

following the procedure printed below.
   (D)   Any person who feels that he or she has been discriminated against may

section. Persons are encouraged, but not required, to use the complaint form.
If necessary, a town official or employee will help a person reduce his or her
complaint to writing for his or her signature.
   (E)   (1)   Generally, a complaint should include the name, address and
telephone number of the person complaining and a brief description of the
alleged discriminatory conduct, including the date of harm. A person submitting

including the names of witnesses and supporting documentation.
      (2)   Complaints should be directed to the Title VI Coordinator for the

notify the State Department of Transportation of the complaint.
      (4)   Within 60 days of the receipt of the complaint, the town will
conduct an investigation of the allegation based on the information provided
and issue a written report of its findings to the complainant. The town will
try to obtain an informal voluntary resolution to all complaints at the lowest
level possible.
      (5)   A complainant’s identity shall be kept confidential except to the
extent necessary to conduct an investigation. All complaints shall be kept
confidential.
   (F)   (1)   The town will maintain a log of all complaints received that
identifies:
         (a)   Each complainant by race, color, sex, national origin or other
pertinent basis;
         (b)   The recipient of the complaint;

kept by the Public Works and Safety Director for three years.
   (G)   Any complaint alleging discrimination will be resolved through the
procedures set forth in §§
34.080 to 34.089 of this chapter relating to grievance or complaints procedures
under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, being 42 U.S.C.

SCHEDULE IV. MOTOR VEHICLES WITH THREE OR MORE AXELS.
   (A)   Definition. As used in this schedule, THROUGH-TRAFFIC refers to
traffic initiated at and destined for points outside the town.
   (B)   Prohibitions.
      (1)   Unless a detour route has been posted or a police officer otherwise
directs, through-traffic is hereby prohibited for all motor vehicles with three
or more axles except for on the following town streets: Main Street.
      (2)   All motor vehicles with three or more axles are prohibited from
crossing the railway tracks on the following town streets:
         (a)   Walnut Street; and
         (b)   Mill Street.
(Ord. 2018-3, passed 7-3-2018) Penalty, see §
70.99
SCHEDULE V. HEAVY TRUCK TRAFFIC.
   (A)   Preamble.
      (1)   The town has the authority to regulate the heavy truck traffic
within the limits of the town.
      (2)   Large, heavy vehicles cause extraordinary damage to the
infrastructure of local roadways and are an unhealthy source of noise and
pollution. The operation of the ethanol plant south of the town is expected to
substantially increase the number of large heavy vehicles utilizing town-,
county- and state-maintained roadways in the area. The increasing
infrastructure damage to town- and county-maintained roadways caused by the
increasing regular use of large heavy vehicles includes damage to the roadway
surface, subgrade, sidewalks, curbs and pavement markings because those
facilities were not designed for the predicted volumes of vehicles of that size
and weight. Repair of the damage to the roadway surface, subgrade, sidewalks,
curbs and markings is costly to the town and its citizens and puts an
unnecessary burden on limited town resources by causing these elements of the
roadway to fail much sooner than anticipated.
      (3)   It is not the nature nor purpose of the local street system to
convey traffic that is not destined for a location within the town. It is the
nature and purpose of state- and county-maintained roadways to convey the
volumes, weights and sizes of vehicles destined for and originating from the
ethanol plant and other commercial facilities.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this schedule, the following terms,
phrases, words and their derivations shall have the meanings given herein.
      HEAVY TRUCK. Any motor vehicle or towed vehicle with a gross vehicle
weight rating (GVWR), registered gross vehicle weight rating (RGVW) or an
actual weight, whichever is greater, of 26,001 pounds or more; or any
combination of vehicles where the gross combined weight rating (GCWR), total
registered gross vehicle weight (RGVW) or the actual weight of the combination
is 26,001 pounds or more.
      SHALL. It is always mandatory and not merely directory.
   (C)   No heavy truck traffic. It shall be unlawful for any person operating
a heavy truck, as defined in division (B) above, to travel on any street in the
town other than First Street.
   (D)   Required use generally; exceptions. This schedule shall not prohibit:
      (1)   The operation of heavy trucks upon any street where necessary to
the conduct of a commercial enterprise (“in commerce”) for the purpose of

AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND METHODS
§ 153.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   State Legislature has in I.C. 36-1-4-11 granted power to local government
units to adopt, codify and enforce ordinances within their jurisdictions.
Therefore, the Town Council does hereby adopt the following floodplain
management regulations.
(Ord. 2025-6, passed 7-9-2025)
§ 153.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation which
results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affects the public health, safety and general welfare. Additionally, structures
that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of
such damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these
regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 2025-6, passed 7-9-2025)
§ 153.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located
in floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
area;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood-prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2025-6, passed 7-9-2025)
§ 153.004 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters, or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 2025-6, passed 7-9-2025)
§ 153.005 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This chapter shall be in full force and effect on July 9, 2025.
(Ord. 2025-6, passed 7-9-2025)
GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.020 DEFINITIONS.

      FLOOD or FLOODING. 
         (a)   A general and temporary condition of the partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
            1.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters;
            2.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source; or
            3.   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by
flooding and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of
normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and
deposited along the path of the current.
         (b)   FLOOD or FLOODING also includes the collapse or subsidence of
land along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion
or undermining caused by waves or current of water exceeding anticipated
cyclical levels that result in a flood as defined above.
      FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Areas subject to the 1% annual chance flood. (See
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.)
      FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP or FIRM. An official map of a community on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available
digitally is called a digital flood insurance rate map (DFIRM).
      FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY or FIS. The official hydraulic and hydrologic
report provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the
FIRM and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
      FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. See FLOODPLAIN.
      FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE or FPG. The BFE plus two feet at any given
location in the SFHA.
      FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being
inundated by water from any source. (See FLOOD.)
      FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective
and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited
to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations and open space plans.
      FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. Zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances
(such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control
ordinance) and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. The term describes such state or local regulations in any
combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage
prevention and reduction.
      FLOODPROOFING or DRY FLOODPROOFING. A method of protecting a structure
that ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
      FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for
nonresidential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG.
      FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulative increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height.
      FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
      FRINGE or FLOOD FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside
the floodway.
      FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended
purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The
term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for
the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship
repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related
manufacturing facilities.
      HARDSHIP. As related to variances of this chapter, the exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
Town Council requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual and peculiar to
the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional HARDSHIP. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive or requires the property owner to build elsewhere
or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
      HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a
structure.
      HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
         (a)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places
(a listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
         (b)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
         (c)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
         (d)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by an
approved state program as determined by the Secretary of Interior or directly
by the Secretary of Interior in states without approved programs.
      HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. Analyses performed by a
professional engineer licensed by the state, in accordance with standard
engineering practices that are accepted by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and FEMA, used to determine the base flood, other frequency floods,
flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries, and flood profiles.
      INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL- EVALUATION SERVICE (ICC-ES) REPORT. A
document that presents the findings, conclusions and recommendations from a
particular evaluation. ICC-ES reports provide information about what code
requirements or acceptance criteria were used to evaluate a product, and how
the product should be identified and installed.
      LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION or LFD. A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
      LETTER OF MAP CHANGE or LOMC. A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They are broken down into the following categories:
         (a)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project, if built as proposed, or
proposed hydrology changes would meet minimum National Flood Insurance Program
floodplain management standards. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective
flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps or flood insurance
studies.
         (b)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (CLOMR-F). A
letter from FEMA stating that a parcel of land or proposed structure that will
be elevated by fill would not be inundated by the base flood if fill is placed
on the parcel as proposed or the structure is built as proposed.
         (c)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a building or area of land
is not located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation
data. A LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
         (d)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT OUT AS SHOWN (LOMA-OAS). An official
determination by FEMA that states the property or building is correctly shown
outside the SFHA as shown on an effective NFIP map. Therefore, the mandatory
flood insurance requirement does not apply. An out-as-shown determination does
not require elevations.
         (e)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations and elevations.
         (f)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). FEMA’s
modification of the SFHA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill
outside the existing regulatory floodway.
      LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support or basement entryway
immediately next to the structure.
      LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest elevation described among the following:

         (d)   The first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or pillars;
         (e)   The floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement, below
an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any resistance
to the flow of floodwaters. Designs for meeting the flood opening requirement
must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or
meet or exceed the following criteria:
            1.   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the
hydrostatic flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
flood waters; and
            2.   At least two openings are designed and maintained for the
entry and exit of floodwater; and these openings provide a total net area of at
least one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of
all such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or
the interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher.
Doorways and windows do not qualify as openings.
         (f)   The first floor of a building elevated on pilings or columns in
a coastal high hazard area (as that term is defined in 44 C.F.R. § 59.1), as
long as it meets the requirements of 44 C.F.R. § 60.3.
      MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a recreational vehicle.

commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulations
adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
      NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
      NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88). As adopted in 1993, a
vertical control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations

studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the town, delineated as an AE Zone on
the county and incorporated areas flood insurance rate map dated May 3, 2011
shall be determined from the 1% annual chance flood profiles in the flood
insurance study of the county and incorporated areas, and the corresponding
flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) dated May 3, 2011, as well as any subsequent
updates, amendments or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency with the most recent date. Should the floodway limits not be delineated
on the flood insurance rate map for a studied SFHA designated as an AE Zone,
the limits of the floodway will be according to the best available flood layer
as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
   (B)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway and fringe limits for each of
the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the town, delineated as an A Zone on the
county, state and incorporated areas flood insurance rate map, dated May 3,
2011 as well as any subsequent updates, amendments or revisions, prepared by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date, shall be
according to the best available flood layer provided by the Indiana Department
of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site
is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party disagrees with the best
available flood layer data, the party needs to replace existing data with
better data that meets current engineering standards. To be considered, this
data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
review and subsequently approved.
   (C)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification
on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway and fringe limits of
any watercourse in the community’s known flood-prone areas shall be according
to the best available flood layer as provided by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is
greater than one square mile.
   (D)   Upon issuance of a letter of final determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.

§ 153.024 COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or
structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of
this chapter and other applicable regulations.
   (B)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the most conservative
(highest) base flood elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed
structure; or for other developments, affecting any part of the area of the
development.
   (C)   No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without
full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations.
(Ord. 2025-6, passed 7-9-2025)
§ 153.025 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   (A)   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions.
   (B)   However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever
imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 2025-6, passed 7-9-2025)
§ 153.026 DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND ELEVATIONS.
   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) with base flood elevations provided (riverine or lacustrine Zone AE) on
the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the
profiles or table of still water elevations shall govern.
   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
   (C)   If the natural grade elevation of the site in question is at or above
the base flood elevation and a LOMA or LOMR-FW is obtained, the floodplain
regulations will not be applied provided the LOMA or LOMR-FW is not
subsequently superseded or invalidated.
(Ord. 2025-6, passed 7-9-2025)

§ 153.044 MAP MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.
   To meet NFIP minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved
by FEMA, and to ensure that town flood maps, studies and other data identified
in §
153.022 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified.
   (A)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
      (1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         (a)   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         (b)   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area; and
         (c)   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and subdivision or large-scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations.
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have required
technical data for a conditional letter of map revision or letter of map
revision and submitted to FEMA. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources
will review the submittals as part of a partnership with FEMA. The submittal
should be mailed to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources at the address
provided on the FEMA form (MT-2) or submitted through the online letter of map
change website. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall be
the responsibility of the applicant.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a conditional letter of
map revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for
proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood elevation.
      (4)   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map
revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to this section.
   (B)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator may
request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does
not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such
as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the Town Council President and may
be submitted to FEMA at any time.
   (C)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain Administrator
shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the town have been
modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an area, or
no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations
for a particular area. In order that the county and incorporated areas flood
insurance rate map accurately represent the town boundaries, include within
such notification a copy of a map of the town suitable for reproduction,
clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the town has
assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
(Ord. 2025-6, passed 7-9-2025)
§ 153.045 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The Plan Commission (the Board) as established by the Town Council
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from requirements of
this chapter.
   (B)   The Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in
any requirement, decision or determination is made by the Floodplain
Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. Any person
aggrieved by the decision of the Board may appeal such decision to the County
Circuit Court.
   (C)   In considering such applications, the Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (2)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (6)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (7)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (8)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (9)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters at the site; and
      (10)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance.
   (E)   Variances from the provisions of this chapter shall only be granted
when the Board can make positive findings of fact based on evidence submitted
at the hearing for the following:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship as defined in §
153.020; and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
   (F)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §
153.060(A), (C)(1) or (D) may be granted.
   (G)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §
153.060(A), (C)(1) or (D) will require a permit from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources. Variances shall not be issued within any designated
regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
   (H)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §§
153.060 through
153.064 may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
   (I)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of
the structure.
   (J)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvements
and other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent
use.
   (K)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (L)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
   (M)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (N)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request.
(Ord. 2025-6, passed 7-9-2025)
PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 153.060 FLOODPLAIN STATUS STANDARDS.
   (A)   Floodways (riverine). Located within SFHAs, established in §
153.022, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles and has erosion potential. Under the provisions of the
Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1), a permit for construction in a floodway from
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance
of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction or
obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation
activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving undertaken before the
actual start of construction of the structure. General licenses and exemptions
to the requirements of the Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1 and 312 I.A.C. 10)
may apply to qualified additions/improvements to existing lawful residential
structures, rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland restoration, utility line
crossings, outfall projects, creek rock removal and prospecting.
      (1)   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in §
153.022, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward
the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for approval for construction
in a floodway, provided the activity does not qualify for a general license or
exemption (I.C. 14-28-1 or 312 I.A.C. 10).
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. The floodplain
development permit shall meet the provisions contained in this subchapter.
      (3)   The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than
an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to qualify for
a general license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site/
project. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
      (4)   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development shall cause
no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge
without first obtaining a conditional letter of map revision and meeting
requirements of §
153.044(A). A conditional letter of map revision cannot be issued for
development that would cause an increase in flood levels affecting a structure
and such development should not be permitted.
      (5)   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet identified on the
effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity
of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation
of the regulatory flood of at least fifteen-hundredths of a foot as determined
by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that
under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
      (6)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees), the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 C.F.R. § 65.12.
   (B)   Fringe (riverine). If the site is in the fringe (either identified on
the FIRM or identified by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources through
detailed or approximate studies and not identified on a FIRM), the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in this subchapter have been met.
   (C)   SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/
fringes (riverine).
      (1)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile.
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade
has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be
issued; provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
      (2)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile.
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
         (b)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit; provided the provisions contained in this
subchapter have been met.
   (D)   SFHAs not identified on a map.
      (1)   If a proposed development site is near a waterway with no SFHA
identified on a map, the Floodplain Administrator shall verify the drainage
area upstream of the site. If the drainage area upstream of the site is
verified as being greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade
has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper written
approval, evidence of general license qualification or floodplain analysis/
regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be issued;
provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not less
restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and the provisions contained in this subchapter have been met.

ZONING MAP; DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
§ 154.015 ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE OF DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Low Density Residential District (R-1). The purpose of the R-
1 District is to permit the establishment of low density single-family
residential uses, but not to exceed six dwelling units per gross acre. Town
water and sewer facilities shall be required.
   (B)   Medium-Low Density Residential District (R-2). The purpose of the R-
2 District is to encourage the establishment of medium-low density multi-family
residential uses, not to exceed 12 dwelling units per gross acre. Town water
and sewer facilities are required.
   (C)   Medium-High Density Multi-Family Residential District (R-3). The
purpose of the R-3 District is to encourage the establishment of medium- high
density multi-family residential uses, not to exceed 18 dwelling units per
gross acre. All such districts must abut upon either an arterial or collector
street and have town water and sewer facilities.
   (D)   Central Business District (CB). The purpose of the CB District is to
accommodate and encourage further expansion and renewal in the historical core
business area of the community. A variety of business, institutional, public,
quasi-public, cultural, residential and other related uses are encouraged in an
effort to provide the mix of activities necessary to establish a truly urban
character.
   (E)   General Business District (GB). The purpose of the GB District is to
encourage the establishment of areas for general business uses to meet the
needs of a regional market area. Activities in this district are often large
space users, and the customers using such facilities generally do not make
frequent purchases. Shopping centers will be the predominant building approach.
Strip development shall be prohibited. GB Districts shall be located on
arterial streets as specified in the Major Thoroughfare Plan.
   (F)   Light Industrial District (I-1). The purpose of the I-1 District is to
encourage the development of manufacturing and wholesale business
establishments which are clean, quiet and free of hazardous or objectionable
elements, such as noise, odor, dust, smoke or glare; operate entirely within
enclosed structures; and generate little industrial traffic. Research
activities are encouraged. This district is further designed to act as a
transitional use between heavy industrial uses and other less intense business
and residential uses.
   (G)   Heavy Industrial District (I-2). The purpose of the I-2 District is to
encourage the development of major manufacturing, processing, warehousing and
major research and testing operations. These activities require extensive
community facilities and reasonable access to arterial highways; they may have
extensive open storage and service areas and generate heavy traffic, but shall
be prohibited if they create nuisances beyond the limitations set up by the
Commission.
   (H)   Agricultural District (A). The purpose of the A District is to
preserve and protect the decreasing supply of prime agricultural land. This
district also is established to control the indiscriminate infiltration of
urban development in agricultural areas, which adversely affects agricultural
operators.
   (I)   Floodplain District (F.P.D.). The purpose of the Floodplain District
is to safeguard the area likely to be flooded once every 100 years as
designated by the Federal Insurance Administrator and having special flood
hazards as provided by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, being 42
U.S.C. §§ 4001 et seq.

§ 154.017 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists concerning the zoning district shown on the
Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply.
   (A)   Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the
centerlines of streets or highways, street lines or highway right-of-way lines,
the centerlines, street lines or highway right-of-way lines shall be construed
to be the actual boundaries.
   (B)   Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the
lot lines, the lot lines shall be construed to be the actual boundaries.
   (C)   Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately parallel to
the centerlines or street lines of streets or the centerlines or right-of-way
lines of highways, the district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel
to them and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the Official Zoning Map.
If no distance is given, the dimensions shall be determined by the use of the
scale shown on the Official Zoning Map.
   (D)   Where the boundary of a district follows a railroad line, the boundary
shall be deemed to be located in the centerline of the main tracks of the
railroad line.
(Prior Code, § 152.017) (Ord. 362, passed 4-8-1975)

to any agricultural or recreational use and any major repairs to an existing
structure may be permitted by the Zoning Board in the Floodplain District only
in accordance with the special permit procedure in division (C) below.
   (C)   Special permit procedure.
      (1)   Upon receipt of an application for a special permit by the property
owner, the Clerk/Treasurer shall set a date for a hearing, notify the applicant
and notify any person or governmental unit having a probable interest in the
proposal, including the State Natural Resources Commission.
      (2)   The Zoning Board may then, after a hearing according to law, grant
the special permit only after it has considered the recommendation of the State
Natural Resources Commission and only if conditions, restrictions and
requirements are imposed on the use to assure that the use, construction or
major repair:
         (a)   Uses construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage;
         (b)   Uses construction practices and methods that will minimize flood
damage;
         (c)   Is designed or modified and anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement of the structure; and
         (d)   Avoids impairment of, or contamination from, on-site waste
disposal systems during flooding.
   (D)   Variances. The Zoning Board may not grant a variance to any of the
requirements of the Floodplain District without the written approval of the
State Natural Resources Commission.
   (E)   Continuation of nonconforming uses. The lawful use of a building or
premises existing at the time of passage of the ordinance codified in this
chapter may be continued although such use does not conform to the provisions
of this chapter.
   (F)   Improvement of nonconforming uses. A nonconforming use in the
Floodplain District may be altered, enlarged or extended on a one-time basis if
the procedures set forth in this chapter are followed and if the alterations,
enlargements or extensions do not increase the value of the building or
structure, excluding the value of land, by more than 40% of its pre-improvement
market value, unless such building or structure is permanently changed to a
conforming use.
