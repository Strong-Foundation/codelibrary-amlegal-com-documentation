ORDINANCE NO. 10-08
   ADOPTING AND ENACTING THE CODE OF THE TOWN OF BEVERLY SHORES, INDIANA
   WHEREAS, the Town of Beverly Shores has determined that its laws and
ordinances should be reviewed, revised, consolidated, codified and maintained
in accordance with the laws of the State of Indiana; and
   WHEREAS, to achieve codification the Town of Beverly Shores contracted with
American Legal to examine Town ordinances, resolutions, and prior compilations
of the Town’s ordinances, for the purpose of organizing, updating,
consolidating and assuring compliance with State and Federal law; and
   WHEREAS, American Legal has presented several drafts to the Town Council for
review. After many reviews and revisions the Council determines and finds the
Code of Ordinances, inclusive of all ordinances through Ordinance 10-05, passed
June 21, 2010, as prepared by American Legal, and presented for adoption to the
Council is a true, valid, and accurate compilation of the Ordinances of the
Town; and
   WHEREAS, based upon this finding the Council believes it is in the best
interest of the Town and its citizens to adopt a Code, inclusive of ordinances
through Ordinance 10-05, passed June 21, 2010, Title One through Fifteen, as
presented by American Legal, as the official Code of the Town.
   NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the Town of Beverly Shores,
Indiana as follows:
   Section 1. The Code of the Town of Beverly Shores, inclusive of ordinances
through Ordinance 10-05 passed June 21, 2010, Title One through Fifteen,
presented for publication by American Legal is now and hereby adopted as the
official Code of the Town of Beverly Shores.
   Section 2. All ordinances of a general or permanent nature enacted on or
before the passage of this Ordinance and not included in the Code or recognized
and continued in force by reference, are repealed.
   Section 3. The repeal provided for in Section 2., shall not be construed to
revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent
ordinance that is repealed by this Ordinance.
   Section 4. All ordinances of a general or permanent nature enacted on or
before the passage of this Ordinance and included in the Code or recognized and
continued in force by reference therein are amended to the extent said language
in this Code alters the language in the original ordinance or any subsequent
amendments to the original ordinance.
   Section 5. The absence of a history note not appearing in parentheses after
a section in this Code indicates the creation of new legislation by virtue of
this Ordinance.
   Section 6. Further additions or amendments to the Code when passed in form
as to indicate the intention of the Council to make the same a part of the Code
shall be deemed to be incorporated into the Code, so that reference to the Code
includes the additions and amendments.
   Section 7. Future ordinances adopted after passage of this Ordinance that
amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code shall be
construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code.

purposes of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of
the penalty, forfeiture or liability.

contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected
by the repeal and reenactment; but all suits, proceedings and prosecutions for

        - Access fees for meters of any size not listed above shall be calculated based on
        the equivalency factor set forth in the latest edition of the American Water Works
        Association M1 manual.
        In all cases above, all other fees applicable to Michigan City Water Department,
        as stipulated in the agreement between the town and Michigan City Department of
        Water Works, are payable directly to Michigan City Department of Water Works,
        including but not limited to, grid extension.

        *All fee may be amended from time to time by the Town Council.

        **In addition to the access fees set forth in the schedule, upon connection to the
        system, out-of-town owners of tax-paying properties will pay an approximated
        "water system tax" calculated in the same manner as it is for in-town owners of
        tax-paying properties during the life of the SRF loan. The town will bill out-of-
        town owners of tax-paying properties for the amount due twice each year. Such
        bills will be mailed at the approximate same time as property tax bills are sent
        to owners of real property within the town. The first such bill will be mailed at
        approximately the same time as the first property tax bill would be mailed to the
        out-of-town property owner following their connection to the town's water grid
        system. The town will cease billing the out-of-town property owner when the SRF
        loan is retired and the "water system tax" is no longer applied to the property
        tax bills of town residents. Payment will be due within 30 days after the bill is
        mailed. If a semi-annual bill is not timely paid, the town will have all remedies
        allowed to it by law, including without limitation, having service discontinued to
        the property until such time as all outstanding amounts have been paid to the
        town. To the extent an owner of an out-of-town tax-paying property can demonstrate
        to the town, through written correspondence, that it requested to be connected to
        the water system prior to January 1, 2007, and but for the previously applicable
        $18,000 access fee, would have connected to the town's system, the town will
        permit such properly owner, if any exists, to connect to the system at the then
        applicable access fee for in-town property owners.
        -Present access fees* for non-taxpaying property owners, whether located in or
        outside of town                                                                    $18,000

        *All fees may be amended from time to time by the Town Council.

      FIXED ASSETS. Assets the lives of which extend beyond a single fiscal
year. FIXED ASSETS may be either intangible (such as easements, water rights or
contracts with a monetary value), or tangible (such as land and improvements,
buildings and improvements, vehicles, equipment, machinery, furniture and

as outlined below, are to be both capitalized and reported in the town’s annual
financial statements at historical cost.
            (2)   Non-capital assets. FIXED ASSETS not meeting the cost and
useful life criteria described in division (C)(1). Such assets are to be
neither capitalized, depreciated nor reported in the town’s annual financial
statements but are to be expensed in the year purchased and annually
inventoried to assure their proper safekeeping and use.
         (c)   Separate records will be maintained in each of the town’s funds
for each of the above 2 asset classes.

include, at minimum, the following:

         (a)   Items permanently installed/attached to a larger unit either at
or subsequent to the time of construction/acquisition, unlikely to be used
elsewhere and not meeting the cost criteria described in division (C)(1)(a) are
to be included in the cost of the larger unit.
         (b)   The reporting of assets acquired with grant funds and/or by a
department subject to more restrictive reporting requirements than those

criteria or pertinent requirements.

asset’s life nor increase its functionality, but merely maintain its intended
functionality (such as repaving a street) are not to be capitalized, regardless
of cost.
         (d)   Functions that either prolong the life of an asset or increase
its functionality are to be capitalized, regardless of cost.
      (3)   Capitalization thresholds.
         (a)   General fixed assets. With the exception of land (all of which
is to be capitalized) the following assets will be capitalized if their value
is $5,000 or more.

adjacent or nearest contiguous water utilities are the Michigan City Water
Utility and the Indiana American Water Company.
   (B)   As a matter of convenience and necessity the town should establish a

   (C)   The town recognizes that the utility establishment, operation and rate
making will be subject to regulation by the Indiana Utility Regulatory
Commission, and the construction and operation is subject to regulation by the

Water Act.
   (D)   The Town Council declares that it will move forward to establish a
water distribution utility for the benefit of the community.
   (E)   The Town Council determines that it will take the following steps to

(MCDOWW). The installation and construction of the Town of Beverly Shores
municipal water system caused damage to roads within the town. Therefore,
monies recouped from MCDOWW are to be deposited in the Beverly Shores local

   (D)   (1)   The Town Council establishes the initial schedule of access
fees, which may be amended from time to time by the Town Council, to require
receipt of a payment of $3,000 as an access fee, if received before August 1,

installation, from a 3/4-inch/5/8-inch meter to a 1-inch meter at a cost
determined by, and payable to, the Michigan City Municipal Water Department.
      (6)   A 1-inch meter is deemed to be useful for homes located at high
elevations or for those using large quantities of water outdoors.
      (7)   Upon proper application and approval by the town, a prospective
customer may have a water meter installed that is larger than 1 inch but not
larger than 6 inches as long as the town, after consultation with the Michigan
City Water Department, finds that there is sufficient capacity in the water
system at the proposed location of the meter installation so that the water
service to other town customers, both current and those that are reasonably
foreseeable, will not be adversely affected.

to defray costs and pay expenses incurred in relation to initial and/or all
other costs of putting a water distribution system into place and into
operation, and other similar or associated uses; including but not limited to,
engineering fees, consulting, legal, accounting, administration, construction
and/or acquisition fees, costs, charges and/or expenses, including appraisals
and for other or similar expenses related to the purposes specified herein or

      (2)   Administration costs are provided for as a legitimate expense that
may be paid by the funds in this account and shall include administrative,
clerical and labor costs.
      (3)   Clerical, administration and labor costs shall be evidenced by time
records to show the amount of time allocated to time spent on the water system
and the nature of work performed for these disbursements and outlay. The time
records need not be made or kept contemporaneously, but must fairly represent
and show time actually attributable to work, time and attention given to water
system matters.
      (4)   These funds may also be used for the capital cost of hooking up the
administration building of the Town of Beverly Shores (Town Hall building),
Lituanica Park, Rebora Plaza and Four Corners to provide a drinking water
connection to those sites.
      (5)   Allowance for payment of claims for administrative, clerical and
labor costs is effective for time retroactive to January 1, 2004.
      (6)   The debt service fund is to be lowered by making lease payments
from the Beverly Shores water system access fund, a non-reverting fund within
the funds of the town as recommended by the Indiana Department of Local
Government Finance (IDLGF). The lease payments from the debt service fund are
to begin in 2007. At least 1 lease payment will be reserved in the Beverly
Shores water system access fund.
   (F)   (1)   An accurate accounting shall be maintained for credits and
approved claims as debits and maintained by the Clerk-Treasurer as an official
record of the Town of Beverly Shores.
      (2)   The money shall not be commingled with other monies of the Town of
Beverly Shores.
   (G)   (1)   This fund is intended to be established in accordance with the
laws of the State of Indiana and the accounting directives of the Indiana State
Board of Accounts, and is intended to serve as a sinking, non-reverting fund
for the purposes of a water distribution system for the Town of Beverly Shores.
      (2)   The access fee is intended to be a just and equitable fee as
recommended by accounting and engineering consultants.

§ 50.03 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT RUNOFF POLICY.
   (A)   The Town Council resolves that the impact of storm water runoff from

considered in public and private projects alike within the town by weighing the
risks, benefits and costs to the property owners affected and general public as
a whole.
   (B)   Furthermore, the town declares that the town’s code and enactments
shall be applied so that no erosion by wind or water, nor storm water run-off

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 150.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions, and in I.C.
36-1-4-11 the power to adopt ordinances. Therefore, the Town Council of the
Town of Beverly Shores does hereby adopt the following floodplain management
regulations.
(Ord. 93-04, passed 11-8-1993; Am. Ord. 07-01, passed 2-19-2007; Am. Ord. 2015-
05, passed 8-17-2015; Am. Ord. 2022-09, passed 9-20-2022)
§ 150.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The flood hazard areas of the Town of Beverly Shores are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 07-01, passed 2-19-2007; Am. Ord. 2015-05, passed 8-17-2015; Am. Ord.
2022-09, passed 9-20-2022)
§ 150.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located
in floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.

§ 150.04 OBJECTIVES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local
regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for flood
damage prevention and reduction.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.

floodway.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   HARDSHIP. As related to variances of this chapter, the exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Town of
Beverly Shores Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is
exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or
financial hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of
one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship.
All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally
intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURES. Any structure that is:

states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by (a)
an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of Interior; or (b)

      (1)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). FEMA’s comment on a
proposed project that would, upon construction, result in modification of the
SFHA through the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
      (2)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (CLOMR-F). A
letter from FEMA stating that a proposed structure that will be elevated by
fill would not be inundated by the base flood.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in
a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is
only issued by FEMA.
      (4)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT OUT AS SHOWN (LOMA-OAS). An official
determination by FEMA that states the property or building is correctly shown
outside the SFHA as shown on an effective NFIP map. Therefore, the mandatory
flood insurance requirement does not apply. An out-as-shown determination does
not require elevations.
      (5)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (6)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). FEMA’s modification
of the SFHA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill outside the
existing regulatory floodway.

or exceed the following criteria:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood;
         (b)   At least two opening are designed and maintained for the entry
and exit of floodwater; and these openings provide a total net area of at least
one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of all
such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher. Doorways
and windows do not qualify as openings; and
      (6)   The first floor of a building elevated on pilings or columns in a

§ 150.07 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING REGULATORY FLOOD DATA.
   This chapter's protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best
available regulatory flood data is listed below.
   (A)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the Town of Beverly Shores, delineated
as an “AE Zone” on the Porter County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood
Insurance Rate Map dated September 29, 2022, shall be determined from the one-
percent annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Porter
County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas and the corresponding Flood Insurance
Rate Maps (FIRM) dated September 29, 2022, as well as any subsequent updates,
amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
with the most recent date. Should the floodway limits not be delineated on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map for a studied SFHA designated as an “AE Zone”, the
limits of the floodway will be according to the best available flood layer as
provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
   (B)   The regulatory flood elevation for the SFHAs of Lake Michigan,
delineated as a “VE Zone” on the Porter County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas
Flood Insurance Rate Map dated September 29, 2022, shall be the highest
elevation specified on the FIRM among all flood zones affecting the proposed
development, as well any subsequent updates, amendments or revisions, prepared
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (C)   The regulatory flood elevation for the SFHAs of Lake Michigan,
delineated as a “AE Zone” on the Porter County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas
Flood Insurance Rate Map dated September 29, 2022, shall be the highest

amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
with the most recent date, shall be according to the best available flood layer
as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the
upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile.
Whenever a party disagrees with the best available flood layer, the party needs
to replace existing data with better data that meets current engineering
standards. To be considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana

150.07 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
         (a)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
            1.   For all development proposals that impact floodway
delineations or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that
technical data reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months
of the date such information becomes available. These development proposals
include:
               a.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
               b.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed
structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special
flood hazard area;
               c.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and Subdivision or large-scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations.
            2.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have required
technical data for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map
Revision and submitted to FEMA. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources
will review the submittals as part of a partnership with FEMA. The submittal

PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 150.45 FLOODPLAIN STATUS STANDARDS.
   (A)   Floodways (riverine). Located within SFHAs, established in §
150.07 are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. Under the provisions of the
Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1) a permit for construction in a floodway from
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance
of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or
obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation
activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving undertaken before the
actual start of construction of the structure. General licenses and exemptions
to the requirements of the Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1 and 312 IAC 10) may
apply to qualified additions/improvements to existing lawful residential
structures, rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland restoration, utility line
crossings, outfall projects, creek rock removal, and prospecting.
      (1)   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in §
150.07, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources and apply for approval for construction in a
floodway, provided the activity does not qualify for a general license or
exemption (I.C. 14-28-1 or 312 IAC 10).
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. The floodplain
development permit shall meet the provisions contained in this chapter.
      (3)   The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than
an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to qualify for
a general license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site/
project. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
      (4)   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development shall cause
no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge
without first obtaining a Conditional Letter of Map Revision and meeting
requirements of §
150.32(C)(6). A Conditional Letter of Map Revision cannot be issued for
development that would cause an increase in flood levels affecting a structure
and such development should not be permitted.
      (5)   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet identified on the
effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity
of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation
of the regulatory flood of at least fifteen-hundredths of a foot as determined
by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that
under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
      (6)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
   (B)   Fringe (riverine). If the site is in the fringe (either identified on
the FIRM or identified by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources through
detailed or approximate studies and not identified on a FIRM), the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in this chapter have been met.
   (C)   SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/
fringes (riverine).
      (1)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the one-percent annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood
protection grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be
issued, provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
      (2)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and one-percent annual chance flood elevation for the
site.
         (b)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this
chapter have been met.
   (D)   SFHAs not identified on a map.
      (1)   If a proposed development site is near a waterway with no SFHA
identified on a map, the Floodplain Administrator shall verify the drainage
area upstream of the site. If the drainage area upstream of the site is
verified as being greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the one-percent annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood
protection grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper written
approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain analysis/
regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be issued,
provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not less
restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and the provisions contained in this chapter have been met.
   (E)   Coastal high hazard areas. Areas in/around Lake Michigan are
designated as coastal high hazard areas as established in §
150.07. These areas have special flood hazards associated with wave wash. A

permit holder fail to do so and to pay for any damages occasioned by his or her
failure to perform.
   (E)   In addition to the bond requirements, proof of liability insurance to
save the Town of Beverly Shores harmless for any injury or damage to persons or
property resulting directly or indirectly from the work, must be provided with

expressly waived in writing by the Town Council.
   (G)   Upon the filing of the application, as herein provided, the Town
Clerk-Treasurer shall notify the Town Council of the fact, and if the plans and
specifications satisfy the conditions set forth in the application and the bond
and liability insurance is sufficient as to form and surety, the Town Council
shall approve the application and the Clerk-Treasurer shall issue to the
applicant a permit to do the work set forth in the application.
   (H)   At the time of filing the application as herein provided, the
applicant shall pay to the Clerk-Treasurer an application fee as set forth in

of the street fund of the town.

altered by, or in connection with, the excavation or obstruction, including
damage to town roads resulting from heavy truck traffic related to the
excavation or obstruction shall, at the permit holder's expense, be returned to
its original condition or to a condition meeting the existing requirements of
the Town of Beverly Shores, whichever is more stringent.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 155.001 TITLE, PURPOSE AND PROVISIONS DECLARED MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Ordinance
Establishing Zoning and Subdivision Regulations for the Town of Beverly Shores,
Indiana.
   (B)   This chapter is adopted in connection with and as a chapter for the
enforcement of the Comprehensive Plan adopted by the Plan Commission and Town
Council of the Town of Beverly Shores, Indiana. In administering this chapter
and its various provisions, the persons or board charged with the enforcement
of the Zoning Chapter shall be guided by and give due consideration to the
following concerns:
      (1)   To promote the public health, safety, comfort, morals and general
welfare of the Town of Beverly Shores in light of the town's reliance on
private wells and septic systems and the lack of a tax base for a public water
and sewer system in the foreseeable future;
      (2)   To conserve the values of property throughout the Town of Beverly
Shores and to preserve the character, ambience and stability of residential
areas and to ensure that landscape continues to be generally dominate over the
improvements;
      (3)   To encourage the conservation of natural contours, vegetation,
wildlife and all the scenic qualities of the area of the sand dunes and all
associated and related geographical elements which are so unique and valuable
to the balance of nature. The special value of Beverly Shores is that it is one
of the few towns which contains beautiful and unique ecological specimens;
      (4)   To provide adequate light, air, privacy and convenience of access
to property and safety from flood, fire and other dangers;
      (5)   To lessen or avoid congestion on the public streets and highways in
the Town of Beverly Shores and surrounding areas;
      (6)   To regulate and restrict the location and use of buildings,
structures and lands to residences, buildings and other uses, and to restrict
the intensity of those uses and to maintain an appropriate balance between
building scale and the local environmental setting;
      (7)   To divide the Town of Beverly Shores into districts of a number,
shape and area according to the use of land and buildings, as may be deemed
best suited to carry out the purpose of this chapter;
      (8)   To prohibit locations and uses of buildings or structures and uses
of land that are incompatible with the type of development planned for specific
zoning districts in the Town of Beverly Shores;
      (9)   To prevent additions to and alterations or remodeling of existing
buildings or structures in a way so as to avoid the restrictions and
limitations lawfully imposed herein under;
      (10)   To protect against fire, explosion, noxious fumes and other
dangers;
      (11)   To fix reasonable standards to which buildings and structures
shall conform;
      (12)   To provide for the gradual elimination of those uses that would
not be permitted in the district in which they are located and are adversely
affecting the orderly and beneficial development of the Town of Beverly Shores;
      (13)   To define and limit the powers and duties of administrative
officers and bodies as herein provided;
      (14)   To prescribe penalties for the violation and provide methods for
the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter or any amendment thereto; and
      (15)   To give special consideration to the unique character of Beverly
Shores resulting from the combination of private and public land within the
town boundaries.
   (C)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to establish minimum requirements, adopted for the
promotion of the public health, safety and the general welfare. Wherever the
requirements of this chapter are at variance or in any other way conflict with
the requirements of any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations, ordinances,
deed restrictions or covenants, the most restrictive, or that imposing the
higher standards, shall govern.

distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the
district which it is located after it is moved.

been partly or completely demolished or destroyed, including fire, flood,
explosion, force majeure, or any other casualty, may be repaired or replaced,
provided:
      (1)   The structure cannot be repaired or replaced in a manner that makes
the structure legally conforming;

from the date of the destruction or removal and all necessary construction is
completed within 1 year from the date of the application for a building permit;
and

the same square footage of the structure that is being replaced and does not
otherwise increase nonconformity.

   (B)   Site clearing standards.
      (1)   All structures not incorporated into an approved plan for new
improvements on the site shall be removed. STRUCTURES, as that term is used in
this section, means all buildings, foundations, walls, basements, floors,
steps, all slabs including any asphalt or concrete slabs used as pullovers or
driveways on or near any street, curbs, sidewalks, fences, septic tanks, wells,
trash and debris, concrete, steel or wood pilings, wire steel reinforcing rods
or any other material that is not of natural setting.
      (2)   All excavated areas shall be filled with clean fill (sand or dirt).
This material should be placed so it is a minimum of 6 inches above the
original ground level to allow for settlement. The final site shall be left at
or near the contour of the setting and seeded with grass or other ground cover

§ 155.064 TREE PRESERVATION AND PROTECTION.
   (A)   Unimproved land. Removal of any tree 4 inches or greater in diameter
on unimproved land shall be prohibited in the absence of an approved building
permit, except as follows:
      (1)   Allowable removals on unimproved land:
         (a)   A diseased tree or a dead tree. The Building Commissioner shall
be consulted. If the Building Commissioner is unable to ascertain if a tree is
diseased or dead, a certified arborist can be consulted to make that
determination;
         (b)   A tree whose species is identified as a nuisance tree (as
defined in §
155.003);
         (c)   A tree that presents an imminent danger to humans or potential
damage to structures; and
         (d)   A tree for which removal is pursuant to a written naturalization
plan, which may be provided annually for a 12-month period, approved by the
Building Site Committee, for the removal of nuisance, non-native or invasive
species.
      (2)   Removal pursuant to allowable removals in division (A)(1) above
shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
         (a)   Prior written applications to the Town Clerk for a tree removal
permit, including payment of any required fees. The written application shall
include, but not be limited to, the number, approximate location, reason for
removal, and diameter of trees to be removed. Each permit may allow for the
removal of up to ten (10) trees.
         (b)   Review and approval of the application in (a) above by the
Building Commissioner.
         (c)   The permit must be applied for and received before beginning
removal work, except in case of imminent threat to humans or structures, under
division (A)(1)(c) in which case the permit must be applied for within five (5)
business days after the removal.
         (d)   The fee for each permit shall be in accordance with the Town Fee
Schedule, §
10.99.
      (3)   Removals pursuant to the allowable unimproved property exceptions
above shall require that trees be cut down, never knocked over using heavy
equipment. If stumps are to be removed, they shall be removed using stump
grinding equipment, axes and saws, never ripped out using heavy equipment.
   (B)   Improved land. Removal of any tree 4 inches or greater in diameter on
improved land shall be prohibited, except as follows:
      (1)   The property owner may remove any tree within 15 feet of the
dwelling unit.
      (2)   The following are allowable exceptions to the above improved
property restrictions on tree removal:
         (a)   A diseased tree or dead tree. The Building Commissioner, or his
or her written designee, shall be consulted. If the Building Commissioner, or
his or her designee, is unable to ascertain if a tree is diseased or dead, an
arborist certified by the Indiana Arborist Association can be consulted to make
that determination;
         (b)   A tree that presents an imminent danger to humans or potential
damage to structures as determined by the Street Commissioner of the Town of
Beverly Shores; and
         (c)   A nuisance tree (as defined in §
155.003).
      (3)   Removal pursuant to division (B)(1) above and the allowable
improved property exceptions in division (B)(2) above shall require that trees
be cut down, never knocked over using heavy equipment.
      (4)   Excepting stumps located within the footprint of an approved
building, if stumps are to be removed, they shall be removed using stump
grinding equipment, axes and saws, never ripped out using heavy equipment.
   (C)   Tree topping.
      (1)   This practice of severely cutting back of limbs within a tree's
crown of branches so as to alter its natural shape and disfigure the tree shall
be prohibited, except as provided in division (C)(2) below.
      (2)   The only allowable exception to this prohibition shall be utility
companies in the maintenance of their easements, when other less disfiguring
pruning practices are ineffective.
   (D)   Protection of trees during construction.
      (1)   By far the greatest damage to our trees, and the fragile dunes they
are critical in stabilizing, occurs during construction activities. Heavy
construction equipment activity is largely responsible, including purposeful or
inadvertent knocking over of trees that disturbs large areas of fragile topsoil
and potentially damages other adjacent trees and vegetation.
      (2)   Heavy equipment traffic over tree root zones (which extend as far
as the tree's leaf canopy) compacts soil and suffocates tree roots, resulting
in tree die back or death over time. In addition, altering of original grades
in tree root zones jeopardizes long-term tree survival. To avoid long-term tree
damage, the maintenance and/or restoration of original soil grades is
imperative.
      (3)   To reasonably protect existing trees, the following tree protection
measures shall be mandatory whenever building activity is undertaken. Items in
divisions (3)(a) through (d) below shall be completed and inspected by the
Building Commissioner prior to commencing any excavation, site clearing or
building activity. Once the site plan is approved no changes can be made.
         (a)   Trees to be removed in accordance with the site plan shall be
marked with colored ribbon for easy identification. During the construction
process for improved land, the property owner may remove any tree within 15
feet of the dwelling unit being built.
         (b)   In order to protect the trunks of trees, 2 x 4 or similar sturdy
lumber 8 feet high shall be lashed to the trunks of trees adjacent to ingress/
egress routes on the property and other high risk areas;
         (c)   Trees to be removed in accordance with the site plan shall be
cut down, never knocked over using heavy equipment, in a manner so as not to
damage adjacent trees. Stumps located within the footprint of an approved
building may be removed using heavy equipment. If stumps are to be removed
outside the footprint of an approved building, they shall be removed using
stump grinding equipment, axes and saws, never ripped out using heavy
equipment;
         (d)   Directional drilling for the installation of utilities is
preferred over trenching because trenching may involve the cutting of roots.
Where trenching is used, trenches must be run around critical root zones to
prevent root damage;
   (E)   (1)   Penalty. Any violation of this section shall be subject to the
provisions of §
155.999 of this chapter, except that the fines and other penalties for the
removal of any tree in whole or in part, including the topping of any tree, in
violation of this section shall be as set forth in §
10.98, with each tree representing a separate offense.
      (2)   In addition to the fines and other penalties, trees cut down in
violation of this section shall be replaced with that number of 2-inch diameter
trees so that the sum total of the diameter of all replacement trees equals the
diameter of the removed trees.
      (3)   Diameter means a measurement of the size of tree that is equal to
the diameter of its trunk, measured 4 1/2 feet above the adjacent natural
grade.
      (4)   The following species of trees may not be planted as replacement
trees (See definitions for TREE and NUISANCE):
         (a)   Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus altissima);
         (b)   Buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica and Rhamnus frangula);
         (c)   Russian Olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia);
         (d)   Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia);
         (e)   Siberian Elm (Ulmus pumila);
         (f)   White Mulberry (Morus alba);
         (g)   Red Mulberry (Morus rubra);
         (h)   Honey Locust (Gleditsia triocanthos);
         (i)   Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia); and
         (j)   Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua).
      (5)   If a removal pursuant to division (A)(1) above is done without
receiving a permit as required by this section before beginning the removal
work, the cost of the permit shall be twice of the amount of the fee. This
additional fee is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any fine that may be
imposed for violating the town code. This division (E)(5) shall not apply to
emergency removal that is done due to imminent threat to humans or structures,
but shall apply when a permit for emergency removal is not applied for within
five (5) business days after the emergency removal work.
      (6)   (a)   A tree removal fine shall be waived for offending property
owners meeting the following criteria:
            1.   It is the offender’s first violation of this section; and
            2.   The offender removed trees that satisfied the requirements of
divisions (A)(1), (A)(3), (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3), provided that the offender
bears the burden of proof for each removed tree.
         (b)   In the event the above criteria are satisfied and the tree
removal fine(s) are waived, the offender shall still be required to pay the
cost of the applicable permit fee as set forth in division (E)(5) above.
      (7)   Division (E)(6) above shall only apply to property owners. If a
first-time offense for a property owner is committed by a contractor, the
applicable tree removal fines shall be assessed and charged to the contractor.
   (F)   A tree removal fine shall be assessed and paid according to §
10.98. The increased incremental fines and higher replacement ratio for larger
trees is intended as a deterrent in order to address the fact that these trees
are a significant and valuable resource for the entire Beverly Shores
community.
   (G)   Tree removal fines shall be paid to the Town Clerk-Treasurer and shall
be designated as funds to be used for the planting, care and maintenance of
trees on town-owned property and parks, and on the public right-of-way.
   (H)   No building permit shall be issued for a property upon which a tree
removal violation has occurred for a period of 1 year from the year of the last
violation.
   (I)   No building permit shall be issued for a property upon which a tree
removal violation has occurred until all unpaid tree removal fines have been
paid.
   (J)   No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a property upon which
a tree removal violation has occurred until all unpaid tree removal fines have
been paid.
   (K)   No building contractor registration shall be issued for a contractor
which has been assessed with tree removal fines until all unpaid tree removal
fines have been paid.

   (A)   A building permit shall expire 12 months from the date of approval,
except that a building permit for complete construction of the main building
shall expire 18 months from the date of approval. The building permit shall
state the expiration date. Once a building permit has expired, the project must
be terminated, and all construction or activities related to the building
permit must stop until or unless a new building permit is issued. A building
permit will expire earlier than the expiration date stated on the permit if the
project is completed. The completion date shall be determined by the Building
Commissioner via the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or if such is not
required for the project, by issuance of the Building Commissioner's written

single-family dwelling or any other building or any part of the real estate
containing the single-family dwelling during the rental period;
         (e)   No sublease or any other rental of any kind of the single-family
dwelling or any other building that is part of the real estate containing the
single-family dwelling is permitted during the rental period;
         (f)   The owner of the single-family dwelling registers each rental in
the Clerk-Treasurer's office on a form approved by the town and pays a
registration fee of $25. The registration shall be required for each rental.

§ 155.140 PROTECTION OF STEEP SLOPES.
   (A)   Steep slope protection. It is the policy of the town to protect the
fragile dune environment within the town. As a part of this policy, the town
will require planning to minimize or avoid damage to the dune environment and
in particular to steep slope dunes which are particularly fragile.
   (B)   Sections
155.140 et seq. comprise the steep slope protection provisions: these minimum
requirements supplement the applicable provisions of
Chapter 155 and are in addition to all other applicable requirements in the
Code. Reference to the Committee in these steep slope provisions refers to
either the Building Site Committee or the Building Committee, as applicable.
(Ord. 2021-09, passed 7-20-2021)
§ 155.141 DEFINITION OF STEEP SLOPE.
   A slope greater than a one-foot vertical rise in a three-foot horizontal
plane on a dune which is at least 20 feet in height measured from the lowest
point of elevation on the lot. A dune shall meet this definition if it rises or
falls continuously at least 20 feet or if it consists of a series of dunes and/
or swales on the lot that in the totality rise or fall at least 20 feet from
the lowest point of elevation on the lot.

from the surface of the slope at any point either during or after construction,
and the applicant otherwise demonstrates that the proposed septic system as
well as the construction related activities are consistent with the intent of
this chapter.
   (B)   If there is a steep slope within any setback of a lot, no construction
activities, including the removal of trees or vegetation, shall occur within
the side or rear yard setbacks which contain any portion of a steep slope.

condition site plan approval or building permit approval on the applicant
utilizing an alternative site on the lot.
      (2)   Any proposed driveway shall be located on the portion of the lot
that does not affect the steep slope. A driveway located on or affecting a
steep slope is greatly discouraged and will only be permitted in extraordinary
cases where the Committee determines that the construction of and placement of

practicable alternative site on the lot or adjacent property available to the
applicant which would avoid or lessen the impact to the steep slope. The
applicant's plans must demonstrate to the Committee that no alternative
practicable site exists and that the proposed construction, and location of any
structure will not cause damage to the dune, roadway, or surrounding property
owners. If the proposed building site, or any preparation for construction,
staging or construction activities, excavation, grading or any other activity
is on or within ten feet of a steep slope or that disturbs or impacts the steep
slope, then no more than 120 cubic yards of sand or soil for septic and no more
than 180 cubic yards of sand or soil for the dwelling and all other structures,
including a driveway, if permitted, shall be removed, relocated, or added to
the dune.

maintenance of the private streets at no expense to the governmental unit.
      (2)   Lot arrangements.
         (a)   The lot arrangements shall be so that there will be no
foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in
securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with this chapter
and other regulations and in providing safe driveway access to buildings on
lots from an approved street.
         (b)   Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of this
chapter.
         (c)   Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be discouraged
except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from
arterial streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and
orientation.
         (d)   Lots shall not generally, derive access exclusively from an
arterial or major collector street. Where driveway access from an arterial or
major collector street may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the Plan
Commission may require that the lots be served by a common and combined
driveway in order to limit possible traffic hazards on the street.
         (e)   Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away
from all buildings and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the
general storm drainage for the area.
         (f)   Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots or used as
spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to provide at least 6 inches of cover
between the sidewalks and curbs, and shall be stabilized by seeding or
planting.
         (g)   No cut trees, timber debris, earth, rocks, stones, soil, junk,
rubbish or other waste materials of any kind shall be buried in any land, or
left deposited on any lot or street at the time the buildings are ready for
occupancy.
         (h)   Where individual septic tanks have been authorized, sufficient
area shall be provided for a replacement sewage disposal system.
      (3)   Block arrangements.
         (a)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for 2 tiers of
lots of appropriate depth. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be
permitted in blocks adjacent to water courses and commercial areas.
         (b)   Whenever practical, blocks along arterials and major collector
streets shall not be less than 1,000 feet in length. As a general rule, blocks
in other residential areas shall not be more than 1,000 nor less than 400 feet
in length.
         (c)   In long blocks the Plan Commission may require an easement
through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities or pedestrian
walkways.
         (d)   Where blocks are developed along arterial streets and/or
highways that shall contain alleys, those alleys, shall run parallel to the
arterial and not perpendicular or radial to it so as to create an intersection
between the arterial and alley.
      (4)   Subdivision and street names.
         (a)   The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too
closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the area
covered by these regulations. The Plan Commission shall have final authority to
approve the name of the subdivision which shall be determined at the time of
preliminary plat approval.
         (b)   Street names shall not duplicate any existing name within the
area covered by these regulations except where a new street is a continuation
of an existing street. Street names that may be spelled differently but sound
the same as existing streets shall not be used.
         (c)   The Plan Commission shall have final authority to name all
streets (in case of conflict) upon recommendation of the Building Committee at
the time of the preliminary plat approval.
      (5)   Public sites and open spaces.
         (a)   Where it is determined that a proposed park, playground, school
or other public use as shown on the local government's plan is located in whole
or in part within a proposed subdivision, sufficient area for the public use
shall be dedicated to the public or reserved and offered for public purchase.
If within 10 years of plat recording, the purchase is not agreed on, the
reservation shall be cancelled or shall automatically cease to exist.
         (b)   Existing natural features which add value to residential
development and enhance the attractiveness of the community shall be preserved
in the design of the subdivision.

      (2)   External boundaries.
         (a)   The external boundaries of a subdivision shall be monumented in
the field by monuments of stone or concrete, not less than 30 inches in length,
not less than 4 inches square or 5 inches in diameter, and marked on top with a
cross, brass plug, iron rod or other durable material securely embedded.
         (b)   The spacing and exact location requirements shall be established
by the Building Commissioner. The Plan Commission may amend these requirements.
      (3)   Internal boundaries. All internal boundaries and those corners and
points not covered by the preceding division (2) shall be monumented in the
field by steel or iron rods 1/2 inch in diameter or iron pipe 1 inch in
diameter and at least 24 inches long. These monuments shall be placed at all
block and lot corners, at each end of all curves (P.C. and P.T.), and at all
internal angle points as required by the Building Commissioner.
   (B)   Traffic-control devices.
      (1)   Street name and regulatory signs. The applicant shall install
street name signs in accordance with the Town of Beverly Shores design
standards and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices of Indiana. One
sign shall be installed at each intersection indicating the name of each street
thereat. Other regulatory signs shall be the responsibility of the Town of
Beverly Shores.
      (2)   Warning signs and other devices. Local government shall be
responsible for the installation of all warning signs and other traffic control
devices, except when warranted in commercial areas, the developer may be
required to pay the cost.
   (C)   Streets and roads.
      (1)   General. In order to provide for streets of suitable location,
width and improvement to accommodate expected traffic and afford satisfactory
access to police, fire fighting, snow removal, sanitation and road maintenance
equipment, and to coordinate street development so as to compose a convenient
system, avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties and assure compatibility
with long range comprehensive plans, all streets shall be designed according to
the geometric standards set forth in these regulations.
      (2)   Principles of design. Subdivision street design shall follow
regulations for this purpose adopted by the Town Council of Beverly Shores.
   (D)   Drainage facilities.
      (1)   General. The Plan Commission shall not recommend for approval any
plat of a subdivision which does not make adequate provision for a storm or
flood water runoff. The drainage system shall be separate and independent of
any sanitary sewerage system. Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is
not carried across or around any intersection, nor for a distance of more than
400 feet in any gutter. Surface water drainage patterns shall be shown for each
lot and block.
      (2)   Requirements for storm sewers. The applicant may be required by the
Plan Commission to carry away by pipe or open ditch, any spring or surface
water that may exist either previously to, or as a result of, the subdivision.
These drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where
feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width. Drain
facilities shall be provided under driveways so that the flow of water in
ditches is not impeded.
      (3)   Flood plain areas. The Plan Commission shall, when it deems
necessary for the health, safety or welfare of the present and future
population of the area and necessary to the conservation of water, drainage and
sanitary facilities, prohibit the subdivision of any portion of the property
which lies within the floodplain. Any approvals within the floodplain shall, at
a minimum, meet the requirements of the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
      (4)   Drainage easement. Where a subdivision is traversed by a
watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream, the subdivider shall provide a
storm water easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the
lines of the watercourse, and of a width and construction as will be acceptable
to the Building Commissioner. The easement shall be adequately monumented, and
whenever possible it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by open
channel with landscaped banks.
   (E)   Water facilities.
      (1)   General.
         (a)   Necessary action shall be taken by the applicant to extend or
create a water supply system capable of providing water for domestic use and
fire protection.
         (b)   The location of all water supply improvements, shall be shown on
the preliminary plat, and the cost of providing and installing same shall be
included in the performance bond.
      (2)   Individual wells and central water systems.
         (a)   In low-density zoning districts and in outlying or rural areas
where a public water system is not available, in the discretion of the Plan
Commission, individual wells may be used or a central water system provided in
a manner so that an adequate supply of potable water will be available to every
lot in the subdivision.
         (b)   Individual wells and central water systems shall be sampled and
approved by the appropriate health authorities.
   (F)   Sewage facilities.
      (1)   General. The applicant shall install sanitary sewer facilities in a
manner prescribed by the Porter County Board of Health and subject to the
specifications, rules, regulations and guidelines of the Porter County Board of
Health.
      (2)   High-density Residential and Nonresidential Districts. Sanitary
sewer facilities shall connect with public sanitary sewer systems. Sewers shall
be installed to serve each lot and to grades and sizes required by appropriate
local officials and agencies. No individual disposal system or treatment plants
(private or group disposal systems) shall be permitted.
      (3)   Low and medium-density Residential Districts. Sanitary sewer
systems shall be constructed as follows.
         (a)   Where a public sanitary sewer system is reasonably accessible
(as determined by the Plan Commission) the applicant shall connect with same
and provide sewers to each lot in the subdivision.
         (b)   Where public sanitary sewer systems are not reasonably
accessible but will become available within a reasonable time not to exceed 15
years the applicant may choose to install 1 of the following alternatives:
            1.   Central sewage system with the maintenance cost to be assessed
against each property benefitted. Where plans for future public sanitary sewer
systems exist, the applicant shall install the sewer lines, laterals, mains in
conformance with plans and ready for connection to future sewer mains; or
            2.   Individual sewage disposal systems, provided the applicant
shall install sanitary sewer lines, laterals and mains to a point in the
subdivision boundary where a future connection with the public sewer main shall
be made. Sewer lines shall be laid from the individual dwellings to the street
line and a connection shall be available in each dwelling to connect from the
individual disposal system to the sewer system when the public sewers become
available. These sewer systems shall be appropriately capped until ready for
use.
         (c)   Where sanitary sewer systems are not reasonably accessible and
will not become available within an estimated 15-year period, the applicant may
install sewage systems as follows.
            1.   Medium-density Residential Districts shall have a central
sewage system. No individual disposal system will be permitted. The Commission
may however, where plans exist for a public sewer system to be built beyond a
period of 15 years, require that the applicant install all sewer lines,
laterals and mains in conformance with the plans and ready for connection to
the public sewer mains.
            2.   Low-density Residential Districts may have individual sewage
disposal systems or a central sewage system can be used.
      (4)   Mandatory connections to public sewers. If a public sanitary sewer
is accessible and a sanitary sewer is placed in a street or alley abutting upon
a property, the owner thereof shall be required to connect to the sewer for the
purpose of disposing of waste. It shall be unlawful for any owner or occupant
to maintain upon the property an individual sewage disposal system.
      (5)   Individual disposal system requirements. Minimum lot areas shall
conform to the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance and individual septic
systems shall conform to the requirements of the Porter County Health
Department requirements.

whom it is directed, technical determinations as described in this chapter will
be made, and that if violations as alleged are found, costs of the
determinations shall be charged against those responsible for the violation, in
addition to other penalties as may be appropriate, but that if it is determined
that no violation exists, the cost of the determination will be paid by the
town.
         (e)   If there is no reply within the time limit set, but the alleged
violation is corrected to the satisfaction of the Building Commissioner, he or
she shall note “violation corrected”on his or her copy of the notice and shall
retain it among his or her official records, taking other action as may be
warranted.
         (f)   If there is no reply within 30 days of receiving the letter
(thus establishing admission of violation) and the alleged violation is not
corrected to the satisfaction of the Building Commissioner within the time
limit set, he or she shall proceed to take or cause to be taken action as is
warranted by continuation of a violation after notice to cease.
         (g)   If a reply is received within the time limit set indicating that
the alleged violation will be corrected to the satisfaction of the Building
Commissioner, but requesting additional time, the Building Commissioner may
grant an extension if he or she deems it warranted in the circumstances of the
case and if the extension will not, in his or her opinion, cause immediate
peril to life, health or property.
         (h)   If reply is received within the time limit set requesting
technical determination as provided in this chapter and if the alleged
violations continue, the Building Commissioner may call in properly qualified
experts to make the determinations. If expert findings indicate violation of
the performance standards, the costs of the determination shall be assessed
against the properties or persons responsible for the violation, in addition to
other penalties as may be appropriate under the terms of §
155.065.
      (2)   If no violation is found, the costs of the determinations shall be

regulations of this subchapter, then the Building Commissioner shall, as a
condition precedent to the issuing of a permit for the use or occupancy,
require the deposit in escrow of $1,000 for a period of 1 year from the date of
the new or altered use or occupancy.
   (B)   If, during the 1-year period, the Building Committee believes there is
reasonable probability that the regulations of this subchapter are being
violated they may employ a qualified technician or technicians to perform
measurement, investigations and analysis to determine whether or not the
regulations of this subchapter are being violated, and they may pay their
reasonable fees out of the aforementioned escrow deposit, regardless of the
outcome of the investigation.
   (C)   If the reasonable fees of the technician or technicians exceed the
amount of any available escrow deposit, and if a violation of this subchapter
is discovered, the fees may be recovered as a penalty in the same manner as,
and in addition to, the penalties otherwise provided for the violation of this
chapter. Escrow deposits or remainders of escrow deposits shall be returned to
the depositor at the expiration of the escrow period.

WETLAND PROTECTION
§ 155.220 TITLE, FACT AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   Title. This subchapter may be cited as the Beverly Shores Wetland
Protection Ordinance.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The wetlands of Beverly Shores are indispensable and fragile
natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding,
erosion and soil imitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve humans and
nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water
quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; shoreline erosion
control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and
recreation opportunities.
      (2)   A considerable number of these important natural resources have
been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building,
pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses may, over time,
destroy remaining wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public
safety and the general welfare.
      (3)   It is therefore necessary for Beverly Shores to ensure maximum
protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities in wetlands and
those activities at adjacent upland sites that may adversely affect wetlands
and to encourage restoration of already degraded or destroyed systems.
   (C)   Purpose.
      (1)   It is the policy of Beverly Shores to:
         (a)   Encourage or require planning to avoid or minimize damage to
wetlands wherever prudent or feasible;
         (b)   Require that activities not dependent upon a wetland location be
located at upland sites;
         (c)   Allow wetland losses only where all practicable measures have
been applied to reduce those losses that are unavoidable and in the public
interest;
         (d)   Provide for compensation in the form of wetland restoration or
creation to offset further losses; and
         (e)   Provide for the protection of wetlands under additional
ordinances already adopted by Beverly Shores.
      (2)   Furthermore, activities must not threaten public safety or cause
nuisances by:
         (a)   Blocking flood flows, destroying flood storage area or
destroying storm barriers, thereby raising flood heights or velocities on other
land and increasing flood damages;
         (b)   Causing water pollution through any means, including location of
waste water disposal systems in wet soils, unauthorized application of
pesticides, herbicides and algaecides; disposal of solid wastes or storm water
runoff at inappropriate sites; or the creation of unstabilized fills;
         (c)   Increasing erosion; or
         (d)   Increasing runoff of sediment and storm water.
      (3)   In addition, it is the policy of Beverly Shores that activities in
or affecting wetlands do not destroy natural wetland functions important to the
general welfare by:
         (a)   Decreasing breeding, spawning, nesting, wintering, feeding or
other critical habitat for fish and wildlife, including rare, threatened and
endangered plant and animal species and commercially and recreationally
important wildlife;
         (b)   Interfering with the exchange of nutrients needed by fish or
other forms of wildlife;
         (c)   Decreasing groundwater recharge;
         (d)   Destroying sites needed for education and scientific research as
outdoor biophysical laboratories, living classrooms and training areas;
         (e)   Interfering with public rights in waters and the recreation
opportunities for fishing, boating, hiking, bird watching, photography, camping
and other activities in wetlands; or
         (f)   Destroying aesthetic and property values.

official wetlands map as being wetlands are presumed to be wetlands consistent
with the definitions thereof.
      (2)   Wetlands not shown on the official wetlands map are presumed to
exist in Beverly Shores and are hereby designated to be within the wetlands and
are protected under all of the terms and provisions of this subchapter. The
official wetlands map shows only the general location of wetlands and should be
consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before
engaging in a regulated activity.
      (3)   The official wetlands map, together with all explanatory matter
thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be
a part of this subchapter. The official wetlands map shall be on file in the
office of the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (B)   Rules for interpretation of wetland district boundaries.
      (1)   The boundaries of a wetland shall ordinarily be determined by the
applicant through the performance of a field survey applying the wetland
definition.
      (2)   The official wetlands map is to be used as a guide to the general
location of wetlands.
      (3)   The applicant is required under §
155.225(B) to show a wetland boundary on a scaled drawing submitted as part of
the permit application.
      (4)   Wetland delineations shall be performed in accordance with the
procedures specified in the Federal Manual for Identifying and Delineating
Jurisdictional Wetlands and any subsequent amendments thereto. Evidence
documenting the results of the boundary survey may be required by the Beverly
Shores Plan Commission.
      (5)   The Beverly Shores Building Commissioner, when requested by the
applicant, may waive the delineation and, in the applicant, may waive the
delineation and, in lieu of direct action by the applicant, perform the
delineation.
         (a)   The Beverly Shores Building Commissioner may use remote sensing,
hydrologists, soil scientists or other experts as needed to perform the
delineation.
         (b)   The applicant may be charged for costs incurred in accordance
with the provisions of §
155.225(B).
      (6)   Where the Beverly Shores Building Commissioner performs a wetland
determination at the request of the applicant, the applicant may appeal the
determination to the Beverly Shores Plan Commission which shall have the
authority to review the evidence presented to the Beverly Shores Building
Commissioner and to obtain additional information as it deems necessary to
review the Beverly Shores Building Commissioner's determination. The decision
of the Beverly Shores Plan Commission shall be considered a final
determination.
      (7)   Where the applicant has provided a determination of the wetland
boundary, the Beverly Shores Plan Commission shall verify the accuracy of, and
may render adjustments to, the boundary delineation.
      (8)   In the event the adjusted boundary delineation is contested by the
applicant, the Beverly Shores Plan Commission may attempt to set mutually
agreeable boundaries; or, when an attempt is unsuccessful, shall, at the
applicant's expense, obtain competent expert services to render a final
delineation.

measures for the damaged or destroyed wetland area by the person or agent
responsible for the violation.
         (b)   If the responsible person or agent does not complete these
measures within a reasonable time following the order, the Town of Beverly
Shores may restore the affected wetland to its prior condition and create or
restore other wetlands for the purpose of offsetting losses sustained as a
result of the violation. The person or agent responsible for the original
violation shall be liable to the Town of Beverly Shores for the cost of those
actions.
      (6)   To guide restoration and creation actions, the Beverly Shores Plan
Commission shall have the power to order the violator to develop a plan as
described in §
155.225(H) for the approval of the Beverly Shores Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (D)   Abrogation and greater restrictions.
      (1)   It is not intended that this subchapter repeal, abrogate or impair
any existing state and federal laws, regulations, easements, covenants and deed
restrictions.

minimum requirements in their interpretation and application and shall be
liberally construed to serve the purposes of this subchapter.

Beverly Shores Board of Zoning Appeals. A request for determination shall
contain plans, data and other information as may be specified by the Beverly
Shores Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (4)   (a)   At the time of an application or request for determination,

to the record owners of property within 300 feet of the applicant's property,
the Beverly Shores Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public hearing on the

         (b)   Minutes of the hearing shall be made.
         (c)   The Beverly Shores Board of Zoning Appeals shall make the final

and the standards set forth below.
   (D)   Standards for special permits. The Beverly Shores Board of Zoning
Appeals, after according consideration to the comments of the general public,
other affected municipalities and counties and federal and state agencies with
jurisdiction over the area in question, shall issue a wetland permit only if it
is found that the regulated activity is determined to be in the public interest
in accordance with §
155.225(F) below and that the applicant has demonstrated by a preponderance of
the evidence that the regulated activity:
      (1)   Is water-dependent or requires access to the wetland as a central
element of its basic function, or is not water-dependent but has no practicable
alternative;
      (2)   Will result in minimum feasible alteration or impairment to the
wetland's functional characteristics and its existing contour, vegetation, fish
and wildlife resources and hydrological conditions;
      (3)   Will not jeopardize the continued existence of species that appear
on federal or state rare, threatened or endangered species lists;
      (4)   Will not cause significant degradation of groundwater or surface-
water quality;
      (5)   Complies with all applicable state, local and federal laws,
including those related to sediment control, pollution control, floodplain
zoning and on-site waste water disposal;
      (6)   Will provide a wetland buffer area of not less than 25 feet between
the wetland and upland activities for those portions of a regulated activity
that need not be conducted in the wetland; and
      (7)   Complies with other standards contained in this subchapter,
including those pertaining to wetland creation and restoration as required.
   (E)   Practicable alternative test.
      (1)   For all permit applications, an alternative site for the proposed
activity shall be considered practicable if it is available and the proposed
activity can be carried out on that site after taking into consideration costs,
existing technology, infrastructure and logistics, in light of overall project
purposes.
      (2)   There is no practicable alternative if the applicant demonstrates
all of the following to the satisfaction of the Beverly Shores Board of Zoning
Appeals:
         (a)   The basic purpose of the project cannot reasonably be
accomplished using 1 or more other sites in the general region that would avoid
or result in less adverse impact on a wetland;
         (b)   The basic purpose of the project cannot be accomplished by a
reduction in the size, scope, configuration or density of the project as
proposed or by changing the design of the project in a way that would avoid or
result in fewer adverse effects on the wetland; and
         (c)   In cases where the applicant has rejected alternatives to the
project as proposed due to constraints such as inadequate zoning,
infrastructure or parcel size, the applicant has made reasonable attempts to
remove or accommodate such constraints.
   (F)   Public interest test. In determining whether a proposed regulated
activity in any wetland is in the public interest, the Beverly Shores Board of
Zoning Appeals shall consider the following:
      (1)   The extent of the public need for the proposed activity;
      (2)   The extent and permanence of the beneficial or detrimental effects
that the proposed regulated activity may have on the public and private uses
for which the property is suited;
      (3)   The quality of the wetland that may be affected and the amount of
wetland to be disturbed;
      (4)   The economic value of the proposed regulated activity to the
general area; and
      (5)   The ecological value of the wetland and probable impact on public
health and safety, fish, plants and wildlife.
   (G)   Special use permit conditions.
      (1)   The Beverly Shores Board of Zoning Appeals may attach conditions to
the granting of a special use permit as deemed necessary to carry out the
purposes of this subchapter.
      (2)   These conditions may include but are not limited to:
         (a)   Limitations on minimum lot size for any regulated activity;
         (b)   Requirements that structures be elevated on piles and otherwise
protected against natural hazards;
         (c)   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities;
         (d)   Imposition of operational control, sureties and deed
restrictions concerning future use and subdivision of lands, such as flood
warnings, preservation of undeveloped areas in open space use and limitation of
vegetation removal;
         (e)   Dedication of easements to protect wetlands;
         (f)   Establishment of vegetated buffer zones separating and
protecting the wetland from proposed activities;
         (g)   Erosion control and storm water management measures;
         (h)   Setbacks for structures and restrictions on fill, deposit of
soil and other activities in the wetland;
         (i)   Modification in project design to ensure continued water supply
to the wetland and circulation of water;
         (j)   Creation or restoration of an area of wetland; and
         (j)   Development of a plan to guide actions involving the creation of
a new wetland or the restoration of a damaged or degraded wetland.
      (3)   The Beverly Shores Board of Zoning Appeals may require a bond in an
amount and with surety and conditions sufficient to secure compliance with the
conditions and limitations set forth in the permit.
      (4)   The particular amount and the conditions of the bond shall be
consistent with the purposes of this subchapter. In the event of a breach of
any condition of any bond, the Beverly Shores Board of Zoning Appeals may
institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction upon the bond and
prosecute the same to judgment and execution.
   (H)   Wetland restoration and creation.
      (1)   As a condition of a permit issued or as an enforcement action under
this subchapter, the Beverly Shores Board of Zoning Appeals may require that
the applicant engage in the restoration or creation of wetlands in order to
offset, in whole or in part, the losses resulting from an applicant's or
violator's actions.
      (2)   In making a determination of whether a like requirement will be
imposed, and if so, the degree to which it would be required, the Beverly
Shores Board of Zoning Appeals will consider the following:
         (a)   The long and short-term effects of the action upon the wetland
and associated aquatic ecosystem, and the reversible or irreversible nature of
the impairment or loss;
         (b)   The type and benefit of the wetland functions and associated
resources lost;
         (c)   The type, size and location of the wetland altered, and the
effect it may have upon the remaining system or watershed of which the wetland
is a part;
         (d)   Observed or predicted trends with regard to the gains or losses
of this type of wetland in the watershed, in light of natural and human
processes;
         (e)   The cost and likely success of the possible compensation
measures in relation to the magnitude of the proposed project or violation; and
         (f)   The degree to which the applicant has demonstrated a good-faith
effort to incorporate measures to minimize and avoid wetland impacts within the
proposed project.
      (3)   The applicant or violator may prepare or be required by the Beverly
Shores Board of Zoning Appeals to develop a wetland restoration or creation
plan for review and approval of the Beverly Shores Board of Zoning Appeals. The
creation or restoration of wetlands shall not be an alternative to the
standards set forth in division (D) above but shall be used only to compensate
for unavoidable losses.
      (4)   The plan should state the location, by metes and bounds
description, of the proposed site; ownership; size, type and complete
ecological assessment (flora, fauna, hydrology, wetland functions and the like)
of the wetland being restored or the area where a new wetland will be created;
and the natural suitability of the proposed site for establishing the
replacement wetland (i.e., water source and drainage patterns, topographic
position, wildlife habitat opportunities, value of the existing area to be
converted and the like).
      (5)   In addition, plane view and cross-sectional, scaled drawings;
topographic survey data, including slope percentage and final grade elevations;
and other technical information are required in sufficient detail to explain,
illustrate and provide for:
         (a)   Soil and substrate conditions; topographic elevations; grading
and excavation; erosion and sediment control needed for wetland construction
and long-term survival;
         (b)   Planting plans specifying plant species types, quantities,
locations, size, spacing or density; source of plant materials, propagules or
seeds; timing, season, water and nutrient requirements for planting; and where
appropriate, measures to protect plants from predation;
         (c)   Water-quality parameters, water source, water depths, water-
control structures and water-level maintenance practices needed to achieve the
necessary ambient water conditions and hydrocycle/hydroperiod characteristics;
         (d)   Mid-course corrections and a 3-year monitoring and replacement
plan establishing responsibility for removal of exotic and nuisance vegetation
and permanent establishment of the wetland system and all its component parts;
and
         (e)   A demonstration of fiscal, administrative and technical
competence of sufficient standing to successfully execute the overall project.
   (I)   Wetland restoration and creation alternatives.
      (1)   Ordinarily, the applicant or violator shall undertake restoration
or creation efforts on or adjacent to the site where permanent losses have been
sustained or where restoration of a former wetland is possible. Replication
“in-kind” of the impacted wetland will be the preferred alternative for
creation or restoration efforts.
      (2)   Where the applicant has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Beverly Shores Board of Zoning Appeals that this approach is infeasible due to
technical constraints, such as parcel or wetland size or wetland type, or that
a wetland of a different type or location is strongly justified based on
regional needs or the functional value of the impacted wetland, the Beverly
Shores Board of Zoning Appeals may accept or recommend an alternative proposal.
      (3)   The proposal may involve monetary compensation as provided for in
this section or the creation or restoration “out-of-kind” and “off site.”
      (4)   The Beverly Shores Board of Zoning Appeals shall set reasonable
fees for compensation of wetland losses based upon the amount that would be
required to perform on-site, in-kind restoration or creation.
      (5)   Where the Beverly Shores Board of Zoning Appeals determines that
the public interest is better served, the Beverly Shores Board of Zoning
Appeals may require a fee in lieu of direct action on behalf of the applicant
or violator to initiate restoration or creation projects.
      (6)   The fees shall be held in escrow for the express use of wetland
creation and restoration projects and shall not be commingled with other funds.
   (J)   Suspension; revocation.
      (1)   The Beverly Shores Board of Zoning Appeals may suspend or revoke a
permit if it finds that the applicant has not complied with the conditions or
limitations set forth in the permit or has exceeded the scope of the work set
forth in the permit.
      (2)   The Beverly Shores Board of Zoning Appeals shall cause notice of
its denial, issuance, conditional issuance, revocation or suspension of a
permit to be published in a daily newspaper having a broad circulation in the
area wherein the wetland lies.
