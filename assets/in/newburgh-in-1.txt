safeguards it deems appropriate in order to achieve the intent of this
subchapter. Failure to comply with such conditions and safeguards, when made a

CAPITAL ASSET POLICY
§ 35.001 PURPOSE.
   This capital asset policy will become effective on January 1, 2020. The
purpose of this policy follows:
   (A)   To facilitate the preparation of the town's annual financial report in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
   (B)   Manage and account for the acquisition, depreciation, net book value
and ultimate disposal of the town's capital assets that are used in current
operations to provide governmental services.
   (C)   Establish a basis for the annual reporting of additions and
retirements of capital assets making possible the accurate updating of the
comprehensive capital asset database.
   (D)   Make possible the calculation of capital asset beginning and ending
balances and depreciation totals for gateway reporting.
(Ord. 2020-19, passed 11-10-2020)
§ 35.002 CLASSIFICATION OF ASSETS.
   Capital assets are personal property and real property and other assets used
in the operations of the government that have an expected estimated useful life
beyond a single reporting period. Capital assets are to include any item that
falls into one of the following categories:
   (A)   Land;
   (B)   Improvements to land;
   (C)   Buildings;
   (D)   Furnishings and equipment;
   (E)   Vehicles;
   (F)   Computer software;
   (G)   General infrastructure;
   (H)   Water and sewer utility infrastructure; and
   (I)   Construction in progress.
(Ord. 2020-19, passed 11-10-2020)
§ 35.003 CAPITALIZATION THRESHOLDS.
   (A)   To be considered a capital asset for financial reporting purposes, an
item must at the time of acquisition, be valued for accounting and financial
reporting purpose at a unit value greater than or equal to $10,000 ($5,000 if
funded through a federal grant). All vehicles are to be included and
capitalized regardless of acquisition value. This increased capitalization
threshold is to be to be applied prospectively starting January 1, 2020.
   (B)   Assets shall remain as part of the property record until they are
retired, sold, traded, or otherwise disposed of regardless of their net book
value amount.
   (C)   Changes in capitalization threshold are applied prospectively and some
items below any new threshold will remain until fully depreciated and removed
when they are retired from service.
   (D)   The capitalization threshold for the following classes of assets shall
be:
      (1)   Land: n/a.
      (2)   Improvements to land: $25,000.
      (3)   Buildings: $50,000.
      (4)   Furnishings and equipment and vehicles: $10,000.
      (5)   Federal grant furnishings and equipment: $5,000.
      (6)   Computer software: $10,000.
      (7)   General infrastructure: $100,000.
      (8)   Water and sewer utility infrastructure: $100,000.
      (9)   Construction in progress: n/a.
   (E)   All land, including rights-of-way, shall be capitalized at the time of
acquisition. If donated, it shall be recorded at its acquisition value. All
vehicles regardless of historical cost or acquisition value will be
capitalized.
(Ord. 2020-19, passed 11-10-2020)
§ 35.004 CAPITAL VS. EXPENSE; IMPROVEMENT VS. REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   There is an inherent difference between the terms capital and expense.
Capital is defined as an asset or improvement to an asset that is at or above
the stated capitalization threshold for its particular classification.
   (B)   A capital asset or capital asset improvement may increase capacity,
efficiency, or extend the estimated useful life.
   (C)   An expense activity merely maintains, restores, or repairs an asset to
the original service potential but does not necessarily improve the asset.
   (D)   See addendum to this policy (attached to Ordinance 2020-19 and
incorporated herein by reference) for further definitions and examples.
(Ord. 2020-19, passed 11-10-2020)
§ 35.005 REPORTED VALUE OF CAPITAL ASSETS; ANNUAL UPDATING AND REPORTING.
   Capital assets shall be recorded at historical cost which includes any
ancillary charges necessary to place the asset into its intended location and
condition for use. Ancillary charges include, for example, freight and
transportation charges, site preparation costs, and professional fees.
Engineering costs (internal and external) include related preliminary project
and environmental studies; project estimating, design, and planning (drawings
and specifications); and construction engineering, construction management,
construction inspection and project payment. However, no such costs shall be
capitalized unless they can be directly identified to a specific capital asset
and have been incurred subsequent to the determination that the capital asset
will, in fact, be acquired (the costs of a feasibility study are not
capitalizable, nor are other costs related to the project occurring prior to
its completion). Donated capital assets are recorded at the value that would be
necessary to acquire them.
(Ord. 2020-19, passed 11-10-2020)
§ 35.006 ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF DEPRECIABLE ASSETS.
   (A)   Capital assets have estimated useful lives extending beyond a single
reporting period (one year) and are depreciated using the straight-line method
with no allowance for salvage value. The estimated useful lives currently used
were developed with the input of knowledgeable staff and reflect our
government's experience with these assets:
Land                               non-depreciable
Improvements to land               20 years
Storm sirens                       10 years
Buildings                          50 years
Furnishings and equipment          5 years
Vehicles
   Autos                        5 years
   Light trucks                 10 years
   Heavy trucks                 15 years
   Boats                        5 years
General infrastructure
   Streets                      50 years
   Streetlights                 20 years
   Lock and dam                 50 years
   Water distribution           50 years
   Sanitary sewer waste collecti50 years
   Storm drainage               50 years
Waste treatment plant              25 years
Computer software                  5 years
 
   (B)   Any future changes to estimated useful lives will be applied
prospectively.
(Ord. 2020-19, passed 11-10-2020)
§ 35.007 DEPRECIATION METHOD AND CONVENTION.
   Depreciation will be calculated as to annual, accumulated, and net book
value amounts using the straight-line method and full-year convention. No
salvage value or residual value will be recognized.
(Ord. 2020-19, passed 11-10-2020)
§ 35.008 RETIREMENTS.
   (A)   Retirements apply to all capital assets including land, improvements
to land, buildings, furnishings and equipment, vehicles, and general
infrastructure.
   (B)   When an asset is disposed of, scrapped, sold, subject to demolition,
etc. it is to be removed from the property record and the appropriate reduction
shall be made to the asset value, accumulated depreciation, and net book value
amounts.
   (C)   Retirements shall reflect the originally recorded value of the capital
asset when the amount is ascertainable. When the originally recorded value of
the capital asset is not ascertainable, an estimate of that amount (typically
historical cost) shall be made.
(Ord. 2020-19, passed 11-10-2020)
§ 35.009 RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROPERTY RECORD MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   The Clerk-Treasurer's Office shall ensure that appropriate accounting
for capital assets is being exercised by establishing a capital asset
inventory, and updating it each year. Each annual update shall reflect all
improvements, additions, retirements, and transfers that occurred during the
year. The update also shall ensure that the annual calculation of depreciation
expense is adjusted accordingly.
   (B)   Day-to-day stewardship of personal property above the capitalization
threshold of $10,000 ($5,000 for assets acquired with federal grants) is the
responsibility of the department utilizing the property.
   (C)   To allow for the annual updating of the capital asset records, the
departments are responsible to report information on improvements, additions,
retirements, and transfers in detail to the Clerk-Treasurer. It is expected
that this reporting will be made in a timely manner, as the capital asset
record must be updated annually (in essence, the Clerk-Treasurer's Office will
record all additions and the departments will determine all retirements and
transfers).
   (D)   In summary, additions of assets at or above the unit capitalization
threshold of $10,000 are to be reported to the Clerk-Treasurer's Office by the
departments upon purchase or receipt of the asset. These will be verified per
the purchasing process by the Clerk-Treasurer's Office. Transfers and
retirements of assets at or above the $10,000 unit threshold are to be reported
as such by the departments to the Clerk-Treasurer's Office at the time of the
transaction.
(Ord. 2020-19, passed 11-10-2020)
§ 35.010 ASSETS PURCHASED WITH FEDERAL FUNDS.
   Assets at or above a threshold of $5,000 on a unit basis funded with a
federal grant are to be reported for federal compliance purposes. To achieve
this end a subsidiary list or other indicator is to be established and
maintained annually and includes all such assets currently in use.
(Ord. 2020-19, passed 11-10-2020)
§ 35.011 PROPERTY CONTROL.
   (A)   Capital assets below the capitalization threshold of $10,000 on a unit
basis but warranting 'control' shall be inventoried at the department level and
an appropriate list will be maintained. Data elements are to include asset
description, location, make, model, serial number, and other information that
assists control deemed relevant.
   (B)   Assets below the capitalization threshold but considered sensitive may
include for example: weapons, radios, personal computers, laptop computers,
printers, fax machines, and small power tools, and perishable hand tools. These
minor but sensitive items shall be inventoried and controlled at the department
level. Stewardship of these minor but sensitive items is the responsibility of
the departments utilizing these properties.
   (C)   The departments shall determine included items and appropriate means,
level of detailed data elements, and the system to be utilized. This inventory
will be updated annually to reflect additions and retirements to become a
current list of controllable items.
   (D)   Finally, the Clerk-Treasurer's Office, at its discretion, may request
copies of the inventories and any updated inventories of controllable items so
as to periodically review the information, adherence to policy, and the
integrity of the data.
(Ord. 2020-19, passed 11-10-2020)

51.040, shall include in its quarterly report an analysis of its wastewater for
the purpose of determining whether the user is in compliance with standards
established by this chapter or all regulations of the state and federal
governments relative to toxic materials in wastewater.
   (F)   The town may collect samples and make analyses of the wastewater
discharged by every user submitting a quarterly report under this section for
the purpose of verifying those reports. The samples may be collected at any
time and as frequently as the town finds necessary for the carrying into effect
of all relevant sections of this code, and shall in any case be made quarterly.
   (G)   At any time the town, in its discretion, determines that the quarterly
report of a particular user is unlikely to differ in any significant respect
from the most recent quarterly report filed by that user, the town may excuse
the user from filing the quarterly reports until further notice that the town
shall again require filing.
(1991 Code, § 50.47)
§ 51.067 OPERATING UPSETS.

RATES, CHARGES AND FUNDS
§ 51.080 RATES AND CHARGES.
   The charges and rates to each user levied and assessed by this chapter shall
be due and payable to the Sewer Department Office as and when charges for sewer
consumption and sewer service charges are due and payable. The rate schedule is
as follows.
   (A)   (1)   The rates and charges shall be collected for the use of, and the
service rendered by, the sewage works of the town from the owners of each and
every lot, parcel of real estate or building that is connected with or that
uses any part of the sewage system of the town or that in any way uses or is
served by the works by discharging any sewage, industrial waste, water or other
liquids into the sewage works, including the real estate, buildings and
premises of the town and the school corporation of the county, the several
townships thereof, the state, the federal government and any district or
political subdivision or agency thereof.
      (2)   Every person whose premises are served by said sewage works shall
be charged for the services provided. These charges are established for each
user class, as deemed, in order that the sewage works shall recover, from each
user and user class, revenue which is proportional to its use of the treatment
works in terms of volume and load. User charges are levied to defray the cost
of operation and maintenance (including replacement) of the treatment works.
         (a)   User charges are subject to the rules and regulations adopted by
the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the law of the state.
Replacement costs, which are recovered through the system of user charges,
shall be based upon the expected service life of the sewage works equipment.
         (b)   The various classes of users of the treatment works for the
purposes of this chapter, shall be as follows:
            1.   Class 1: Residential;
            2.   Class 2: Commercial;
            3.   Class 3: Governmental/institutional; and
            4.   Class 4: Industrial.
   (B)   The quantity of water obtained from sources other than the water
utility serving said town and discharged into the public sanitary sewer system
may be determined by the town in such manner as the town shall elect, and the
sewage treatment service may be billed at appropriate rates.
   (C)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of the
water supplied by the water utility serving said town, the water used thereon
or therein is not measured by a meter, or is measured by a meter not acceptable
to the town, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or
determined by the town in order to ascertain the rates of charge, or the owner
or other interested party, at his or her expense, may install and maintain
meters, wells, volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method
of measurement acceptable to the town for the determination of the sewage
discharge.
   (D)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving said town, and in addition uses water
from another source which is not measured by a water meter or is measured by a
water meter not acceptable to the town, then the amount of water used shall be
otherwise measured or determined by the town in order to ascertain the rates of
charges, or the owner or other interested party, at his or her expense, may
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetrical measuring devices or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the town for the
determination of sewage discharge.
   (E)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, and it can be shown to
the satisfaction of the town that a portion of water as measured by the water
meter or meters does not and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the
owner or other interested party shall install and maintain meters, weirs,
volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the town for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (F)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate or
buildings discharge sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and
the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each such
case, for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for
each user and the minimum charge and the sewage rates and charges shall apply
to each of the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate or buildings
served through the single water meter.
   (G)   Where a metered water supply is used for fire protection as well as
for other uses, the town may, in its discretion, make adjustments in the
minimum charge and in the use charge as may be equitable.
   (H)   For the service rendered to the town, the town shall be subject to the
same rates and charges provided or to rates and charges established provided or
to rates and charges established in harmony therewith.
   (I)    In order that the rates and charges may reflect the costs of
providing service to rendered to users, the town shall base its charges not
only on the volume, but also the strength and character of the stronger-than-
normal domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose of.
The town shall require the user to determine the strength and content of all
sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly into the sanitary
sewage system, in such manner and by such method as the town may deem
practicable in order to determine the proper charge. The user shall furnish a
central sampling point available to the town at all times.
      (1)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a
biochemical oxygen demand of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid or suspended
solids in excess of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid. Additional charges for
treating stronger-than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the following
basis.
         (a)   Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids. There shall be an
additional charge per pound of suspended solids for suspended solids received
in excess of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid as follows:
 
On or after January 1, 2021 $0.18 per pound
On or after July 1, 2021    $0.19 per pound
On or after July 1, 2022    $0.19 per pound
On or after July 1, 2023    $0.20 per pound
 
         (b)   Rate surcharge based upon BOD. There shall be an additional
charge per pound of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) received in excess of 250
milligrams per liter of fluid as follows.
 
On or after January 1, 2021 $0.30 per pound
On or after July 1, 2021    $0.31 per pound
On or after July 1, 2022    $0.32 per pound
On or after July 1, 2023    $0.33 per pound
      (2)   The determination of suspended solids, five-day biochemical oxygen
demand, ammonia nitrogen and phosphorous contained in the waste shall be in
accordance with the latest copy of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water, Sewage and Industrial Wastes, as written by the American Public Health
Association, the American Water Works Association and the Water Pollution
Control Federation, and in conformance with Guidelines Establishing Test
Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants, Regulation 40 C.F.R. Part 136, published
in the Federal Register on October 16, 1973.
   (J)   (1)   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may
remain fair and equitable and be in proportion to the cost of providing
services to the various users or user classes, the town shall cause a study to
be made within one year, following the date on which this chapter goes into
effect and at least annually thereafter. Such study shall include, but not be
limited to, an analysis of the costs associated with the treatment of excessive
strength effluents from industrial users, volume and delivery flow rate
characteristics attributed to the various users or user classes, the financial
position of the sewage works and the adequacy of its revenue to provide
reasonable funds for the operation and maintenance, replacements, debt service
requirements and capital improvements to the waste treatment systems. The town
shall adjust its rates and charges to reflect the results of the study.
      (2)   Thereafter, on an annual basis, within a reasonable period of time
following the normal accounting period, the town shall cause a similar study to
be made for the purpose of reviewing proportionality of the rates and charges
for sewage services on a continuing basis. Said studies shall be conducted by
officers or employees of the town, or by a firm of certified public
accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers which firms shall have
experience in such studies, or by such combination of officers, employees,
certified public accountants or engineers as the town shall determine to be
best under the circumstances. The town shall, upon completion of said study,
revise and adjust the rates and charges, as necessary in accordance therewith
in order to maintain the proportionality and sufficiency of the rates.
   (K)   The rules and regulations promulgated by the town, after approval of
the Town Council shall, among other things, provide for an appeal procedure
whereby a user shall have the right to appeal a decision regarding user charges
to the Town Council.
   (L)   The Council is hereby further authorized to enter into special rate
contracts with customers of the sewage works where clearly definable cost to
the sewage works can be determined, and such rate shall be limited to such
costs. Said contract shall be in compliance with the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act (Pub. L. No. 92-500), being 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq., as amended
by the Clean Water Act (Pub. L. No. 95-217) of 1977, being 42 U.S.C. §§ 7401 et
seq.
   (M)   The Council shall not grant free service or use of the sewage
treatment system to any person, group or entity.
   (N)   The town shall receive a return on investment to be set annually by
the Town Council pursuant to §
51.085 hereof.
   (O)   The rates and charges as herein set forth shall become effective on
the first full billing period occurring after the adoption of this chapter.
   (P)   The rates and charges shall be prepared and billed by the town, and
shall be collected in the manner provided by law and ordinance. Said rates and
charges will be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying the property served,
unless otherwise requested in writing by the owners, but such billing shall in
nowise relieve the owner from liability in the event payment is not made as
herein required. Except for duplexes, only one billing will be made per meter.
The owners of the property served, which are occupied by tenants, shall have
the right to examine the collection records of the town for the purpose of
determining whether such rates and charges have been paid by such tenants,
provided that such examination shall be made in the office of which said
records are kept and during the hours that such office is open for business.
   (Q)   (1)   (a)   The town shall make and enforce such by-laws and
regulations as may be deemed necessary for the safe, economical and efficient
management of the town’s sewage system, pumping stations and sewage conveyance
system, for the construction and use of house sewers and connections to the
sewage system, and for the regulation, collection, rebating and refunding of
such rates and charges.
         (b)   There shall be established a charge in the amount of $2,000 for
the privilege of making a sewer connection from any single-family residence to
an existing sanitary sewer suitable for use as a lateral sewer by said single-
family residence. The charge for said sewer connection shall be paid in full to
the town at the time that said connection to the municipal sewer system is
made; provided, however, that said connection charge, upon written request of
the customer or property owner, may be paid in four equal installments over a
two-year period.
      (2)   The town is hereby authorized to prohibit dumping of wastes into
the town’s sewage system which, in its discretion, are deemed harmful to the
operation of the sewage treatment works of the town or to require methods
affecting pretreatment of said wastes to comply with the pretreatment standards
included in the national pollution discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit
issued to the sewage works.
   (R)   (1)   Each charge for such sewage works by or pursuant to this chapter
is made a lien against and upon the corresponding lot, parcel or real estate,
building or premises served by the sewage works, and if not paid on or before
the due date thereof, the amount thereof, together with a penalty of 10% of the
current unpaid balance and a reasonable attorney’s fee may be recovered by the
Town Council in a civil action in the name of the town after statutory notice
is given.
      (2)   Every user shall be billed under one of three methods set out in
this division (R). Such rates and charges include user charges and debt service
costs, which shall be in an amount determinable as follows.
         (a)   Metered water users.
            1.   The sewage rates and charges shall be based, in part, on the
quantity of water used on or in the property or premises subject to such rates
and charges, as the same is measured by the water meter there in use, except as
herein otherwise provided. For the purpose of billing and collecting the
charges for sewage service, the water meters shall be read monthly (or period
equaling a month) or as determined by the water utility providing the readings
to the town's billing agency.
            2.   The water usage schedule on which the amount of said rates and
charges shall be determined is as follows:

§ 51.085 RATE OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT.
   (A)   (1)   State law, found at I.C. 36-9-23-25(d)(9) and (d)(10) provides
that a municipal utility may establish its sewer fees to be paid by its
customers based upon a number of factors.
(2)   Those factors include:
         (a)   A flat charge for each sewer connection;
         (b)   The amount of water used on the property;
         (c)   The number and size of water outlets on the property;
         (d)   The amount, strength or character of sewage discharged into the
sewers;
         (e)   The size of sewer connections;
         (f)   Whether the property has been or will be required to pay
separately for any part of the sewage works;
         (g)   Whether the property, although vacant or unimproved, is
benefitted by a local or lateral sewer because of the availability of that
sewer. However, the owner must have been notified, by recorded covenants and
restrictions or deed restrictions in the chain of title of his or her property,
that a fee or assessment for sewer availability may be charged, and the fee may
reflect only the capital cost of the sewer and not the cost of operation and
maintenance of the sewage works;
         (h)   The cost of collecting, treating and disposing of garbage in a
sanitary manner, including equipment and wages;
         (i)   The amount of money sufficient to compensate the municipality
for the property taxes that would be paid on the sewage works if the sewage
works were privately owned (PILOT); and
         (j)   Any other factors the legislative body considers necessary.
      (3)   The town legislative body considers it necessary to include, among
the factors listed above, pursuant to the authority in I.C. 36-9-23-25(c)(10),
the factor of the rate of return on investment (ROI) as a component of the
rates.
   (B)   The town considers it necessary to include, among the rate factors
listed above, pursuant to the authority in I.C. 36-9-23-25(c)(9) and (10), the
factors of the rate of return on investment (ROI) and payment in lieu of
property taxes (PILOT) as a component of the rates to be collected from its
sewer customers.
   (C)   The town will collect both the ROI and the PILOT from the Sewer
Department and such money shall be placed in the Town General Fund for general
fund uses.
   (D)   Those factors shall be calculated annually for inclusion in the budget
for the next year and shall be reflected as miscellaneous revenue to the
General Fund.
   (E)   The pro rata portion of such calculated payments, as included in the
budget, shall be made by the Sewer Department to the General Fund on a monthly
basis, subject only to any bond covenants regulating such payments.
   (F)   The formula for the calculation of PILOT and ROI shall be as
established by generally accepted ratemaking accounting practice (GARAP) in
effect at the time such calculation is made.
   (G)    The rate of return shall be a reasonable rate of return calculated in
accordance with the relevant procedures of GARAP not to exceed 7.5% per annum.

ENFORCEMENT
§ 51.100 ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM.
   (A)   Industries found to be in violation of industrial waste pretreatment
requirements will be notified of the violation via certified mail.
      (1)   This notification will state the nature of the violation and
request a representative of the industry to contact the pretreatment program
administrator to arrange for a conciliation hearing.
      (2)   If hazardous or emergency conditions exist, the company will be
notified by phone or telegram to appear immediately or on the following day.
      (3)   At the time of notification of violation of pretreatment standards,
the company’s file will be placed into a separate violator’s file, in order to
assure that all violators will be dealt with.
   (B)   At the conciliation hearing, the nature and extent of the violation
will be reviewed; and the company will be asked to present a plan and schedule
for attaining compliance. When the compliance date is agreed upon and
compliance is verified by the pretreatment program administrator, the company
file will then be placed with all other industries in compliance.
   (C)   If the conciliatory process breaks down, the administrator of the
pretreatment program will recommend that the company be required to show cause
why its discharge of pollutants to the POTW should not be prohibited. Show
cause hearings will be formal hearings where legal testimony will be taken.
Field personnel may be called upon to testify concerning their activity in the
matter. These hearings should result in an order by the town which will require
the violator to comply with pretreatment requirements by a certain date.
   (D)   After the town has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the
party responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time
period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities,
devices or other related appurtenances are properly operated, and such further
orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate.
   (E)   If the company fails to comply with the town order, the administrator
of the pretreatment program will recommend that a lawsuit be filed to seek
injunctive relief and a fine for each day that the company’s discharge is in
violation. The town will be represented in show cause hearings and in court by
a member of its legal staff.
   (F)   Following a court-ordered compliance date, the company’s effluent
discharge will be re-sampled, each sample being processed such that the chain
of evidence is maintained. Each case will be pursued until the violator is in
compliance.
   (G)   At the end of each year, the administrator will arrange to publish in
the town’s largest daily newspaper the companies who have been in significant
violation of pretreatment requirements.
   (H)   A significant violation will be any of the following:
      (1)   A violation for which a compliance schedule has not been submitted
45 days after notification of noncompliance;
      (2)   A violation which is part of a pattern of noncompliance over a 12-
month period;
      (3)   A violation which involves a failure to accurately report
compliance; and

§ 52.01 STATEMENT OF POLICY.
   (A)   Fats, oil and grease (FOG) in wastewater can result in the decreased
carrying capacity of sewers due to congealed, cooled grease which coats the
inside of the pipes. Once a pipe becomes constricted, the potential for a
blockage increases. Blockages can and will eventually cause sanitary sewer
overflows.
   (B)   The following is the FOG policy for the town’s wastewater treatment
utility (utility). The purpose of establishing the FOG policy is to protect
public health by eliminating sanitary sewer system overflows due to FOG and
reduce the amount of FOG discharged to the sanitary sewer system while reducing
maintenance costs for the utility’s customers and improving operation of the
collection system. Any wastewater which contains FOG shall only be discharged
into the utility’s sanitary sewer system under the conditions of this policy
and with a valid FOG discharge permit.
   (C)   (1)   A FOG discharge permit shall be required of any customer of the
utility including businesses, institutions or establishments participating in
the preparation or service of food, where fats, oil and grease may be
discharged into a public sewer, except as provided in division (E) below and in

52.99
§ 52.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Progression of penalty for violations of the FOG policy.
      (1)   When FOG policy violations are found at any restaurant or food
preparation establishment the utility needs to take enforcement action to
correct the issue. Violations may be as a result of on-site inspections by
utility or County Health Department personnel, general complaints, consumer
tips or observation of collection system problems from various utility
department personnel.
      (2)   Establishments found to be violating the FOG policy shall be sent a
notice of violation (NOV) that will outline the nature of the violation and the
corrective measures that need to be taken along with a time frame in which the
establishment must act. Failure to address the issue, failure to respond or
failure to meet the stipulated time frame(s) will result in the issuance of a
monetary penalty. The establishment shall also be responsible for reimbursing
the utility for all costs incurred by the utility associated with the violation
of the FOG policy, including, but not limited to, collection system
maintenance/cleaning costs, property damage, administrative costs, engineering
costs and legal costs.
   (B)   Fine structure.
      (1)   The fine structure shall be as follows:
         (a)   First NOV subjects the violator to a civil penalty of $250 if
the violator fails to act upon a corrective recommendation within 20 working
days. Costs incurred by the utility will also be applied. The 20 working days
referenced may be reduced when significant water quality degradation has
occurred or there is a high potential for such degradation to occur if left
uncorrected. If corrective action is undertaken in the 20-day period, or a plan
approved by the utility committee at its next scheduled meeting after the NOV
is issued, the civil penalty will be waived; however, costs incurred by the
utility will still be required to be paid.
         (b)   Second NOV for the same issue means that after the expiration of
the time period for correction established in the first NOV, the condition or
conditions constituting a violation in the first notice remain uncorrected or
otherwise not compliant with the FOG policy. The violator shall be subject to
an additional civil penalty of $500 if the violator fails to act upon a
corrective recommendation within ten working days. Costs incurred by the
utility will also be applied. The ten working days referenced here may be
reduced when significant water quality degradation has occurred or there is a
high potential for such degradation to occur if left uncorrected. If corrective
action is undertaken in the ten-day period, or a plan approved by the utility
committee at its next scheduled meeting after the NOV is issued, the civil
penalty of $500 will be waived but not the penalty of $250 or the collection
system cleaning costs.
         (c)   Third NOV for the same issue means that at any time after a ten-
working day period for the correction of a second NOV has elapsed, the
condition or conditions constituting the violation remain uncorrected and the
violator will be subject to a civil penalty of $2,500 in addition to the
original $250, and the second NOV of $500, and the costs incurred by the
utility will be applied.
         (d)   Any further noncompliance will result in a daily fine of $250/
day plus the costs incurred by the utility will be applied to the appropriate
individual or individuals responsible for correcting the violating condition or
conditions.
      (2)   The Sewer Office, after notification by the Plant Superintendent or
his or her designee, will prepare the NOV and issue such notification to the
affected property owner. Notification shall also be provided to the Sewer
Committee and Town Council. In the event the affected property owner fails to
comply with the NOV, the Sewer Office shall alert the Town Council that a fine
or fines should now be levied and any further civil action that may be needed
for failure of the establishment to submit payment. Payment will be collected
by the utility administrative office.

APPENDIX A: GREASE INTERCEPTOR AND GREASE TRAP SIZING
   (A)   Grease interceptor sizing.
      (1)   This section of Appendix A is intended to be example guidance for
the designer. The tank size shall be based on design criteria set forth in
Bulletin S.E. 13 from the Indiana State Board of Health, latest edition.
      (2)   The recommended grease interceptor size may be calculated as
follows:
      Tank Size (in gallons) = Meals Served During Peak Hour x Waste Flow Rate
Factor x Retention Time Factor x Storage Factor
      (3)   Components of the equation are:
         (a)   The peak meals served per hour = the maximum number of meals
served in any given hour of kitchen operation (maximum seating capacity may be
substituted for peak meals served per hour).
         (b)   The waste flow factor may be determined as one of the following:
            1.   For a commercial kitchen with a dishwashing machine, the waste
flow factor = 6;
            2.   For a commercial kitchen without a dishwashing machine, the
waste flow factor = 5;
            3.   For a single service kitchen (food served on, in, or with
disposable service ware), the waste flow factor = 2; or
            4.   For food waste disposal only, the waste flow factor = 1.
         (c)   The retention time factor may be determined as one of the
following:
            1.   For a commercial kitchen, the retention time factor = 2.4; or
            2.   For a single service kitchen, the retention time factor = 1.5.
         (d)   The storage factor may be determined as one of the following:
            1.   For a commercial kitchen, the storage factor = 0.125 X the
hours/day of kitchen operation; or
            2.   For a single service kitchen, the storage factor = 1.5.
      (4)   Sample calculation no. 1.
         (a)   Calculate the size of a grease interceptor for a fast food
restaurant that is open 24 hours per day and has a seating capacity of 66.
There is no dishwasher and food is served with disposable service ware.
 
   Tank Size (in gallons) = 66 x 2 x 1.5 x 1.5
   Tank Size = 297 gallons
 
         (b)   Note: The minimum size of a grease interceptor as stipulated by
the FOG policy is 1,000 gallons. Therefore, a 1,000 gallon grease interceptor
must be installed in this case.
      (5)   Sample calculation no. 2.
         (a)   Calculate the size of a grease interceptor for a commercial
kitchen of a nursing home serving a maximum of 76 meals/hour. The kitchen is
equipped with a dishwasher and the kitchen operates 15.5 hrs/day.
 
   Tank Size (in gallons) = 76 x 6 x 2.4 x (0.125 x 15.5)
   Tank Size = 2,120 gallons
 
         (b)   Note: The maximum size of a grease interceptor as stipulated by
the FOG policy is 1,500 gallons. Therefore, two grease interceptors must be
installed in series in this case.

General
Grease traps shall be installed at any commercial kitchen or food service business which produces waste that may contain large amounts of grease, fat or oil. These traps shall remove the grease before it enters the sanitary sewer system. Wastes from sinks,
dishwashers and kitchen floor drains should be combined and routed through the grease trap prior to entering the sanitary sewer system. The tank size shall be based on design criteria set forth in Bulletin S.E. 13 from the Indiana State Board of Health, latest
edition.
A typical detail drawing is shown on Figure A2.4 in the Town of Newburgh Sanitary Sewer Design and Construction Standards.
The recommended grease trap size may be calculated as follows:
Tank Size (in gallons) = Meals Served During Peak Hour x Waste Flow Rate Factor x Retention Time Factor x Storage Factor
Peak Meals Served/Hour or Seating Capacity:                                                   
Waste Flow Rate Factor:
   [ ]   a.  Commercial kitchen with dishwashing machine:            6
   [ ]    b. Commercial kitchen without dishwashing machine:         5
   [ ]    c. Single service kitchen:                     2
   [ ]    d. Food waste disposal only:                     1
Retention Time:
   [ ]   a. Commercial kitchen waste                     2.4
   [ ]   b. Single service kitchen:                     1.5

         0.125 x                          hours of operation =                     
   [ ]   b. Single service kitchen:                     1.5
Using the above equation, calculate the grease trap size:
Tank Size =                          x                          x                          x                         
Tank Size =                          Gallons or                          CU ft. (as determined by the distance from the discharge pipe’s invert to the floor.)
Calculated by:                                                    Date:                                                   
 
Notes:
1.   All buried exterior lank surfaces shall be coated with ten ml. thickness
coal tar epoxy.
2.   All lateral piping shall be gasketed, six in. SDR 26 PVC.
3.   Internal piping may be glue joint.
4.   All tank joints shall be provided with water tight seals.
5.   The minimum setback from the bottom of the building foundation to the
bottom of the interceptor excavation shall be one to one.
6.   The length to width ratio for the tank shall be two to one.
7.   A cleanout shall be required in the discharge pipe within three feet of
the tank.

   (B)   Internal grease tap sizing. Grease traps may be substituted for grease
interceptors as provided in §
52.01(E) and (F) of the FOG policy. When grease traps are required by the
utility, each grease trap shall have an approved rate of flow, which is not
less than that given in the following grease trap sizing table for the total
number of connected fixtures or as calculated using the sum of all modified
flow rates for each fixture (modified flow rates for each fixture = gpm/fixture
x the fixture rating). No more than four fixtures may be connected to one
grease trap and dishwashers should have dedicated grease traps.
      (1)   Grease trap sizing table.

   (2)   Calculating the modified flow rates of various kitchen fixtures.
      Modified flow rate = gpm/fixture x the fixture rating
         (a)   GPM/fixture. This is derived from the Manning formula. It takes
into account the slope; roughness of the pipe (plastic) used and pipe diameter
size. The drainage rates of various pipe diameter sizes are:
            1.   0.5 inch pipe diameter = 0.8 GPM/fixture;
            2.   1.0 inch pipe diameter = 5.0 GPM/fixture;
            3.   1.5 inch pipe diameter =15 GPM/fixture;
            4.   2.0 inch pipe diameter = 33 GPM/fixture;
            5.   2.5 inch pipe diameter = 59 GPM/fixture; and
            6.   3.0 inch pipe diameter = 93 GPM/fixture.
         (b)   Fixture ratings of grease-laden waste streams. Fixtures that
have more grease in their waste stream receive higher values while less grease
corresponds to a lower value. Common commercial kitchen fixtures and their
corresponding rating (for each) are as follows:
Kitchen Fixture Rating
Kitchen Fixture                        Rating
1 or 2 compartment meat prep sink      0.75
1 or 2 compartment vegetable prep sink 0.25
2, 3, or 4 compartment pot sink        1.0
Can wash                               0.25
Floor drain                            0.00
Mop sink                               0.25
Pre-rinse sink                         0.5
 
         (c)    Example calculations of fixture modified flow rates. A
restaurant’s kitchen is supplied with the following fixtures. What is the
modified flow rate for each fixture?
            1.   A two compartment pot sink with a one and one-half inch drain.
 
   Fixture modified flow rate = 15 x 1.0 fixture modified flow rate = 15 gpm
 
            2.   A two compartment vegetable prep sink with a one and one-half
inch drain.
 
   Fixture modified flow rate = 15 x 0.25 fixture modified flow rate = 3.75 gpm
 
            3.   A mop sink with a two inch drain.
 
   Fixture modified flow rate = 33 x 0.25 fixture modified flow rate = 8.25 gpm
 
            4.   A dishwasher with a manufacture’s rated maximum discharge
capacity of 10.0 gpm.
 
   Fixture modified flow rate = 10.0 gpm
 
      (3)   Example grease trap size determination.
         (a)   Given the information in divisions (B)(2)(c)1., (B)(2)(c)2., (B)
(2)(c)3. and (B)(2)(c)4., the grease trap size(s) may be determined as follows:
            1.   Using Table A and number of fixtures. Using Table A, three
fixtures require a grease trap with a flow rating of 35 gpm and a grease
retention capacity of 70 pounds. Per §
52.03(K) of the policy, the dishwasher will require an additional grease trap
capable of receiving ten gpm. In this case, the dishwasher will require the
installation of a second grease trap which meets the minimum requirements of §
52.03(D). A grease trap with a flow rating of 20 gpm and a grease retention
capacity of 40 pounds (per Table A) is required for the dishwasher.
            2.   Using Table A and fixture modified flow rates.
               a.   When using fixture modified flow rates, the size is
determined using Table A and the sum of all fixture modified flow rates flowing
into the grease trap:
 
15 gpm + 3.75 gpm + 8.25 gpm = 27 gpm
 
               b.   In this case, 27 gpm is the minimum flow rating required,
and, when this is compared to Table A, a 35 gpm grease trap will be required
with a grease retention capacity of 40 pounds. The dishwasher will require the
installation of a second grease trap as determined in division (B)(3)(a) above.

APPENDIX B: BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
   Town of Newburgh
   Best Management Practices
   Fats, Oil, and Grease (FOG)
   Best Management Practices (BMPs)
   For Food Service Facilities
   (A)   Information, pollution prevention and compliance information. Fats,
oil and grease (FOG) can have negative impacts on wastewater collection and
treatment systems. Most wastewater collection system blockages can be traced to
FOG. Blockages in the wastewater collection system are serious, causing sewage
spills, manhole overflows or sewage backups in homes and businesses. This
manual is written to provide restaurant and fast food business managers and
owners with information about FOG pollution prevention techniques focused on
their businesses, effective in both reducing maintenance costs for business
owners, and preventing oil and grease discharges to the sewer system. The
discharge of FOG to the sewer system is illegal. Ensuring that grease trap and
grease interceptors are properly installed and most importantly, properly
maintained, is the key to avoiding enforcement action against your business.
This manual focuses on proper maintenance of grease traps and interceptors, and
includes inspection checklists for the business owner/manager as a guide to how
and what town wastewater treatment utility (utility) pretreatment inspectors
will be checking during an on site inspection.
   (B)   Manual contents.
      (1)   Manual contents includes:
         (a)   Frequently asked questions (FAQs);
         (b)   Best management practices (BMPs);
         (c)   Prohibitions;
         (d)   How it works;
         (e)   Maintenance; and
         (f)   Compliance inspection and installation checklists.
      (2)   Knowledgeable business managers can effectively prevent oil and
grease buildup and associated problems for both the sewerage agency and the
restaurant owner.
   (C)   Frequently asked questions about FOG.
      (1)   Frequently asked questions.
         (a)   Why is grease a problem?
         (b)   Do I need a grease interceptor or trap?
         (c)   Who determines if I need a grease trap or interceptor?
         (d)   Do I have a grease interceptor or trap?
         (e)   What is a grease trap and how does it work?
         (f)   What is a grease interceptor?
         (g)   How do I clean my grease trap or interceptor?
         (h)   Can you recommend a grease interceptor maintenance schedule?
         (i)   What if I don’t take care of my grease trap or interceptor?
         (j)   What are the criteria for inspecting grease traps?
      (2)   Why is grease a problem? Large amounts of oil and grease in the
wastewater cause trouble in the collection system pipes. It decreases pipe
capacity and, therefore, requires that piping systems be cleaned more often
raising costs for all ratepayers. Oil and grease also hamper effective
treatment at the wastewater treatment plant. Grease may not appear harmful but
it congeals and causes nauseous mats on the surface of settling tanks,
digesters and the interior of pipes and other surfaces which may cause a
shutdown of wastewater treatment units. Problems caused by wastes from
restaurants and other grease producing establishments are the reason the town
wastewater treatment utility requires the installation of pretreatment
equipment, commonly known as grease traps or interceptors.
      (3)   Do I need a grease interceptor or trap? Any establishment that
introduces wastewater containing grease or oil into the sewage system is
required to install an interceptor or in limited cases, an interior grease trap
(point source). Interceptors are usually required for high volume fast food or
full menu establishments and large commercial establishments such as hotels,
hospitals, factories or school kitchens. In some instances, interior grease
traps may be allowed for small volume fast food or take-out restaurants with
limited menus, paper plate service, minimum dishwashing and/or minimal seating
capacity.
      (4)   Who determines if I need a grease trap or interceptor? When waste
pretreatment is required by the utility, an approved grease trap or interceptor
shall be installed according to the Town Sanitary Sewer Design and Construction
Standards and the town fats, oil and grease policy. The utility staff will
assist the establishment in determining if a grease trap or interceptor is
required and the appropriate sizing. The utility’s inspectors make routine
periodic inspections to verify that mandatory maintenance BMPs are being
implemented. These BMPs are fully enforceable under the utility’s regulations.
      (5)   Do I have a grease interceptor or trap? If you are uncertain
whether your establishment has a grease interceptor or trap, you should contact
the utility for assistance. You may request a “voluntary compliance” visit by
the utility’s inspector without risk of an enforcement action. You will be
required to comply with any requests for cleaning or other maintenance.
      (6)   What is a grease trap and how does it work? A grease trap is
typically located under the sink or other kitchen fixture to which it is
connected. Baffles in the trap interior slow the wastewater down long enough
for the grease to separate and rise to the surface. The grease can then be
removed and disposed of properly. Passive traps must be cleaned manually.
Electro-mechanical devices require less manual maintenance and are more
efficient because accumulated FOG is automatically removed daily.
      (7)   What is a grease interceptor? An interceptor is a buried vault with
a minimum capacity of between 1,000 and 1,500 gallons located on the exterior
of the building. The vault includes a minimum of two compartments, and flow
between each compartment is through a configuration of pipe fittings designed
to allow for solids settling and grease retention. The capacity of the
interceptor provides adequate detention time so that the wastewater has time to
cool, allowing grease to separate and rise to the surface where it accumulates
until the interceptor is cleaned. See How it Works section in this document for
a description of how the various components of a grease interceptor function.
      (8)   How do I clean my grease trap or interceptor? Refer to Grease Trap
and Interceptor Maintenance section in this document.
      (9)   Can you recommend a grease interceptor maintenance schedule? Based
on historical inspection observations and established best management
practices, most grease interceptors need to be cleaned every 60 to 90 days.
Some establishments will find it necessary to clean their traps more often. In
some instances, light menu, low volume facilities may be able to clean less
frequently. Only rarely does a facility have to pump less frequently than every
six months. Demonstrating through accurate record keeping that a less frequent
cleaning schedule is fully adequate is the responsibility of you the business
owner/manager. It is not the utility’s responsibility. Securing a service
contract with a qualified pumping contractor for routine inspection and
cleaning as needed is the best way to avoid enforcement action by the utility.
Waiting until the utility’s inspector arrives on site and requires you to clean
your interceptor is not an acceptable best management practice and will result
in an enforcement action.
      (10)   What if I don’t take care of my grease trap or interceptor?
Failure to implement the required FOG BMPs is a violation of the utility’s
regulations. Additionally, if the establishment fails to adequately maintain
its trap or interceptor, it will eventually encounter a maintenance problem
with a plugged sewer line. The blockage can create a sewer backup situation and
ultimately a potential health problem in the establishment. If the problem is
in the building sewer line, then the establishment has direct responsibility
for paying for the maintenance. If the blockage or restriction occurs in the
utility’s sewer main then the establishment will have to pay for the utility’s
line cleaning maintenance costs. The discharge of grease to a sanitary sewer
line in amounts “which will or may cause obstruction” is a violation of the
utility’s Regulations and will result in enforcement action including cost
recovery, fines and/or penalties.
      (11)   What are the criteria for inspecting grease traps/interceptors ?
         (a)   All food service establishments are inspected for compliance
with BMPs. The following general criteria are used by pretreatment inspectors
during trap or interceptor evaluation and are offered here for information
purposes only. The judgment of the on-site inspector is final.

                                            Facility to call for re-inspection.
 
         (b)   If the trap is in fair to poor condition, the facility may be
advised to schedule a cleaning event in the near future. The cleaning frequency
schedule may need to be increased. If the trap is in noncompliance, the
facility is issued a compliance order to have it cleaned immediately. The
facility is required to call for re-inspection within seven days to verify that
the trap or grease interceptor has been properly cleaned. An enforcement action
including fines and/or penalties will be taken against facilities found in
noncompliance a second time.

      (5)    How it works - grease interceptor.

IMAGES/0-0-0-33.jpg]
 
         (a)   Flow from undersink grease traps or directly from plumbing
fixtures enters the grease interceptor. The UPC requires that all flow entering
the interceptor must enter through the inlet pipe.
         (b)   An air intake valve allows air into the open space of the grease
interceptor to prevent siphonage and backpressure.
         (c)   Oil and grease floats on the water surface and accumulates
behind the grease retaining fittings and the wall separating the compartments.
The oil and grease will be removed during routine grease interceptor cleaning.
         (d)   Solids in the wastewater that do not float will be deposited on
the bottom of the grease interceptor and will need to be removed during routine
grease interceptor cleaning.
         (e)   Grease retaining fittings extend down into the water to within
12 inches of the bottom of the interceptor. Because grease floats, it generally
does not enter the fitting and is not carried into the next compartment. The
fittings also extend above the water surface to provide air relief.
         (f)   Some interceptors have a sample box so that inspectors or
employees of the establishment can periodically take effluent samples. Having a
sample box is recommended but not required by the utility.
         (g)   Flow exits the interceptor through the outlet pipe and continues
on to the sanitary sewer system.
      (6)   Grease trap and interceptor maintenance.
         (a)   Generally.
            1.   Grease trap maintenance is usually performed by maintenance
staff, or other employees of the establishment. Grease interceptor (GI)
maintenance, which is usually performed by permitted haulers, consists of
removing the entire volume (liquids and solids) from the GI and properly
disposing of the material in accordance with all federal, state and/or local
laws. When performed properly and at the appropriate frequency, grease
interceptor and trap maintenance can greatly reduce the discharge of FOG into
the wastewater collection system. The required maintenance frequency for grease
interceptors and traps depends greatly on the amount of FOG a facility
generates as well as any best management practices (BMPs) that the
establishment implements to reduce the FOG discharged into the sanitary sewer
system. In many cases, an establishment that implements BMPs will realize
financial benefit through a reduction in their required grease interceptor and
trap maintenance frequency. Refer to the best management practices tables in
this document for examples of BMPs that FOG generating establishments should
implement.
            2.   Warning! Do not use hot water, enzymes, bio-additives,
emulsifying agents or similar chemical agents in lieu of physical cleaning of
grease traps and interceptors.
         (b)   Grease interceptor maintenance. Grease interceptors, due to
their size, will usually be cleaned by grease haulers or recyclers. Licensed
septic haulers can also pump out grease interceptors and haul the waste to a
regulated facility. Septic haulers are required to be permitted by the state. A
proper maintenance procedure for a grease interceptor is outlined below:

IMAGES/0-0-0-35.jpg]
 
 
Step Action
l.   Review records of last cleaning. Most units require cleaning every 60 to
     90 days.
2.   Contact a grease hauler for cleaning. See: Grease Interceptor Cleaning
     Contractors.
3.   Record the volume of grease removed on the maintenance log or retain
     contractor receipt.
 
         (c)   Electro-mechanical trap maintenance. A proper maintenance
procedure for these automatic grease removal devices includes:

IMAGES/0-0-0-37.jpg]
 
 
Step Action
1.   Empty - solids strainer and the outside grease cup daily
2.   Clean - wiper blades and grease outlet trough per the manufacturer’s
     recommended cleaning frequency.
3.   Clean - the entire unit, including sediment at the bottom, a minimum of
     monthly.
4.   Replace - wiper blades every six months to ensure proper operating condition.
5.   Check - It doesn’t work if it’s not plugged in and if the auto timer is not set
     properly.
 
         (d)   Passive grease trap maintenance. A proper maintenance procedure
for a grease trap is outlined below:

IMAGES/0-0-0-39.jpg]
 
 
Step Action
1.   Bail out any water in the trap to facilitate cleaning. The water should be
     discharged to the sanitary sewer system.
2.   Remove baffles if possible.
     Dip the accumulated grease out of the interceptor and deposit in a
3.   watertight container. Remove all solids from the bottom of the trap.
     Scrape the sides, the lid and the baffles with a putty knife to remove as
     much of the grease as possible.
4.   Mix grease and solid materials with “kitty litter” and dispose to
     dumpster.
5.   Replace the baffle and the lid.
6.   Record the date, name of attendant and volume of grease removed on the
     maintenance top (copy at end of this document).

In accordance with all of the terms and conditions of the Rules and Regulations and Policies of the
Town of Newburgh (Town) and any applicable provisions of Federal and/or State law or regulation,
permission is hereby granted to: FSE NAME located at FSE FACILITY ADDRESS to discharge non-domestic
wastewater into the Town of Newburgh’s sanitary sewer system. This permit is granted in accordance
with the Food Service Establishment Wastewater Discharge Permit Questionnaire and in conformity
with plans, specifications and other data submitted, all of which are filed with and considered as
part of this permit.
                                                                    
Wastewater Treatment Facilities Superintendent
THE PERMIT MAY BE REVOKED:
a)   If applicable fees or fines are not paid within thirty (30) days of the due date;
b)   If the nature of the discharge changes;
c)   If ownership is transferred without prior approval of permit transfer;
d)   If town, state and/or federal rules and regulations change;
e)   If false information or data is/was given; or
f)   If a violation of the permit occurs.
 
   (A)   General requirements and regulations.
      (1)   All discharges containing grease and oil must pass through grease
control equipment (GCE) before entering the sanitary sewer. GCE refers to any
equipment that removes fats, oils and grease from wastewater such as a grease
trap which is installed inside the building usually under a counter/sink or
built into the floor of the kitchen area; or a grease interceptor which is
usually installed outside in the ground and is much larger in size. GCE must be
well-maintained and in proper operating condition at all times.
      (2)   All discharges into the sanitary sewer system are subject to the
conditions of this permit and the town rules and regulations.
      (3)   The town reserves the right to re-open the permit to establish more
stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater sanitary
sewer system or change any other permit condition deemed necessary.
      (4)   The conditions of this FOG permit shall remain in effect
indefinitely, unless the town chooses to discontinue or revoke this permit.
Should the town choose to discontinue or revoke this permit, an official letter
of notification will be sent expressing the town’s intentions.
      (5)   Should your GCE be deemed insufficient or in need of repair, the
town may require additional GCE to be installed or require the existing GCE to
be repaired or modified to meet the original design specifications.
      (6)   Should new GCE be installed or existing GCE be replaced, the new
GCE must meet all current town design criteria and be pre-approved by the town.
      (7)   Use of additives (including enzymes and biological) are prohibited
in plumbing tied into GCE unless express written permission is received from
the town. In no case shall the use of a town approved additive extend the
required cleaning frequency of the GCE.
   (B)   Grease control equipment requirements. Permit writer should list the
required GCE: grease interceptors; under-counter or in-floor grease traps;
waste oil collection devices; or other applicable pretreatment units shall be
installed, operated, maintained and repaired solely at the customer’s expense.
   (C)   Schedule for compliance with the FOG discharge policy. (Permit writer:
choose one or more of the following):
      (1)    New food service establishment (FSE): a grease interceptor shall
be installed, inspected and approved by the town wastewater treatment utility
(utility) before commencing any wastewater discharges to the sanitary sewer
system.
      (2)   Existing FSE without an existing grease interceptor: a grease
interceptor shall be installed, inspected and approved by the town wastewater
treatment utility (utility), and the FSE must be in full compliance with its
food service discharge permit within six months of issuance.
      (3)   Existing FSE with an existing grease interceptor and found to be in
noncompliance with the FOG policy: staff will need to evaluate the information
contained in the permit application to determine if the existing GCE is
adequately sized or if failure of the GCE is due to improper maintenance.
      (4)   Existing FSE being renovated or expanded:
         (a)   A grease interceptor shall be installed, inspected and approved
by the town wastewater treatment utility (utility), and the FSE must be in full
compliance with its food service discharge permit within six months of
issuance; and
         (b)   FSE being renovated or expanded that already has a FOG discharge
permit: staff will need to evaluate the information contained in a new permit
application to determine if the existing GCE is adequately sized and if permit
modification is necessary.
      (5)   FSE receiving a waiver or exemption from the installation of a
grease interceptor: staff will evaluate the information contained in the permit
application to determine if internal grease traps are required.
   (D)   GCE servicing requirements.
      (1)   All GCE shall be maintained by the owner at his, her or its expense
and functioning efficiently at all times.
      (2)   Your facility must have a contract with a GCE “cleaning service
company/hauler” unless the GCE is cleaned by your own employees. If the GCE is
cleaned by your own employees, then a cleaning log and a cleaning schedule must
be maintained to record all cleanings and the final disposal destination of the
removed grease. If an outside company performs the cleaning of the GCE a
hauling manifest/receipt must state the final disposal destination of the
grease removed from the GCE. All material removed from GCE must be disposed of
properly by being removed from the property and not discharged to the sanitary
sewer system.
         (a)   Interior GCE - “grease traps”.
               1.   Interior GCE must be cleaned as needed to operate
effectively. In no case shall the cleaning frequency be less than every seven
days, unless permission has been given by the utility to extend the frequency
based on the actual usage.
               2.   Interior GCE must have a “flow restrictor” installed to
control the volume of flow entering the GCE. This flow restrictor must be in
place and in proper working order at all times. The flow restrictor may be
mounted in the wastewater drain pipe flowing toward the GCE or it may be built
into the design of the GCE, depending on the type of GCE that is installed. The
flow restrictor must be inspected at a minimum of once per year to ensure the
restrictor is still in place and restrictor orifice has not been altered or has
not deteriorated. The permittee must record and document this inspection in
his, her or its on-site maintenance log.
            (b)   Exterior GCE - “grease interceptors”.
               1.   The exterior in-ground GCE cleaning frequency shall not be
less than every 90 days between cleaning unless permission has been given by
the town to extend the frequency based on the actual usage.
               2.   GCE must be pumped out completely (total pump), and no
water from the GCE will be discharged back into the GCE after the pumping is
completed unless prior approval is given by the town. The GCE should be filled
with “fresh water” after the total pump.
   (E)   Best management practices. The FSE shall comply with the following
best management practices (BMPs).
      (1)   BMPs to prevent blockages in the sanitary sewer.
         (a)   Educate employees on the BMPs and the importance of preventing
fats, oils and grease from entering the sanitary sewer system.
         (b)   Dispose of food waste by recycling and/or solid waste removal.
         (c)   Dry wipe pots, pans and dishware prior to washing.
         (d)   Use absorbent pads to soak up fats, oils and grease under fryer
baskets.
         (e)   Post “No Grease” signs above sinks and in front of dishwashers.
         (f)   Properly dispose of all fats, oils and grease into recycling
containers. No FOG should be poured into a drain or flushed into sanitary sewer
collection system.
         (g)   Place covers on containers before transporting used oil and
grease to recycling containers.
         (h)   Recycle FOG waste via rendering or recycling companies.
         (i)   Collect and recycle used cooking oil in appropriate containers
for recycling.
      (2)   BMPs to properly maintain grease traps and interceptors.
         (a)   Observe proper grease interceptor cleaning and maintenance
procedures to ensure that the device is operating properly. Regular and proper
service maximizes interceptor efficiency, prevents spills and minimizes odor.
         (b)   Train all staff to regularly check the depth of solids and
thickness of retained FOG in the grease interceptor. As a general rule, an
interceptor loses its effectiveness when excessive amount of FOG and/or solids
accumulate. The frequency of servicing is determined by the accumulation rate
of FOG and solids.
         (c)   Service the grease interceptor at regularly scheduled intervals.
Have a licensed and certified hauling, rendering or pumping company clean, pump
down and service the grease interceptor regularly.
         (d)   Witness all grease trap or interceptor cleaning and maintenance
activities to ensure the grease control device is properly cleaned and is
operating correctly.
         (e)   1.   Clean under-sink, under-counter or in-the-floor grease
traps weekly. These grease traps have less volume than grease interceptors.
Weekly cleaning of grease traps by the establishment’s own maintenance staff
will reduce the cost of cleaning the grease interceptor.
            2.   If the establishment does not have a grease interceptor, the
grease trap is the only means of preventing grease from entering the sanitary
sewer system. If the grease trap is not providing adequate protection, the
utility will require the installation of a grease interceptor.
         (f)   Keep a maintenance log. The maintenance log serves as a record
of the frequency and volume of cleaning of the grease trap/interceptor. It is
required by the FOG policy to ensure that maintenance is performed on a regular
basis.
   (F)   Record keeping.
      (1)   (a)   The “FOG Folder” must be kept at FSE facility address. This
folder shall be available for periodic inspections, including copying by the
town.
         (b)   This folder must contain the following records at all times:
            1.   The food service discharge permit;
            2.   Completed interior GCE cleaning logs and cleaning schedule
(including receipts from cleanings performed by outside companies);
            3.   GCE maintenance and inspection logs and all calibration
records for instrumentation and flow meters;
            4.   Copies of all receipts and hauling manifests for exterior GCE
cleanings. The FSE must obtain the final disposal copy of the hauling manifest
showing where the final disposal occurred;
            5.   Copy of the contract/agreement with the GCE cleaning company/
hauler;
            6.   Specifications on all GCE being used at the facility; and
            7.   Any correspondence including past notices of violation from
the town.
      (2)   All records shall be retained for a minimum of three years.
      (3)   Failure to meet any of the record keeping requirements is a
violation of the food service discharge permit and the town’s rules and
regulations.
   (G)   Right to inspect. The utility shall have the right to enter the
premises of any establishment to determine whether the establishment is
complying with all requirements of the FOG policy, with any wastewater
discharge permit or with any order issued by the utility. FSEs shall allow the
utility ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of
any additional duties during reasonable business hours.
      (1)   Where an establishment has security measures in force, which
require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
establishment shall make necessary arrangements with security so that, upon
presentation of suitable identification, utility staff will be permitted to
enter immediately for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
      (2)   The utility shall have the right to set up on the establishment
property, or require installation of, such devices and/or structures as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the establishment’s
operations.
      (3)   The utility may require the establishment to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The establishment’s sampling and monitoring equipment
shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by
the establishment at the establishments expense. All devices used to measure
wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at least annually to ensure
accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the establishment’s FOG control devices, interceptors or equipment to be
inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the establishment at the
written or verbal request of utility staff and shall not be replaced.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing utility staff to access the
establishment’s premises shall be a violation of this permit.
   (H)   Permit violations. No permittee shall discharge wastewater to the
sanitary sewer system in violation of the FOG policy or the utility’s
pretreatment discharge limitations.
      (1)   It shall be a violation of the permit for any permittee to:
         (a)   Modify a grease interceptor structure without the consent or
approval of the utility including alteration or removal of any flow
constricting devices so as to cause flow to rise above the design capacity of
the grease interceptor;
         (b)   Provide false maintenance records;
         (c)   Cause or permit the plugging, blocking or interference with a
grease interceptor or permits others to cause such interference; and
         (d)   Failure to comply with the provisions of a FOG discharge permit
or the FOG policy.
      (2)   No permittee shall discharge grease in excess of 100 mg/l to the
sanitary sewer collection system or contribute to increased downstream
maintenance of the sanitary sewer system, or contribute to downstream backups
or overflows due to grease blockages as determined by the utility staff. If
such discharge occurs, the customer or establishment shall be considered in
violation of this permit and subject to the remedies described herein.
      (3)   No permittee shall contribute or cause to be contributed into the
grease interceptor or the sanitary sewer system any of the following:
         (a)   Hot water running continuously through grease interceptor;
         (b)   Concentrated alkaline or acidic solutions;
         (c)   Concentrated detergents, emulsifiers, de-emulsifiers, surface
active agents, enzymes, degreasers, solvents or any type of product that will
liquefy grease interceptor wastes;
         (d)   Any substance that may cause excessive foaming in the sanitary
sewer system;
         (e)   Any substance capable of passing the solid or semi-solid
contents of the grease interceptor to the sanitary sewer system;
         (f)   Hazardous wastes including concentrated cleaners, pesticides,
herbicides, paints, solvents, gasoline or other petroleum products; or
         (g)   Waste fats, oils and grease not generated as part of the
wastewater system.
   (I)   Penalties and fees.
      (1)   When FOG policy violations are found at a permittee’s
establishment, the utility may take enforcement action to correct the issue.
Violations may be as a result of on-site inspections by utility or the County
Health Department personnel, general complaints, consumer tips or observation
of collection system problems from various utility department personnel.
      (2)   A permittee found to be violating the FOG policy shall be sent a
notice of violation (NOV) that will outline the nature of the violation and the
corrective measures that need to be taken along with a time frame in which the
establishment must act. Failure to address the issue, failure to respond or
failure to meet the stipulated time frame(s) will result in the issuance of a
monetary penalty.

requirements of §
53.015 and the customer discharges abnormal industrial wastes to the public
sanitary sewerage system having an average total suspended solids (TSS) content
in excess of 250 mg/l and/or an average of five day BOD in excess of 450 mg/l,
the customer shall pay a surcharge based upon the excess strength of his or her
wastes.
   (B)   The costs of treatment for each pound of BOD, suspended solids or
grease removed by each treatment works shall be reviewed by the town at the end
of each fiscal year. If a discrepancy exists between the actual costs as found
by the town and the estimated costs, the Town Council shall increase or
decrease the surcharge rates sufficiently to cover only the projected actual
costs for the ensuing year.
   (C)   No reduction in sewerage service charges, fees or taxes will be
permitted because of the fact that certain industrial wastes discharged to the
public sanitary sewerage system contain less than 450 milligrams per liter of
suspended solids, or 450 milligrams per liter BOD.

of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Wastewater Superintendent may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c).
   (B)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Wastewater
Superintendent shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream
formula in 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e).
   (C)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Wastewater
Superintendent may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed
either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for
purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual
industrial users.
   (D)   A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard
if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in
40 C.F.R. Part 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally
different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical
pretreatment standard.
   (E)   A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in
accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.15.

Standard limitations applied as it is identified as most stringent when
compared to 2015 Local Limit calculations.
   (C)   Under the direction of the Wastewater Superintendent, BMPs may be
developed and required. BMPs may include treatment requirements; operating
procedures and practices to control site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or
waste disposal; or drainage from raw materials storage. Per 40 CFR § 403.5(c)
(4), BMPs shall be considered local limits and pretreatment standards for the
purposes of this part and section 307(d) of the Act.
   (D)   The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged
to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal
unless indicated otherwise. The Wastewater Superintendent may impose mass
limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations
above.
   (E)   Upon the promulgation of the National Categorical Pretreatment
Standard (NCPS) for a particular user, the said standard, if more stringent
then the limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that category,
shall, when effective, immediately supersede the limitations and conditions
imposed under this ordinance. The Wastewater Superintendent shall notify all
known affected users of the applicable permitting and reporting requirements

   No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly
authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The
Wastewater Superintendent may impose mass limitations on users who are using
dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other
cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. The Wastewater
Superintendent has the legal authority to accept or deny new or increased
discharges from any indirect discharger.

PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER
§ 53.035 PRETREATMENT FACILITIES.
   Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this
chapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits and the prohibitions set out in §
53.015 within the time limitations specified by EPA, IDEM or the Wastewater
Superintendent, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for
compliance shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user’s expense.
Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the Wastewater Superintendent for review, and shall be acceptable
to the Wastewater Superintendent before such facilities are constructed. The
review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a
discharge acceptable to the town under the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2016-15, passed 8-10-2016)
§ 53.036 ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES.
   (A)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Wastewater Superintendent may require
users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that
certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial
wastestreams and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW
and determine the user’s compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The Wastewater Superintendent may require any person discharging into
the POTW to install and maintain, on his, her or its property and at his, her
or its expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure
equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for
flow equalization.
   (C)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
   (D)   Users which operate vehicular wash facilities shall provide, operate
and maintain pretreatment facilities approved by the Wastewater Superintendent
to control solids and preclude the discharge of toxics to the POTW.
   (E)   Users which operate food preparation facilities shall provide, operate
and maintain pretreatment facilities approved by the Wastewater Superintendent
to control the discharge of greases, fats, oils and food solids to the POTW.

substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
C.F.R. Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste
as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the
type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the user discharges more
than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of
the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; an estimation of the mass
and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during
that calendar month; and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this division (A) need be submitted only once
for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed
conditions must be submitted under §
53.094. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
53.090,
53.092 and
53.093.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A) above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of
nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires
a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges
more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA, being 42
U.S.C. § 6921, identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or
listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
Wastewater Superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division
Director and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) of the
discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such
regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(Ord. 2016-15, passed 8-10-2016)
§ 53.099 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. Part 136, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40
C.F.R. Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance
with procedures approved by EPA.
(Ord. 2016-15, passed 8-10-2016)
§ 53.100 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (A)   Except as indicated in division (B) below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In
the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the Wastewater
Superintendent may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum
of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab
samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease (O & G), temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
(Ord. 2016-15, passed 8-10-2016)
§ 53.101 TIMING.
   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern. Facsimiles may be accepted on a case-by-case basis if
approved by the Wastewater Superintendent.
(Ord. 2016-15, passed 8-10-2016)
§ 53.102 RECORD KEEPING.
   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include
the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person
(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the
analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such
analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three
years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any
litigation concerning the user or the town, or where the user has been
specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Wastewater
Superintendent.
(Ord. 2016-15, passed 8-10-2016)
COMPLIANCE MONITORING
§ 53.115 RIGHT OF ENTRY; INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   The permittee shall allow the Wastewater Superintendent, or an authorized
representative, upon the presentation of credentials and other documents as may
be required by law, to:
   (A)   Enter upon the permittee’s premises where a regulated facility or
activity is located or conducted, or where records must be kept under the
conditions of this chapter;
   (B)   Have access to an copy, at reasonable times, any records that must be
kept under the conditions of this chapter;
   (C)   Inspect at reasonable times any facilities, equipment (including
monitoring and control equipment), practices or operations regulated or
required under this chapter;
   (D)   Sample or monitor, for the purposes of assuring permit compliance, any
substances or parameters at any locations; and
   (E)   Inspect any production, manufacturing, fabricating or storage area
where pollutants, regulated under the permit, could originate, be stored or be
discharged to the sewer system.
(Ord. 2016-15, passed 8-10-2016)
§ 53.116 ORDER TO ENTER PREMISES.
   If the Wastewater Superintendent has been refused access to a building,
structure or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there
is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program of the town designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any
permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety and welfare of the community, then the Wastewater Superintendent may
seek issuance of an order from the County Circuit or Superior Court authorizing
such access as allowed by this chapter.
(Ord. 2016-15, passed 8-10-2016)
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
§ 53.130 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits and monitoring
programs, and from the Wastewater Superintendent’s inspection and sampling
activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the
user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the Wastewater Superintendent, that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection
as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted
at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and
demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be
held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets
or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public,
but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies
for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in
enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics and other “effluent data” as defined by 40
C.F.R. § 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be
available to the public without restriction.
(Ord. 2016-15, passed 8-10-2016)
ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
§ 53.145 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   When the Wastewater Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Wastewater Superintendent may serve upon that user a written
notice of violation. Within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by
the user to the Wastewater Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way
relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the Wastewater Superintendent to take any action, including
emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a
notice of violation.
(Ord. 2016-15, passed 8-10-2016)
§ 53.146 AGREED ORDERS.
   The Town Council may enter into agreed orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to
be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §
53.999 and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Ord. 2016-15, passed 8-10-2016)
§ 53.147 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   The Wastewater Superintendent may order a user which has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to appear before the Wastewater Superintendent and show cause why
a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on
the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user
show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice
of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least 15 days prior to the hearing. Such notice
may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause
hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
(Ord. 2016-15, passed 8-10-2016)
§ 53.148 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the Wastewater Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Wastewater Superintendent may request the issuance of an order
by the Town Council to the user responsible for the discharge directing that
the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not
come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2016-15, passed 8-10-2016)
§ 53.149 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   (A)   When the Wastewater Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, or that the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the
Wastewater Superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it to cease
and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   (B)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. Cease and desist
orders are appealable to the Town Council within 15 days of date such order is
issued.
(Ord. 2016-15, passed 8-10-2016)
§ 53.150 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)   The Wastewater Superintendent may immediately suspend a user’s
discharge, after formal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to
present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons.
   (B)   The Wastewater Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user’s
discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Wastewater Superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The
Wastewater Superintendent may allow the user to recommence its discharge when
the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Wastewater Superintendent
that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings
in §
53.151 are initiated against the user.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Wastewater Superintendent prior to the
date of any show cause or termination hearing under §§
53.147 or
53.151. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Ord. 2016-15, passed 8-10-2016)
§ 53.151 TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.
   (A)   In addition to the provisions in §
53.075, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge
termination:
      (1)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§
53.015 through
53.020.
   (B)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under §
53.147 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by
the Wastewater Superintendent shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2016-15, passed 8-10-2016)
AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
§ 53.165 UPSET.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (C) below are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the Wastewater
Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset:
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
(Ord. 2016-15, passed 8-10-2016)
§ 53.166 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
53.015(A) or the specific prohibitions in §
53.015(B)(3) through (B)(16) if it can prove that it did not know, or have
reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges
from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when the town was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit (No. IN0023892), and in the case
of interference, was in compliance with applicable biosolids use or disposal
requirements.
(Ord. 2016-15, passed 8-10-2016)
§ 53.167 BYPASS.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      BYPASS. The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a
user’s treatment facility.
      SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property, damage
to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of divisions (C) and (D) below.
   (C)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Wastewater Superintendent, at least ten days before
the date of the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Wastewater Superintendent of
an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission
shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of
the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass
and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times,
and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected
to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Wastewater Superintendent may waive the written
report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24
hours.
   (D)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Wastewater Superintendent may take
an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (C) above.
      (2)   The Wastewater Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, if the Wastewater Superintendent
determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in division (D)(1)
above.

of the violation.
         (b)   The town may seek to recover court costs, and other expenses
associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring
expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the town.
         (c)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court should
take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to,
the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
         (d)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or
a prerequisite for, talcing any other action against a user.
(Ord. 2016-15, passed 8-10-2016)
      (3)   Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this chapter
are not exclusive. The town may take any, all, or any combination of these
actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations
will generally be in accordance with the town's enforcement response plan.
However, the Wastewater Superintendent may take other action against any user
when the circumstances warrant. Further, the Wastewater Superintendent is
empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant

section is adopted.
   (D)   Upon the adoption of this section, a designated entity determined by
permit issued by the town pursuant appropriate application shall hold an
exclusive license to furnish water service within the regulated territory, and
all other utilities are expressly prohibited from furnishing water service
within the regulated territory, except for those customers located in the
regulated territory that are connected to another water utility as of the date
this section is adopted.
   (E)   Attached hereto and incorporated by reference herein is a map
depicting the regulated territory, a copy of which shall be retained for public
inspection at the offices of the town’s sewer utility during regular business
hours.
   (F)   This section shall not be construed to prohibit an individual property
owner from providing water service to such property owner’s lot through the
drilling of a well on such property; provided, however, the water from such
well shall not be used to provide water service to owners or lessees of other
properties.
   (G)   The town’s existing rules and regulations for sewer service, as
amended from time to time, shall apply to and within the regulated territory.

   (F)   Notice of violation. Violations of this section shall be addressed by
the Building Commissioner:
      (1)   When a public nuisance is found to exist, the Building Commissioner
shall notify the property's owner of the existence of the nuisance and order
the owner to abate the nuisance.
      (2)   The written notice to abate shall be served upon an owner by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a "notice" placard conspicuously
posted on the property with a copy of the notice being sent by regular first
class United States mail, postage prepaid, granting a minimum of ten calendar
days to abate the nuisance. That notice shall state the nature of the nuisance
and the penalty for neglect or refusal to abate the nuisance. That notice shall
also contain the address and the telephone number of the town, and a
notification that if the nuisance is not abated within ten calendar days of
that notice, the town may abate the nuisance and seek recovery for its costs of
doing so.
      (3)   Within ten calendar days of delivery of a notice to abate, the
owner may notify the town in writing of any specific objection to that notice.
If the owner notifies the town of the owner's objection, no further abatement
action shall be pursued until such action is directed by the Council.
      (4)   If after the expiration of those ten days, the public nuisance
continues unabated, and either no objection has been made or an objection has
been made and considered by the Council and the Council has overruled the
objection, further action shall be taken to abate that nuisance in accordance
with this section and applicable law.
   (G)   Citation for failure to abate nuisance. Whenever the Building
Commissioner, after the expiration of the notice, determines that the
property's owner has failed to abate the nuisance, the Building Commissioner
may cause a citation to be issued against that owner. For each violation the
fine shall be $100, and each subsequent day of violation shall be considered a
separate and chargeable offense.
   (H)   Abatement of nuisance by town. Upon failure, neglect, or refusal of
any party to comply with the notice to abate, in addition to the issuance of a
citation under this section, the Building Commissioner in the name of the
Council may cause the town to abate by any reasonable means the public
nuisance, and thereafter furnish the Council with a statement of the costs of
that abatement. The Building Commissioner shall give notice to the property
owner, in writing, at least 24 hours in advance of entering the real estate of
its intent to enter and abate. Such notice may be left at the real estate upon
which the condition exists, may be mailed to the property owner by regular
United States mail or may be hand delivered to the property owner.
   (I)   Continuous enforcement orders. If an initial notice of violation of
this section is provided to a property owner by certified mail and first class
mail as provided herein, a continuous enforcement order may be posted at the
property at the time of abatement instead of by certified mail or first class
mail. A continuous enforcement order serves as notice to the property owner
that any subsequent violation during the same year for which the initial notice
of violation was provided may be abated by the Town of Newburgh or its
contractors without need of further notice to the property owner.
   (J)   Institution of legal action. An action for appropriate relief may be
brought against an alleged violator in the Warrick County Superior Court.
   (K)   Procedure for collection of abatement and administrative costs.

for all costs incurred by the town in abatement of the public nuisance. The
cost billed to the property owner under this section shall include all actual
costs incurred by the Town of Newburgh, Indiana, including without limitation,
the cost of a private contractor should only be used or the actual cost per
hour or any labor spent by town employees in abating the nuisance, equipment
and supply costs, the cost of any title or other record search and the cost of
all postage, plus an administrative fee equal to 2% of the total of such costs.
The owner shall pay the amount of the bill to the Clerk-Treasurer's office
within 30 days of the date of that delivery unless, within those 30 days the
owner notifies that office in writing of any objection to that bill. If that
notice is given, no further collection action shall be taken until the Council
acts on the objection.
      (2)   If the 30 days has expired and either no timely objection to the
bill has been made or the Council has overruled any timely objection and the
bill is not paid in full, then the bill for all such costs which the owner has
failed to pay shall be considered delinquent.
      (3)   Whenever the Building Commissioner deems it necessary, the Building
Commissioner shall prepare:
         (a)   A list of delinquent fees, penalties, and costs that are
enforceable under this chapter, including:
            1.   The name or names of the owners of each lot or parcel of real
property on which fees, penalties and costs are delinquent;
            2.   A description of the premises, as shown on the records of the
County Auditor;
            3.   The amount of the delinquent fees, penalties and costs due
under this chapter; or
         (b)   An instrument for each lot or parcel of real property on which
the fees are delinquent.
      (4)   The Building Commissioner shall record a copy of each list or each
instrument with the County Recorder in accordance with I.C. 36-1-6-2(e).
      (5)   The Building Commissioner shall provide a copy of the recorded list
or instrument to the County Auditor to be placed on the tax duplicate for that
property, with the result that the amount so certified shall be collected as
delinquent taxes are collected in accordance with I.C. 36-1-6-2(f).
(Ord. 2019-2, passed 5-22-2019)
§ 91.02 WEEDS, GRASS AND RANK VEGETATION.
   (A)   This section is adopted pursuant to I.C. 36-7-10.1 pertaining to weeds
and other rank vegetation. The provisions and remedies in this section are in
addition to the provisions and remedies provided in § 91.01 herein.
   (B)   No person shall allow any weeds, grass or vegetation to grow to a
height 12 inches from the ground on any real property owned, leased or
controlled by him within the Town of Newburgh, Indiana. All weeds, grass, and
rank vegetation in an excess of 12 inches are hereby declared to be a public
nuisance and may be abated in accordance with the law.
   (C)   For purposes of this section, weeds and rank vegetation shall be
deemed to include any undesirable, uncultivated plant including weeds, grass
and vegetation, but shall not include agricultural crops, such as hay and
pasture.
   (D)   Whenever the Building Commissioner finds weeds, grass, or rank
vegetation on real property within the Town of Newburgh, Indiana which is in
such a condition as to violate this section, the Town of Newburgh may issue
written notice to the property owner ordering the property owner to remove the
weeds, grass, or rank vegetation within ten days of receipt of the notice.
Notice shall be served by certified mail upon the property owner at said
person's last address as indicated on the records of the Warrick County Auditor
on the date of the notice, with a first class letter sent on the same date.
Notice shall be deemed complete and received upon mailing.
      (1)   In the event the property owner fails to remove the weeds, grass,
or rank vegetation, as required in the written notice, the Building
Commissioner may issue to the property owner, a citation for an ordinance
violation which states the relevant offenses of the ordinance, and the matter
may be prosecuted in the appropriate court by the Town Attorney.
      (2)   In addition, if the property owner fails to remove the weeds,
grass, or rank vegetation, as required in the written notice, the Town of
Newburgh, through its own workforce or through a private contractor hired by
the Town of Newburgh, may enter the real property and abate the violation by
cutting and removing the weeds, grass, or rank vegetation. The expense thereof
shall be billed to the property owner. If the property owner fails to pay such
bill within ten days from the date of notice (which notice shall be served as
provided in division (D) above), the Town of Newburgh will certify to the
Warrick County Auditor the amount of the bill, plus any additional
administrative costs incurred in the certification. The Auditor shall
thereafter place the total amount certified on the tax duplicate for the
property affected, and the total amount (which may include, without limitation,
fees for title searches and postage), and any accrued interest, shall be
collected as delinquent taxes are collected, and shall be disbursed to the
general fund of the Town of Newburgh, Indiana. The cost billed to the property
owner under this section shall include all actual costs incurred by the Town of
Newburgh, Indiana, including without limitation, the cost of a private
contractor should one be used or the actual cost per hour or any labor spent by
town employees in abating the nuisance, equipment and supply costs, the cost of
any title or other record search and the cost of all postage, plus an
administrative fee equal to 2% of the total of such costs.
      (3)   If an initial notice of violation of this section is provided to a
property owner by certified mail and first class mail as provided herein, a
continuous abatement notice may be posted at the property at the time of
abatement instead of by certified mail or first class mail. A continuous
abatement notice serves as notice to the property owner that any subsequent
violation during the same year for which the initial notice of violation was
provided may be abated by the Town of Newburgh or its contractors without need
of further notice to the property owner. For purposes of this section
continuous enforcement order may also be identified as a continuous abatement
notice as that term is used in I.C. 36-7-10.1.
   (E)   Any property owner that is aggrieved by a notice to abate or a bill
submitted following failure to comply, may appeal. Such appeal shall be made in
writing and shall be delivered personally to the Town of Newburgh at Newburgh
Town Hall, within not more than ten days from the date the notice or bill was
received. The Newburgh Town Council may, but is not required to, conduct a
hearing on request of an aggrieved person pursuant to this section.
   (F)   Any person found to be in violation of one or more requirements of
this section shall be subject to a fine of $100. Each day a violation continues
shall constitute a separate offense. Said fine shall be in addition, and
without exclusion to any other remedies and/or penalties provided herein.

except, such application may not be withdrawn after the applicant has made
deposit of the required share of the cost of construction unless specifically

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
§ 151.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Town Council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 2017-01, passed 4-12-2017; Ord. 2017-08, passed 7-12-2017)
§ 151.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-proofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 2017-01, passed 4-12-2017; Ord. 2017-08, passed 7-12-2017)
§ 151.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters.
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage.
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (F)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2017-01, passed 4-12-2017; Ord. 2017-08, passed 7-12-2017)
§ 151.004 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health.
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains.
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.

DEFINITIONS
§ 151.015 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both, in A zones,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM or FHBM. The definitions are
presented below.
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply.
      (2)   ZONE AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements
apply. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance
purchase requirements apply.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.
      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection. Mandatory flood insurance
purchase requirements apply.
      (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements
apply.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure that is located on
the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns and hay
sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community’s
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular
program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   D ZONE. Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding
is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is
not required by regulation in this zone.

   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The FLOODPLAIN includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited
to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances and other applications of police power which control development in
flood prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to
as FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS, FLOODPLAIN ORDINANCE, FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
ORDINANCE and FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for
nonresidential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOOD.)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See FREEBOARD.)
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP (AS RELATED TO VARIANCES OF THIS CHAPTER). The exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Town
Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual and
peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is
not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition or any combination thereof. All renewal and new business
flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,1997, will
include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
      LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the currently
effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA
through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is only
issued by FEMA.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the currently
effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations,
and elevations.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision by
letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.

below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and
         (c)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.

151.031. The REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the term BASE FLOOD, 1% ANNUAL
CHANCE FLOOD and 100-YEAR FLOOD.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period ending on the date of the event for
which the second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood
damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of the market value of the
structure at the time of each such flood event.
   SECTION 1316. That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968,
being 42 U.S.C. §§ 4001 et seq., as amended, which states that no new flood
insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that the Administrator
finds has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority
or other authorized public body to be in violation of state or local laws,
regulations or ordinances that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict
land development or occupancy in flood prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdictions of
the town subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the town
are generally identified as such on the Warrick County, Indiana and
Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, dated August 2, 2012. (These areas are shown on a FHBM or
FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1-A30, AH, AR, A99 or AO).
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage
of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds

the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary or safety code requirements or any alteration
of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structures continued designation as a historic structure.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification or other evidence of compliance required in this
chapter is presumed to be in VIOLATION until such time as that documentation is
provided.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
SHADED X ZONES shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). UNSHADED X ZONES (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FHBM or FIRM that reflects the severity
or type of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. See definition for A ZONE.
   ZONE B, C AND X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available
in participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(ZONE X is used on new and revised maps in place of ZONES B AND C.)

revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage area
from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace existing
data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and subsequently approved.
   (C)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification
on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of
any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas shall be according
to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater
than one square mile.
   (D)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.

§ 151.035 DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND ELEVATIONS.
   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles shall govern.
   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
   (C)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the
base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site shall be
considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied.
The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA.

plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and
elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, earthen
fill, storage of materials or equipment, drainage facilities, and the location
of the foregoing.
   (B)   Specifically the following information is required:
      (1)   Application stage.
         (a)   A description of the proposed development.
         (b)   Location of the proposed development sufficient to accurately
locate property and structure(s) in relation to existing roads and streams.
         (c)   A legal description of the property site.
         (d)   A site development plan showing existing and proposed
development locations and existing and proposed land grades.
         (e)   Elevation of the top of the planned lowest floor (including
basement) of all proposed buildings. Elevation should be in NAVD 88 or NGVD.
         (f)   Elevation (in NAVD 88 or NGVD) to which any non-residential
structure will be floodproofed.
         (g)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. A hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering study is required and any watercourse changes submitted
to DNR for approval and then to FEMA as a Letter of Map Revision. (See §
151.052(6) for additional information.)
      (2)   Construction stage. Upon establishment of the lowest floor of an
elevated structure or structure constructed on fill, it shall be the duty of
the applicant to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the
NAVD 88 or NGVD elevation of the lowest floor, as built. Said certification
shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land
surveyor, professional engineer or architect and certified by the same. The
Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor elevation survey data
submitted. The applicant shall correct deficiencies detected by such review
before any further work is allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the
elevation certification shall be at the applicant's risk. Upon establishment of
the floodproofed elevation of a floodproofed structure, it shall be the duty of
the applicant to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a floodproofing
certificate. Certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision
of a registered professional engineer or architect and certified by same. (The
Floodplain Administrator shall review the floodproofing certification
submitted.) The applicant shall correct any deficiencies detected by such
review before any further work is allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the
floodproofing certification or failure to make correction required shall be
cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
      (3)   Finished construction. Upon completion of construction, an
elevation certification (FEMA Elevation Certificate Form 81-31 or any future
updates) which depicts the "as-built" lowest floor elevation is required to be
submitted to the Floodplain Administrator. If the project includes a
floodproofing measure, floodproofing certification (FEMA Floodproofing
Certificate Form 81-65 or any future updates) is required to be submitted by
the applicant to the Floodplain Administrator.

the plane of the wall. This requirement applies to the hole in the wall,
excluding any device that may be inserted such as typical foundation air vent
device.
      (8)   Property owners shall be required to execute a flood openings/
venting affidavit acknowledging that all openings will be maintained as flood
vents, and that the elimination or alteration of the openings in any way will
violate the requirements of §
151.066 (D). Periodic inspections will be conducted by the Floodplain
Administrator to ensure compliance. The affidavit shall be recorded, along with
the deed, in the office of the Town County Recorder.
      (9)   Property owners shall be required to execute and record with the
structure's deed a non-conversion agreement declaring that the area below the
lowest floor (where the interior height of the enclosure exceeds six feet)
shall not be improved, finished or otherwise converted; the community will have
the right to inspect the enclosed area. The non-conversion agreement shall be
recorded in the office of the Warrick County Recorder.
   (E)   Structures constructed on fill. A residential or nonresidential
structure may be constructed on a permanent land fill in accordance with the
following:
      (1)   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep
before compacting to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with either the
standard or modified proctor test method. The results of the test showing
compliance shall be retained in the permit file.
      (2)   The fill shall extend ten feet beyond the foundation of the
structure before sloping below the BFE.
      (3)   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during
flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulkheading. If vegetative cover is

(Ord. 2017-01, passed 4-12-2017; Ord. 2017-08, passed 7-12-2017)
§ 151.069 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
151.031, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit,
provided the provisions contained in §§
151.065 et seq. (Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction) of this chapter have
been met. The Floodplain Development Permit cannot be less restrictive than the
permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any)
shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
0.15 of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under
the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as
proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.

§ 151.070 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
151.065 et seq. (Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction) of this chapter have
been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or
substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.
(Ord. 2017-01, passed 4-12-2017; Ord. 2017-08, passed 7-12-2017)
§ 151.071 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway or a floodplain analysis/
regulatory assessment citing the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the
recommended flood protection grade has been received from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment
approving the proposed development, a floodplain development permit may be
issued provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in §§
151.065 et seq. have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
151.065 et seq. have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and will not increase flood damages
or potential flood damages.

corridors, and bluff zones.
   (B)   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Town of Newburgh
Stormwater Management Ordinance. Once adopted, this chapter will supersede any
conflicting ordinances previously adopted by the town.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.002 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   This chapter shall regulate all development and redevelopment
occurring within the town. No building permit shall be issued, and no land
disturbance started for any construction in a development, as defined in §
152.005 for such construction have been accepted in writing by the town. With
the exception of the requirements of §§
152.020 through
152.026 and
152.089 through
152.094, single-family dwelling houses and duplexes in accepted subdivisions
and land disturbing activities affecting less than 10,000 square feet of area
shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter. Agricultural land
disturbing activities shall also be exempt from the requirements of this
chapter unless specifically provided otherwise.
   (B)   In addition to the requirements of this chapter and its companion
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, compliance with all applicable
ordinances of the town as well as with applicable federal, State of Indiana,
and other local statues and regulations shall also be required. Unless
otherwise stated, all other specifications referred to in this chapter shall be
the most recent edition available. Town capital improvement projects shall be
exempt from obtaining any approvals or permits but are expected to meet all
applicable technical requirements of this chapter and the town Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual. If the project site is located within a Warrick
County Regulated Drain Watershed, the applicant shall confirm with the Warrick
County Surveyor’s Office as to whether any additional requirements specific to
that regulated drain will apply to the site. In case there are conflicts
between the requirements contained in this chapter and applicable requirements
contained in other regulatory documents referenced above, the most restrictive
shall prevail.
   (C)   Except with respect to the requirements detailed in §§
152.020 through
152.026, any construction project which has had its final drainage plan
accepted by the town within a two-year period prior to the effective date of
this chapter shall be exempt from all requirements of this chapter that are in
excess of the requirements of ordinances in effect at the time of acceptance.
   (D)   The town has the authority to modify, grant exemptions, and/or waive
any and all the requirements of this chapter and its associated Technical
Standards document. A pre-submittal meeting with the town may be requested by
the applicant to discuss the applicability of various provisions of this
chapter and its associated Technical Standards document with regards to unique
or unusual circumstances relating to a project. However, any initial
determination of such applicability shall not be binding on future
determinations of the town that may be based on the review of more detailed
information and plans.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.003 FINDINGS.
   The town finds that:
   (A)   Water bodies, roadways, structures, and other property within the town
or its planning jurisdiction boundary are at times subjected to flooding;
   (B)   Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is
also a danger to the natural resources of the region;
   (C)   Land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds,
resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, increased flooding,
increased stream channel erosion, and increased sediment transport and
deposition;
   (D)   Soil erosion resulting from land-disturbing activities causes a
significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to be transported off-site
and deposited in ditches, streams, wetlands, lakes, and reservoirs;
   (E)   Increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments and
pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects
within the town will, absent reasonable regulation and control, adversely
affect the town’s water bodies and water resources;
   (F)   Pollutant contributions from illicit discharges within the town will,
absent reasonable regulation, monitoring, and enforcement, adversely affect the
town’s water bodies and water resources;
   (G)   Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, non-point source pollution, and
illicit sources of pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation
of stormwater management;
   (H)   Adopting the standards, criteria, and procedures contained and
referenced in this chapter and implementing the same will address many of the
deleterious effects of stormwater runoff and illicit discharges;
   (I)   Adopting this chapter is necessary for the preservation of the public
health, safety, and welfare, for the conservation of natural resources, and for
compliance with state and federal regulations.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.004 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the town through the regulation of
stormwater and nonstormwater discharges to the storm drainage system and to
protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land and water
resources within the town. This chapter establishes methods for managing the
quantity and quality of stormwater entering into the storm drain system. The
objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To reduce the hazard to public health and safety caused by excessive
stormwater runoff.
   (B)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain system
from construction site runoff.
   (C)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain system
from runoff from new development and redevelopment.
   (D)   To prohibit illicit discharges into the storm drain system.
   (E)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, monitoring,
and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.

discharger for such discharge. It shall not, however, be a defense to a legal
action brought to obtain an injunction, to obtain recovery of costs or to
obtain other relief because of or arising out of the discharge. A discharge
shall be considered properly reported only if the discharger complies with all
the requirements of this subchapter. This requirement does not relieve
discharger from notifying other entities as required by state or federal
regulations.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.026 INSPECTIONS AND MONITORING.
   (A)   Storm drainage system. The town has the authority to periodically
inspect the portion of the storm drainage system under the town’s control, in
an effort to detect and eliminate illicit connections and discharges into the
system. This inspection may include a screening of discharges from outfalls
connected to the system in order to determine if prohibited flows are being
conveyed into the storm drainage system. It may also include spot testing of
waters contained in the storm drainage system itself to detect the introduction
of pollutants into the system by means other than a defined outfall, such as
dumping or contaminated sheet runoff.
   (B)   Potential polluters. If, as a result of the storm drainage system
inspection, a discharger is suspected of an illicit discharge, the town may
inspect and/or obtain stormwater samples from stormwater runoff facilities of
the subject discharger, to determine compliance with the requirements of this
chapter. Upon request, the discharger shall allow the town’s properly
identified representative to enter upon the premises of the discharger at all
hours necessary for the purposes of such inspection or sampling. The town or
its properly identified representative may place on the discharger’s property
the equipment or devices used for such sampling or inspection. Identified
illicit connections or discharges shall be subject to enforcement action as
described in §§
152.105 through
152.108.
   (C)   New development and redevelopment. Following the final completion of
construction and the receipt of as-built drawings by the town, the town has the
authority to inspect new development and redevelopment sites to verify that all
on-site stormwater conveyances and connections to the storm drainage system are
in compliance with this subchapter.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT
§ 152.040 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   The storage and controlled release of excess stormwater runoff shall be
required for all new business, institutional developments, commercial and
industrial developments, residential subdivisions, planned development, rural
estate subdivisions, and any redevelopment or other new construction located
within the town unless a waiver is granted by the Stormwater Management Board
under §
152.041.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.041 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that most streams and drainage channels serving the
town do not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey stormwater runoff
resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, the storage and controlled
release of excess stormwater runoff as well as compensation for loss of
floodplain storage shall be required for all developments and redevelopments
(as defined in § 152.005) located within the town. Release rate requirements,
downstream restriction considerations, acceptable outlet, adjoining property
impact considerations, policy on dams and levees, policy on fluvial erosion
hazard corridors, and compensatory floodplain storage rates are detailed in the
town Stormwater Technical Standards.
   (B)   Due to unknowns regarding the future development patterns and the
associated proposed stormwater quantity management systems within a watershed,
it is the policy of the town to discourage direct release of runoff from a new
development or redevelopment without providing detention. However, in rare
circumstances, where a comprehensive watershed-wide hydrologic study or
watershed plan of a major stream (not a “beat the peak” analysis) approved by
the Board substantiates the benefits of (or allows for) direct release for a
proposed development located adjacent to a major stream, the detention
requirements set in this chapter may be waived. Other special circumstances
when such a waiver may be considered by the town include situations where the
design of a regional pond has already taken into account the provision of
direct release in certain areas in the watershed. In addition, the Board may
waive the requirement of storage and controlled release for divisions of land
meeting the requirements of minor subdivisions under the town’s subdivision
control ordinance (Chapter 156) in the Board’s discretion after appropriate
investigation and evaluation.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.042 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of all

§ 152.043 DRAINAGE EASEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All stormwater management systems, including detention or retention
basins, conveyance systems, structures and appurtenances, located outside of
the right-of-way shall be placed within an acceptable drainage easement. There
shall be no trees or shrubs planted, nor any structures or fences erected in
any drainage easement, unless otherwise approved by the town. Additional
easement requirements along stormwater conveyance systems are contained in the
town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. All drainage improvements performed
relative to the conveyance of stormwater runoff and the perpetual maintenance
thereof, within the latter easements, shall be the responsibility of the owner
or homeowner association except to the extent such drainage improvements are
specifically accepted by the town for maintenance.
   (B)   Any outlet to, crossing, and/or encroachment of a county regulated
drainage easement requires application and acceptance from the County Drainage
Board in accordance with the Indiana Drainage Code.

the commencement of construction activities, the town has the authority to
conduct inspections of the work being done to ensure full compliance with the
provisions of this subchapter, the Stormwater Technical Standards Manual,
design and construction standards, and the terms and conditions of the approved
permit.
   (B)   The town also has the authority to perform long-term, post-
construction inspection of all public or privately owned stormwater quantity
facilities. The inspection will cover physical conditions, available storage
capacity, and the operational condition of key facility elements. Stormwater
quantity facilities shall be maintained in good condition, in accordance with
the designed and approved performance specifications for the facilities, in
addition to any prescribed operation and maintenance procedures, and shall not
be subsequently altered, revised or replaced except as approved by the town. If
deficiencies are found during the inspection, the owner of the facility will be
notified by the town and will be required to take all necessary measures to
correct such deficiencies. If the owner fails to correct the deficiencies
within the allowed time period, as specified in the notification letter, the
town may undertake the work to correct the deficiencies and collect from the

STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION FOR CONSTRUCTION SITES
§ 152.055 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   The town will require a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP),
which includes erosion and sediment control measures and materials handling
procedures, to be submitted as part of a project’s construction plans and
specifications. Any project located within the corporate boundaries of the town
that includes clearing, grading, excavation or other land disturbing activities
resulting in the disturbance of 10,000 square feet or more of total land area
is subject to the requirements of this subchapter. This includes both new
development and redevelopment. This subchapter also applies to disturbances of
land that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger
common plan will ultimately disturb 10,000 square feet or more of total land
area. Section
152.057 provides guidelines for calculating land disturbance. Projects meeting
the coverage requirements of IDEM’s CSGP shall also be in compliance with the
requirements contained in that permit.
   (B)   The requirements under this subchapter do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion and sediment control
measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10.
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34.
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under
329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the
expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or
outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
   (C)   For an individual lot where land disturbance is expected to be one
acre or more, the individual lot owner must complete their own notice of intent
letter, apply for a stormwater management permit from the town, and ensure that
a sufficient construction and stormwater pollution prevention plan is completed
and submitted in accordance with §§
152.085 through
152.094, regardless of whether the individual lot is part of a larger permitted
project site. For an individual lot where land disturbance is less than one
acre, a basic drainage permit application is required prior to receiving a
building permit. Details of the permitting process are contained in §§
152.085 through
152.094.
   (D)   An individual lot located within a larger permitted project site, is
considered part of the larger permitted project site, and the individual lot
operator must comply with the terms and conditions of the stormwater management
permit approved for the larger project site. The stormwater management permit
application for the larger project site must include detailed erosion and
sediment control measures for individual lots. In addition, the builders of
these individual lots are required to submit a basic drainage permit
application along with a SWPPP for that individual lot prior to receiving a
building permit. Details of the permitting process for individual lots and
parcels are contained in §§
152.085 through
152.094 and additional requirements for individual lots may be found in the
town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (E)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
stormwater management permit application and ensure that a sufficient
construction plan is completed and submitted to the town in accordance with §§
152.085 through
152.094. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure
compliance with this chapter during the construction activity and
implementation of the construction plan, and to notify the town upon completion
of the project and stabilization of the site, requesting a termination
inspection to be performed by the town. However, all persons engaging in
construction and land disturbing activities on a permitted project site meeting
the applicability requirements must comply with the requirements of this
section and this chapter.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.056 POLICY ON STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION.
   (A)   Effective stormwater pollution prevention on construction sites is
dependent on a combination of preventing movement of soil from its original
position (erosion control), intercepting displaced soil prior to entering a
waterbody (sediment control), and proper onsite materials handling.
   (B)   For land disturbance of one acre or more, the developer must submit to
the town, a SWPPP with detailed erosion and sediment control plans as well as a
narrative describing materials handling and storage, and construction
sequencing. The SWPPP and the project management log must be retained by the
developer for at least three years from the date the project permit is
terminated. For land disturbances totaling 10,000 square feet or more but less
than one acre, appropriate erosion and sediment control measures that are
consistent with the town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual must be designed
and shown on the plans.
   (C)   The required IDEM general and implementation requirements that apply
to all land disturbing activities are contained in the town Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.057 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   In calculating the total area of land disturbance, for the purposes of
determining applicability of this subchapter to a project, the following
guidelines should be used:
      (1)   Off-site construction activities that provide services (for
example, road extensions, sewer, water, offsite stockpiles, and other
utilities) to a land disturbing project site, must be considered as a part of
the total land disturbance calculation for the project site, when the activity
is under the control of the project site owner.
      (2)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by this
subchapter, the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the
total area of land disturbance for improvements, such as, roads, utilities, or
common areas, and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as
determined by the following:
         (a)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
one-half acre or more, one-half acre of land disturbance must be used as the
expected lot disturbance.
         (b)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
less than one half acre in size, the total lot must be calculated as being
disturbed.
         (c)   To calculate lot disturbance on all other types of project
sites, such as industrial and commercial projects project sites, a minimum of
one acre of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance,
unless the lots are less than one acre in size, in which case the total lot
must be calculated as being disturbed.
   (B)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction sites shall meet
the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the Indiana
Stormwater Quality Manual, the town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and
the product guidance/specifications of the manufacturer. The methods and
procedures included in these two references are in keeping with the above
stated policy and meet the requirements of the IDEM’s CSGP. A copy of the
Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual may be obtained online through IDEM.
   (C)   The design requirements that would apply to all land disturbing
activities and shall be considered in the selection, design, and implementation
of all stormwater quality and management measures contained in the SWPPP are
contained in the town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.058 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING, AND REPORTING.
   (A)   Following approval of the stormwater management permit or basic
drainage permit by the town and commencement of construction activities, the
town has the authority to conduct inspections of the site to ensure full
compliance with the provisions of this subchapter, the approved stormwater
pollution prevention plan, the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual, and the terms
and conditions of the approved permit.
   (B)   A self-monitoring program (SMP) must be implemented by the project
site owner to ensure the stormwater pollution prevention plan is working
effectively. A trained individual, acceptable to the town, shall monitor and
manage project construction and stormwater activities. Details regarding the
required monitoring activities are contained in the town Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual.
   (C)   The stormwater pollution prevention plan shall serve as a guideline
for stormwater quality but should not be interpreted to be the only basis for
implementation of stormwater quality measures for a project site. The project
site owner is responsible for implementing, in accordance with this subchapter,
all measures necessary to adequately prevent polluted stormwater runoff.
Recommendations by the trained individual for modified stormwater quality
measures should be implemented.
   (D)   A project management log must be maintained at the project site or in
the possession of on-site individuals associated with the management and
operations of the construction activities. Details regarding requirements
related to the project management log are contained in the town Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION
§ 152.070 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   In addition to the requirements of §§
152.055 through
152.058, the stormwater pollution prevention plan, which is to be submitted to
the town as part of the stormwater management permit application, must also
include post-construction stormwater quality measures. These measures are
incorporated as a permanent feature into the site plan and are left in place
following completion of construction activities to continuously treat
stormwater runoff from the stabilized site. Any project located within the
corporate boundaries of the town that includes clearing, grading, excavation,
and other land disturbing activities, resulting in the disturbance of 10,000
square feet or more of total land area is subject to the requirements of this
subchapter. This includes both new development and redevelopment, and
disturbances of land less than 10,000 square feet of total land area that are
part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan
will ultimately disturb 10,000 square feet or more of total land area. In
addition, regardless of the amount of disturbance, the town reserves the right
to require pretreatment BMPs for proposed hot spot developments in accordance
with provisions contained in the town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (B)   The requirements under this subchapter do not apply to the following
activities:
      (1)   Construction activities associated with a single-family residential
dwelling disturbing less than one acre, when the dwelling is not part of a
larger common plan of development or sale; or individual building lots within a
larger permitted project.
   (C)   The requirements under this subchapter do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10.
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34.
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under
329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the
expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or
outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
   (D)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
stormwater management permit application and ensure that a sufficient
construction plan is completed and submitted to the town in accordance with §§
152.085 through
152.094. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure
proper construction and installation of all stormwater BMPs (especially, the
protection of post-stormwater BMPs during construction phase) in compliance
with this chapter and with the approved stormwater management permit, and to
notify the town upon completion of the project and stabilization of the site,
requesting a termination inspection to be performed by the town. However, all
eventual property owners of stormwater quality facilities meeting the
applicability requirements must comply with the requirements of this subchapter
and this chapter.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.071 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to undeveloped
areas, generally have increased imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates,
increased runoff rates, and increased concentrations of pollutants such as
fertilizers, herbicides, greases, oil, salts and other pollutants. As new
development and redevelopment continues within the corporate boundaries of the
town, measures must be taken to intercept and filter pollutants from stormwater
runoff prior to reaching regional creeks, streams, and rivers. Through the use
of appropriate best management practices (BMPs), to treat the Water Quality
Volume (WQv) or the Water Quality Flow (Qwq) stormwater runoff will be filtered
and harmful amounts of sediment, nutrients, and contaminants will be removed.
   (B)   It is also recognized that another major source of pollution in many
Indiana streams, including those within the corporate boundaries of the town,
is the streambank erosion associated with urbanizing watersheds. Stream
channels develop their shape in response to the volume and rate of runoff that
they receive from their contributing watersheds. Research has shown that in
hydrologically stable watersheds, the stream flow responsible for most of the
shaping of the channel (called the bankfull flow) occurs between every one to
two years. When land is developed, the volume and rate of runoff from that land
increases for these comparatively small flooding events that are not normally
addressed by the detention practices and the stream channel will adapt by
changing its shape. As the stream channel works to reach a new stable shape,
excess erosion occurs. As new development and redevelopment continues within
the corporate boundaries of the town, measures must be taken to minimize the
impact of such development or redevelopment on streambank erosion. Through the
use of appropriate best management practices (BMPs) to retain and/or detain and
slowly release the Channel Protection Volume (CPv), the volume and rate of
runoff for channel forming flows will be reduced in an attempt to minimize
increased streambank erosion in the receiving streams and channels.
   (C)   The project site owner must submit to the town a stormwater pollution
prevention plan (SWPPP) that shows placement of appropriate BMP(s) from a
preapproved list of BMPs specified in the town Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual. The SWPPP submittal shall include an operation and maintenance manual
for all post-construction BMP(s) included in the project and a notarized
maintenance agreement, consistent with the sample agreement provided in the
town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, providing for the long-term
maintenance of those BMPs, both of which shall be recorded with the deed for
the property on which the project is located. The noted BMP(s) must be
designed, constructed, and maintained according to guidelines provided or
referenced in the town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. Practices other
than those specified in the pre-approved list may be utilized. However, the
burden of proof as to whether the performance and ease of maintenance of such
practices will be according to guidelines provided in the town Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual, would be placed with the applicant. Details
regarding the procedures and criteria for consideration of acceptance of such
BMPs are provided in the town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (D)   Gasoline outlets and refueling areas must install appropriate
practices (as noted under “Hot Spots” provision in the Technical Standards) to
reduce lead, copper, zinc, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in stormwater runoff.
These requirements will apply to all new facilities and existing facilities
that replace their tanks, regardless of the size of the facility.
   (E)   Discharges from new development and redevelopment sites will not be
allowed directly into karst features without pre-treatment.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.072 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   Calculation of land disturbance should follow the guidelines discussed
in §
152.057.
   (B)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all stormwater quality management measures, or BMPs shall meet the design
criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the town Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual. The methods and procedures included in the
referenced standards is in keeping with the above stated policy and meet or
exceed the requirements of IDEM’s MS4 GP.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.073 EASEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   All stormwater quality management systems, including detention or retention
basins, filter strips, pocket wetlands, in-line filters, infiltration systems,
conveyance systems, structures and appurtenances located outside of the right-
of-way shall be incorporated into permanent easements. For the purposes of
monitoring, inspection, and general maintenance activities, adequate easement
width, as detailed in the town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, beyond
the actual footprint of the stormwater quality management facility as well as a
20-foot wide access easement from a public right-of-way to each BMP shall be
provided.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.074 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING, AND REPORTING.
   (A)   After the approval of the stormwater management permit by the town and
the commencement of construction activities, the town has the authority to
conduct inspections of the work being done to ensure full compliance with the
provisions of this subchapter, the approved stormwater pollution prevention
plan, the town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and the terms and
conditions of the approved permit.
   (B)   Stormwater quality facilities shall be maintained in good condition,
in accordance with the operation and maintenance procedures and schedules

appropriate for effective review of a particular project.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.086 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PERMIT PROCEDURES.
   All development or redevelopment of land that results in land disturbance of
one acre or more shall be required issuance of a stormwater management permit
in accordance with this subchapter. Individual lots and sites with land
disturbance of less than one acre shall refer to §§
152.055 through
152.058,
152.070 through
152.074, and §
152.088 for plan review and permit requirements and procedures. Figure 1 is a
flowchart summarizing the plan review/permit approval/project termination
compliance process for land disturbance of one acre or more and can be found at
the end of this section.
   (A)   General procedures.
      (1)   The project site owner shall submit an application for a stormwater
management permit to the town. The application will include a completed
application checklist, construction plan sheets, a stormwater drainage
technical report, a stormwater pollution prevention plan, and any other
necessary support information. Specific information to be included in the
application can be found in §
152.087. Three copies of each application must be submitted to the town. The
town may, at its discretion, require one or more copies be submitted to other
entities deemed appropriate by the town. Additionally, a digital copy of the
construction plans is required in a format accepted by the town.
      (2)   After the town’s receipt of the application, the applicant will be
notified as to whether their application was complete or insufficient. The
applicant will be asked for additional information if the application is
insufficient. If the application is complete, it will be reviewed in detail by
the town and/or its plan review consultant(s). Once all comments have been
received and review completed, the town will either approve the project,
request modifications or deny the project. If the applicant does not agree with
or accept the review findings and wishes to seek an appeal, the town will place
the project on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the
Newburgh Stormwater Management Board, subject to any notification or
publication requirements, which may require the project to be placed on the
agenda of a subsequent regular or special meeting of the Stormwater Management
Board. The town will furnish the applicant a complete list of comments and
objections to the plans and accompanying data prior to any scheduled Stormwater
Management Board meeting. After the scheduled meeting, the town may issue a
permit, request modifications to the construction plans, or deny the project.
      (3)   The project site owner must notify the town and IDEM before
beginning construction. Notification to the town shall be in the form of an
email while the notification to IDEM shall be in the form of an online IDEM NOI
submittal. Once a permit has been issued and the pending construction
notifications submitted to the town and IDEM before the beginning of
construction, construction may commence. Once construction starts, the project
owner shall monitor construction activities and inspect all stormwater
pollution prevention measures in compliance with this chapter and the terms and
conditions of the approved permit. Upon completion of construction activities,
a certification of completion and compliance and as-built plans must be
submitted to the town. Once the construction site has been stabilized and all
temporary erosion and sediment control measures have been removed, a
notification shall be sent to the town, requesting a termination inspection.
The town, or its representative, shall inspect the construction site to verify
that the completed project is fully stabilized and meets the requirements of
this chapter and its Technical Standards and that the terms and conditions of
the permit. Once the applicant receives a signed copy of the termination
inspection checklist confirming compliance, they must forward a copy to IDEM
along with the required IDEM NOT form. Permits issued by the town under this
scenario will expire five years from the date of issuance. If construction is
not completed within five years, an updated permit application must be
submitted to the town and an updated NOI must be resubmitted to IDEM at least
90 days prior to expiration.
   (B)   SWPPP review time limits.
      (1)   Pursuant to I.C. 13-18-27, an MS4-designated entity or other review
authority such as SWCD must make a preliminary determination as to whether the
construction plan associated with SWPPP is substantially complete before the
end of the tenth working day (for sites with less than five acres of land
disturbance) after the day on which the SWPPP is submitted to the review
authority or the fourteenth working day (for sites with five acres or larger of
land disturbance) after the day on which the SWPPP is submitted to the review
authority. Depending on the outcome of the SWPPP review, the following
scenarios may play out:
         (a)   No SWPPP review notification received. If the review authority
does not notify the applicant of its preliminary determination as to whether
the construction plan is substantially complete within either ten or 14 days as
noted above, the project site owner may submit a notice of intent letter to
IDEM including the information required by IDEM, or this chapter and the town
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and 48 hours after the NOI is submitted
to IDEM, may begin the construction project, including the land disturbing
activities of the construction project.
         (b)   SWPPP not substantially complete. If the review authority
notifies the applicant that the construction plan is not substantially
complete, the project site owner may not submit a notice of intent letter to
IDEM until the review authority makes a conclusive favorable determination
concerning the construction plan under the IDEM rule/permit, or this chapter
and the town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
         (c)   Unfavorable SWPPP. If the review authority notifies the
applicant that the construction plan is substantially complete; and makes a
conclusive unfavorable determination concerning the construction plan under
IDEM rule/permit, or this chapter and the town Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual, the project site owner may not submit a notice of intent letter to
IDEM.
         (d)   Preliminary SWPPP review. If the review authority notifies the
applicant that the construction plan is substantially complete and a
preliminary review has been completed, the project site owner may submit a
notice of intent letter to IDEM including the information required by IDEM, or
this chapter and the town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and 48 hours
after the NOI is submitted to IDEM, may begin the construction project,
including the land disturbing activities of the construction project. The plan
review authority reserves the right to perform a comprehensive review at a
later date, and revisions may be required at that time.
         (e)   Conditional SWPPP review. If the review authority notifies the
applicant that the construction plan is substantially complete and a
conditional review has been completed, the project site owner may submit a
notice of intent letter to IDEM including the information required by IDEM, or
this chapter and the town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and 48 hours
after the NOI is submitted to IDEM, may begin the construction project,
including the land disturbing activities of the construction project provided
that the requirements included in the conditional review are fulfilled.
         (f)   Favorable SWPPP review. If the review authority notifies the
applicant that the construction plan is substantially complete and a
preliminary review has been completed, the project site owner may submit a
notice of intent letter to IDEM including the information required by IDEM, or
this chapter and the town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and 48 hours
after the NOI is submitted to IDEM, may begin the construction project,
including the land disturbing activities of the construction project.
      (2)   Note that the above time limits only apply to the SWPPP portion of
the overall stormwater permit submittal and does not affect any official or
non-official permit review timelines set by the entity for other aspects of the
stormwater management permit application.

(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.091 REQUIRED ASSURANCES.
   This subchapter shall apply to all projects requiring a stormwater
management permit, whether the proposed stormwater management system or
portions thereof will be dedicated to the town or retained privately. As a
condition of approval and issuance of the permit, the town shall require the
applicant to provide assurance in form of an irrevocable letter of credit or a
bond when the stormwater management plan has been accepted and before
construction begins. The assurance will guarantee a good faith execution of the
stormwater drainage plan, the stormwater pollution prevention plan, the
stormwater quality management plan, and any permit conditions. The assurance
shall be for an amount equal to 125% of the total costs of all stormwater
management measures for the entire project. The above-mentioned costs shall be
based on an estimate as prepared by a registered engineer or land surveyor. The
costs shall be for the installation and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of
erosion control measures and the construction and ongoing monitoring and
maintenance of storm drainage infrastructure, detention/retention facilities,
and stormwater quality BMPs, as regulated under this chapter, until the
construction is completed, the site is stabilized, and as-built plans are
accepted by the town . Assurances shall be for a minimum of $5,000. All other
performance bonds, maintenance bonds or other assurances required by the town
in accordance with any and all other ordinances shall also apply and so be
required. Local governmental jurisdictions may require additional performance
and/or maintenance assurances. The intent of this assurance is not only to
complete the installation of storm drain infrastructure for the project, but
also to assure that adequate stormwater pollution prevention measures are
properly installed and maintained. If adequate assurances are set aside by the
project site owner for the overall project, proof of total assurance can be
submitted in place of an individual stormwater assurance.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.092 TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PERMITS.
   (A)   In granting a stormwater management permit or basic drainage permit,
the town may impose such terms and conditions as are reasonably necessary to
meet the purposes of this chapter. The project site owner shall ensure
compliance with such terms and conditions. Non-compliance with the terms and
conditions of permits will be subject to enforcement as described in §§
152.105 through
152.108.
   (B)   The project site owner shall inform all general contractor,
construction management firms, grading or excavating contractors, utility
contractors, and the contractors that have primary oversight on individual
building lots of the terms and conditions of the stormwater management permit
and the schedule for proposed implementation.
   (C)   In the event that a project site is determined to impact or discharge
to a sensitive area or is located in an impact drainage area, the town may
require more stringent stormwater quantity and quality measures than detailed
in this chapter or in the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual.
      (1)   Determination of sensitive areas. Sensitive areas include highly
erodible soils, wetlands, karst areas, threatened or endangered species
habitat, outstanding waters, impaired waters, recreational waters, and surface
drinking water sources. Any discharge from a stormwater practice that is a
Class V injection well shall meet the Indiana groundwater quality standards and
registered with U.S. EPA as required by the IDEM. If wetlands are suspected on
a site, a wetland delineation should be completed in accordance with the
methodology established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE). The need for
the applicant to check for the presence of threatened or endangered species
habitat will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Special terms and
conditions for development determined to impact or discharge to any sensitive
area shall be included in the stormwater management permit.
      (2)   Determination of impact drainage areas.
         (a)   The following areas shall be designated as impact drainage
areas, unless good reason for not including them is presented to the town:
            1.   A floodway or floodplain as designated by the most updated
FEMA Code dealing with floodplain regulation and/or by the best available data
through IDNR.
            2.   Land within 25 feet of each bank of any ditch within the
town’s system.
            3.   Land within 15 feet of the centerline of any stormwater
infrastructure or enclosed conduit within the town’s system.
            4.   Land within 75 feet of each bank of a county open regulated
drain.
            5.   Land within 50 feet of a natural drainageway.
            6.   Land within 75 feet of the centerline of any tiled regulated
drain.
            7.   Land within the fluvial erosion hazard (FEH) corridor.
            8.   Land within the expected breach inundation zone of an existing
or proposed new dam, and areas protected from flooding by a levee.
            9.   Any flood prone areas deemed by the town, identified or
established through engineering studies or town preliminary engineer reports or
Master Plan.
         (b)   The town or Town Engineer is authorized, but is not required, to
classify certain geographical areas as impact drainage areas. In determining
impact drainage areas, the town may consider such factors as topography, soil
type, capacity of existing drains, and distance from adequate drainage
facility.
         (c)   Land that does not have an adequate outlet, taking into
consideration the capacity and depth of the outlet, may be designated as an
impact drainage area by the town. Special terms and conditions for development
within any impact drainage area shall be included in the stormwater management
permit.
      (3)   Determination of designated drainage areas served by regional
facilities. The town is authorized, but is not required, to classify certain
geographical areas as designated drainage areas that are or will be served by
regional facilities, such as a regional pond. In such cases, an infrastructure
development fee (IDF) rate may be established for the designated drainage area.
The basis for determining such a fee for a proposed development or
redevelopment within a designated drainage area will be as detailed in the town
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.093 AS-BUILT PLANS.
   This subchapter shall apply to all projects whether the stormwater
management system or portions thereof will be dedicated to the town or retained
privately. After completion of construction of the project and before the
release of required performance assurances referenced in §
152.091, a professionally prepared and certified “as-built” set of plans
(record drawings) shall be submitted to the town for review. These as-built
plans/record drawings must be prepared and certified by the Engineer of Record,
i.e., the company/engineer who originally prepared the construction plans.
Additionally, a digital copy of the “as-built” plans (record drawings) as well
as finalized digital versions of all analyses, models, manuals, and reports
that are consistent with the as-built conditions is required in a format
acceptable to the town. These plans shall include all pertinent data relevant
to the completed storm drainage system and stormwater management facilities,
and shall include at a minimum the following:
   (A)   Pipe size and pipe material;
   (B)   Invert elevations;
   (C)   Top rim elevations;
   (D)   Elevation of the emergency overflow (spillway) for ponds;
   (E)   Grades along the emergency flood routing path(s);
   (F)   Pipe structure lengths;
   (G)   BMP types, dimensions, and boundaries/easements;
   (H)   “As-planted” plans for BMPs, as applicable;
   (I)   Data and calculations showing detention basin storage volume;
   (J)   Data and calculations showing BMP treatment capacity; and
   (K)   Certified statement on plans stating the completed storm drainage
system and stormwater management facilities substantially comply with
construction plans and the stormwater management permit as approved by the
town. (See certificate in the Stormwater Technical Standards Manual).
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.094 POST-PROJECT MAINTENANCE BOND AND VERIFICATIONS.
   (A)   In addition to as-built plans and the certification of completion and
compliance, following the release of performance assurances, the property
owner, developer, or contractor shall be required to file a two-year
maintenance bond or other acceptable guarantee with the town in an amount not
to exceed 25% of the cost of the stormwater management system located outside
the public road rights-of-way, and in a form satisfactory to the town in order
to assure that such stormwater system installation was done according to
standards of good workmanship, that the materials used in the construction and
installation were of good quality and construction, and that such project was
done in accordance with the accepted plans, and this chapter and that any off-
site drainage problems that may arise, whether upstream or downstream of such
project, will be corrected if such drainage problems are determined by the town
to have been caused by the development of such project. The bond or other
acceptable guarantee shall be in effect for a period of two years after the
date of the release of required performance assurances referenced in §
152.091. The beneficiary of all maintenance bonds shall be the Newburgh Town
Council.
   (B)   To verify that all stormwater infrastructure is functioning properly,
visual recordings (via closed circuit television) of such infrastructure,
including all subsurface drains, shall be required twice, once 30 days
following the completion of installation of the stormwater management system,
and the second time 11 months after installation of the entire storm system.
These visual recordings will be scheduled by the developer and paid for by the
developer. Visual recordings shall meet the requirements of NASSCO (National
Association of Sewer Service Companies) pipeline assessment certification
(PACP) requirements. Reports summarizing the results of the noted visual
recordings shall be reviewed and accepted by the town before maintenance
sureties would be recommended to be released.
   (C)   Additional requirements for transfer of any applicable stormwater BMP
maintenance agreement, O&M maintenance manual, and maintenance escrow accounts
to subsequent owners prior to release of the maintenance bond is discussed in
§§
152.070 through
152.075.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 152.105 COMPLIANCE WITH THIS CHAPTER.
   To secure compliance with the requirements of this chapter, violations
thereof shall be subject to the enforcement provisions set forth under §
152.106. Additionally, compliance with the requirements set forth in the local
zoning ordinances (
Chapter 157) is also necessary. Compliance with all applicable ordinances of
the town as well as with applicable State of Indiana statues and regulations
shall also be required. Unless otherwise stated, all other specifications
referred to in this chapter shall be the most recent edition available.
   (A)   Definitions.
      COMPLIANCE. The act of correcting a violation or violations within the
time frame specified by the town.
      OFFENSE. Both a violation and a failure of compliance on a particular
project constitute an OFFENSE. If there are multiple violations or multiple
failures of compliance on the same project, each shall be considered a separate
offense as further stated in §
152.106(C).
      VIOLATION. Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of this
chapter, the requirements of an approved basic drainage design plan or permit,
and/or the requirements of a recorded stormwater maintenance agreement may be
subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this subchapter. Any such action
or inaction is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive
or other equitable relief, in addition to and separate from the imposition of
any of the enforcement actions described below.
   (B)   Warning notice. When the town finds that any person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued
hereunder, the town may serve upon that person a written warning notice,
specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting
the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution
whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of
the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the alleged
violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of
the warning notice. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
town to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement
action, without first issuing a warning notice.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.106 ENFORCEMENT OF THIS CHAPTER.
   (A)   Notice of violation/citation.
      (1)   If the town determines that an applicant or other responsible
person has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a permit, an
approved stormwater management design plan, a recorded stormwater management
maintenance agreement, or the provisions of this chapter, it shall issue a
written notice of violation to such applicant or other responsible person and
the owner of the property. Where a person is engaged in activity covered by
this chapter without having first secured a permit therefor, the notice of
violation shall be served on the owner or the responsible person in charge of
the activity being conducted on the site.
      (2)   The notice of violation can be in the form of a citation ticket
and/or a written letter and shall contain detailed inspection findings,
disposition of warning or fines assessed, stipulated remedial actions as
discussed with the responsible party representative, reasonable deadlines for
those remedial actions, and the date of re-inspection.
   (B)   Compensatory action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties,
and remedies authorized by this chapter, the town may impose upon a violator,
alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at
compliance workshops, creek cleanup, public education, and the like.
   (C)   Civil penalties for violations.
      (1)   Any person who commits an offense under this chapter commits a
civil infraction subject to a fine not to exceed $2,500 for each offense, plus
costs, damages, and expenses. Each day such violation occurs or continues
without a compliance action that is satisfactory to the town may be deemed a
separate offense and shall make the violator liable for the imposition of a
fine for each day. The rights and remedies provided for in this section are
cumulative and in addition to any other remedies provided by law. An admission
or determination of responsibility shall not exempt the offender from
compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   Any person who aids or abets a person in a violation of this
chapter shall be subject to the penalties provided in this subchapter.
      (3)   The town has established an Enforcement Response Schedule as noted
in the table below that standardizes the approach that the town may, in its
discretion, employ in dealing with stormwater regulations offenses subject to
this chapter and the associated Technical Standards document. When so employed,
this Schedule shall apply separately to each offense in the following manner:
The first offense is the underlying violation itself, while the subsequent
offenses 2 thru 8 (as necessary) are failures of compliance.
OFFENSE # TYPE OF RESPONSE ANTICIPATED
OFFENSE #   TYPE OF RESPONSE ANTICIPATED
1st offense Verbal telephone notice, letter of violation or written warning and
            administrative penalty
2nd offense Letter of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit
3rd offense Letter of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit
4th offense Letter of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit
5th offense Agreed order, administrative penalty and/or site visit
6th offense Administrative order, administrative penalty and/or site visit
7th offense Compliance schedule, administrative penalty and/or site visit
8th offense Litigation and administrative penalty
 
      (4)   Likewise, in order to standardize the approach that the town may,
in its discretion, employ in the imposition of administrative penalties, the
town has established the following Schedule of Administrative Penalties. Again,
the penalty for the first offense would apply to the violation itself, while
the subsequent penalties 2 through 4 (as necessary) would apply to failures of
compliance. In its discretion, the town may impose penalties up to the amount
specified in this Schedule.
 
OFFENSE #   PENALTY
1st offense $250
2nd offense $500
3rd offense $1,000
4th offense $2,500
 
   (D)   Stop work order.
      (1)   In addition to the penalties listed above, if land disturbance
activities are conducted contrary to the provisions of this chapter or accepted
final stormwater management plans, the town may order the work stopped by
notice in writing served on any person engaged in the doing or causing of such
work to be done, and any such persons shall forthwith stop such work until
authorized by the town to proceed with the work. A stop work order will be
posted on the site by the town and it is unlawful for any person to remove the
notice or continue any work on the site without permission from the town. The
town may also undertake or cause to be undertaken, any necessary or advisable
protective measures to prevent violations of this chapter or to avoid or reduce
the effects of noncompliance herewith. The cost of any such protective measures
shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property upon which the work is
being done and the responsibility of any person carrying out or participating
in the work.
      (2)   The town may bring an action under I.C. 34-28-5-1(b), to be read
together with I.C. 34-6-2-86(1)(B) and 13-21-3-12(4), and/or other applicable
law, to enforce a stop work order against any person who neglects or fails to
comply with a stop work order.
      (3)   For construction projects that are operating under a SWPPP approved
by the town, if a stop work order is issued on the grounds that the erosion and
sediment control measures included in the construction plan are not adequate,
the project site owner must be notified in writing of the inadequacies in the
erosion and sediment control measures and the project site owner has 72 hours
after receiving written notice to resolve the identified inadequacies before
the stop work order can take effect.
      (4)   The 72-hour period to resolve identified inadequacies on a
construction project does not apply if the stop work order is issued to a
construction project where the project site owner is creating a public health
hazard or safety hazard.
   (E)   Withhold certificate of occupancy. The town may refuse to issue a
certificate of occupancy for the building or other improvements constructed or
being constructed on the site until the applicant or other responsible person
has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has
otherwise satisfied the requirements of this ordinance as determined by the
town.
   (F)   Suspension, revocation, or modification of permits. The town may
suspend, revoke, or modify any existing permit that the violator may also have
been previously granted. A suspended, revoked, or modified permit may be
reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the
remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured
the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated upon
such conditions as the town may deem necessary to enable the applicant or other
responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such
violations.
   (G)   Suspension of access to the stormwater drainage system.
      (1)   Emergency cease and desist orders.
         (a)   When the town finds that any person has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or
that the person’s past violations are likely to recur, and that the person’s
violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened
discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to
present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or to the environment, the town may issue an order to the violator
directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing
the violator to immediately comply with all ordinance requirements and take
such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a
continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations
and/or terminating the discharge.
         (b)   Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under
this section shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering
discharge. In the event of a discharger’s failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the emergency order, the town may commence court action
against such person under I.C. 34-28-5-1(b), to be read together with I.C. 34-
6-2-86(1)(B) and 13-21-3-12(4), to enforce a stop work order.
         (c)   The town may allow the person to recommence its discharge when
it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the town that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated
against the discharger under this ordinance. A person that is responsible, in
whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall
submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful
discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the town
within five days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency
cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the violator.
      (2)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The
town may, without prior notice, suspend stormwater drainage system discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
stormwater drainage system or waters of the state if the violator fails to
comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the town may take such
steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the stormwater
drainage system or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to persons.
      (3)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the stormwater drainage system in violation of this chapter may
have their stormwater drainage system access terminated if such termination
would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The town will notify a violator of
the proposed termination of its stormwater drainage system access. The violator
may petition the town for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an
offense if the person reinstates stormwater drainage system access to premises
terminated pursuant to this subchapter, without the prior approval of the town.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.107 COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION.
   (A)   In addition to any other remedies, should any owner fail to comply
with the provisions of this chapter, the town may, after giving notice and
opportunity for compliance, have the necessary work done, and the owner shall
be required to promptly reimburse the town for all costs of such work.
   (B)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the town from taking such other
lawful action as may be necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. All costs
connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. Costs
include, but are not limited to, repairs to the stormwater drainage system made
necessary by the violation, as well as those penalties levied by the EPA or
IDEM for violation of the town’s NPDES permit, administrative costs, attorney
fees, court costs, and other costs and expenses associated with the enforcement
of this chapter, including sampling and monitoring expenses.
   (C)   If the amount due for abatement of the violation is not paid within a
timely manner as determined by the decision of the town or by the expiration of
the time in which to file an appeal, the amount due shall become a special
assessment against the property and constitute a lien against the property, and
the town may commence a court action to recover the costs assessed under I.C.
34-28-5-1(b), to be read together with I.C. 34-6-2-86(1)(B) and 13-21-3-12(4),
and/or other applicable law.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 12-11-2024)
§ 152.108 APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeal of notice of violation. Any person to whom any provision of
this chapter has been applied may appeal in writing, not later than 30 days
after the action or decision being appealed from, to the Stormwater Management
Board the action or decision whereby any such provision was so applied. Such
appeal shall identify the matter being appealed, and the basis for the appeal.

         (a)   Is an amount determined by the Plan Commission to be sufficient
to complete the basic improvements and installations in compliance with the
plat and drainage approval; and
         (b)   Provides surety satisfactory to the Plan Commission.
      (2)   (a)   The subdivider may submit an irrevocable letter of credit
issued by a financial institution acceptable to the Commission on behalf of the
subdivider and securable to the town in an amount equivalent to 100% of the
estimated cost of completion of the uncompleted portion of street and sidewalk
improvements.
         (b)   In the event an irrevocable letter of credit is used, it shall
be written for a minimum period of one year for street improvements other than
sidewalks and two years for sidewalks and a maximum of two years for street
improvements other than sidewalks and three years for sidewalks. Two months
prior to the expiration date of the irrevocable letter of credit, the
Commission shall determine if the street improvements have been completed and
accepted for maintenance and/or acknowledgment of completion by the town or
other units of government having jurisdiction over them, and if they have not
been accepted or acknowledge shall so notify the subdivider of his or her
options which are:
            1.   If the subdivider has not exceeded the allowed maximum two
years for street improvements other than sidewalks and three years for
sidewalks, he or she may have his or her engineer submit a certified report of
percentage of street construction and sidewalk completion yet to be finished
and the dollar amount required to complete the work. This submittal must be
made to the Commission office a minimum of 30 days prior to the expiration date
of the irrevocable letter of credit. The Town Engineer shall make an inspection
to verify said engineer’s certification. Once the Town Engineer gives his or
her written approval the subdivider may submit a new irrevocable letter of
credit a minimum of ten days prior to the expiration date of the one being
replaced. This new irrevocable letter of credit shall not be for a period less
than one year; and
            2.   In the event the subdivider can demonstrate that due to some
unforeseen circumstance or hardship beyond his or her control and not self
created, he or she may request a second and final extension to be granted by
the Planning Commission. At the discretion of the Planning Commission, it may
grant the extension for such period of time it deems adequate, however, not to
exceed one year. In the case of sidewalks, at least one side of each street
must be installed for pedestrian safety and convenience by this time, certified
to by his or her engineer and verified by the Town Engineer.
   (F)   Any money received from the bond or otherwise shall be used only for
making the improvements and installments for which the bond or other proof of
financial responsibility is provided. The improvement or installation must
conform to the standards provided for such improvements or installations by the
town, as well as the subdivision control chapter, drainage approval and street
standards as adopted by the town.
   (G)   (1)   The Plan Commission shall, by rule, prescribe the procedure for
determining whether all basic improvements and installations have been
constructed and completed as required by the subdivision control chapter. The
rule must designate the person or persons responsible for making the
determination.
      (2)   A person desiring the secondary approval of a plat or replat of
land for subdivision shall submit to the Plan Commission the plat of the
proposed subdivision with the required certificates attached.
      (3)   The following certificates shall be affixed to the plat before
recording:
         (a)   By the registered land surveyor to the effect that the plat
represents a survey made by him or her that all monuments shown there on exist,
and that their locations are as shown;
         (b)   By the owner or owners, and any interest holder, a notarized
statement that he or she is the owner of the land, and that the platting of the
subdivision is his or her voluntary act and deed The owner shall declare in
this certificate by description or reference to the plat the purpose of all
rights-of-way, easements and other reservations shown on the plat;
         (c)   By the Plan Commission, fixed with the seal of the Plan
Commission, signed by the President or presiding officer of the Plan
Commission, and attested to by the Secretary of the Plan Commission. The
certificate shall disclose that proper public notice was given, and that a
majority of the members of the Plan Commission concur in its approval;
         (d)   By the presiding officer of the Plan Commission to the County
Recorder that the plat complies with the provisions of this subdivision
chapter;
         (e)   By the President of the Department of Storm Water Management
certifying that a drainage plan has been approved; and
         (f)   By the Town Council President certifying that all road
construction plans conform to the current design standards adopted by the town.
   (H)   Except as provided in division (I) below, a plat or replat of a
subdivision must be recorded within 18 months of primary approval. Upon written
request, the Plan Commission may extend the time limitation for one year. If
the subdivider fails to record, or seek an extension, within this time period,
the approval given by the Plan Commission shall be null and void.
   (I)   (1)   Plats that have been granted primary approval after the adoption
of this chapter may be submitted for secondary approval in sections as deemed
most advantageous by the subdivider with the approval of the Plan Commission.
Additional sections may be submitted for secondary approval without repeating
primary approval if they substantially conform to the geometries of the
original primary plat. The 18-month limit for recording the secondary plat is
automatically renewed with the recording of any section of the approved primary
plat.
      (2)   The plat may be deemed to substantially conform to the primary plat
if the geometries of the secondary plat are substantially the same layout. The
addition, removal or alteration of street patterns, lot sizes and total number
of lots shall result in a re-submission of the plat for primary approval. The
addition or removal of easements to accommodate utilities or drainage shall not
constitute a substantial change in conformity.

0.01 acres of land for each lot on the primary plat.
      (3)   In the case of an apartment development, however, the number of
dwelling units shall be used to determine the required acreage instead of lots.
   (B)   Whenever the Plan Commission considers that any part of the proposed
subdivision is needed in the interest of the town for a park, an open space, a
recreational site, a school site or such other legitimate purpose, the Plan
Commission may require that the subdivider either dedicate said area or convey
said area as directed by the Plan Commission, provided, however, within six
months after the approval of the primary plat:
      (1)   The subdivider of the land to be dedicated or conveyed has been
paid for the full fair market value of said real estate;
      (2)   The subdivider of the real estate to be dedicated or conveyed has
entered into a contract satisfactory to the subdivider, to be paid the fair

§ 156.42 PROOF OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)   If the subdivider elects to install all improvements, including
traffic-control devices, before he or she applies for secondary plat approval
and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Plan Commission that the conditions
of this chapter have been met, and if the secondary plat conforms substantially
to the plat that received primary approval, the subdivider is exempt from the
remaining provisions of this section of the chapter provided, however, that
said application for secondary approval is made within 12 months of primary
plat approval without the granting of extensions. Moreover, if the above
conditions are met, the Plan Commission shall have no other course than to give
secondary plat approval within 30 days after application for secondary
approval.
   (B)   If the subdivider elects to apply for secondary approval prior to the
complete installation of all basic and street improvements that received
primary approval, then in lieu thereof, the subdivider shall file with the Plan
Commission a bond or irrevocable letter of credit guaranteeing that the
improvements will be completed as hereinafter set forth.
      (1)   If the subdivider elects to file a bond with the Commission to
assure completion of all basic and street improvements required by the
Commission, such bond shall:
         (a)   Be securable to the town;
         (b)   Be in an amount determined by the Plan Commission to be
sufficient to complete the improvements required; and
         (c)   Provide surety satisfactory to the Plan Commission.
      (2)   Any funds received from these bonds shall be used by the town only
for the purpose of making the improvements and installations for which the bond
was provided. These proceeds of the bond may be used for these purposes without
appropriation.
      (3)   Such performance bond shall comply with all statutory requirements
and shall be satisfactory to the Commission as to form, sufficiency and manner
of execution. The period within which public improvements must be completed
shall not exceed two years from date of secondary approval. The Plan Commission
may grant an extension of the completion date set forth in such bond for a
maximum period of one additional year, provided that the bond submitted for
this extension period meets all other requirements herein. The Commission may
at any time during the period of such bond accept a substitution of principal
or sureties on the bond as hereinafter provided.
   (C)   (1)   Instead of a bond, the subdivider may submit an irrevocable
letter of credit issued by a financial institution acceptable to the Commission
and securable to the town in an amount equivalent to 100% of the estimated cost
of completion of the uncompleted portion of street and sidewalk improvements.
      (2)   In the event an irrevocable letter of credit is used, it shall be
written for a minimum period of one year for street improvements other than
sidewalks and two years for sidewalks and a maximum of two years for street
improvements other than sidewalks and three years for sidewalks. Two months
prior to the expiration date of the irrevocable letter of credit, the
Commission shall determine if the street and sidewalk improvements have been
completed and accepted for maintenance and/or acknowledgment of completion by
the town, and if they have not been accepted or acknowledged shall so notify
the subdivider of his or her options which are:
         (a)   If the subdivider has not exceeded the allowed maximum two years
for street improvements other than sidewalks and three years for sidewalks, he
or she may have his or her engineer submit a certified report of percentage of
street construction and sidewalk completion yet to be finished and the dollar
amount required to complete the work. This submittal must be made to the
Commission office a minimum of 30 days prior to the expiration date of the
irrevocable letter of credit. The Town Engineer shall make an inspection to
verify said engineer’s certification. Once the Town Engineer gives his or her
written approval the subdivider may submit a new irrevocable letter of credit a
minimum of ten days prior to the expiration date of the one being replaced.
This new irrevocable letter of credit shall not be for a period of not less
than one year, and in the amount as directed by the Town Engineer; and
         (b)   Should the developer not submit a replacement irrevocable letter
of credit in the manner previously described, the town shall secure the funds
pledged by the expiring irrevocable letter of credit.

STATEMENT OF INTENT
§ 157.001 PURPOSE.
   (A)   This chapter is intended to implement the Comprehensive Master Plan
for the town and to promote public health, safety, convenience and general
community well-being by uniformly establishing growth and development standards
which are consistent with community adopted land use and development goals.
   (B)   Specifically, this chapter is designed to protect community character
and enhance the integrity of the town core area of the town, accommodate future
growth and development in ways which minimize traffic congestion; service
delivery and advance community economic and social well-being in a manner
consistent with improving the overall quality of life for residents.
(Ord. 1997-1, § 130.1(A), passed 1-22-1997)
§ 157.002 METHOD OF APPROACH.
   This chapter, consistent with I.C. 36-7-4-601, 600 series, which permits the
adoption of a zoning ordinance to regulate land use in the planning
jurisdiction and to embrace growth and development policies which promote
public health, safety, comfort, morals, convenience and general welfare, allows
the planning jurisdiction to be divided into one or more land use districts or
zoning districts to regulate the manner in which real property is improved,
developed, maintained and used. This chapter defines the land use districts
hereinafter called zoning districts and establishes for each zoning district
standards for development in terms of lot size; arrangement of buildings and
improvements; building size, mass and function; the residential and commercial
use of the property; access requirements; and sets other conditions of
development essential to carry the growth and development policies adopted in
the Comprehensive Land Use Plan and to provide suitable and uniform procedures
for securing development approvals throughout the planning jurisdiction.
(Ord. 1997-1, § 130.1(B), passed 1-22-1997)
§ 157.003 OFFICE ZONING MAP.
   In order to delimit zoning district boundaries this chapter provides for an
official zoning map to be made an integral part of this chapter by reference.
(Ord. 1997-1, § 130.1(C), passed 1-22-1997)
§ 157.004 SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT CONDITIONS.
   In order to accommodate special or unusual development conditions and
problems, or unique geographic, physical, natural or built environmental
circumstances, this chapter identifies “overlay” zones in which special
development approval procedures must be followed.
(Ord. 1997-1, § 130.1(D), passed 1-22-1997; Ord. 2001-14, passed 8-22-2001)
§ 157.005 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   This chapter also provides for development of large tracts of undeveloped
land with development approval procedures which encourage flexible site design,
building arrangements, development phasing and use but which are consistent and
complimentary to overall development standards for the community.
(Ord. 1997-1, § 130.1(E), passed 1-22-1997)
§ 157.006 DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL PROCEDURES.
   This chapter sets forth the procedures for seeking development approval and
establishes procedures for public notification and development petition review.
(Ord. 1997-1, § 130.1(F), passed 1-22-1997)
§ 157.007 ENFORCEMENT ROLES AND PROCEDURES.
   This chapter is intended to establish the roles and responsibilities for the
enforcement, alteration, amendment and development review procedures to be
followed by the Town Planning Commission, the Town Advisory Board of Zoning
Appeals, any professional staff positions, and by any advisory bodies
established under this chapter for the purposes of implementing one or more
sections of this chapter.

157.039(E));
         (b)   Except for one and two-family dwellings and associated accessory

(Ord. 1997-1, § 130.2(P), passed 1-22-1997; Ord. 2001-14, passed 8-22-2001)
§ 157.050 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   (A)   Generally. A conditional use is a use of property, structure or
building within a zoning district other than a principally permitted use, which
is expressly permitted by the chapter. Conditional uses are generally
considered undesirable or incompatible uses, therefore necessitating special or
additional regulations than would otherwise be required in a specific zoning
district.
   (B)   Conditional use versus variances.
      (1)   An application for a variance seeks permission to do something
which is not in conformance with the zoning chapter. A variance is an
overriding of the legislative judgment, justified by the existence of either an
unnecessary hardship or a practical difficulty in physically or practically
meeting the exact terms or specifications of the zoning chapter.
      (2)   In contrast, an applicant for a conditional use does not seek to
“vary” the chapter. The permission he or she seeks is one permitted by the
chapter, but with special conditions attached to ensure protection of the
health, safety and welfare of the neighborhood and the general public.
      (3)   Accordingly, while the applicant for a variance must show both an
unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty and consistency with the public
interest, a conditional use petition generally involves only the latter issue.
   (C)   Authority to grant. The authority to review plans and grant
conditional use permits shall rest with the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (D)   Types of conditional use exceptions. Land uses which create safety,
traffic, noise or other undesirable problems, and therefore require conditional
use permits include:
      (1)   Uses deemed necessary for the convenience of the community’s
residents which require special deliberation as to locale because of their
inherent tendency to create noise, traffic or density problems;
      (2)   Uses which are necessary but incompatible uses within a specific
zoning district; and
      (3)   Uses customarily sited in residential zones but which, because they
attract great numbers of people, require special deliberation regarding
conditions that must be attached to their permitted use and due consideration
of their effect upon neighboring property owners.
   (E)   Factors of consideration. Before granting a conditional use permit,
the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider the following factors.
      (1)   Concept of highest and best use. If there are other valid reasons
for denying a conditional use permit, the denial may be sustained even if the
proposed use is the highest and best use which can be made of the land in
question. While a conditional use permit is not generally utilized as a relief
from hardship, the impact and financial consequences may properly be considered
by the Board.
      (2)   Traffic congestion. Evidence that a proposed use will create a
traffic hazard, undue congestion or some other severe or adverse impact on area
traffic may justify denial of a conditional use permit.
      (3)   Public convenience and welfare. The Board of Zoning Appeals must
consider regulations provided in the zoning chapter, including those necessary
to protect the public health, safety, welfare and convenience. The applicant
must show that the proposed uses will not be offensive to the community health,
safety, welfare or convenience. On the other hand, evidence that a particular
service is needed may indicate that the permit is reasonably necessary for the
public convenience.
      (4)   Public safety. A conditional use permit may be denied if the
proposed use would violate any specific health or safety regulations.
      (5)   Regulation of competitive uses. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall
not deny a permit solely for the purpose of limiting the number of similar
businesses in an area. However, the Board may invoke reasonable minimum
distances between similar businesses for some legitimate reasons such as safety
or traffic.
      (6)   Effect on neighboring property values. The intended use shall not
cause a depreciation of value of adjacent property. In fact, such a finding may
support the conclusion that the permit will conflict with the public interest.
Future development of a given area should also be considered.
      (7)   Impact on Comprehensive Development Plan. The issuance or the
denial of a conditional use permit may have a direct and significant effect
upon the community’s planning scheme. This impact should not be of an adverse
nature.
      (8)   Checklist of development standards. The basic checklist of
development standards that may receive special consideration includes, but is
not limited to, the following items; which are general criteria to which
specific standards may be applied by the Board of Zoning Appeals: ingress and
egress to the site and to structures; parking and loading facilities; refuse
and other service areas; utility services and facilities; appropriate screening
and buffering; yards and open space; health and safety standards; and
compatibility with surrounding uses.
      (9)   Environmental impact statement. The Board of Zoning Appeals may
require the applicant for a conditional use to perform an environmental impact
study of the area in which the use is proposed. This condition may especially
be applied to such examples as confined feed lots, mining or mineral
extraction, landfills, stock yards, sewage treatment plants, chemical
manufacturing and the like. An environmental impact study shall, if required,
be conducted to meet the accepted standards of federal regulatory bodies such
as FHWA (Federal Highway Administration).
      (10)   Legitimate conditional use. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall
review the particular facts and circumstances of each application and determine
through findings of fact that the proposed use is a appropriate conditional use
as established under the provisions of this chapter.
   (F)   Conditional permit. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the
authority to impose specific conditions on any conditional use permit. A
conditional use permit may be denied where the applicant fails to comply with
specific conditions made a part of the permit by the Board, or fails to comply
with a reasonable request of the Board for furnishing specific information
related to the proposed use.
   (G)   Filing and notification requirements. Filing and notification
requirements for a conditional use are the same as prescribed for variances in
§
157.051.
   (H)   Public hearing. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public
hearing within a reasonable length of time after receipt of an application for
a conditional use from the applicant. However, the public hearing shall not be
held sooner than ten days after its receipt.
   (I)   Board action and findings.
      (1)   Either at the public hearing or within a reasonable length of time
thereafter, the Board shall either approve, conditionally approve or disapprove
the request. The Board shall further make a finding that the reasons set forth
in the application are justifiable and that the development and zoning
standards proposed are in conformance with the requirements and intent of the
zoning chapter.
      (2)   No conditional use shall be granted by the Board except at a
regular meeting thereof. Before granting a conditional use the Board shall make
a determination in writing of its findings for each application. Such findings
shall be based upon the Board’s review of the factors of consideration listed
in division (E) above.
(Ord. 1997-1, § 130.2(Q), passed 1-22-1997)
§ 157.051 VARIANCE.
   (A)   A person desiring a variance from the requirements of this section
must file a petition with the Board of Zoning Appeals describing the property
that is the subject of variance, the type of variance required, the facts
pertinent to the variance desired, and a site plan as defined in §
157.039(E).
   (B)   Following notice to adjoining property owners and the public hearing
on the variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals must either grant or deny the
petition. No variance may be granted except on a finding of all the following
factors:
      (1)   The approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety,
morals and general welfare of the community, nor will it adversely effect the
adopted Comprehensive Plan;
      (2)   The use and value of the area adjacent to the property included in
variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse manner;
      (3)   The strict application of the terms of the zoning chapter will
result in practical difficulties in the use of the property;
      (4)   The variance is not a variance of the use of the property; and
      (5)   The need for the variance is not created by the applicant.
   (C)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not grant a variance from a use
district or classification. The grant of a variance is by resolution of the
Board of Zoning Appeals and is not an amendment of this chapter.
   (D)   The Board may incorporate into the granting of a variance whatever
conditions or limitations are necessary to protect adjacent properties and the
surrounding neighborhood and effectuate the purpose of this chapter.
   (E)   Any variance granted by the Board shall expire 12 months after the
Board's granting of the variance unless a permit based upon and incorporating
the variance is issued prior to the expiration of the 12-month period. The
Board may extend the aforementioned 12-month period as the Board may determine
is appropriate, provided good cause is shown. An extension of time pursuant to
this division may be requested in the original application for variance or in a
subsequent application after the grant of the variance but before its
expiration.
   (F)   An improvement location permit that takes into account one or more
approved variances may only be issued in conformance with the site plan that
was submitted with the petition for variance.

following restrictions.
   (A)   Conditional use permit required. All installations of satellite
antennas dishes (herein “dish”) shall be considered extraordinary structures;
and may only be installed upon obtaining a conditional use permit and a
building permit prior to commencing installation.
   (B)   Permit issuance criteria; residential districts. No conditional use
permit or building permit shall be granted for a satellite dish in Districts
A1, R1, R2, R3 and R4, unless:
      (1)   All installations shall exhibit architectural quality; coloration
to blend with surroundings and structural integrity. Experimental or temporary
installations, inferior materials and questionable stability are not permitted.
In every case, the entire installation shall be compatible with the character
of the surrounding area of the town and shall have no adverse impact on the
property, the neighborhood or general public. Permanent foundations shall be
adequate for anticipated wind loads. Electrical connections shall be low
voltage direct, except where the device connected is Underwriter’s Laboratory
approved, in which case alternating current will be allowed to code
requirements. Consideration shall be given to protection of children as in the
case of an attractive nuisance;
      (2)   The smallest practical size shall be used for any dish. Such dish
shall be of a size no greater than eight feet in its maximum dimension. Any
such dish shall be mounted as close to the ground as possible, and shall not
raise from the ground in excess of ten feet in height at its maximum point.
Elevated installations on poles or roofs are prohibited;
      (3)   The construction and installation of a satellite dish shall
strictly conform to all town ordinances. Once the dish is installed, it shall
be maintained and the condition of the dish shall not be allowed to deteriorate
or fall into disrepair;
      (4)   The applicant demonstrates that the proposed location is such that
during all seasons, no part of the dish structure will be visible to the
general public from a point that is between the ground level and ten feet above
ground level on surrounding property. This provision is satisfied by the
installation of a screen for the dish at the time of installation;
      (5)   No more than one such satellite dish may be installed on a single
zoning lot;
      (6)   In every case, the installation shall be located in the rear yard.
The location shall not be in the required setback areas, unless encroachment in
the required side or rear setback areas provides an acceptable location if
otherwise conformity with all of the other provisions of this section. In such
case, a variation is required, and the applicant shall file a petition with the
Board of Zoning Appeals; and
      (7)   In the event that compliance with this section prevents the
reception of satellite signals by satellite receiver antennas, a variance from
this section may be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (C)   Conditional use permit issuance; nonresidential districts. No
conditional use permit or building permit shall be granted for satellite dishes
in a nonresidential district unless:
      (1)   The applicant demonstrates that the intended use is authorized
under applicable federal law;
      (2)   The smallest practical size shall be used for any dish. Such dish
shall be of a size no greater than eight feet in its maximum dimension. Any
such dish to be mounted on a rooftop shall be reviewed by a licensed engineer
or architect. No installation shall exceed the height of any existing structure
on the building or surrounding buildings; provided that the overall height of
the satellite dish does not exceed 35 feet from ground to the top of the
antenna. Elevated installations on poles are prohibited. Any such dish shall be
mounted as close to the ground or roof as possible and shall not be more than
ten feet in height from the ground or roof to its highest point;
      (3)   The construction and installation of a satellite dish shall
strictly conform to all town ordinances. Once the dish is installed, it shall
be maintained and the condition of the dish shall not be allowed to deteriorate
or fall into disrepair;
      (4)   The applicant demonstrates that the proposed location is such that
during all seasons, no part of the dish structure will be visible to the
general public from a point that is between the ground level and ten feet above
ground level on surrounding property. This provision is satisfied by the
installation of a screen for the dish at the time of installation. For purpose
of rooftop installations, no part of the dish structure shall be visible from
the ground;
      (5)   No more than one such satellite dish may be installed on a single
zoning lot;
      (6)   Where nonresidential property abuts residential property, it must
comply with the location requirements of division (B)(4) above on the abutting
side;
      (7)   All installations shall exhibit architectural quality; coloration
to blend with surroundings, and structural integrity. Experimental or temporary
installations, inferior materials and questionable stability are not permitted.
In every case, the entire installation, including coniferous plantings, shall
be compatible with the character of the surrounding area of the town and shall
have no adverse impact on the property, the neighborhood or general public.
Permanent foundations shall be adequate for anticipated wind loads. Electrical
connections shall be low voltage direct, except where the device connected is
Underwriter’s Laboratory approved, in which case alternating current will be
allowed to code requirements. Consideration shall be given to protection of
children as in the case of an attractive nuisance; and
      (8)   In the event that compliance with this section prevents the
reception of satellite signals by satellite receiver antennas, a variance from
this section may be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (D)   Procedure.
      (1)   An application for a conditional use permit for installation of a
satellite dish shall be obtained from the office of the Administrator. The
Administrator may approve the application if it meets the requirements of this
chapter.
      (2)   Where a variation, pursuant to division (B)(7) above or this
chapter is requested or required, the application shall be submitted to the
Board of Zoning Appeals for review and final decision.
   (E)   Application. In all requests for conditional use permits, the
application shall include all items generally required for the actions sought
(i.e., applicable fees, conditional use permit, building permit, zoning
variation and the like), plus the following:
      (1)   Plot plan showing proposed location and dish projection at extremes
of the satellite band to be viewed. This requirement will be satisfied by
drawing radial lines from a point representing the pivot point of the dish to
each end of the satellite band, then drawing a line perpendicular to each
radial at a distance scaled to the distance between the rim of the dish to the
pivot point. Each perpendicular line shall be scaled to the diameter of the
dish to show its maximum protection on the plan at the extremes of its
satellite scan. Compass directions will be adequate for this requirement;
      (2)   Plans and specifications for the installation, including
elevations, dish configurations, mount and foundation;
      (3)   Complete description of any vegetation on the property;
      (4)   Landscape plan for screening the installation from street view; and
      (5)   Location of principal structures on adjacent lots.
   (F)   Roof and other antennas.
      (1)   Roof mounted TV antennas are permitted in all districts, subject to
the following restrictions.
         (a)   Number. The number of antennas permitted per principal structure
shall conform to the following:
            1.   One antenna per single-household detached dwelling;
            2.   One antenna per individually serviced single-household
attached or duplex dwelling;
            3.   One antenna per multi-household building;
            4.   One antenna per commercial use, whether freestanding or part
of a multi-use building; and
            5.   The number of antennas per conditional use shall be controlled
by conditional use permit.
         (b)   Dimension. The maximum dimension, whether height, length or
diameter, of any antenna shall not exceed ten feet.
         (c)   Mounting. No antenna shall be mounted on the roof at the front
of the house.
         (d)   Other. Any TV antenna which does not meet the requirements
division (F)(1)(a) through (F)(1)(c) above, shall be considered a conditional
use. In considering the granting of this conditional use the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall find that, in addition to all other standards for conditional
uses, the rooftop television antenna will be located so as to minimize its
visibility from other properties.
      (2)   Amateur radio facilities: antennas and support structures for
amateur radio operators which are licensed by the Federal Communications
Commission may be allowed, subject to particular zoning district regulations,
provided that such antennas, whether mounted on a rooftop or on the ground,
shall not extend more than 20 feet above the maximum height for permitted uses
in the district.

§ 157.070 HOME OCCUPATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to permit the
establishment of home occupations that are compatible with the residential
districts in which they are located.
   (B)   Definition. For the purpose of this section, the following definition
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      HOME OCCUPATION. An accessory use of a dwelling unit which is:
         (a)   Used for gainful employment that involves the assembly,
processing or sale of goods and/or services; and is
         (b)   Incidental and secondary to the residential use of the structure
and does not change the essential residential character of the dwelling unit;
and
         (c)   Does not include garage/yard sales or home parties that are held
for the sale of goods or services whose number of sales events exceeds four a
year.
   (C)   General requirements and performance criteria. All home occupations
shall comply with the following standards.
      (1)   The entrepreneur of every home occupation shall reside in the
dwelling unit in which the business operates.
      (2)   The use shall be conducted entirely within a completely enclosed
structure.
      (3)   The home occupation shall not interfere with the delivery of
utilities or other services to the area.
      (4)   The activity shall not generate any noise, vibrations, smoke, dust,
odor, heat, glare or electrical interference with radio or television
transmission in the area that would exceed that which is normally produced by a
dwelling unit in a zoning district used solely for residential purposes.
      (5)   No toxic, explosive, flammable, radioactive or other restricted
materials shall be used, sold or stored on the site.
      (6)   There shall be no alteration of the residential appearance of the
premises, including the creation of a separate or exclusive business entrance
(s) or use of signage to identify the business beyond that expressly allowed in
residential districts.
      (7)   No more than five people at one time shall avail themselves of the
service provided by the home occupation use at a given dwelling unit; or no
more than 12 people shall avail themselves of the provided service during a 24-
hour period.
      (8)   No clients/pupils shall be permitted between the hours of 10:00
p.m. and 7:00 a.m.
      (9)   No visible outdoor display or storage of materials, goods supplies
or equipment shall be allowed.
      (10)   The home occupation shall, at all times, comply with all other
applicable laws and ordinances.
      (11)   The home occupation shall not cause a significant increase in the
amount of traffic or parking on the particular residential street.
      (12)   The total area used for such home occupations shall take up no
more than 15%, or 300 square feet (whichever is greater), of the structure it
occupies. In no case shall a parking space within a garage be used to fulfill
this area allowance.
   (D)   Permitted home occupations. The following uses, because of their low-
impact nature, and because they do not detract from the residential character
of a neighborhood, provided they comply with the limitations set forth herein,
are permitted subject to the general requirements and performance criteria
specified in divisions (B) and (C) above.
      (1)   Attorney, CPA, salesperson, architect/landscape architect, interior
designer, graphic artist, dog grooming, word processor and consultant for the
purpose of preparing documents and drawings, and doing business by phone only;
      (2)   Artist studios, provided no retail business is conducted on the
premises;
      (3)   Child and adult day care homes provided that they comply with all
applicable home occupation regulations. However, child day care homes which do
not comply with these home occupation regulations may be allowed in zoning
districts where they are listed as special uses and are approved pursuant to
the procedures set forth by the Board of Zoning Appeals;
      (4)   Mail or telephone businesses, for receipt of mail orders only.
Business must be conducted entirely by mail and/or telephone;

      (7)   One chair barber or beauty shop; and
      (8)   Other uses with impacts similar to those listed in this section as
determined by the Zoning Administrator.
   (E)   Prohibited home occupations. Certain uses have a demonstrated tendency
to impair the uses and value of a residential district because of their
tendency to expand beyond the limits permitted for home occupations. For this
reason, the following uses, regardless of their compliance with the standards
in divisions (B) and (C) above are prohibited as home occupations:
      (1)   Any repair or rental shop operating on or from the premises such as
repair or painting of autos, trailers, boats and other equipment repair or

NONCONFORMANCE
§ 157.085 NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this provision is to provide for the short
term maintenance of uses which do not conform to the provisions of this chapter
and which were lawful at the time this chapter was adopted. The purpose is also
to provide for the gradual elimination of nonconforming uses to uses which
conform to the provisions of this chapter in order to accomplish the objectives
of the chapter without undue burden to a single property owner.
   (B)   Exception for repairs pursuant to public order. In order to accomplish
the objectives of the chapter without posing any hazard to the public or
occupants of buildings and structures, nothing in this section shall be deemed
to prevent the strengthening or restoration of an unsafe structure. If any
public official charged with protecting the public safety finds that a
nonconforming structure or sign is unsafe in its then present condition, repair
or restoration in violation of the provisions of this section may occur.
   (C)   Classification of types of nonconforming uses. In order to limit the
burden of converting a nonconforming use to a conforming use, the town has
adopted different regulations for different classes of nonconforming uses. The
classes of nonconforming uses are as follows.
      (1)   Class 1. A Class 1 nonconforming use is the use of a building or
structure which is specifically designed for the nonconforming use, and which
requires substantial modification in order to accommodate a conforming use.
      (2)   Class 2. A Class 2 nonconforming use is a use of a building or
structure which is designed to accommodate uses which conform to the
requirements of this chapter, and which could accommodate a conforming use
without any substantial modification.
      (3)   Class 3. A Class 3 nonconforming use is a use of a building or
structure which is not conforming as to bulk, height, required yard, floor area
ratio or setback.
      (4)   Class 4. A nonconforming use of land not involving a building or
structure.
   (D)   General regulations.
      (1)   Improvements underground or at ground level. Non-accessory
improvements which are underground or substantially underground and which have
a current market value in excess of $5,000 and which comprise substantially all
the improvements enjoyed in nonconforming use of land shall be deemed
nonconforming structures and subject to the applicable provisions of this
section.
      (2)   Nonconforming use of land accessory to the nonconforming use of a
building and structure. The nonconforming use of land which is accessory to the
nonconforming use of a building or structure may be continued for such time as
the nonconforming use of the building or structure is permitted under the
provisions of this section.
      (3)   Relocation of building or structure. No building or structure shall
be moved in whole or in part to any other location on the same or any other lot
unless every portion of such building or structure which is moved and the use
made thereof is made to conform to all of the regulations of the district in
which it is to be located.
      (4)   Restoration of buildings.
         (a)   A nonconforming building, except one identified by Town Council
action as being of historic significance, which is destroyed or damaged by fire
or other casualty or act of God may be restored only if the cost of
reconstruction to a condition in which it was prior to the casualty does not
exceed 50% of the replacement cost of the entire building and providing no
restoration or reconstruction shall be undertaken unless it is started within
one year from the date of notice by the Zoning Administrator of this provision
or the date of partial destruction which ever is later and completed within 24
months from the date of partial destruction.
         (b)   The time and cost limitations set forth herein shall not apply
to any single-family dwelling located in a residential district providing
reconstruction of the dwelling begins within one year from the date of partial
destruction and is thereafter diligently pursued. A nonconforming building,
identified by Town Council action as being of historic significance may be
restored in conformance with these provisions without respect to cost or
replacement cost.
      (5)   Accessory buildings. The requirements for nonconforming uses of
nonconforming buildings, structures or uses shall apply to all accessory
buildings, structures or buildings located on the same zoning lot.
      (6)   Burden of establishing nonconforming use.
         (a)   The burden of establishing any legal nonconforming use is to be
met by the owner or party seeking to continue the use, or any person applying
for a zoning certificate.
         (b)   Such persons shall provide sufficient proof in a form acceptable
to the Zoning Administrator of the following:
            1.   Date of construction of the building or structure or date the
use was established (proof may consist of a certified copy of a business
license or building permit);
            2.   Continuous operation of the nonconforming use (proof may
consist of affidavits signed by persons having personal knowledge of the use of
the premises since the use was established); and
            3.   Such other proof as may be deemed necessary by the Zoning
Administrator.
      (7)   Discontinuance of abandoned nonconforming use. Except as otherwise
provided herein, the voluntary abandonment of any nonconforming use of a
building, structure or premises for a period longer than six months shall
terminate any rights conferred by this section to continue such use.
      (8)   Expansion of nonconforming use within a building.
         (a)   Class 1 and Class 3 nonconforming uses of a portion of a
building may be expanded throughout the building in which they are located but
no changes or structural alterations shall be permitted which would increase
the bulk of such building or structure unless such changes conform to all the
provisions of the zoning district in which such building is located.
         (b)   Expansion of any Class 2 nonconforming use of any building or
structure into any portion of the building in which it is not located shall not
be permitted.
      (9)   Change in nonconforming use.
         (a)   1.   Class 1 nonconforming uses may be changed to another
nonconforming use which is not permitted in the district providing that such
use is not permitted in a more restrictive district than the district in which
the existing nonconforming use is permitted.
            2.   Such change shall be permitted only after it has been reviewed
by the Board of Zoning Appeals and approved as a special use. The jurisdiction
over such change, the review of proposals and approval standards and procedures
shall be the same as those which are applied for special uses, however the
proposed changed use need not be specifically listed as special uses in the
district in which they are sought.
         (b)   Class 2 and Class 3 nonconforming uses shall not be changed to
another nonconforming use.
         (c)   No Class 4 nonconforming uses may be expanded, or extended
beyond the area they occupy.
      (10)   Extension of time. The Town Council, after receiving
recommendations from the Board of Zoning Appeals, and after such Board has
conducted a public hearing, may extend the time period for any break in a
nonconforming use for an additional six months.
      (11)   Nonconforming parking and landscaping. When a proposed or
completed repair, change in use, expansion of use or change in structure result
in nonconforming parking or landscaping, any person interested in the use or
structure may petition for a waiver of any portion or all of the landscaping or
parking requirement resulting from such change or proposed change. The
procedures governing such waiver and decision making authority with respect to
such waiver shall be the same as for minor variations. Such waivers shall be
granted only when they are in the interest of the town, or when conformance
with the parking and landscaping requirements pose some practical difficulty or
particular hardship. In determining whether there is a hardship, the
Administrator shall balance the cost of conformance against the detriment which
may result from granting the waiver. Conditions or restrictions may be imposed
by the Administrator at the time any waiver is granted. If the change is a
proposed one, the waiver shall be applied for at the time of application for an
improvement permit. If change has been completed the property agent shall have
30 days from occupancy or use to apply for a waiver.
   (E)   Nonconforming use of lots of record.
      (1)   Erection of new residences in residential districts, where
permitted shall be permitted where both the lot width and total lot area each
are at least 80% of that which is required, and where at least 80% of any
required lot area for each dwelling is provided.
      (2)   The erection of new single-family dwellings on nonconforming lots
is subject to the following additional regulations.
         (a)   The lot area shall be no less than 80% of the required lot area.
         (b)   The dwelling shall be placed on the lot so as to provide a yard
on each side of the dwelling such that the sum of the widths of the two side
yards shall be not less than the minimum required, or the greater of the
following: 20% of the width of the lot or three feet.
      (3)   The erection of new structures or buildings in nonresidential
districts, shall be permitted on nonconforming lots of record if such proposed
structure meets all of the requirements of the district in which it is sought
to be located except for lot area.
      (4)   Structures and buildings on nonconforming lots in existence at the
time this chapter was adopted may be maintained as nonconforming uses subject
to the general provisions of this section.
   (F)   Special regulations for pre-code non conforming buildings, structures
and uses. Not withstanding the other provisions of this chapter the following
additional provisions shall apply to pre-code uses.
      (1)   Pre-code uses shall be those uses which were established prior to
April 1, 1931.
      (2)   Class 1 and Class 3 pre-code uses may be continued subject to the
following restrictions.
         (a)   No repairs structural alterations or additions may be made to a
Class 1 building which would increase the bulk of the building.
         (b)   No increase in the bulk of a Class 3 pre-code use is permitted
unless such increase in bulk conforms to the provisions of this chapter.
         (c)   Class 2 pre-code uses may be continued subject to the following:
repairs, additions or alterations and structural changes may be made to a
nonconforming pre-code building or structure provided that said repairs,
alterations or structural regulations conform to the regulations of the
district in which such building is located.
   (G)   Nonconforming signs.

awning is unsafe or insecure, or is a menace to the public, he or she shall
given written notice to the person displaying such sign correction of the
condition which causes the Administrator to give such notice shall be effected
within ten days after receipt of the notice.
         (b)   If such condition is not corrected after such ten-day period,
the Administrator is authorized to cause the sign to be removed forthwith at
the expense of the person displaying the sign.
         (c)   Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Administrator is
authorized to cause any sign, retractable canopy or awning to be removed
summarily and without notice whenever he or she finds that such a sign, canopy

§ 157.086 RESTORATION OF A DWELLING USED FOR A SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENCE ON A
NONCONFORMING LOT.
   (A)   A dwelling used as a single-family residence which is damaged or torn
down, for any reason, and located on any lot which does not conform to the
zoning chapter, may be restored or replaced in conformance with this section.
This section does not apply to any lot where a business use of the structure
immediately preceded the destruction of the building.
   (B)   Reconstruction of such dwelling, if it was complete torn down, shall
meet the setback requirements required for residential lots in the zoning
category where such structure existed if such setbacks can be met, or, if such
setbacks cannot be met, such dwelling shall set back at least ten feet on the
front (or the average setback of any structures located on two adjoining lots),
six feet on each side and ten feet in the rear from the lot line of the lot
where such structure will be replaced. Setback measurements shall occur from
the edge of the roof line, not the exterior wall of the structure. Accessory
structures shall meet the same setback requirement as the principal structure.
   (C)   Restoration of a partially destroyed structure may occur without
reference to the percentage or the value of the structure which may have been
damaged.
   (D)   In no case may a replacement building, constructed pursuant to this
section, occupy more than 60% of the area of the lot upon which it is to be
rebuilt.

   (D)   Conditional use requirements.
      (1)   Use of land classified as a conditional use within this zoning
district shall provide the town with a development impact statement. The
development impact statement is designed to provide the decision-making process
with adequate information relating to the impacts a large scale commercial use
will have on economic, environmental, aesthetic, cultural, residential and
public services within the community.
      (2)   Criteria to be addressed in a development impact statement shall
include the following.
         (a)   Economic statement.
            1.   Projected property tax generation;
            2.   Projected sales tax generation adjusted for economic shift;
            3.   Projected benefits due to expanded customer/consumer service/
product mix to be provided to the community; and
            4.   Impacts on surrounding property values.

            2.   Soils type and classification for agricultural uses and
structural stability;
            3.   Slope, proposed cut and fill;
            4.   Floodplain locations and impact of proposed development;
            5.   Protected water table recharge areas and development impacts;
            6.   Impacts on surrounding land use, quality of life factors
relating to physical, cultural and aesthetic impacts the proposed development

statement of no impact shall include rationale for each of the above criteria.
The statement must outline the center’s use of existing services and how the
redevelopment, reconstruction or expansion of the center will not impact those
existing services.
      (4)   Any application which does not include all of the indicated
materials shall be rejected and returned to the developer.
   (E)   Site plan review.
      (1)   Allowable uses, permitted and conditional, in the C4 District are
deemed to have the potential for adverse impacts if haphazardly located and
laid out on their respective zoning lot. Such impacts may interfere with the
use and enjoyment of adjacent property and uses.
      (2)   Site plan review for commercial districts is required to protect
the local economy, maintain safe traffic conditions, maintain the environment
and assure harmonious land-use relationships between business uses and more
sensitive land-uses in affected areas. Therefore, allowable uses, permitted and
special, shall be subject to site plan review by the town’s Site Review
Advisory Committee.
      (3)   No building permit shall be issued nor structure or building shall
be erected, in any of the commercial districts, nor shall existing buildings be
altered, remodeled or enlarged or extended until the Site Review Advisory
Committee (SRAC) has approved a site development plan as outlined in §
157.039.
      (4)   The SRAC may approve the proposed site development plan with or
without conditions. The SRAC may deny approval of the total site proposal or a
portion thereof if it finds that conditions, standards or purposes of this
section; or other germane sections of the chapter; or the policies of the
official Comprehensive Plan; or the general development policies and specific
site design guidelines of the town have not been complied with.
      (5)   The Site Review Advisory Committee may waive or otherwise grant
relief in the form of minor variations from the standards for bulk and design
controls. MINOR VARIATIONS are defined as variations which allow a variation of
up to 20% of the listed standard for the following cases:
         (a)   The application of a design or impact control would cause an
undue adverse impact on adjoining or nearby property;
         (b)   The application of a particular design standard or control would
cause an unsafe condition; and
         (c)   1.   The granting of any relief from a design standard or
control would enable better overall design and functioning that would not
otherwise be achievable under strict applications of all bulk and design
standards.
            2.   In no instance shall the Site Review Advisory Committee grant
a minor variance in the transitional buffer yard requirements without a public
hearing as per §

OVERLAY DISTRICT
§ 157.165 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   The purpose of the Overlay Districts are to provide for those areas
of town in which special and limiting circumstances occur and to provide for a
mechanism through which development flexibility with respect to use, lighting,
signage, site layout and architectural design and landscaping. The overlay
districts are not intended to supplant or stand instead of underlying district
zoning requirements, except the FP District, but rather to be complementary and
clarifying of zoning requirements.
      (2)   The overlay districts are specially designed to assist in the
implementation of growth and development policies as adopted in the
Comprehensive Plan; to advance community development objectives and to protect
public health and safety.
      (3)   In this subchapter three Overlay Districts are identified as
follows:
         (a)   TC: Town Core Overlay;
         (b)   HC: Highway Corridor Overlay; and
         (c)   FP: Floodplain District Overlay.
   (B)   Boundaries. The boundaries of each overlay district are shown on the
official zoning map overlap districts or the Town Master Plan for the town and
incorporated herein by reference.
(Ord. 1997-1, § 130.9(A), passed 1-22-1997)
§ 157.166 TC TOWN CORE OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose statement.
      (1)   The designation of the TC Town Core Overlay District in the Town
Master Plan is intended to protect the architectural integrity and community
character of the older historic business district and the adjacent residential
neighborhoods. While the area encompassed by the TC District includes many
historically significant structures and many designated in the National
Register of Historic Places, it is not per se intended to be a historic
district. Rather the TC District is intended to conserve the architectural and
geographic context of downtown and ensure the continued viability of town core
businesses and to ensure that residential neighborhoods are not adversely
impacted by inappropriate development, commercial traffic or by haphazard
unplanned growth.
      (2)   The TC District recognizes the following facts, special conditions
and circumstances:
         (a)   The town core area is a mixed use area consisting of small scale
business activities and a variety of residence type dwelling units;
         (b)   Few vacant or undeveloped parcels of land currently exist in the
town core area; few new structures can be built except for demolition of
existing structures with subsequent new construction;
         (c)   Most properties either residential or commercial, cannot meet
the lot size requirements or other provisions of this zoning chapter;
         (d)   Because the town core is largely comprised of the pre-code
buildings (before 1931) the existing building stock is old, with building
materials and architectural characteristics which provide a uniformly unique
and distinguished character to the town core area. This characteristic cannot
be easily replicated and would normally not occur with rebuilding or new
construction;
         (e)   Many businesses now occupy structures designed for residential
use and this adaptive re-use of these residential buildings is likely to
continue; and
         (f)   Because of the unique topographic relationship to the Ohio
River, the area encompassed by the TC District has outstanding river views.
   (B)   Objectives. Based upon the preceding special conditions and unique
characteristics, the TC District is intended to accomplish the following
objectives:
      (1)   Conserve, protect and enhance the architectural integrity of the
district;
      (2)   Permit sensitive and compatible adaptive re-use of existing
buildings;
      (3)   Ensure that new buildings and new construction is suited to the
existing architectural context in terms of scale, building mass, exterior
building materials and site arrangement;
      (4)   Preserve diverse residential opportunities within the town core;
      (5)   Enhance property values;
      (6)   Protect riverfront access and maintain river views;
      (7)   Encourage consistency in treatment of exterior building appearance
through common signage, lighting and landscaping standards throughout the
district;
      (8)   Stimulate reinvestment and new investment in existing structures;
and
      (9)   Foster community wide pride and recognition of the town core area
as a unique community resource.
   (C)   Designation. The official zoning map designates the TC District. The
boundaries of this district may be altered from time to time through action by
Town Council under procedures for zoning chapter amendments.
      (1)   General procedures.
         (a)   All structural and use alterations within the TC District shall
require a certificate of appropriateness unless excepted herein.
         (b)   Exterior changes and alterations shall be reviewed by the Site
Review Advisory Committee and a report forwarded to the Plan Commission for
action.
      (2)   Specific actions requiring review and certification of
appropriateness. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, it shall be
unlawful for any person, to:
         (a)   Construct, reconstruct, alter, move or demolish all or part of a
building or principal structure within the TC District without a certificate of
appropriateness;
         (b)   Alter or change the use of a building originally constructed for
residential purposes in the TC District without obtaining a certificate of
appropriateness by the Administrator;

installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
      RECREATION VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
         (a)   Built on a single chassis;
         (b)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projections;
         (c)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
         (d)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as
temporary living quarters for recreational camping, travel or seasonal use.
      REGULATORY FLOOD. The flood having a 1% probability of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure which is
acceptable to and approved by the Indiana Natural Resources Commission. The
regulatory flood elevation at any location is as defined in this chapter. The
REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the terms BASE FLOOD.
      SFHA or SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Those lands within the jurisdiction of
the town that are subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of
the town are generally identified as such on the flood insurance rate map of
the town prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated August
2, 2012. The SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated Warrick County that are
within the jurisdiction of the town or that may be annexed into the town are
generally identified as such on the flood insurance rate map prepared for
Warrick County by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated August 2,
2012.
      STRUCTURE. A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed
by walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured home or a prefabricated building. The term also includes
recreational vehicles and travel trailers to be installed on a site for more
than 180 days.
      SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial
damages” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not
include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of state or
local health, sanitary or safety code requirements or any alteration of a
“historic structure”, provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure”.
   (C)   Duties of the Administrator. The Zoning Administrator is appointed to
review all development and subdivision proposals to ensure compliance with this
chapter, including but not limited to the following duties:
      (1)   Ensure that all development activities within the SFHAs of the
jurisdiction of the town meet the requirements of this chapter;
      (2)   Provide information and assistance to citizens upon request about
permit procedures and floodplain construction techniques;

Indiana Natural Resources Commission for all development projects subject to
this chapter, and maintain a record of such authorization (either copy of
actual permit or letter of recommendation);
      (4)   Maintain a record of the “as-built” elevation of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new and/or substantially improved buildings
constructed in the SFHA;
      (5)   Maintain a record of the engineer’s certificate and the “as built”
floodproofed elevation of all buildings subject to this chapter;
      (6)   Cooperate with state and federal floodplain management agencies to

      (8)   Notify adjacent communities and the State Coordinating Office prior
to any alteration of relocation of a watercourse, and submit copies of such
notifications to FEMA.
   (D)   Regulatory flood elevation. This section’s protection standard is the
regulatory flood. The best available regulatory flood data is listed below.
Whenever a party disagrees with the best available data, the party submitting
the detailed engineering study needs to replace existing data with better data
and submit it to the Department of Natural Resources for review and approval.
      (1)   The regulatory flood elevation and floodway limits for the SFHAs of
the Ohio River shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the
flood insurance study of the town dated November 17, 1981 and the corresponding
flood boundary floodway map dated August 2, 2012 and prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory floodway shall be according to the
best data available as provided by the Department of Natural Resources.
      (2)   The regulatory flood elevation for each SFHA delineated as an “AH
Zone” or “AO Zone” shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the flood
insurance rate map of the town.
      (3)   The regulatory flood elevation and floodway limits for each of the
remaining SFHAs delineated as an “A Zone” on the flood insurance rate map of
the town shall be according to the best data available as provided by the
Department of Natural Resources.
      (4)   The regulatory flood elevation and floodway limits for the SFHAs of
those parts of unincorporated Warrick County that are within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the town or that may be annexed into the town
shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance
study of Warrick County dated February 3, 1993 and the corresponding FBFM dated
February 3, 1993 prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (5)   If the SFHA is delineated as “AH Zone” or “AO Zone”, the elevation
(or depth) will be delineated as “Zone A” on the county flood insurance rate
map. If the SFHA is delineated on the county flood insurance rate map, the
regulatory flood elevation and floodway limits shall be according to the best
data available as provided by the Department of Natural Resources.
   (E)   Improvement location permit. No person, firm, corporation or
governmental body not exempted by state law shall commence any “development” in
the SFHA without first obtaining an improvement location permit from the town.
The town shall not issue an improvement location permit if the proposed
“development” does not meet the requirements of this chapter.
      (1)   The application for an improvement location permit shall be
accompanied by the following:
         (a)   A description of the proposed development;
         (b)   Location of the proposed development sufficient to accurately
locate property and structure in relation to existing roads and streams;
         (c)   A legal description of the property site;
         (d)   A site development plan showing existing and proposed structure
locations and existing and proposed land grades; and
         (e)   Elevation of lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed
structures. Elevation should be in National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929
(NGVD).
      (2)   Upon receipt of an application for an improvement location permit,
the Zoning Administration shall determine if the site is located within an
identified floodway or within the floodplain where the limits of the floodway
have not yet been determined.
         (a)   1.   If the site is in an identified floodway the Building
Official shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Department of Natural Resources and
apply for a permit for construction in a floodway.
            2.   Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit from the Natural
Resources Commission is required prior to the issuance of a local building
permit for any excavation, deposit, construction or obstruction activity
located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as
filling, grading, clearing and paving and the like undertaken before the actual
start of construction of the building.
            3.   No action shall be taken by the Building Official until a
permit has been issued by the Natural Resources Commission granting approval
for construction in the floodway. Once a permit has been issued by the Natural
Resources Commission, the town may issue the local improvement location permit,
provided the provisions contained in this chapter have been met. The
improvement location permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit issued
by the Natural Resources Commission.
         (b)   If the site is located in an identified floodway fringe, then
the Building Official may issue the local improvement location permit provided
the provisions contained in this chapter have been met.
         (c)   1.   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits
of the floodway and floodway fringe have not yet been determined (shown as Zone
A on the flood insurance rate map), and the drainage area upstream of the site
is greater than one square mile, the Building Official shall require the
applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and
specifications, to the Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.
            2.   No action shall be taken by the Building Official until either
a permit for construction in the floodway or a letter of recommendation citing
the 100-year flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Department of Natural Resources.
            3.   Once the Building Official has received the proper permit or
letter of recommendation approving the proposed development, an improvement
location permit may be issued provided the conditions of the ILP are not less
restrictive than the conditions received from Natural Resources and the
provisions contained in this chapter have been met.
         (d)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and floodway fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage
area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Zoning
Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis
showing the limits of the floodway, floodway fringe and 100-year elevation for
the site. Upon receipt, the Zoning Administrator may issue the local
improvement location permit, provided the provisions contained in this section
have been met.
   (F)   Preventing increased damages.
      (1)   No development in the SFHA shall create a damaging or potentially
damaging increase in flood heights, velocity or threat to public health and
safety.
      (2)   Within the floodway identified on the flood boundary and floodway
map or the flood insurance rate map, the following standards shall apply.
         (a)   No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in
combination with existing or future similar works, will cause any increase in
the elevation of the regulatory flood; and
         (b)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill
(including levees) the developer, through the town, shall submit a request to
the Federal Emergency Management Agency to revise the regulatory flood data.
      (3)   (a)   Within all SFHAs identified as A Zones (no 100-year flood
elevation and/or floodway/floodway fringe delineation has been provided) the
following standard shall apply.
         (b)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the regulatory flood elevation more than one-tenth of one foot and will not
increase flood damages or potential flood damages.
      (4)   Public health standards in all SFHAs:
         (a)   No development in the SFHA shall include locating or storing
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, pollutants or
other hazardous or toxic materials below the flood protection grade, unless
such materials are stored in a storage tank or floodproofed building
constructed according to the requirements of this section; and
         (b)   New and replacement sanitary sewer lines and on-site waste
disposal systems may be permitted providing all manholes or other above ground
openings located below the FPG are watertight.
   (G)   Protecting buildings.
      (1)   In addition to the damage prevention requirements of this chapter,
all buildings to be located in the SFHA shall be protected from flood damage
below the FPG.
      (2)   This building protection requirement applies to the following
situations:
         (a)   Construction or placement of any new building;
         (b)   Structural alterations to an existing building that increase the
market value of the building by more than 50% (excluding the value of the
land);

proctor test method;
         (b)   The fill should extend at least ten feet beyond the foundation
of the building before sloping below the FPG;
         (c)   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during
flooding by vegetative cover, riprap or bulkheading. If vegetative cover is
used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical;
         (d)   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties; and
         (e)   The lowest floor (see definition of lowest floor in division (B)
above) shall be at or above the FPG.
      (5)   A residential or nonresidential building may be elevated in
accordance with the following:
         (a)   The building or improvements shall be elevated on posts, piers,
columns, extended walls or other types of similar foundation provided:
            1.   Walls of any enclosure below the elevated floor shall be
designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on the walls by
allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters, through providing a minimum of
two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) having a total area of one
square foot for every two square feet of enclosed floor area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one foot
above the enclosed area’s floor; and
            2.   Any enclosure below the elevated floor is used for
nonresidential purposes and building access.
         (b)   The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored and

service facilities may be located below the FPG.
      (6)   Manufactured homes and travel trailers (also called recreational
vehicles) to be installed or substantially improved on a site for more than 180
days must meet one of the following anchoring requirements:
         (a)   The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent
foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse and lateral movement. This requirement applies to all manufactured
homes to be placed on a site;
            1.   Outside a manufactured home park or subdivision;
            2.   In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
            3.   In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision; or
            4.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which
a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as a result of a flood.

type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions); or
         (c)   Meet the requirements for “manufactured homes” in this section.
      (8)   A nonresidential building may be floodproofed to the FPG (in lieu
of elevating) if done in accordance with the following.
         (a)   A registered professional engineer shall certify that the
building has been designed so that below the FPG, the structure and attendant
utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the
regulatory flood. The building design shall take into account flood velocities,
duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic pressures and impacts from debris or ice.
         (b)   Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human
intervention and without an outside source of electricity.
   (G)   Other development requirements.
      (1)   (a)   The Plan Commission shall review all proposed subdivisions to
determine whether the subdivision lies in a flood hazard area as defined
elsewhere by chapter. If the Commission finds the subdivision to be so located,
it shall cause the developer to forward plans and materials to the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.
         (b)   The Commission shall require appropriate changes and
modifications to the plat in order to assure that:
            1.   It is consistent with the need to minimize flood damages;
            2.   All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage;
            3.   Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to
flood hazards; and
            4.   On-site waste disposal systems, if provided, will be so
located and designed to avoid impairment of them or contamination from them
during the occurrence of the regulatory flood.
      (2)   Developers shall record the 100-year flood elevation on all
subdivision plats containing lands identified elsewhere by chapter as within a
flood hazard area prior to submitting the plats for approval by the Plan
Commission.
      (3)   All owners of manufactured home parks or subdivisions located
within the SFHA identified as Zone A on the town’s FHMB or FIRM shall develop
an evacuation plan for those lots located in Zone A and file it with the local
Plan Commission and file it with the appropriate community emergency management
authorities.
   (H)   Variances.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may consider issuing a variance to the
terms and provisions of this chapter provided the applicant demonstrates that:
         (a)   There exists a good and sufficient cause for the requested
variance;
         (b)   The strict application of the terms of this chapter will
constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   The granting of the requested variance will not increase flood
heights, create additional threats to public safety, cause additional public
expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public, or
conflict with existing laws or chapters.
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may issue a variance to the terms and
provisions of this section subject to the following standards and conditions:
         (a)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to
this chapter may be granted;
         (b)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to this chapter will
require a permit from the Indiana Natural Resources Commission;
         (c)   Variances to the building protection standards of this chapter
may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of one-half
acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures construed below the flood protection grade;
         (d)   Variance may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of
any structure individually listed on the Register of Historic Places or the
Indiana State Survey of Historic Architectural, Archaeological and Cultural
Sites, Structures, Districts and Objects;
         (e)   All variances shall give the minimum relief necessary and be
such that the maximum practical flood protection will be given to the proposed
construction; and
         (f)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall issue a written notice to the
recipient of a variance that the proposed construction will be subject to
increased risks to life and property and could require payment of excessive
flood Insurance premiums. Such notice shall be recorded by the property owner
in the office of the Recorder of the county.
   (I)   Disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by
this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of study.
Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this section
does not create any liability on the parry of the town, natural resources or
the state, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter of
any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
   (J)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This section repeals and replaces
other ordinances adopted by the town to fulfill the requirements of the
national flood insurance program. However, this section does not repeal the
original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the program.
Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements,
covenants or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other chapter easements,
covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall take precedence.
   (K)   Separability. The provisions and sections of this section shall be
deemed separable and the invalidity of any portion of this chapter shall not
affect the validity of the remainder.
(Ord. 1997-1, § 130.9(D), passed 1-22-1997) Penalty, see §

under this section promote a harmonious variety of uses; provides for an
economy of shared services and facilities; and is compatible with surrounding
areas fostering the creation of attractive, healthy, efficient and stable
environments for living, shopping or working. PUD regulations are intended to
encourage innovations in land development techniques so that the growing
demands of the community may be met with greater flexibility and variety in
type, design and layout of sites and buildings and by the conservation and more
efficient use of open spaces and other amenities generally enhancing the
quality of life.

OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS
§ 157.180 SCOPE AND APPLICATION.
   (A)   Scope of regulations. The off-street parking and loading provisions of
this subchapter shall apply as follows:
      (1)   For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land
established after the effective date of this subchapter, accessory parking and
loading facilities shall be provided as required in this subchapter;
      (2)   When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises
shall be increased through the addition of dwelling units, gross floor area,
siting capacity or other units of measurement specified herein for required
parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required
herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use and for any
existing deficiency in parking or loading facilities; and
      (3)   Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall
hereafter be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be
provided as required for such new use.
   (B)   Existing parking and loading facilities. Accessory off-street parking
and loading facilities in existence on the effective date of this subchapter
and located on the same lot as the building or use served shall not hereafter
be reduced below, or if already less than, shall not be further reduced below,
the requirements for a similar new building or use under the provisions of this
subchapter.
   (C)   Permissive parking and loading facilities. Nothing in the subchapter
shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off-street parking or
loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings, provided
that all regulations herein governing the location, design and operation of
such facilities are adhered to.
   (D)   Damage or destruction. For any conforming or legally nonconforming
building or use which is in existence on the effective date of this subchapter,
which subsequently thereto is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion
or other cause, and which is reconstructed, reestablished or repaired, off-
street parking or loading facilities need not be provided, except that parking
or loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage
or destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. However, in no case
shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in
excess of those required by this chapter for equivalent new uses or
construction.
   (E)   Submission of plot plan. Any application for a improvement location
permit, or for an occupancy certificate where no improvement location permit is
required, shall include therewith a plot plan, drawn to scale and fully
dimensioned, showing any off-street parking or loading facilities to be
provided in compliance with this chapter.
(Ord. 1997-1, § 130.10(A), passed 1-22-1997)
§ 157.181 OFF-STREET PARKING.
   (A)   General requirements.
      (1)   Parking, requirements for legal nonconforming uses.
         (a)   All legal nonconforming uses in structures of 1,200 square feet
or greater shall be required to provide parking at the rates applicable for the
use as specified in this section.
         (b)   The Zoning Administrator shall confirm whether or not it is
feasible for the owner or developer of such lots to provide all of the required
parking spaces.
         (c)   His or her decision shall be based on the following:
            1.   Whether existing development on the lot leaves inadequate
space for the required parking;
            2.   Whether the development standards set forth in this section,
and elsewhere in the code of ordinances for any new development on the lot
leave inadequate space on the lot to accommodate the required parking;
            3.   Whether the required number of parking spaces are available on
other lots in accordance with this section; and
            4.   Whether additional land can be acquired to expand the lot to
accommodate the required parking.
         (d)   If it is physically impossible to provide such parking the
Zoning Administrator may waive the same or all of the required parking.
      (2)   Location of parking spaces.
         (a)   All parking spaces required to serve buildings or uses erected
or established after the effective date of this subchapter shall be located on
the same zoning lot as the building or use served, except that parking spaces
to serve business, commercial, industrial and office buildings or uses may be
located off lot if within 500 feet of such use if said parking spaces are
located in a business, industrial or office district. If any parcel is located
within 100 feet of, and but for the interpositions of a public street is
contiguous with, a publicly maintained parking lot, the parking spaces in such
lot may be counted to meet the parking space obligations of this subchapter
with the permission of the Plan Commission.
         (b)   Buildings or uses existing on the effective date of this
subchapter which are subsequently altered or enlarged so as to require the
provision of parking spaces under this subchapter, may be served by parking
facilities located on land other than the zoning lot on which the building or
use served is located, provided such facilities are within 500 feet walking
distance of a main entrance to the use served. Owners of property,
nonconforming as to parking, who elect to provide parking and become conforming
may locate such parking on land other than the zoning lot on which the building
or use is located, as allowed in this section.
      (3)   Parking prohibited in required front and corner side yards. Off-
street parking spaces, open to the sky, may be located in any yard except the
required front yard or corner side yard. Enclosed building structures and
carports containing off-street parking shall be subject to all applicable yard
requirements.
      (4)   Control of off-street parking facilities.
         (a)   In cases where parking facilities are permitted on land other
than the zoning lot on which the building or use served is located, such
facilities shall be in the same possession as the zoning lot occupied by the
building or use to which the parking facilities are accessory.
         (b)   Private possession may be either by deed or long-term lease or
contractual arrangement, the term of such lease or contractual arrangement to
be determined by the Zoning Administrator; and such deed or lease shall be
filed with the Zoning Administrator. The deed or lease shall require such owner
or his or her heirs or assigns to maintain the required number of parking
facilities for the duration of the use served or the deed or lease.
      (5)   Size of parking stalls. Except for parallel parking spaces, each
required off-street parking space shall be at least nine feet in width and at
least 17.5 feet in length, exclusive of access drives or aisles, ramps, columns
or office or work areas. Such space shall have a vertical clearance of at least
seven feet, and shall be measured at right angles to the axis of the vehicle.
For parallel parking, the length of the parking space shall be increased to 22
feet. Compact car spaces, with minimum dimensions of eight feet by 16 feet may
be substituted for a portion of the required spaces.
      (6)   Handicapped parking. Any parking area to be used by the general
public shall provide parking spaces designated and located to adequately
accommodate the handicapped, and these shall be clearly marked as such. The
number of handicapped spaces shall conform to the schedule of parking
requirements at §
157.183(B) and shall be located in close proximity to the principal building.
The designation of handicapped parking stalls shall constitute consent by the
property owner to the enforcement of the restriction of such spaces to
handicapped motorists by the town.
      (7)   Access. All off-street parking facilities shall be designed with
appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner which
will least interfere with traffic movement.
      (8)   Collective provision.
         (a)   Off-street parking facilities for separate uses may be provided
collectively if the total number of spaces so provided is not less than 90% of
the separate requirements of each such use and all regulations governing
location of accessory parking spaces in relation to the uses served are adhered
to. Except for the following provisions, no parking space or portion thereof
shall serve, or be counted as a required space for more than one use unless
otherwise authorized by the Zoning Administrator.
         (b)   The Zoning Administrator may authorize a reduction in the total
number of required parking spaces for two or more nonresidential uses jointly
providing off street parking when their respective hours of operation do not
normally overlap. Reduction of joint use parking shall be subject to the
following conditions:
            1.   No more than 50% of the parking spaces required for a building
or use may be supplied by parking facilities required for any other building or
use;
            2.   The number of shared spaces for two or more distinguishable
land uses shall be determined by mutual consent of the parties involved; and
            3.   The property owners involved in the joint use of off-street
parking facilities shall submit a legal agreement approved by the Town Attorney
guaranteeing that the parking spaces shall be maintained so long as the use
requiring parking is in existence or unless the required parking is provided
elsewhere in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter. Such instrument
shall be recorded by the property owner with the (Warrick County Recorder) and
a copy filed with the Zoning Administrator.
      (9)   Fractional space. When determination of the number of off-street
parking spaces required by this subchapter results in a requirement of a
fractional space, that fractional space may be disregarded. Parking spaces
required on an employee basis shall be based on the maximum number of employees
on duty or residing or both, on 90% of the premises at any one time.
      (10)   Utilization. Except as may otherwise be provided for the parking
of trucks in the granting of special uses, required accessory off-street
parking facilities shall be solely for the parking of passenger automobiles of
patrons, occupants or employees of such uses.
      (11)   Design maintenance.
         (a)   Plan. The design of parking lots or areas shall be subject to
the approval of the Zoning Administrator.
         (b)   Character. Accessory parking spaces may be open to the sky, or
enclosed in a building,
         (c)   Surfacing. All open off-street parking areas, shall be surfaced
with a hard surface material.
         (d)   Landscaping and screening. Screening and landscaping of off-
street parking areas shall be provided pursuant to the requirements of §
157.065.
         (e)   Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking
areas shall be designed and equipped to cast light down from the fixture head,
away from residential properties and public streets in such a way as not to
cause glare. However, in no case shall such lighting exceed three footcandles
measured at the lot line.
         (f)   Signs. Accessory signs shall be permitted on parking areas in
accordance with the provisions specified in §§
157.195 through
157.218 .
   (B)   Specific requirements.
      (1)   All off-street parking spaces hereinafter required by this
subchapter, except those required for one- and two-family dwellings, shall be
designed in accordance with one of the formula set forth in the off-street
parking schedule, §
157.183. Off-street parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with the
classes as hereinafter set forth in the off-street parking schedule. Parking
spaces for accessory uses not specifically enumerated within a parking class
shall be assumed to be included in the principal (permitted or special) use
requirement. If, for any reason the classification of any use, for the purpose
of determining the amount of off-street, parking or the number of spaces to be
provided by such use is not readily determinable hereunder, the parking class
of such use shall be established by the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)   The calculation of parking spaces for a given business shall always
include one space for each vehicle owned by the business.
      (3)   When computing required parking spaces, the total number of
required spaces shall be based upon use(s) of the zoning lot or portion
thereof. Therefore, one principal use may actually contain two or more parking
class uses (e.g., retail sales and warehousing).
   (C)   Bicycle parking facilities. Bicycle parking facilities are recommended
to be a stationary bicycle storage rack designed to secure the frame and one of
the wheels of the bicycle where the bicyclist provides only the locking
mechanism.
(Ord. 1997-1, § 130.10(B), passed 1-22-1997)
§ 157.182 OFF-STREET LOADING.
   (A)   Location. All required loading berths shall be located on the same
zoning lot as the use served. All motor vehicle loading berths which abut a
residence district or an intervening alley separating a residence district from
a business or industrial district shall be completely screened therefrom by
building walls or by a uniformly painted, solid fence, wall or door, and/or
according to the provisions of screening loading areas as specified in §
157.065. No permitted or required loading berth shall be located within 30 feet
of the nearest point of intersection of any two streets. No loading berth shall
be located in a required front or side yard where berths would abut a residence
district. Any loading berth located in a required rear yard may be open to the
sky.
   (B)   Size. Unless otherwise specified, a required off-street loading berth
shall be at least 12 feet in width by at least 30 feet in length for short
berths, and 12 feet in width by at least 50 feet in length for long berths
exclusive of aisle and maneuvering space, and shall have a vertical clearance
of at least 15 feet. Maneuvering aprons for short berths shall be at least 35
feet and for long berths shall be at least 60 feet. Access lanes for short
berths shall be 12 feet in width for one-way lanes and 22 feet in width for
two-way lanes. For long berths, access lanes shall be 14 feet in width for one-
way lanes and 24 feet in width for two-way lanes. Space dedicated for access
lanes may also be considered as space for the maneuvering apron.
   (C)   Access. Each required off-street loading berth shall be designed with
appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner which
will least interfere with traffic movement, separated from customer and/or
employee parking, and shall be subject to approval by the Zoning Administrator.
   (D)   Surfacing. All open off-street loading berths shall be surfaced with
bituminous, concrete or an equivalent dust-free surface.
   (E)   Utilization. Space allocated to any off-street loading use shall not,
while so allocated, be used to satisfy the space requirements for any off-
street parking facilities or portions thereof.
   (F)   Central loading. Central loading facilities may be substituted for
loading berths on the individual zoning lots provided the following conditions
are fulfilled:
      (1)   Each zoning lot served shall have direct access to the central
loading area without crossing streets or alleys at-grade;
      (2)   Total off-street loading berths provided shall meet the minimum
requirements herein specified, based on the use of the several types of uses
served. (Area of types of uses may be totaled before computing number of
loading berths);
      (3)   No zoning lot served shall be more than 500 feet removed from the
central loading area; and
      (4)   The tunnel or ramp connecting the central loading area with the
zoning lot served shall be not less than seven feet in width and have a
clearance of not less than seven feet.
   (G)   Minimum facilities. Uses for which off-street loading facilities are
required herein, but which are located in buildings of less floor area than the
minimum prescribed for such required facilities, shall be provided with
adequate receiving facilities, accessible by motor vehicle off any adjacent
alley, service drive or open space on the same zoning lot.

SIGN REGULATIONS
§ 157.195 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)    Signs obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses
for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. The
purpose of this section is to regulate the size, color, illumination, movement,
materials, location, height and condition of all signs placed on private
property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the protection of property
values, the character of the various neighborhoods, the creation of a
convenient, attractive and harmonious community, protection against destruction
of or encroachment on historic convenience to citizens and encouraging economic
development in conformity with the 2001 to 2021 Comprehensive Plan for the Town
of Newburgh, Indiana, Newburgh Historic Preservation Commission Preservation
Guidelines, and Newburgh Downtown Action Plan. This section allows adequate
communication through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality in the
design, location, size and purpose of all signs. This section must be
interpreted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment guarantee of free
speech. If any provision of this section is found by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, such finding must not affect the validity of other
provisions of this section which can be given effect without the invalid
provision.
   (B)   A sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of
identification, protection or directing persons to a use conducted therein must
be deemed to be an integral but accessory and subordinate part of the principal
use of land or building. Therefore, the intent of this section is to establish
limitations on signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to the land,
building or use to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for their
intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interests
identified in division (A) of this section.
   (C)   These regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible
with the use of the property to which they are appurtenant, landscape and
architecture of surrounding buildings, are legible and appropriate to the
activity to which they pertain, are not distracting to motorists, and are
constructed and maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition.
   (D)   These regulations distinguish between portions of the town designed
for primarily vehicular access and portions of the town designed for primarily
pedestrian access.
   (E)   These regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual
communication that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits
of the town. Rather, they are intended to regulate those forms and instances
that are most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set
forth above.
   (F)   These regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may
be created by the installation and display of signs. Rather, they strike an
appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of
visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms
caused by signs.
   (G)   These regulations are not intended to and do not apply to signs
erected, maintained, or otherwise posted, owned, or leased by the State of
Indiana, the United States government, or this town. The inclusion of
"government" in describing some signs does not intend to subject the government
to regulation, but instead helps illuminate the type of sign that falls within
the immunities of the government from this regulation.
   (H)   This section is intended to regulate the design and placement of signs
from the date of adoption of this subchapter in the following circumstances:
      (1)   Where a newly constructed facility includes signs;
      (2)   Where a sign is replaced because of a change of occupancy,
ownership or use;
      (3)   Where a new sign is added to an existing building; and
      (4)   Granting of a special use or expansion of a facility which includes
signs.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 10-13-2021)
§ 157.196 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this Sign Ordinance (codified as §§
157.195 through
157.219), the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly
indicates or requires a different meaning.
   COPY. Any word, number, letter, picture, or emblem that is a feature of the
sign.
   ELECTRONIC MESSAGE SIGN. A sign capable of displaying words, symbols,
figures, or images that can be electronically or mechanically changed by remote
or automatic means.
   FLAG. A geometric shaped cloth, fabric, or lightweight nonridged material
normally fastened to a string which is secured or tethered to a building or
other permanent structure so as to allow movement of the sign caused by
movement in the atmosphere.
   SEASONAL DECORATIONS. Temporary, non-commercial, decorations or displays
erected or displayed only on a seasonal basis.
   SIGN. A name, identification, description, display or illustration, which is
affixed to, painted or represented directly or indirectly upon a building, or
other outdoor surface which directs attention to or is designed or intended to
direct attention to the sign face or to an object, product, place, activity,
person, institution, organization or business. Signs located completely within
an enclosed building, and not exposed to view from a street, must not be
considered a sign. Each display surface of a sign or sign face must be
considered to be a sign.
   TEMPORARY SIGN. A banner, pennant, poster or advertising display constructed
of paper, cloth, canvas, plastic sheet, cardboard, wallboard, plywood or other
like materials and that appears to be intended or is determined by the code
official to be displayed for a limited period of time (rather than permanently
attached to the ground or a structure).
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 10-13-2021; Ord. 2024-09, passed 2-26-2025)

      (9)   Signs which move, or give the appearance of moving, except as
permitted under the provisions of §

inflatable signs, balloons or other air or gas filled fixtures, "garrison" size
flags and all other signs which flutter, undulate, swing, rotate, oscillate or
otherwise move by natural or artificial means. This category does not include
seasonal decorations.
      (10)   Signs off-premises, unless such sign is a temporary sign and is
placed on the property of another property owner and that property owner
consents to display the temporary sign.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 10-13-2021; Ord. 2024-09, passed 2-26-2025)
§ 157.198 AUTHORIZED SIGNS.
   The following signs are authorized pursuant to §
157.197(A)(1) in every district and shall not require a permit when erected,
maintained, or posted pursuant to the provisions of this §
157.198 and any other regulation under this code:
   (A)   Government signs.
      (1)   Although these regulations do not apply to signs erected,
maintained or posted by the State of Indiana, United States Government, or this
town, these regulations clarify that government signs are allowed in every
zoning district which form the expression of this government when erected and
maintained and include the signs described and regulated in the following
divisions when erected and maintained pursuant to law.
         (a)   Traffic control devices on private or public property must be
erected and maintained to comply with the Indiana Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices.
         (b)   Each property owner must mark their property using numerals that
identify the address of the property so that public safety departments can
easily identify the address from the public street. Where required under this
code or other law the identification must be on the curb and may be on the
principal building on the property. The size and location of the identifying
numerals and letters if any must be proportional to the size of the building
and the distance from the street to the building and in no case larger than one
square foot in area. In cases where the building is not located within view of
the public street, the identifier must be located on the mailbox or other
suitable device such that it is visible from the street.
         (c)   Where a federal, state or local law requires a property owner to
post a sign on the owner's property to warn of a danger or to prohibit access
to the property either generally or specifically, the owner must comply with
the federal, state or local law to exercise that authority by posting a sign on
the property. If the federal, state, or local regulation describes the form and
dimensions of the sign, the property owner must comply with those requirements;
otherwise, when not defined, the sign shall be no larger than two square feet
and located in a place on the property to provide access to the notice that is
required to be made.
         (d)   Official notices or advertisements posted or displayed by or
under the direction of any public or court officer in the performance of
official or directed duties; provided however, that all such signs must be
removed by the property owner no more than ten days after their purpose has
been accomplished or as otherwise required by law.
         (e)   Directional or instructional signs accessory to parking and
driveway areas when erected pursuant to §
72.21.
         (f)   Signs which direct or guide persons to facilities intended to
serve the public, including signs identifying rest rooms, public telephones,
walkways and similar facilities. Advertising material is not permitted on such
signs. This category does not include signs accessory to parking or driveway
areas; and
         (g)   Off-premises "wayfinding signs" that are part of a continuous
system of signs coordinated with and approved by the town for the purpose of
directing vehicular and pedestrian traffic to key civic, cultural, visitor and
recreational attractions and destinations.
         (h)   The Town of Newburgh has historically allowed non-profit
organizations, as defined by Section 501 (c) of the Internal Revenue Code, to
place temporary signs in the public right-of- way at the southeast corner of
State Street and Jennings Street for purposes of advertising events located in
Warrick County, Indiana that promote the Town of Newburgh or fundraise for an
organization that promotes the Town of Newburgh. The Town of Newburgh believes
that those signs form the expression of the Town of Newburgh and are not
subject to the regulations of this code regarding off-premises signs, temporary
signs, or signs in the public right-of-way. The Town of Newburgh may continue
to erect and maintain a temporary sign in the public right-of-way at the
southeast corner of Jennings Street and State Street, for the purpose of
advertising an event located within Warrick County, Indiana that promotes the
Town of Newburgh or fundraises for an organization that promotes the Town of
Newburgh.
      (2)   The signs described in the proceeding divisions are an important
component of measures necessary to protect the public safety and serve the
compelling governmental interest of protecting traffic safety, serving the
requirements of emergency response and protecting property rights or the rights
of persons on property.
   (B)   Flags.
      (1)   Residential and historic sign districts. In a residential sign
district or historic sign district, two flags and one flag pole per premises.
Each flag may not exceed 30 square feet in area. The flag pole may be a maximum
of 25 feet in height or no higher than the highest point of the principal
building's roof, whichever is lower. Flag poles must meet the minimum yard
setback requirements for a principal building.
      (2)   Nonresidential zoning districts. In a nonresidential zoning
district one flag per 25 feet of frontage on a right-of-way up to a maximum of
six flags and six flag poles per premises. Each flag may not exceed 96 square
feet in area. Flag poles may be a maximum of 50 feet in height or no higher
than the highest point of the nearest principal building's roof on the
premises, whichever is lower. Flag poles must meet the minimum yard setback
requirements for a principal building or a minimum of ten feet whichever is
more restrictive.
      (3)   Small flags at vehicle sales and service establishments. One small
flag of no more than one square foot in area may be attached to vehicles on
display for sale or rent at vehicle sales and service establishments. Such flag
must be no higher than two feet above the height of the vehicle as if it were
displayed at grade level.
   (C)   Sandwich board or A-frame signs and signs on easels. Sandwich board,
A-frame sign or sign on an easel that is erected or displayed pursuant to
requirements set forth in meet the requirements of as provided for in §
157.207.
   (D)   Temporary signs. Temporary sign that is erected or displayed pursuant
to requirements set forth in §
157.208.
   (E)   Notices placed on bulletin boards maintained by town government.
   (F)   Signs not in an enclosed building and not exposed to view from a
street or public right-of- way, public place or other property such as those
not visible to a person from a public right-of-way, public place or other
property.
   (G)   Seasonal decorations. In all sign districts, seasonal decorations may
be displayed, provided that such decorations are maintained so as to not
constitute a fire hazard or safety hazard.
   (H)   For purposes of this §
157.198 the lessor of a property is considered the property owner as to the
property the lessor holds a right to use exclusive of others (or the sole right
to occupy). If there are multiple lessors of a property then each lessor must
have the same rights and duties as the property owner as to the property the
lessor leases and has the sole right to occupy and the size of the property
must be deemed to be the propelty that the lessor has the sole right to occupy
under the lease.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 10-13-2021)
§ 157.199 SIGN DISTRICTS.
   For the purposes of this subchapter, the town is divided into three sign
districts: residential, nonresidential and historic.
   (A)   Those properties zoned residential within the zoning regulations are
designated as residential sign districts.
   (B)   Those properties zoned commercial and office within the zoning
regulations are designated as nonresidential sign districts.
   (C)   All properties located within a Town Historic Preservation District
are designated as historic sign districts.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 10-13-2021)
§ 157.200 PERMITS.
   (A)   Sign permits required.
      (1)   From, and after, the effective date of this subchapter, no person
may erect, alter or relocate any wall sign, ground sign, permanent window sign,
canopy, awning or mural in the town without first obtaining a permit from the
Zoning Administrator and paying the required fee.
      (2)   Routine maintenance or changing of parts of a sign shall not be
considered as an alteration of a sign, provided that the maintenance or change
of parts does not alter the surface area, height or otherwise make the sign
nonconforming.
   (B)   Electrical code. In addition to complying with the provisions of this
subchapter, all signs in which electrical wiring and connections are to be used
shall be subject to the provisions of the electrical code of the town.
   (C)   Permit applications. Applications for sign permits shall be obtained
from the Zoning Administrator.
   (D)   Issuance of permits. Upon the filing of an application for a sign
permit, the Zoning Administrator shall examine the plans, specifications and
other data submitted, and may, if deemed necessary, inspect the premises upon
which the proposed sign is to be erected; and if it appears that the proposed
sign is in compliance with all the requirements of this subchapter and in
conformity with the zoning regulations and all other applicable ordinances and
codes of the town; and if the appropriate permit fee has been paid, the Zoning
Administrator shall issue a permit for the proposed sign. If the work
authorized under a sign permit has not been completed within six months after
the date of issuance, the permit shall become null and void.
   (E)   Permit fees. With each application for a sign permit, a fee shall be
paid as designated by the town. If an electrical permit is required, an
additional fee shall be paid for the cost of the electrical permit.
   (F)   Revocation. All rights and privileges acquired under the provisions of
this subchapter are mere licenses, revocable at any time by the Zoning
Administrator. All permits issued pursuant to this section are subject to this
provision.
   (G)   Failure to obtain permit. Any person who erects, alters or moves a
permanent sign after the effective date of this subchapter without obtaining a
permit, as required by this section (if applicable), shall be subject to a
penalty for violation of this subchapter.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 10-13-2021)
§ 157.201 HISTORIC DISTRICTS.
   (A)   The enhancement and improvement of the town historic districts is in
the best interest of the town, its residents and commercial business owners. An
improved appearance of buildings in historic districts will not only enhance
the appearance of the historic districts but adjacent areas as well, thereby
helping to foster the economic vitality of the town as a whole. This section is
intended to complement the Preservation Guidelines for Newburgh Historic
Districts. All regulations and restrictions of the Town Historic Preservation
Commission pertaining to signage within the historic preservation districts are
applicable to this subchapter. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, in the event
of a conflict between this subchapter and the Historic District Guidelines, the
more restrictive requirements will apply.
   (B)   (1)   In addition to all required permits, any sign within a Historic
Preservation District requires approval of the Historic Preservation Commission
in accordance with preservation guidelines.
      (2)   Specific sign restrictions within a Historic District include but
are not limited to the following.
         (a)   New signage should be unobtrusive, relating to rather than
obscuring the design elements of the building or site.
         (b)   Sign material should complement those found on the related
building, or that are common within the district. Metal, stone or painted wood
signs are generally most appropriate.
         (c)   Commercial signage that advertises a business or service should
be simple in design, preferably identifying only the name, purpose and address
on a sign structure sized for reasonable legibility.
         (d)   Ground signs should be mounted low to the ground to avoid
blocking the pedestrian's view. Signs mounted on low, landscaped bases may also
be appropriate.
         (e)   Accent lighting used to illuminate signs should be installed in
a manner that minimizes visibility of the light fixture and does not result in
glare. External illumination should be from the top down not from the bottom
up.
         (f)   Sandwich board or A-frame signs and signs on easels as described
in this subchapter are appropriate and add to the overall character of the
historic districts.
         (g)   Fabric awnings on commercial buildings are preferred over metal
or wood in most cases.
         (h)   Internally illuminated signs are prohibited, except to the
extent permitted as follows:
            1.   Reverse lit channel letter signs are permitted for
commercially zoned non historic properties located within an expansion historic
district. For purposes of this division, REVERSE LIT CHANNEL LETTER SIGNS,
generally referred to as halo-lit channel letters, shall mean metal faced signs
that are backlit with white LED lighting so as to allow illumination from the
back of the sign. More specific specifications for acceptable reverse lit
channel letter signs may be approved by the Plan Commission without need for
further amending this section.
         (i)   Plastic signs are prohibited.

§ 157.208 TEMPORARY SIGNS.
   It is the intent of this code to limit the aesthetic impact of signs on
properties to prevent clutter and protect streetscapes thereby preserving
property values and protecting traffic safety without inhibiting the rights
afforded to its citizens by the First Amendment. The accumulation of signs
adversely affects these goals, property values and public safety. Accordingly,
a person exercising the right to place temporary signs on a property as
described in division (A) of this section must adhere to the regulations set
forth in division (B) of this section.
   (A)   Authorized temporary signs. Temporary signs are authorized as follows:
      (1)   A property owner may place four temporary signs on the property at
any time. Such sign may not be illuminated and may not exceed four square feet
in surface area.
      (2)   Additional temporary signs may be located on a property 60 days
prior to an election involving candidates for a federal, state or local office
that the property owner is eligible to vote for or involves an issue on the
ballot of an election within the district where the property is located.
Additional temporary signs erected pursuant to this subparagraph must be
removed ten days after the election. Such signs may not be illuminated and may
not exceed 16 square feet in surface area in a residential district and the
historic district, and 32 square feet in surface area in a nonresidential
district.
      (3)   One additional temporary sign may be located on a property when the
property is a development site and the owner consents. Such sign may not be
illuminated and may not exceed 16 square feet in surface area in a residential
district and the historic district, and 32 square feet in surface area in a
nonresidential district.
      (4)   One additional temporary sign may be located on a property in the
historic or a nonresidential district if the property is the sight of a new
business for a period of 60 days, not to exceed 30 days after the first day the
business was open to the public. Such signs may not be illuminated and may not
exceed 16 square feet in surface area in the historic district and 32 square
feet in a nonresidential district.
   (B)   Regulation of temporary signs.
      (1)   Number of temporary signs. A person exercising the right to place
temporary signs on a property must limit the number of temporary signs on the
property at any one time to four plus any additional sign listed in division
(A)(2) through (A)(4) of this section.
      (2)   Size limit. The sign face of a temporary sign may not exceed four
square feet unless a larger sign face is authorized by this code.
      (3)   Location requirements. Temporary signs may only be located on
property that is owned by the person whose sign it is, or the property of
another person, with that property owner's express consent.

   (B)   Information on gasoline pumps. Matter appearing on gasoline pumps as
they were purchased or installed shall not be considered as signs for purposes
of this subchapter.
   (C)   Price and service information at pump areas. In addition to all other
signs permitted by this subchapter, an automobile service station may display
one sign, not larger than nine square feet, above each pump island stating
whether the area is a "self service" or "full service" area and the current
price per gallon of the gasoline sold at the station. No element of the cost to
the customer of the gasoline shall be omitted from statement of the price per
gallon.
   (D)   Automobile service station signable area. Service stations which
include interior facilities for the servicing of automobiles or a supplementary
business shall be treated as consisting of two buildings, each with its own
signable area, with the limitation that no more than two signable areas can be
established per building regardless of the number of streets on which the
business has frontage. One of such buildings shall be that part of the service
station structure in which the principal entrance to the station office is
located. The other of such buildings shall be that part of the service station
structure in which the automotive service or supplementary facilities are
located.

directly visible from any surrounding public street or private residence.
   (B)   Any receptacle or device used to provide external illumination for a
wall sign shall not protrude more than 12 inches from the face of the sign.

of an existing permanent sign found to be in violation of any provision of this
subchapter pursuant to inspections made. The notice shall be by certified or
registered mail and shall refer to each section of this subchapter under which
a violation has been found to exist, and the notice shall describe the features
found to be deficient.
   (C)   Effect of notice. Each existing permanent sign which is the subject of
a notice given under this section shall thereupon be classified as a
nonconforming sign subject to §
157.211.
   (D)   Appeals and variances. The owner of a sign with respect to which a
notice has been given under this section may file for an appeal of the
administrative decision of the Zoning Administrator or may file for a variance
in order to retain the sign. Such appeals must be filed not later than 30 days
after the date of the notice.

requirement, decision or determination made under this subchapter by the Zoning

§ 157.214 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   (A)   Certain types of signs shall only be allowed by a special use permit
granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals upon having reviewed and approved of the
characteristics of the proposed signs. Such special use permits are required
because these categories of signs are of such a nature that their construction
and operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact
upon neighboring properties.
   (B)   The following types of signs will be allowed by conditional use permit
only:
      (1)   Memorial plaques, cornerstones, historical plaques and similar
designations displayed for noncommercial purposes;

criteria by which the Board of Zoning Appeals evaluates the suitability of
proposed signs to be granted by special permit:
      (1)   The proposed location does not block the view of other signs in the
area;
      (2)   The size does not unduly infringe upon the health, safety or
welfare of persons occupying or moving through the surrounding area;
      (3)   The sign does not detract from the "historic fabric" of the town;
and
      (4)   The sign is materially consistent with the objectives of this
subchapter.

hearings shall be the same as that outlined for §

§ 157.215 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.

nonconforming as described in this subchapter shall be removed or brought into
compliance within six months of the effective date of this subchapter.
   (B)   Nonconforming signs that have been in existence for over 20 years
prior to the effective date of this subchapter shall be exempt.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 10-13-2021)
§ 157.216 REMOVAL OF CERTAIN SIGNS.
   (A)   Obsolete signs. Any on-premises sign, retractable canopy or awning,
whether existing on, or erected after the effective date of this subchapter,
which advertises a business no longer being conducted or a product no longer
being sold in or from the premises to which the sign relates shall be taken
down and removed by the owner, agent or person having the beneficial use of the
building, structure or premises upon which such sign is found. Removal shall be
effected within 30 days after written notice from the Zoning Administrator. If
such a sign is not removed after such 30-day period, the Zoning Administrator
is authorized to cause the sign to be removed forthwith. Any expense incidental
thereto shall be paid by the owner, agent or person having the beneficial use
of the building, structure or premises on which such sign is found.
   (B)   Unsafe signs. If the Zoning Administrator finds that any sign, outdoor
advertising sign structure, retractable canopy or awning is unsafe or is a
menace to the public, the Zoning Administrator shall give written notice to the
person delaying such sign. Correction of such condition(s) shall be effected
within 15 days after receipt of the notice. If such condition is not corrected
within 15 days, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to cause the sign to be
removed forthwith at the expense of the person displaying the sign. Such
removal does not require further notice if the sign, canopy or awning is an
immediate peril to persons or property.

§ 157.217 SUBSTITUTION CLAUSE.
   The owner of any sign which is otherwise allowed by this sign subchapter may
substitute non- commercial copy in lieu of any other commercial or non-
commercial copy. This substitution of copy may be made without any additional
approval or permitting. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any
inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over non-commercial speech, or

message. This provision prevails over any more specific provision to the
contrary.
