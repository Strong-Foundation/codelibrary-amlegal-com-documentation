are for organizational purposes only, and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only, and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.

nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is severable.
If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or

liabilities, powers, and rights were transferred.

not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture, or
liability.

VARIANCES AND INTERNAL CONTROL STANDARDS
§ 33.50 MATERIAL VARIANCES, LOSSES, SHORTAGES, THEFTS.
   (A)   Whereas I.C. § 5-11-1-27(j) states: All erroneous or irregular
material variances, losses, shortages, or thefts of political subdivision funds
or property shall be reported immediately to the State Board of Accounts. For
all material variances, losses, shortages, or thefts, the State Board of
Accounts shall:
      (1)   Determine the amount of funds involved and report the amount to the
appropriate government and law enforcement officials;
      (2)   Determine the internal control weakness that contributed to or
caused the condition; and
      (3)   Make written recommendations to the appropriate legislative body or
appropriate official overseeing the internal control system addressing:
         (a)   The method of correcting the condition; and
         (b)   The necessary internal control policies and internal control
procedures that must be modified to prevent a recurrence of the condition.
   (B)   The Indiana State Board of Accounts has ruled that in general, each
political subdivision must develop its own policy on materiality because
irregular variances, losses, shortages, and thefts are as broad and varied as
the political subdivisions in which the incidents occur.
   (C)   The town recognizes that variances, losses, shortages, and thefts may
occur. If such an incident occurs, it is the town policy for the Clerk-
Treasurer or such other employee as becomes aware of the variance, loss,
shortage or theft to report the same to the President of the Town Council, and
to the Clerk-Treasurer, and said incident shall be placed on the agenda for
resolution at the next Town Council meeting.
   (D)   It is hereby ordained that the materiality threshold at which point
the town reports incidents of material variances, losses, shortages, or thefts
to the State Board of Accounts is:
      (1)   A one-time cash loss of at least $500; or
      (2)   A recurring cash loss of at least $500 average per month.
   (E)   All items not reported to the State Board of Accounts shall be
resolved at the Town Council level with appropriate documentation retained by
the Clerk Treasurer.
   (F)   The Town Council will also consider I.C. 5-11-1-27(l), which requires
public officials who have actual knowledge of or reasonable cause to believe
that there has been a misappropriation of public funds to immediately send
written notice of misappropriation to the State Board of Accounts and the
prosecuting attorney.
   (G)   (1)   When irregular variance, loss, shortage, or theft is determined,
pursuant to the town’s policy on materiality, the Clerk-Treasurer must report
the incident to the State Board of Accounts' website, where there is a
notification link, which allows public officials to report via e-mail material
irregular variances, losses, shortages, or thefts. Telephone and in person
reporting is also acceptable.
      (2)   Reports will be followed up with a return e-mail or call to gather
additional information as necessary. All reports of irregular variances,
losses, shortages, or thefts are maintained by the State Board of Accounts.

including but not limited to the major services of the town such as police,
fire, the water, sewer, and storm water utilities, economic development, and
parks;
      (3)   Promotion of government efficiency, accountability, reliability and
transparency; and
      (4)   Promotion of safeguards to reduce the risk of loss due to fraud,
waste, abuse, mismanagement or errors.
   (B)   The town finds that its interrelated and often overlapping objectives
as related to an internal control system are as follows:
      (1)   Operations objectives which involve the ways governmental services
are performed and the performance of those providing governmental services
including by way of example budgeting, purchasing, permitting, cash management
and planning, among others.
      (2)   Reporting objectives which involve the filing of financial and non-
financial information to those inside the government and those outside of the
government including by way of example, filing the annual report, audit and
examination cooperation, filing uniform conflict of interest forms and the
other filings with any governmental agency or official, or information required
to be kept such as an OSHA log and responding to a public records request among
others.
      (3)   Compliance objectives involve the adherence to law and regulations
including by way of example, following guidance documents such as the State

not be in writing unless a written line extension agreement is required under
these rules.
   (B)   Avilla reserves the right to require that all applications for service
be in the name of the property. Owner who shall be responsible for the payment
of all bills. All applications involving the initial establishment of service
to premises not previously serviced, must be made by the property owner. Where
the premises are occupied by a tenant, and without in any manner relieving the
property owner of their responsibility for payment of all bills, Avilla
reserves the right to bill the tenant directly for electric service and require
the tenant to make a suitable advance deposit to secure payment of all
applicable bills.
   (C)   Avilla reserves the right to reject any application, whether written
or otherwise, on account of unpaid charges or any other valid reason authorized
by the current Rates, Rules & Regulations in effect at the time of application.
   (D)   Any individual making application for sewer or water service from the
town shall not be entitled to service until all unpaid charges, fees, and

bills), shall have been paid in full.
(Ord. 1406-6-02, passed 6-18-2002; Am. Ord. 1508-7-11, passed 7-20-2011)
§ 51.23 SERVICE CONTRACTS.
   (A)   Contracts; exception.
      (1)   Contracts for all residential service and non-residential service,
under rate codes SGS and LGS with less than 20 kWD of connected load, shall be
for no definite term, other than what is called for in the rate, unless a line
extension agreement is also involved. Contracts for all other customers shall
be categorized as follows:
         (a)   Standard term (three years or greater);
         (b)   Short term (less than three years) / temporary service;
         (c)   Special contract.
      (2)   An exception will be made for those agencies of government that,
ordinarily, have prospect of using electric service at the premises for three
years or more, but are limited (by statute or by appropriation of funds) to
making regularly recurring short term contracts (such as for not more than one
year, and the like). Where the authority of such governmental agencies is so
limited, contracts may be made for a period of less than three years without
being classified as a short term contract or special contract. Such initial
term, and subsequent renewals, shall be in accordance with the fullest limit
the agency’s authority may allow. Where, however, there is no prospect that an
agency or government will use electric service at the premises three years or
more, the contract will only be made under the conditions of a short term
contract or a special contract.
   (B)   Standard term contract. The initial term shall begin when Avilla first
supplies electricity under the contract, unless some other beginning date is
stated specifically in the contract. At the expiration of the initial term, the
contract thereafter automatically renew for successive terms of one year each
unless one party gives the other party written notice of termination at least
60 days in advance of the termination of the then current term.
   (C)   Short term contract/temporary service.
      (1)   Service for a term less than three years and for temporary service
will be supplied under the conditions of a short term contract, which are:
         (a)   That Avilla has adequate transmission and distribution
facilities available.
         (b)   If any extension of facilities is required, customer shall make
advance deposit of the applicable amount as defined herein.
         (c)   Service bills and the conditions for any such supply will be
according to rate code SGS, LGS, or P.
      (2)   Service to mobile homes, house trailers, mobile field offices,
sales trailers, service trailer, portable tool, and the like shall normally be
considered as temporary in character and nature. Service to such facilities
shall be classified as temporary service and any such rules and regulations
shall apply which, in general, require that the applicant pay the cost of
establishing and disconnecting the service, including construction and
dismantling of service facilities, as well as the cost of energy at the
applicable rate and customer charges.
   (D)   Special contracts.
      (1)   A special contract must be made in case of unusual capacity
requirements or load characteristics, unusual investment required or other
abnormal condition. Such contract terms shall be commensurate with Avilla’s
investment, and like conditions, and shall be subject to the approval of
Avilla.
      (2)   A special contract may be required by Avilla before it will make
line extensions and/or upgrades in situations involving transformers in excess
of 100 KVA single phase (or 300 KVA total) or where unusually large or
expensive switching or control equipment will be required. Additionally,
customers that may have an uncertain or insufficient return on Avilla’s
projected investment may warrant a special contract. Such situations may
include providing electrical supply to welding, x-ray or other apparatus that
may have inherently low load-factor and may require relatively high investment
per unit of capacity.
   (E)   Change of contract term.
      (1)   In the event customer’s use of energy changes from the use
contemplated at the time of malting the contract, so that it is in the interest
of both customer and Avilla to do so, either or both the term of the service
contract may be changed to another term conforming to Avilla’s Rates, Rules &
Regulations, provided all the conditions of initial service contract have been
fulfilled as of the date the change is requested.
      (2)   The effective date of the contract change shall be the date it is
executed, unless another date is stated within the contract.
   (F)   Assignment of contract. The benefit and obligation of any service
contract (except budget billing) shall begin when Avilla commences to supply
electrical service and shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the
respective heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns of the
original parties thereto; provided that no assignment shall be made by customer
without first obtaining Avilla’s prior written consent.
(Ord. 1406-6-02, passed 6-18-2002)
§ 51.24 NEW OR UPGRADED ELECTRIC SERVICE REQUESTS MADE BY CUSTOMERS.
   (A)   Requests by customers.
      (1)   Customer shall, upon request of Avilla, present in writing to
Avilla a list of the devices that are to be served by Avilla’s lines and the
location of the premises to be served. In such request, the customer shall
specify whether they desire service to be installed overhead or underground.
      (2)   Avilla will then inform customer as to the voltage and other
characteristics of the service it will furnish. Where there is a reasonable
prospect that the capital expenditure is warranted, Avilla will extend its
lines and service facilities upon the conditions outlined below, subject to
such regulatory body approval, as may be required.
   (B)   Customers with standard term contracts. A line extension of Avilla’s
service facilities, including changes from single phase to three phase, will be
made at Avilla’s expense if, in the judgment of Avilla, the return on the
investment and the stability and credit of customer justify it, provided
customer will guarantee payment, if required. Such payment guarantee, if
required, shall be specified in the line extension agreement entered into
between customer and Avilla.
   (C)   Customers with short term contracts, temporary service or special
contracts. There shall be a determination of the total cost of the line
extension, excluding metering equipment. Customer shall deposit the total cost
of the line extension with Avilla, in advance of construction. The deposit will
be returned to customer, as a credit on his or her bills for electric service,
in accordance with the terms specified in the line extension agreement entered
into between customer and Avilla.
   (D)   Providing electric service to new customers where lines exist.
      (1)   Additional customers may be connected to existing electrical supply
lines that are in place and functioning at the time a customer applies for
service. In the event that the existing facilities must be replaced or
upgraded, in order to accommodate the electric supply requirements of the new
customer, an extension to serve such additional customers will be treated as a
new line extension.
      (2)   When additional customers are connected within six years of the
completion of a line extension, those that entered into an applicable line
extension Agreement may be entitled to a refund. Any such refund shall be in
proportion to a customer’s respective contributions toward the cost of such
line extension, and may be up to an amount equal to 2 times the estimated
annual revenue from such additional customers, less the cost to serve such
additional customers.
   (E)   Service connection.
      (1)   Avilla will designate the service connection at a point on
customer’s facility that is readily accessible. Such service connection will
generally be the closest point to Avilla’s existing facilities, from which
service wires are to be run without contact of such wires with the building at
another point. Customer’s service entrance conductors shall, if possible,
terminate so that the service supply conductors (service drop) will not cross-
adjacent property, and will not require the use of an extra pole or poles.
      (2)   Service conductors protruding from the service head, for connection
to Avilla’s service drop, should be at least 24 inches for sizes up to No. 4.
Larger sizes should extend a minimum of 36 inches.
   (F)   Installation of underground lines. The decision whether lines shall be
installed “underground” or “overhead” shall be made solely by Avilla, where the
matter rests in Avilla’s discretion. Irregardless of customer’s contribution
towards the total cost, Avilla is not obligated to make any underground
installation that, in the sole judgment of Avilla, cannot be technologically or
economically justified.
   (G)   Clearing and site preparation.
      (1)   All clearing and site preparation shall generally be completed by
Avilla and the cost of such work calculated in the total cost of the line
extension.
      (2)   In certain instances, it may advantage customer to complete some or
all of the vegetation clearing and/or site preparation (including trenching for
underground installations where applicable). Any such arrangements shall be
clearly defined in the line extension agreement including such items as
clearing width, depth/width of trench, site grading, and the like.
   (H)   Service lines installed by customer. Service lines (conductors and
equipment for delivering energy, not to exceed 600 volts, from the electric
supply system to the wiring system of the premises served) may be installed by
a customer subject to Avilla specifications and inspections. Customer must
either submit a satisfactory design or plan to Avilla or reimburse Avilla for
its design or plan before proceeding with any work. Avilla may refuse to
energize such line unless Avilla has the opportunity to adequately inspect the
same. Avilla has no responsibility or liability for any service lines installed
by a customer with respect to any property damage or personal injury directly
or indirectly resulting from such line, notwithstanding an inspection thereof
by Avilla.
   (I)   Extension of customer’s lines beyond the point of supply.
      (1)   All cost of extending customer’s lines beyond the point of supply
on their premises shall be at the expense of customer. It is recognized that in
some instances an industrial, commercial or institutional establishment
operating as an integrated unit, extends to both sides of a street or streets
and would comprise a single area were it not for the intervening street. In
such case, the rule above (with respect to an extension along or across a
public street) shall not apply, provided customer shall have made written
request for and Avilla shall have agreed in writing to supply such premises as
an integrated unit. This exception is not to be construed to permit the
extension of a line between two or more integrated but separate premises, or an
extension of a customer’s line across or along a public street to supply two or
more residential, commercial or other non-industrial premises.
      (2)   In no case will Avilla be responsible for the maintenance or safety
of service lines extended beyond the point of supply regardless of the fact
that they may be located on a public thoroughfare, nor will Avilla assume any
responsibility with respect to obtaining consent of Municipal, County or State
authorities for the construction and location of such lines.
      (3)   Customer shall pay the cost of any special installation necessary
to meet his requirements for service at other than standard voltages, phase or
frequency, or for the supply of closer voltage regulations than is required by
standard practice.
(Ord. 1406-6-02, passed 6-18-2002)
§ 51.25 NEW OR UPGRADED ELECTRIC SERVICE REQUESTS MADE BY DEVELOPERS.
   (A)   Requests by developers.
      (1)   Prior to the start of a developer’s project, the developer shall
make application to Avilla for providing electric service. Preferences, such as
the routing of electric lines, the type of electric line installation desired
(underground and/or overhead), as well as the developer’s schedule should all
be described in the application.
      (2)   Such application shall be reviewed by Avilla to determine if the
type of installation contemplated is consistent with current requirements
described in the rates, terms and conditions. Additionally, Avilla shall
require the developer to execute an appropriate line extension agreement, as to
any and all of the matters set forth herein and including estimates of the
costs the developer is required to cover.
   (B)   Data required of developer.
      (1)   The developer shall furnish Avilla with building plans, site plans,
building layouts, electrical load information, street addresses and other such
data sufficiently in advance for Avilla to meet service requirements and in
sufficient detail to enable Avilla to determine the type, capacity and extent
of the electrical lines to be installed.
      (2)   Additionally, the developer shall propose a reasonable project
schedule, describing the developer’s project starting date and when electric
lines are forecasted to be installed to meet the projected facility
construction schedules.
   (C)   Replacement/upgrades of existing facilities. Where the developer’s
application describes installation of new electric lines and/or where existing
electric lines are required to be replaced (such as replacement of overhead
electric lines with underground electric lines, and the like) or upgraded (such
as the existing electric lines are replaced with electric lines having a
greater electrical capacity rating to provide adequate electrical service to
the developer’s project) the developer shall pay Avilla the difference between
the estimated total cost (as computed by Avilla) and the estimated revenue (as
computed by Avilla) if the projected total cost exceeds revenue.
   (D)   Conversion, replacement and/or upgrades of existing facilities.
      (1)   Where the developer’s application involves the conversion of
existing electric lines (such as replacing overhead lines with underground
lines, and the like) or the replacement of existing electric lines (such as
upgrading from single phase to three phase, and the like) the developer shall
pay the estimated net loss of the affected electric lines. Additionally, the
developer shall pay Avilla the amount that the estimated total cost (as
computed by Avilla) exceeds estimated revenue of such project (as computed by
Avilla).
      (2)   Such conversion, replacements and/or upgrades of existing
facilities shall be within the sole discretion of Avilla to determine,
consistent with sound engineering and economic principles.
   (E)   Payment required in advance of construction. Any payment required to
be made to Avilla by the developer, as described herein and in the line
extension agreement, shall be made in advance of any line extension work

   (G)   Avilla’s work limited to its standards. The utilization of voltages
and configurations for underground installation of electric lines are limited
to those set fort in the most recent issue of Avilla’s Electric Service Meter
Manual. The electric lines and other equipment installed by Avilla and the
manner in which they are installed, shall be in accordance with the most recent
issue of Avilla’s “Construction Standards”. Deviations from such Electric
Service and Meter Manual and such “Construction Standards” may be permitted;
provided, the developer agrees, in advance, to pay the cost thereof and Avilla
has given its prior written consent. Any provision of the Electric Service and
Meter Manual or of the “Construction Standards” of Avilla which is in conflict
with these terms and conditions shall be deemed amended to conform to these
terms and conditions.
   (H)   Connection points determined by Avilla. Avilla reserves the right to
determine the location of all connection points, including, without limitation,
termination and metering points. Avilla shall install the underground electric
lines for the developer’s project from the nearest point of connection with
Avilla’s existing and unaltered primary or secondary service lines to each of
the meter facilities or junction boxes located outside on permanent structures
comprising the developer’s project.
   (I)   Installation of underground lines.
      (1)   The decision whether such lines shall be installed underground or
overhead shall be made solely by Avilla, where the matter rests in Avilla’s
discretion. Irregardless of the developer’s contribution towards the total
cost, Avilla is not obligated to make any underground installation that, in the
sole judgment of Avilla, cannot be technologically or economically justified.
      (2)   With respect to the trench routes reviewed and approved by Avilla,
the developer shall stake all property concerns, permanent structures and all
underground facilities that are located within, or associated with the line
extensions to serve the developer’s project. Additionally, the developer shall
clear trench routes of all debris (including surface and subsurface
obstructions that prevent the use of standard trenching equipment), at least
five feet either side of the easement centerline and to a depth of at least
three feet of where the trench shall be placed and bring the ground to within
four inches of final grade. Any damage to persons or property resulting from
the failure of the developer, or the successors or assigns thereof, to maintain
the clearance or to establish and maintain a grade that will provide for
Avilla’s electric lines to be placed and remain at least three feet below the
ground, shall be assumed and paid for by the developer, or the successors or
assigns thereof.
      (3)   The developer may elect to perform all the trenching and
backfilling required for the installation of underground electric lines. If
constructed in accordance with current Avilla installation standards, the cost
of such trenching and backfilling, as originally estimated by Avilla, shall be
deducted from the estimated total cost (if it was included).
      (4)   The developer shall furnish and install all conduit for those
underground electric lines running from the meter facility or junction box away
from the permanent structure either to the point where all paved patios, pools,
sidewalks, driveways and other paved areas are cleared by at least two feet, or
to such point as Avilla may designate in writing to the developer. The
developer shall be responsible for, and pay the cost of, all trenching and
backfilling that is required to install such conduit, irrespective of the type
of developer’s project involved, and the cost of such trenching and
backfilling. If originally estimated by Avilla, and subsequently included in
the total cost, these costs shall be deducted from the estimated total cost if
adequately performed in accordance with Avilla’s “Construction Standards”.
      (5)   The developer assumes all responsibility for the protection of
landscaping during Avilla’s underground installation of electric lines and for
any replanting or reseeding of the trench routes that may be required as a
result of such installation.
   (J)   Developer to furnish easements. The developer shall furnish, at no
cost to Avilla, all easements and rights-of-way in, over and through private
real estate for the installation of the electric lines to serve developer’s
project. Avilla reserves the right to specify the routes, locations, widths and
conditions of such easements and rights-of-way.
   (K)   Modifications to line installation associated with the developer’s
project. Should the developer make any changes in the originally submitted
plans, or other data, which subsequently necessitate revisions on Avilla’s
part, developer shall pay all additional costs incurred as a result thereof.
Likewise, if Avilla, at the request of the developer, employs nonstandard
methods or equipment not contemplated in the original, or subsequently revised,
total cost estimates, the developer shall pay the difference in cost.
   (L)   Developer’s work subject to Avilla standards. Any work performed by
the developer shall be done in accordance with the most recent issue of
Avilla’s “Construction Standards”, copies of which are on file with and are
available for examination at the Avilla Municipal Electric Department’s main
office. The timely completion of such work by the developer shall be
prerequisite to Avilla’s obligation to perform the work required to render
electric utility service to the developer’s project.

service to the ultimate consumer, and then only upon written permission,
obtained from Avilla, stating the specific use and period of use covered in
each request.
(Ord. 1406-6-02, passed 6-18-2002)
§ 51.30 DEPOSITS AND FEES.
   (A)   Deposit to insure payment of bills; residential customers.
      (1)   A new applicant, applying for residential service, shall not be
required to make the deposit provided for in §
50.01 as a condition of obtaining service provided they can provide proof from
the applicable utility (water, sewer, and/or electric) of no late payments in
the preceding 12 months of previous utility service.
      (2)   All utility deposits of said residential customers shall be
refunded without interest after 12 consecutive months of timely payment.
      (3)   Utility deposits from renters will be refunded without interest
when they move from the premises served by the utility.
      (4)   The town may require a deposit from an existing customer when such
customer has been mailed two consecutive disconnect notices, or three non-
consecutive notices within the preceding 12 months. If services are
disconnected for non-payment, then the customer shall pay all monies owed,
including their current utility bill, disconnect and reconnect fees and a
deposit in order for the customer's utilities to be reconnected. See §§
50.01(E) and
50.02.
      (5)   The term “refunded”, as used herein, shall include the application
of deposits to amounts then due and payable by a customer to Avilla, and such
application shall constitute a lawful disposition of such deposits. Any sum
remaining after the application of any such deposits shall, at the option of
Avilla, either be shown as credit on the customer's account, or paid by check
mailed or delivered to customer within 15 days.
   (B)   Deposit to insure payment of bills; non-residential customers.
      (1)   A non-residential customer may be required at any time, or from
time to time, to make a cash deposit to assure payment of such customer’s final
bill. Such deposit may be required as a condition for obtaining or continuing
service. Deposits taken after the effective date of Avilla rules, shall not
exceed $170 plus one-sixth the estimated annual billings for service to
customer at the address service is rendered.
      (2)   In making a refund of a deposit, Avilla may, at its option, pay the
full amount thereof to customer or apply such deposit to amounts then due and
payable by such customer to Avilla and any deposit balance remaining after such
applicant may be either paid to customer or shown as a credit balance on
customer’s account.

§ 51.31 TITLE TO CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES.
   (A)   Notwithstanding any payments made by a customer or developer to
Avilla, covering the cost of a line extension or other form of system
modification, addition or upgrade partially or fully funded by customer or
developer, the title to such facilities and equipment shall be and remain the
property and responsibility of Avilla. No use, however extended, of Avilla’s
electrical system, or payment of any costs, fees or charges required hereunder
shall create or vest in customer or developer any claim of right, possession,
title, interest or ownership in such facilities. Likewise, customer or
developer shall not be entitled to interest on any amount advanced to assist in
financing such extensions or installations.
   (B)   Nothing in this Rates, Rules & Regulations shall be construed to
compel Avilla to construct, reconstruct, retain, extend, repair, place, replace
or maintain any facility which, in Avilla’s sole discretion, is not needed for
its own purposes. Avilla and its successors and assigns shall have the right to
operate, relocate and maintain its facilities in such a manner as will best
enable it, in its sole discretion, to fulfill its service requirements.
   (C)   No radio, wireless telegraph, wireless telephone or any other
equipment may be connected to Avilla’s lines, poles, cross arms or structures,
except in accordance with the requirements of Avilla and upon written
permission obtained from Avilla for each installation.
   (D)   Avilla will own, install and maintain the necessary distribution
transformers unless otherwise expressly provided for.
(Ord. 1406-6-02, passed 6-18-2002)
§ 51.32 EASEMENTS AND PERMITS; SECURING EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Construction or any line extensions are contingent upon assistance by
the applicant, customer or developer for service in securing the necessary
easements, permission for clearing/site preparation and/or other necessary
permits. Avilla shall be under no obligation to start construction in the event
such easements or permits are not secured at the start of scheduled starting
date for construction.
   (B)   Customer or developer shall obtain, on forms provided by or approved
by Avilla, all necessary easements in, on, over or through private property for
the installation and maintenance of all poles, wires, transformers, conduit, or
other equipment necessary or convenient for supply of service to such customer.
   (C)   Avilla shall have the right to install, construct and operate such
poles, wires, fixtures and other equipment (overhead and underground) on
customer’s or developer’s property and shall have the right to maintain such
poles, wires, fixtures and other equipment including the right to control
vegetation (remove trees, brush and vines, or trim selected trees at Avilla’s
discretion) located on customer’s or developer’s property, as, in Avilla’s
judgment, are reasonably necessary to the installation, operation and
maintenance of such facilities.
   (D)   Customer or developer hereby agrees to indemnify and save Avilla
harmless from any and all claims, including the expenses incurred by Avilla to
defend itself against such claims, resulting from or arising out of the failure
of customer or developer to secure such right, license, permit or easement for
the construction or maintenance of Avilla’s facilities, the loss of right-of-
way or property owner consent, or of the costs of relocating any of Avilla’s
facilities. As applicable, all of the terms of the indemnity set forth in these
Rates, Rules & Regulations are incorporated herein and shall apply with equal
force to the indemnity set forth herein.
(Ord. 1406-6-02, passed 6-18-2002)
§ 51.33 INDEMNIFICATION.
   (A)   Avilla shall not be liable for any interruption of service or damages
to customer’s property caused by customer’s defective wiring, inadequate
grounding or customer’s appliances, devices or equipment located on customer’s
premises. Furthermore, to the extent permitted by law, customer, for itself and
its contractors and subcontractors, hereby releases Avilla, its affiliates, and
their respective employees and agents (collectively, “Indemnities”), from any
and all liability for loss of or damage to the facilities or services of
customer or and for any interruption to, or failure of, the supply of electric
service rendered by Avilla. Customer further hereby agrees to indemnify, hold
harmless, and defend indemnities from and against any and all losses,
liabilities, costs, expenses, suits, actions, claims and all other obligations
and proceedings whatsoever, including, without limitation, all judgments
rendered against, and all fines and penalties imposed upon indemnities, and any
reasonable attorneys’ fees and any other costs of litigation (hereinafter
collectively referred to as “liabilities”) arising, directly or indirectly, out
of the interruption or loss of electric service to customer, or out of injuries
to persons, including disease or death, or damage to property, or in any other
way attributable to or arising either directly or indirectly out of, the
attachment, installation, operation, presence, use, maintenance, or removal of
Avilla’s facilities, except that licensee’s obligation to indemnify indemnities
shall not apply to any liabilities to the extent arising from indemnities’ sole
negligence or willful misconduct. Indemnities shall be free to select counsel
of their choice for their defense hereunder.
   (B)   Where applicable, the conditions of this chapter shall apply, in whole
or in part, to a developer and/or developer’s project.
(Ord. 1406-6-02, passed 6-18-2002)
§ 51.34 ACCESS TO FACILITIES.
   (A)   The properly authorized agents of Avilla shall have the right, at all
reasonable times, to enter upon the premises of customer for the purpose of
installing, meter reading, inspecting, repairing or replacing appliances used
in connection with the supply of service to customer and, upon termination of
the service contract, for the purpose of obtaining a meter reading prior to
physical disconnection and for removal of Avilla’s property.
   (B)   When the character of service requires it, customer shall provide,
free of expense to Avilla, and near the service entrance, a suitable and dry
space or room for the necessary meter, any and all auxiliary apparatus,
distribution transformer or other appliances that may be furnished by Avilla.
Such spaces or rooms shall be kept easily accessible at all times, shall not be
used for storage purposes and shall be kept free of foreign materials of any
nature.
   (C)   Failure of customer to comply with provisions herein shall provide
sufficient cause for Avilla to refuse, withhold or disconnect service to such
customer until compliance therewith has been obtained.
(Ord. 1406-6-02, passed 6-18-2002)
§ 51.35 METERING AND MEASUREMENTS.
   (A)   Meters to be installed by Avilla.
      (1)   All electrical energy, unless specified otherwise, shall be
measured by a meter or meters (which includes all auxiliary and supplemental
measuring instruments) of standard manufacture, installed by Avilla upon
customer’s premises in accordance with Commission Rule 5, as amended from time
to time, and the Meter and Service Rules of Avilla in force at the time of
installation. If the meters or the appliance belonging to Avilla are willfully
tampered with, damaged or destroyed due to negligence or misuse by customer, or
any member of his family, or by any officer, agent or employee of customer,
then the cost of the necessary repair or replacement shall be paid by customer.
Additionally, conditions stipulated under the “Fraudulent or Unauthorized Use
of Electricity” article may apply.
      (2)   Avilla will furnish one main watt-hour meter (including such
auxiliary meters and instruments that may be required to supplement it) to
enable the measurement of and billing for all energy of like character supplied
to customer for each service classification on the same premises. A separate
bill will be rendered for the energy passing through and measured by each
separate metering installation. An exception to the above may be made where
three-phase four-wire supply is available. In such cases three phase and
single-phase energy will be measured and billed through one meter.
      (3)   When, in the judgment of Avilla, it is necessary to furnish more
than one meter for each supply of like character on the same premises, because
of practical conditions of measurements, engineering, safety, legal or other
reasons, Avilla will furnish such additional equipment that it considers
necessary, and will render the bills for such services as if the energy were
supplied through a single meter.
      (4)   When the convenience of Avilla requires more than one watt-hour
meter to be installed in one building or more than one building, on the same
premises for one customer under one contract, the KWH readings of the meters
shall be taken collectively in determining the rate to which customer is
entitled. Under no other conditions shall the KWH readings be taken
collectively. When, in its judgment, it is expedient to do so, Avilla shall
have the right to install at its expense outdoor type “Inverted Sequence”
meters upon the premises of customer.
      (5)   When customer requires, for customer’s own use and convenience,
more than one main watt-hour meter (as described in the preceding paragraph)
for each supply of like character on the same premises, any and all expense of
installation and operation of the added equipment shall be borne entirely by
customer.
      (6)   Avilla reserves the right to seal all meters, metering equipment
and fused or un-fused switches, together with any enclosures, “gutters” or
“raceways” containing un-metered circuits, whether any of such equipment has
been furnished by customer or Avilla; and to keep all of the foregoing sealed
to the exclusion of all other parties.
   (B)   Meter testing and registration.
      (1)   Avilla shall make a test on the accuracy of registration of a
single-phase meter at least every 10 years, or at five year intervals, as
Avilla deems necessary. Three phase commercial network and self- contained
meters shall be tested on a 48-month basis. Three-phase industrial demand and
reactive metering units shall be tested on a 12-month interval.
      (2)   Avilla will test the accuracy of registration of a meter upon
written request of a customer and upon payment of a deposit, as detailed in
Exhibit I. If the meter to be tested is found to be outside limits, the deposit
will be refunded. Customer will be responsible for all costs incurred in the
performance of such tests if customer requires them to be performed outside of
normal working hours.
   (C)   Incorrect registration of meter.
      (1)   Whenever it is discovered that a meter is not registering
correctly, adjustments covering such inaccuracy shall be made in accordance
with Commission Rule 14 (A), as amended from time to time. Any other
determinable billing error, including incorrect rate application, shall be
adjusted to the known dates of error, date of connection of current customer,
or one year, whichever is shorter.
      (2)   If, on test of any meter at the request of customer, a meter is
found to be more than 2% fast, Avilla shall refund to customer an amount equal
to the excess charged for the electricity incorrectly metered, for a period
equal to one-half of the time elapsed since the previous test, but not to
exceed 12 months.
      (3)   If, on test of any meter at the request of customer, a meter is
found to be more than 2% slow, Avilla may charge customer for the electricity
incorrectly metered, for a period equal to one-half of the time elapsed since
the previous test but not to exceed six months. If a meter is found not to
register for any period, Avilla shall estimate the charge for the electricity
used by averaging the amounts registered over corresponding periods in previous
years.
(Ord. 1406-6-02, passed 6-18-2002)
§ 51.36 FRAUDULENT OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OF ELECTRICITY.
   (A)   When it is reasonably determined that fraudulent or unauthorized use
has occurred, Avilla may, subject to any provision of Commission Rule 16 to the
contrary, disconnect service to that customer without notice and Avilla is not
required to reconnect the service until a deposit and all the described
penalties and charges are paid in full. In such instances, a penalty payment
will be required, in the amount equal to six months estimated usage, as well as
a penalty charge, as described in Exhibit I.
   (B)   When Avilla detects fraudulent or unauthorized use of electricity, or
Avilla’s regulation, measuring equipment or other service facilities have been
tampered with, Avilla may reasonably assume that customer or other user has
benefitted by such fraudulent or unauthorized use or tampering. In such
instances, the affected customer is responsible for payment of the reasonable
cost of the service used during the period such fraudulent or unauthorized use
or tampering occurred (or is reasonably assumed to have occurred) and, in
addition, for the cost of field calls and/or effecting repairs necessitated by
such use and/or tampering. Additionally, Avilla shall charge a minimum penalty
fee, as described in Exhibit I, per occurrence for such field calls and
repairs.
   (C)   If, after reasonable investigation, Avilla determines that a customer
has tampered with seals on metering equipment, customer will be fined in
accordance with Exhibit I for the first offense and be subject to disconnection
of service for the second offense. If, after reasonable investigation, Avilla
determines that a licensed electrician has tampered with seals on any metering
equipment without proper notice to Avilla, the electrician will be subject to a
fine, in accordance with Exhibit I, and be subject to Avilla pursuing the
revocation of his/her electrician’s license.
(Ord. 1406-6-02, passed 6-18-2002)
§ 51.37 BILLINGS AND PAYMENT.
   (A)   Billing. Electric service bills, including budget billing, are issued
each month as net bills. The net amount, as indicated on the bill, is due and
payable upon receipt. If payment of the net amount is not received by Avilla or
a duly authorized collection agent within 17 days after the bill is mailed to
customer, the bill is delinquent. The net amount plus the late payment charge,
as described in Exhibit I, then becomes due. If the bill remains unpaid at the
next billing date, a bill with a disconnect notice will be mailed to customer,
requiring payment of the delinquent amount within 14 days of the mailing date.
If such payment is not received by the expiration of such 14-day period,
service is thereafter subject to disconnection. When the due date falls on
Saturday, Sunday or any legal holiday, the first business day thereafter shall
be the due date.
   (B)   Payment. All bill payments must be received in Avilla’s office, or by
a collection agent authorized by Avilla, on or before the stated due dates to
avoid late payment charges and disconnection of service. Failure to receive a
bill shall not entitle customer to the net bill if he fails to make payment
within the initial 17-day period, nor shall it affect the right of Avilla to
discontinue service as provided above. Partial payments and payments on bills
with disconnect notices will not be accepted by banks authorized as collection
agents.
   (C)   Estimated bills.
      (1)   An estimated bill may be issued when an actual meter reading cannot
be obtained for any reasons permitted under Commission Rule 13(1). Any
difference between the estimated bill and customer’s actual usage will be
adjusted in accordance with the next meter reading.
      (2)   If a meter is tampered with or found not to register accurately for
any period, Avilla shall estimate the charges for service used by averaging the
amounts registered on the meter over similar periods, preceding or subsequent
thereto, or over corresponding periods in previous years.
   (D)   Budget billing. (not available)
   (E)   With regard to leased properties, electric bills shall be billed to
the tenant(s) occupying the property served, unless otherwise requested in
writing by the owners, but the billing shall in no way relieve the owner from
liability in the event payment is not made as herein required. The owner of the
property served, which are occupied by tenant(s), shall have the right to
examine the collection records of the town for purposes of determining whether
the rates and charges have been paid by the tenant(s), provided the examination
shall be made in the office in which the records are kept and during the hours
that the office is open for business.
(Ord. 1406-6-02, passed 6-18-2002; Am. Ord. 1528-2-13, passed 2-20-2013)
§ 51.38 RATE SCHEDULES.
   (A)   Avilla shall supply, free of charge, a copy of the rate schedules
applicable to the types of service available to new applicants for, and
existing customers of, residential service, upon request by the applicant or
customer. Where more than one rate is applicable to the service taken, the
applicant or customer shall designate which rate is desired.
   (B)   Where applicable, customer, upon written application, may change from
one rate to another once during the first contract year, effective
retroactively to the date of connection, and once at the end of each 12-month
period thereafter. Such change shall not be applied retroactively and is
subject to approval by Avilla.
(Ord. 1406-6-02, passed 6-18-2002)
§ 51.39 DISCONTINUANCE OF ELECTRICAL SUPPLY/SERVICE.
   (A)   Customer requested disconnection notice.
      (1)   A customer shall notify Avilla at least three days prior to the
date such customer desires service to be disconnected and Avilla shall have
three working days thereafter to make such disconnection. A customer after so
notifying Avilla, shall not be responsible for any service rendered after such
three working days, except that any customer who fails to request disconnection
of service as provided herein shall be responsible for the payment for all
service rendered by Avilla while the account remains in the customer’s name.
      (2)   Should service to a business become suspended or discontinued, due
to fire or other extraordinary causes beyond the control of customer, the
service contract, upon written request by customer, shall become inoperative
until business is resumed, except for unbilled amounts due Avilla for service
provided prior to the suspension or discontinuance. Once service is restored,
the contract and all of its conditions shall again become operative for the
remainder of the contract term.
      (3)   When a customer requests that service be disconnected at a given
location, Avilla may, at its election, discontinue service by either making a
physical disconnection of the service at such location, or obtaining an actual
meter reading on the effective date service is to be discontinued to a
particular customer. If Avilla elects to leave the meter in service, Avilla
shall transfer the account into the name of the new customer at the location.
   (B)   Avilla reserves the right to discontinue supply.
      (1)   Avilla shall have the right, subject to any provision of Commission
Rule 16 to the contrary, to discontinue service without notice and remove any
of its property from customer’s premises without legal process, for any of the
following reasons:
         (a)   To facilitate emergency repairs.
         (b)   For want of supply of electric energy.
         (c)   Where tampering or the fraudulent or unauthorized use of
electricity is detected, or where Avilla’s regulating or measuring equipment or
other facilities have been tampered with and Avilla has reasonable grounds to
believe the affected customer is responsible for such use of tampering.
         (d)   Where a condition dangerous or hazardous to life, physical
safety or property exists.
         (e)   By order of any court, the Commission, or other duly authorized
public authority.
      (2)   When Avilla’s agents are unable to have safe and reasonable access
during Avilla’s normal business hours to any meter, for continuous period of
three months, Avilla may disconnect after 14-days’ written notice, until
suitable arrangements can be made for the regular reading of such meter.
      (3)   Avilla may discontinue service after 14 days prior written notice
to a customer for any of the following reasons:
         (a)   For nonpayment of a delinquent bill.
         (b)   For violation of any Avilla Municipal Electric Department rule.
         (c)   For breach of any contract entered into between Avilla and
customer.
      (4)   If, for any reason, Avilla has issued a notice of disconnection of
service, but because of a medical postponement or bill payment extension
agreement such service was not disconnected pursuant to such notice, Avilla may
disconnect such service without further notice, upon the expiration of such
postponement or any breach of such extension agreement.
   (C)   Disconnect penalties.
      (1)   If Avilla is justified in discontinuing service to a customer at
one location, Avilla shall have the right, subject to any provisions of the
Commission Rule 16 to the contrary, to transfer unpaid charges to the same
customer at any other location at which Avilla is rendering service to such
customer, notwithstanding separate service contracts may be in effect for each
location. Furthermore, Avilla shall have the right, subject to any provision of
Commission Rule 16 to the contrary, to discontinue its service to a customer at
any location to which the charges have been transferred because of such
customer’s failure to pay such charges with the time prescribed in the
“Billings and Payment” Article.
      (2)   When service is disconnected for nonpayment of a bill, or whenever
for any reason beyond the control of Avilla, except acts of God, a reconnection
of service is required by any customer, a minimum charge, as specified in
Exhibit I, shall be paid to Avilla to cover a part of the cost of disconnection
and reconnection of the service; except that the charge for any service of a
customer after regular business hours or on Saturdays, Sundays or holidays,
shall be charged at an actual cost incurred by Avilla. This charge, together
with any arrears due Avilla and/or required service deposit, must be paid
before the service is reconnected. Such discontinuance, provided for herein,
shall not, however, invalidate any of the covenants of the contract of Avilla
Rules; and Avilla shall have the right to enforce any contract notwithstanding
such discontinuance.
(Ord. 1406-6-02, passed 6-18-2002)
§ 51.40 INTERRUPTION OF ELECTRIC SUPPLY/SERVICE.
   (A)   Continuity of supply.
      (1)   Avilla will use reasonable diligence in providing regular and
uninterrupted supply of energy; but, if the supply should be interrupted or
fail by reason of accidents, emergencies, maintenance requirements, strikes,
acts of God, legal process or procedure, Federal, State or Municipal action or
interference, extraordinary repair or for any cause whatsoever not within the
control of Avilla, Avilla shall not be held liable for damage, and such
interruptions or failures shall not invalidate any of the covenants of the
contract.
      (2)   Similarly, due to the inherent nature an electric utility, it’s
load requirements and protective devices, momentary operations occasionally
will cause brief interruptions in electrical supply. Protection against such
occurrences, such as unified power supplies, are customer’s responsibility if
they so desire to use such devices.
      (3)   In any case of deficiency of supply or any trouble with the
electric service, notice shall be given promptly to the office of the Avilla
Municipal Electric Department or the Avilla Police Department.
   (B)   Load curtailment.
      (1)   If for any reason, sufficient amounts of electric power, in the
judgment of Avilla, are not available to Avilla to meet all existing and
reasonably anticipated demands for service or to protect integrity and
stability of the system, Avilla reserves the right to restrict, limit or
curtail electric service to any of its customers. Under these conditions
appeals for voluntary curtailments of loads will be initiated.
      (2)   If supplies of electric power are not sufficient after the above
named appeals for voluntary curtailment of load, Avilla reserves the right to
order further electric service curtailment either by a priority of service
system or interruption of selected circuits. Priority of service will be as
follows (the highest priority as Class 1 and the lowest as Class 5):
         (a)   Human health needs, including governmental;
         (b)   Residential and living quarters;
         (c)   Commercial and industrial;
         (d)   Schools, colleges, universities, and other educational
institutions;
         (e)   Dispensable users and surplus capacity power.
      (3)   Avilla reserves the right to order electric service curtailment
without regard to priority of service when, in its sole judgment, such
curtailment is required to forestall imminent and irreparable injury to life,
property or the electric system. In the event mandatory curtailment is imposed,
selective short-term service interruptions (generally two hours or less) by
operation, on a rotational basis, of distribution switching equipment to effect
the necessary electric power curtailment.
(Ord. 1406-6-02, passed 6-18-2002)
§ 51.41 RESIDENTIAL SERVICE CLASSIFICATION AND LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   Classification and limitations.
      (1)   Residential service is only applicable for service supplied to what
is ordinarily designated and recognized as individual single-family,
residential, home or farmhouse use, including apartments, mobile homes and
other individual single-family dwelling quarters or units. Where service is
supplied through one meter to more than a single-family dwelling unit or living
quarters or apartment, see elsewhere under “Multiple Dwelling Units” as to
billing and other requirements.
      (2)   The term RESIDENTIAL SERVICE includes service to:
         (a)   The separate dwelling-units in an apartment house, but not the
halls, basement or other portions of such building common to more than one such
unit.
         (b)   The premises occupied as the living-quarters of five persons or
less who unite to establish a common dwelling-place for their own personal
comfort and convenience on a cost-sharing basis.
         (c)   The premises owned by a church designated or set-aside and used
as the residence of a priest, rabbi, pastor, nun or other clerical/church
employee.
         (d)   Private dwellings in which a person residing therein
occasionally uses space for the conduct of business.
      (3)   The term RESIDENTIAL SERVICE does not include service to:
         (a)   Premises that are institutional in character including clubs,
fraternities, orphanages or group homes;
         (b)   Premises defined as a rooming or boarding house in the Avilla
Municipal Code.
         (c)   The space in an apartment or other residential building
primarily devoted to a professional or other office, studio or other gainful
pursuit.
         (d)   The portion of an apartment house considered common to all
occupants, such as halls, basements, and the like.
      (4)   The election made by customer shall continue for a period of 12
months and thereafter until customer shall notify Avilla, in writing, of his
election to have the selected classification changed. Each such election
subsequent to the initial election shall continue for a 12-month period and
thereafter until customer again notifies Avilla in writing, of his election to
change his selection of the classification of such service.
      (5)   In borderline cases, in which the principal use of energy will be
for residential purposes, but it is desired to utilize a small amount of energy
for non-residential purposes, such nonresidential use will be permitted only
when the equipment for such use is within the capacity of one 120 volt, 30
ampere branch circuit (or less than 3,000 watts capacity) and the non-
residential consumption is less than the residential use on the premises. When
the non-residential equipment exceeds the above stated maximum limit the entire
nonresidential wiring must be separated from the residential wiring, so that it
may be metered separately, and the non-residential load will be billed under
the appropriate commercial service rate.
   (B)   Residential heating service. Residential heating service is applicable
under Rate Code 16 for house heating service where the house heating service
installation conforms to the specifications and conditions hereinafter set
forth.
      (1)   All electric space heating equipment shall consist of a permanent
installation to be approved by Avilla with maximum connected kVA explicitly
stated.
      (2)   The electric heating equipment may consist of either individual
room resistance space heating units installed in each room, or reversed cycle
refrigeration “heat pump” units, or central “furnace-type” units, not to exceed
25 kVA.
      (3)   The entire heating installation (including heating units, wiring
ducts, controls, building insulation, and the like) shall be installed strictly
in accordance with Avilla’s Standards available at the Avilla Municipal
Electric Department Office. The Standards specify, among other things, that the
minimum approved insulation for any electrically heated home shall have a
thickness of not less than eight inches for outside ceiling areas and installed
with an approved vapor barrier.
      (4)   For concrete slab floor construction next to earth, two inches of
effective edge and waterproof perimeter insulation shall be installed,
extending not less than 24 inches below the floor slab.
      (5)   Where the home is heated by means of individual resistance heating
units (ceiling and baseboard) the temperature of each room shall be controlled
by means of individual thermostats installed in each room.
      (6)   Where the home is heated by means of a circulation hot water
heating system, using a centrally located electric resistance operated hot

unit that can be in operation at any time exceeds 10 kWH with a maximum limit
of 25 kWH, the charges as set forth in Rate Code 16 shall apply.
   (C)   Service to multiple dwelling units. Where electrical energy is
supplied through one meter and billed to one residential service customer and
serving two, but not more than three, separate dwelling units, and when the
entire use of the service is for residential purposes, customer shall, by
written application to Avilla, elect whether:
      (1)   The service will be classified as residential, in which case, for
billing purposes, customer charge of the residential rate shall be multiplied
by the number of living quarters served through the meter; or
      (2)   The service shall be classed as non-residential (commercial), in
which case, for billing purposes; the applicable non-residential rate shall be
applied on the basis of a single customer.
      (3)   This rule has no application to rooming houses, which will be
served only under the applicable non-residential service rate.
(Ord. 1406-6-02, passed 6-18-2002)
§ 51.42 NON-RESIDENTIAL OR COMMERCIAL SERVICE CLASSIFICATION AND LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   Three-phase service - minimum installation. Three-phase service will
be supplied only where Avilla has the lines available, but no connection will
be made for less than five horsepower, nor will the bill be based upon less
than four kilowatts.
   (B)   Determination of customer’s demand.
      (1)   The monthly kVA billing demand shall be normally determined by
measurement of taking the highest 15 minute integrated, or equivalent thermal
kW capacity, and dividing same by the average monthly power factor, as may be
determined by a ratcheted kVARh meter, or by the average monthly power factor,
as may be determined by Avilla via periodic tests using suitable metering
equipment. The monthly kVA billing demand may also be determined by means of
other suitable indication or recording metering equipment. All kVA billing
demand shall be determined to the nearest whole kVA.
      (2)   The billing demand may be adjusted where highly fluctuating or
intermittent loads (such as welding machines, electric furnaces, hoists,
cranes, elevator, x-ray equipment, and the like) are in operation by customer.
Avilla reserves the right to determine the billing capacity by averaging
customer’s total load over a two-minute period.
      (3)   Customer’s demand upon Avilla’s facilities will be determined by
permanently installed meters of suitable design. Any demand resulting from
unusual conditions, not conducive to practical or accurate metering, will be
estimated and added, for billing purposes, to the measured demand.
      (4)   When more than one demand meter is used to determine customer’s
demand upon Avilla’s facilities, the kilowatts of demand that are used in
computing the bill shall be based upon:
         (a)   The sum of the maximum demands of the several meters, without
any consideration of their time of occurrence in the month, when the use of
more than one meter is required by customer; or
         (b)   The sum of the simultaneous demands of the several meters, as
near as can be reasonably determined, when the use of more than one meter is
required by Avilla.
      (5)   The billing demand applicable for all customers shall be based upon
the total demand established by customer in the month being considered, but
with the further provision that the demand charge shall not be based upon less
than 60% of the highest demand established in any of the immediately preceding
11 months, or less than the minimum demand provided for in the applicable rate.
      (6)   The billing demand applicable for service shall be determined as is
stated in the rate available for that service.
   (C)   Voltage measurement and billing. All measurements will be made at the
voltage stated in the rate, unless it is necessary and practical that Avilla
measure at some other voltage. All bills will be computed at the voltage stated
in the rate.
(Ord. 1406-6-02, passed 6-18-2002)
§ 51.43 EXCLUSIVITY OF SERVICE.
   No other source of electric light or power supply shall be used by customer

above may be made for auxiliary power supply and only through suitable switches
to insure that customer’s emergency generation is isolated from Avilla’s lines
at all times.
(Ord. 1406-6-02, passed 6-18-2002)
§ 51.44 MODIFICATION OF CONTRACTS OR AGREEMENTS.
   No promise, agreement or representation of any agent of Avilla, made either
before or after the signing of the contract, shall be binding upon Avilla,
unless the same shall have been incorporated in the contract in writing before
the contract is signed and accepted by the proper authority of Avilla.

are users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water
meter, then in this case billing shall be for a single service in the manner
set out herein, except that the charge shall be not less than the number of
dwelling units multiplied by the monthly minimum charge for a five-eighths to
three-fourths-inch water meter. A dwelling unit shall be interpreted as a room
or any other space in which cooking facilities are provided.
      (2)   In the case of trailer parks discharging sanitary sewage, water or
other liquids into the town’s sanitary sewage system, either directly or
indirectly, and which are users of water from the town’s water works, and the
quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in this case
billing shall be for a single service in the manner set out herein, except that
the charge shall be not less then the number of occupied trailer spaces
multiplied by the monthly minimum charge for a five-eighths to three-fourths-
inch water meter.
   (G)   In order that domestic and residential users of sewage services shall
not be penalized for the sprinkling of lawns during the months of June, July,
August and September, the billing for sewage service for residences and/or
domestic users for the months of June, July, August and September shall be
based upon the water usage for the previous months of December, January,
February and March. In the event the water usage for the previous months of
December, January, February and March is greater than the water usage of the
months of June, July, August and September, then the billing for sewage service
shall be computed on the actual water used in the month for which the sewage
service bill is being rendered. Domestic and/or residential sewage service, as
applicable to the sprinkling rate, shall apply to each lot, parcel of real
estate or building which is occupied and used as a residence. The sprinkling
rate shall not apply to any premises which are partially or wholly used for
industrial or commercial purposes. In the event a portion of the premises shall
be used for commercial or industrial purposes, the owner shall have the
privilege of separating the water service so that the residential portion of
the premises is served through a separate meter, and in this case, the water
usage as registered by the water meter serving the portion of the premises used
for residential purposes would qualify under the sprinkling rate.
   (H)   Where a metered water supply is used for fire protection as well as
for other uses, the town may, in its discretion, make adjustments in the
minimum charge and in the use charge as may be equitable.

§ 53.38 STRENGTH AND CHARACTER OF WASTES.
   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably adjusted to
the service rendered, the town shall have the right to base its charges not
only on volume, but also on the strength and character of the sewage and waste
which it is required to treat and dispose of. The town shall have the right to
measure and determine the strength and content of all sewage and waste
discharged, either directly or indirectly, into the town’s sanitary sewage
system in a manner and by a method as may be deemed practical in the light of
the conditions and attending circumstances of the case, in order to determine
the proper charge. Any and all commercial and industrial installations shall be
so controlled and/or treated as to the sewage strength that their effluent
discharged to the town’s sewers shall have a B.O.D. not to exceed 300 parts per
million and suspended solids not to exceed 350 parts per million at any time,
which provisions are in general agreement with the recommendations contained in
Manual No. 3 of the Federation of Sewage Works Association, entitled Municipal
Sewer Ordinances - 1949. The town is authorized to prohibit the dumping of
wastes into the town’s sewage system which, in its discretion, are deemed
harmful to the operation of the sewage treatment works of the town, or to
require methods of pretreatment of the wastes to reduce the characteristics of
the waste satisfactory to the town.

rates and charges established herein, and all other provisions herein set forth
shall be applicable outside the town limits.
(Ord. 1011, passed 2-24-1965)
§ 53.40 BILLING.
   The rates and charges shall be prepared and billed by the town monthly, and
shall be collected in the manner provided by law and ordinance. The rates and
charges will be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying the property served
unless otherwise requested in writing by the owners, but the billing shall in
no way relieve the owner from liability in the event payment is not made as
herein required. The owners of the property served, which are occupied by
tenants, shall have the right to examine the collection records of the town for
the purpose of determining whether the rates and charges have been paid by the
tenants, provided that the examination shall be made in the office in which the
records are kept and during the hours that the office is open for business.

SIDEWALK REGULATIONS
§ 95.20 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED FOR CONSTRUCTION; APPROVAL OF THE TOWN COUNCIL.
   All sidewalks made new, replaced or repaired in the town shall be made in
conformity with the provisions of this subchapter, and the grades, plans,
profiles and specifications shall be approved by the Town Council.
(Ord. 302, passed 11-27-1962)
§ 95.21 CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Handicap accessible ramp. Where sidewalks intersect with curbs, the
curb and gutter shall be removed. The curb and sidewalk shall be replaced with
handicap accessible ramp to meet the Americans with Disabilities standards.
   (B)   Sidewalk grades and widths. All sidewalks shall be constructed in a
minimum of five feet in width, except in the case of the continuation of an
already constructed sidewalk which is less in width than five feet, but in no
event shall a sidewalk be constructed less than four feet in width. If the
sidewalk under construction is a gap between already constructed sidewalks in
the same block, it shall be constructed according to the width of the wider
sidewalk. The concrete shall be a minimum of four inches in thickness and shall
be laid in one course in accordance with the specifications. The surface of any
walk when completed shall be in conformity with the grade given by the town,
and shall have a slope if 1/4 of an inch per foot toward the center of the
street. All sidewalks shall be laid with the inner edge on the property line,
unless otherwise directed by the town.
   (C)   Driveway and alley crossings. All driveway and alley crossing shall be
constructed of concrete, conform to the sidewalk grade, and shall be six inches
in depth of the same quality and material as specified for sidewalks.
   (D)   Manner for placing concrete for sidewalks. The subgrade shall be
wetted before the concrete is placed thereon. The concrete shall be deposited
within the forms upon the wetted subgrade to the thickness required. It shall
then be leveled off and tamped sufficiently to bring the mortar to the surface,
after which it shall be finished smooth and even. The edge shall be rounded
with an edger having a radius of 1/4 inch. A broom shall be used for texturing
and brooming shall generally be parallel to transverse joints. When the surface
has received the final finish the surface shall be coated with a concrete
curing compound or covered and kept wet for a period of not less than 48 hours.
No concrete shall be placed on frozen subgrade. Whenever there is a danger that
the temperature will reach the freezing point, sufficient straw or other
suitable material shall be added to the covering material to prevent freezing
of the concrete before it is thoroughly cured.
   (E)   Expansion joints. Preformed joint material for expansion joints shall
be composed of a durable elastic compound. Expansion joints shall be placed
where any sidewalk joins with any curb and gutter, where new sidewalk joins old
sidewalk, and at other locations as directed by the town. Expansion joints
shall be placed at intervals not to exceed 50 feet.
   (F)   Sidewalk transverse joints.  Transverse joints shall be cut
perpendicular to the sidewalk edge with a jointer having a radius of 1/4 inch,
at intervals not greater than the width of the sidewalk being constructed,
unless otherwise directed by the town. As an alternate method of forming
transverse joints, the joints may be sawed to a depth of one inch after the
concrete has hardened.
(Ord. 302, passed 11-27-1962; Am. Ord. 1453-06-02, passed 7-10-2006)
§ 95.22 NOTICE TO THE PROPERTY OWNER FOR CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR OF SIDEWALKS.
   (A)   Whenever in the opinion of the Town Council any new sidewalk should be
built or old sidewalks repaired in the town, the Council shall forthwith give
notice to the owner of the abutting property or his or her agent, if residents
of the town, and the Street Commissioner shall serve the notice by sending a
copy thereof by registered mail to the owner or agent if the address of the
owner or agent is known to the Street Commissioner. If the owner or agent is a
nonresident, and his or her address is unknown to the Street Commissioner, or
the real estate is vacant or unoccupied and the residence of the owner or agent
is unknown, then the Street Commissioner shall post a copy of the notice on the
property in a conspicuous place requiring the owner to build or repair the same
within 30 days from the date of service of the notice. In case the owner shall
fail to build or repair the sidewalk after the notice has been given, the town
shall proceed to build or repair the walk, and the costs, charges and expenses
thereof shall be charged against the owner of the property and shall be
collected in the same manner as assessments for street improvement.
   (B)   When any sidewalk within the town shall be or become out of repair so
as to render the same unsafe, unfit or inconvenient for passage thereover by
pedestrians, the Town Council shall notify the owners of the abutting property
adjoining thereof of the defects in the sidewalk, and, in the event the same is
not repaired, relaid or replaced as directed within a reasonable time not to
exceed 30 days, then the Town Council shall take any action as shall be deemed
proper by the Council, as provided by the laws of the state and the ordinances
of the town. For the purpose and within the purview of this subchapter, the
determination of the Board of Trustees as to the necessity of the repair,
relaying or replacing of any sidewalk to render the same safe, fit or
convenient for passage thereover by pedestrians shall be conclusive as far as
the town is concerned.
(Ord. 302, passed 11-27-1962)
§ 95.23 USE OF DIRT REMOVED DURING CONSTRUCTION.
   Whenever any sidewalk shall have been ordered built, repaired, relaid or
replaced, the dirt removed may be used by the town in improving the street upon
which building or repairs are being made or on streets, alleys or public
places, the grading of which is of the same general plan. In case the town does
not so use the dirt, the property owner may remove it together with all old
material within five days from the completion of the work. In case the property
owner fails to do so, the contractor shall proceed to remove the same, and the
costs thereof shall be collected as a part of the cost of the improvements. It
shall be the duty of the contractor at all times while building, repairing,
relaying or replacing any sidewalk to see to it that the stakes indicating the
grade of the same have not been tampered with.
(Ord. 302, passed 11-27-1962)
§ 95.24 TAMPERING WITH SIDEWALKS PROHIBITED.
   It shall be unlawful for any unauthorized person or persons to tamper with
or in any way interfere with any grade stake or any sidewalk, or to deface or
disturb any sidewalk while in progress of construction. Any person to do so
shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined.

premises situated in the town are hereby required to keep sidewalks in front of
or adjacent to the premises so occupied by the occupants or in front of or
adjacent to the unoccupied premises so owned by owners free from snow and ice,
as hereinafter provided. For the purpose of this section the person or persons,
firm, association or corporation occupying for business, residence or other
purposes the first floor of any building situated on the premises so occupied
shall be responsible for removal of snow and ice form the sidewalk, but if the
first floor of the building is not occupied, then the premises shall be deemed
and held to be unoccupied, and the owner thereof shall be required to keep the
sidewalks free from ice and snow.
   (B)   (1)   In case any snow or ice accumulated on any sidewalk shall have
fallen or accumulated in the night time, the same shall be removed by the
occupant or owner within 24 hours of the accumulations of said snow or ice. If
the snow or ice shall have fallen or accumulated on any sidewalk during
daylight hours, then the same shall be removed by the occupant or owner within
24 hours from the time the snow has ceased to fall or the ice has accumulated.
      (2)   In the event an occupant or owner shall have removed the
accumulated snow or ice within the time provided for in this division, then
said occupant or owner shall be deemed to have complied with division (A).
   (C)   If any owner or occupant does not remove snow and ice as provided in
division (A) above, the Street Commissioner is hereby authorized to remove or
cause the snow and ice to be removed and report in writing the necessary
expense incident thereto to the Clerk-Treasurer, who shall certify the amount
with the description of the lot or parcel of ground and the owner or owners'
name or names, which amount shall then become a lien upon the lot or parcel of
ground and shall be collected by the Clerk-Treasurer at the same time and in
the same manner that he or she collects other assessments on real estate.

§ 112.01 PURPOSES AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented
businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare
of the citizens of the town, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses within the town. The provisions of this chapter have neither the
purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or
reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by
the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene material.
   (B)   Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of adult uses in
the town and in other communities, presented in hearings and in reports made
available to the Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of Pap’s
A.M. v City of Erie, 2000 U.S. LEXIS 2347 (Mar. 29, 2000); City of Renton v.
Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres,

oriented businesses, both in the town and in other communities including, but
not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona - 1984; Minneapolis, Minnesota - 1980;
Houston, Texas - 1997; Indianapolis, Indiana - 1984; Amarillo, Texas; Garden
Grove, California - 1991; Los Angeles, California - 1977; Whittier, California

Wisconsin - 1993; Bellevue, Washington, - 1998; Newport News, Virginia - 1996;
New York Times Square study - 1994; and also on findings from the Report of the
Attorney General’s Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented
Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the unlicensed
operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism in
this town to make the owners and operators of these establishments responsible
for the activities that occur on their premises.
      (2)   Certain employees of unregulated sexually oriented businesses
defined in §
112.02 as adult theatres and cabarets engage in a higher incidence of certain
types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
unregulated sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide
private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live
sex shows.
      (4)   Offering and providing unregulated space encourages the sexual acts
referred to in division (3) above, which creates unhealthy conditions.
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of the sexually oriented businesses, or for the purpose of purchasing
or selling illicit drugs.
      (6)   Numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis salmonella, campylobacter and shigella infections,
chlamydial, myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections, trichomoniasis and
chancroid.
      (7)   According to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation, an
estimated 650,000 to 900,000 Americans are infected with HIV. The number of new
HIV infections occurring each year is now about 41,000. Men and women of all
races are most likely to be infected by sexual contact.
      (8)   Relevant statistics revealed that a total of 5,419 AIDS cases had
been reported in Indiana as of January 1, 1999. Indiana has required HIV case
reporting since July of 1988 and shows 5,561 people currently living with HIV
(3,109) or AIDS (2,452) in the state.
      (9)   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that as
many as one in three people with HIV do not know they are infected.
      (10)   The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982
and 45,200 through November of 1990.
      (11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over 500,000 being reported in 1990.
      (12)   The surgeon general of the United States, in his report of October
22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      (13)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
See Findings of U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services.
      (14)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
      (15)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented
films.
      (16)   The findings noted in subsections (1) through (15) raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (17)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (18)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, the licensing procedure will
place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health,
safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the
town. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is
the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, and fully in possession
and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (19)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres.
      (20)   Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects, and by preventing minors
from working in the establishments.
      (21)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to- day operation and maintenance of the sexually
oriented business, where the information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of the uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
      (22)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent, or who
are likely to be witnesses to prohibited activity.
      (23)   The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of
the town will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE
AND OBJECTIVES; DEFINITIONS
§ 153.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Town Council of the Town of Avilla does hereby adopt the following floodplain
management regulations.
(Ord. 1527-2-13, passed 3-20-2013; Am. Ord. 1548-1-15, passed 1-21-2015)
§ 153.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-proofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 1527-2-13, passed 3-20-2013; Am. Ord. 1548-1-15, passed 1-21-2015)
§ 153.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters.
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage.
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (F)   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and
their contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 1527-2-13, passed 3-20-2013; Am. Ord. 1548-1-15, passed 1-21-2015)
§ 153.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains; and
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
(Ord. 1527-2-13, passed 3-20-2013; Am. Ord. 1548-1-15, passed 1-21-2015)
§ 153.05 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
      ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood event.
Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood
elevation or depths are shown.
      ZONE AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance
flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown
within these zones (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-
A30).
      ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow flooding
(usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one
and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses
are shown within this zone.
      ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow flooding
(usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and three feet.
Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within
this zone.
      ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction Federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (to an existing structure). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this section.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular
program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   DEVELOPMENT.

dams, channel improvements, etc.;
         (e)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling
operations;
         (f)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
         (g)   Storage of materials; or
         (h)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
      (2)   DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the maintenance of
existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing, resurfacing
roads, or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent
structures.
   D ZONE. Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding
is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is
not required by regulation in this zone.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter
walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or
columns (posts and piers).
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. A certified statement that verifies a structure's
elevation information.
   EMERGENCY PROGRAM. The first phase under which a community participates in
the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOOD)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See FREEBOARD)
   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The FLOODPLAIN includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT.  The operation of an overall program of corrective
and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. This term describes Federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to
as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention
ordinance, and floodplain management requirements.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP (as related to variances of this chapter). The exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Board of
Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar
to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structures individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
      LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the currently
effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA
through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is only
issued by FEMA.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the currently
effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations,
and elevations.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision by
letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE (LAG). The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest elevation described among the following:
      (1)   The top of the lowest level of the structure.
      (2)   The top of the basement floor.
      (3)   The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of
the structure.
      (4)   The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or
pillars.
      (5)   The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement,
below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and,
         (c)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a recreational vehicle.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE. The building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. MARKET VALUE can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or
adjusted assessed values.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The Federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the Federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD) OF 1929. Corrected in 1929 is a
vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within
the floodplain.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for which the start of construction
commenced after the effective date of the community's first floodplain
ordinance.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   NON-BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of any river or stream other than
a boundary river.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88). Adopted in 1993 is a

embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization,
bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the
letter A is subject to the 1% annual chance flood. (See REGULATORY FLOOD)
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community's FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain
boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These
changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements,
annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base
flood elevations or SFHAs.
   PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE. Anything which is injurious to the safety or
health of an entire community, neighborhood or any considerable number of
persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary
manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.

quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGULAR PROGRAM. The phase of the community's participation in the NFIP
where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and
higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations
determined in a FIS.
   REGULATORY FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable
to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is
as defined in §
153.11. The REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the term "Base Flood," "One-
Percent Annual Chance Flood," and "100-Year Flood."
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SECTION 1316. That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided
for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly
constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to
be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that
intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood-prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdiction of the
town subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the town are
generally identified as such on the Noble County, Indiana and Incorporated
Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated March 2, 2015 as well as any future
updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as Zone A,
AE, A1-A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes
recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration
of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structures continued designation as a historic structure.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X ZONES shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X ZONES (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type
of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. See A ZONE.
   ZONE B, C, AND X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones
(Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C).

available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and
sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be
displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above
the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.

§ 153.44 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
153.11 are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/ improvement to a residence
in a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources).
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit,
provided the provisions contained in §§ 153.60 et seq. of this chapter have
been met. The Floodplain Development Permit cannot be less restrictive than the
permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any)
shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
0.15 of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under
the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as
proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 C.F.R. § 65.12.
(Ord. 1527-2-13, passed 3-20-2013; Am. Ord. 1548-1-15, passed 1-21-2015)
§ 153.45 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit provided the
provisions contained in this subchapter have been met. The key provision is
that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure
shall be at or above the FPG.
(Ord. 1527-2-13, passed 3-20-2013; Am. Ord. 1548-1-15, passed 1-21-2015)
§ 153.46 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in this subchapter have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this
subchapter have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and shall not increase flood
damages or potential flood damages.
