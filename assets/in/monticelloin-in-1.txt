restrictive ordinance to comply with division (H) does not void the ordinance.

division (F) apply only if the city received, under IC 13-25-5-8.5(f), written
notice that the Department is relying on the environmental restrictive

proposal:

special meeting after the ten-day period prescribed by division (A) of this
section, passes the ordinance, order, or resolution over the Mayor’s veto by a
two-thirds vote.

employee for the city, nor violate any federal, state, or city laws, rules,
ordinances, or policies. Further, any personal use shall not result in an
increase in the cost to the city to its cell phone service provider, and, in
such event the employee shall be responsible for payment of any additional cost
incurred as a result of any personal use.

(Ord. 2015-11, passed 9-21-15; Am. Ord. 2019-10, passed 10-21-19)
§ 34.83 INVESTMENT POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this investment policy (the “policy”) is to
set forth the investment objectives and parameters for the management of public
funds of the city. This investment policy is designed to safeguard funds on
behalf of the city, to assure the availability of funds when needed, and
provide a competitive investment return.
   (B)   Scope.
      (1)   This policy applies to the investment of all funds of the city,
including, but not limited to, the General Fund, special revenue funds, debt
service funds, project funds, and trust and agency funds.
      (2)   The city may consolidate fund balances to increase investment
earnings and to increase efficiencies with regard to investment pricing,
banking fees and administration. Investment income will be allocated to the
various funds, based on their respective participation, and in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.
   (C)   General objectives. The primary objectives, in priority order, of
investment activities shall be safety, liquidity, and return.
      (1)   Safety. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the
investment program. Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to
ensure the preservation of capital. The objective will be to minimize credit
risk and interest rate risk.
         (a)   Credit risk. The city will minimize CREDIT RISK, which is the
risk of loss due to the failure of the security issuer or backer, by limiting
investments to the types of securities listed in division (F) of this section.
         (b)   Interest rate risk. The city will minimize INTEREST RATE RISK,
which is the risk that the market value of securities in the portfolio will
fall due to changes in market interest rates, by structuring the investment
portfolio so that securities mature to meet cash requirements for ongoing
operations, thereby avoiding the need to sell securities prior to maturity.
      (2)   Liquidity. The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently
liquid to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated.
This is accomplished by structuring the portfolio so that securities mature
concurrent with cash needs to meet anticipated demands. Furthermore, since all
possible cash demands cannot be anticipated, a portion of the portfolio may be
placed in money market mutual funds or government investment pools that offer
same-day liquidity for short-term funds.
      (3)   Yield. The investment portfolio shall be designed with the
objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and
economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints and
liquidity needs. Return on investment is of secondary importance compared to
the safety and liquidity objectives described above. The core of investments is
limited to relatively low risk securities in anticipation of earning a fair
return relative to the risk being assumed.
   (D)   Standards of care.
      (1)   Delegation of authority. The Clerk-Treasurer, hereinafter referred
to as the Investment Officer, shall be responsible to oversee the day-to-day
management of the city’s investments pursuant to IC 36-4-10-4.5. Should the
city elect to select an outside investment advisor, such advisor or firm must
be registered under the Investment Advisor’s Act of 1940.
      (2)   Prudence. The standard of prudence to be used by the Investment
Officer shall be the “prudent person” standard and shall be applied in the
context of managing all funds of the city. The “prudent person” standard states
that, “Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances
then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence
exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for
investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the
probable income to be derived.”
      (3)   Ethics and conflicts of interest. The Investment Officer and
employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal
business activity that could conflict with the proper execution and management
of the investment program, or that could impair their ability to make impartial
decisions. The Investment Officer and employees shall disclose any material
interests in financial institutions with which they conduct business. They
shall further disclose any personal financial/investment positions that could
be related to the performance of the investment portfolio.
   (E)   Authorized financial institutions and brokers/dealers.
      (1)   A list will be maintained of local financial institutions that are
approved depositories for the receipt of public funds according to the State
Board for Depositories. The city may pass a resolution pursuant to IC 5-13-9-
5 expanding the list of approved financial institutions to include all state
depositories approved for the receipt of public funds according to the State
Board for Depositories.
      (2)   In addition, the city will only use brokers/dealers that meet the
following requirements:
         (a)   Primary dealers or regional dealers that qualify under
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 15C3-1 (uniform net capital
rule);
         (b)   Capital of no less than $10,000,000;
         (c)   Registered as a dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934;
         (d)   A member of the National Association of Securities Dealers
(NASD);
         (e)   Proof of state registration.
   (F)   Suitable and authorized investments.
      (1)   Consistent with IC 5-13-9, the following investments will be
permitted by this policy:
         (a)   Securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States Treasury or fully guaranteed by the United States, and issued by any of
the following:
            1.   The United Stales Treasury;
            2.   A federal agency;
            3.   A federal instrumentality;
            4.   A federal government-sponsored enterprise;
         (b)   Securities fully guaranteed and issued by any of the following:
            1.   A federal agency;
            2.   A federal instrumentality;
            3.   A federal government-sponsored enterprise;
         (c)   Municipal securities issued by a state local governmental
entity, a quasi-governmental entity related to the state, or a unit of
government, municipal corporation, or special taxing district in the state, if
the issuer has not defaulted on any of the issuer’s obligations within the 20
years preceding the date of the purchase in accordance with IC 5-13-9-2;
         (d)   Money market mutual funds rated AAAm, or its equivalent, by
Standard and Poor’s Corporation or Aaa, or its equivalent, by Moody's Investors
Service, Inc., in accordance with IC 5-13-9-2.5;
         (e)   Repurchase agreements in accordance with IC 5-13-9-3;
         (f)   Transaction accounts, certificates of deposit and deposit
accounts issued or offered by a designated depository of the city’s political
subdivision. The investing officer making a deposit in a certificate of deposit
shall obtain quotes from each designated depository in accordance with IC 5-13-
9-4;
         (g)   Certificates of deposit authorized by a resolution of the city
in accordance with IC 5-13-9-5 and 5-13-9-5.3;
         (h)   Local government investment pools in accordance with IC 5-13-9-

      (2)   Consistent with IC 36-1-7, the city may pass a resolution to enter
into interlocal cooperation agreements for the joint exercise of powers,
including the investment of public funds.
   (G)   Investment parameters.
      (1)   Maximum maturities. 
         (a)   The city’s investments must have a stated final maturity of not
more than two years pursuant to IC 5-13-9-5.6. Because of inherent difficulties
in accurately forecasting cash flow requirements, a portion of the portfolio
should be continuously invested in readily available funds, such as local
government investment pools, money market funds, or overnight repurchase
agreements, to ensure that appropriate liquidity is maintained to meet ongoing
obligations.
         (b)   The city may adopt an ordinance, pursuant to IC 5-13-9-5.7,
authorizing its Investment Officer to make investments having a stated final
maturity that is more than two years, but not more than five years after the
date of purchase. The total investments of the city with maturities of two to
five years outstanding at the time of purchase may not exceed 25% of its total
portfolio of public funds invested, including balances in transaction accounts.
This ordinance expires on the date on which this policy expires, which may not
exceed four years.
      (2)   Competitive bids. The Investment Officer, or his or her designee,
shall obtain competitive bids for investment with financial institutions in
accordance with IC 5-13-9-4. The Investment Officer, or his or her designee,
shall obtain bids from at least two brokers or financial institutions on all
purchases of investment instruments on the secondary market. Overnight sweep
investment instruments shall not be subject to this section.
   (H)   Policy considerations.
      (1)   Adoption and expiration. This policy shall be adopted by the city
at a public meeting and shall expire one year from the date of adoption in
accordance with IC 5-13-9-5.7.
      (2)   Exemption. Any investment currently held that does not meet the
guidelines of this policy shall be exempted from the requirements of this
policy. At maturity or liquidation, such monies shall be reinvested only as
provided by this policy.
      (3)   Amendments. This policy shall be reviewed periodically. Any changes
must be approved by the Investment Officer and any other appropriate authority.

CAPITAL ASSETS POLICY
§ 34.105 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   CAPITAL ASSETS. Tangible assets of a durable nature employed in the
operating activities of the unit and that are relatively permanent and are
needed for the production or sale of goods or services are termed property,
plant and equipment or capital assets. These assets are not held for sale in
the ordinary course of business. This broad group is usually separated into
classes according to the physical characteristics of the items (such as land,
buildings, infrastructure, improvements other than buildings, machinery, and
equipment, furniture and fixtures.)
   CAPITAL OUTLAYS. Expenditures which benefit both the current and future
fiscal periods. Includes costs of acquiring land or structures; construction or
improvement of buildings, structures or other capital assets; and equipment
purchases having an appreciable and calculable period of usefulness. CAPITAL
OUTLAYS are expenditures resulting in the acquisition of or addition to the
government's general capital assets.
   ENTERPRISE FUNDS.  
      (1)   Those funds used to account for operations:
         (a)   That are financed and operated in a manner similar to private
business enterprise – where the intent of the governing body is that the costs
(expenses, including depreciation) of providing goods or services to the
general public on a continuing basis be financed or recovered primarily through
user charges; or
         (b)   Where the governing body has decided that periodic determination
of revenues earned, expenses incurred, and/or net income is appropriate for
capital maintenance, public policy, management control, accountability, and
other purposes.
      (2)   ENTERPRISE FUNDS include the municipally owned water and sewage
utilities. Operation of these utilities shall require enterprise fund account
and reporting.
   HISTORICAL COSTS.  The cash equivalent price exchanged for goods and
services at the date of acquisition. Land, buildings, equipment, and most
inventories arc common examples of items recognized under the historical cost
attribute.
   IMPROVEMENTS OTHER THAN BUILDINGS. Improvements to land for better
enjoyment, attached or not easily removed, and which will have a life
expectancy of greater than two years. Examples are walks, parking areas and
drives, golf cart paths, fencing, retaining walls, pools, outside fountains,
planter underground sprinkler systems, and other similar items. IMPROVEMENTS
OTHER THAN BUILDINGS do not include roads, streets, or assets that are of value
only to the public. For example, Main Street is a public street with the
greatest value to the public. Roads or drives upon city-owned land that provide
support to our facilities are assets. A sidewalk down the road for public
enjoyment is an infrastructure improvement and is not capitalized. However,
sidewalks installed upon city-owned land for use by the public and for the
support of our facility are capital assets.
   MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT.  An apparatus, tool, or conglomeration of pieces to
form a tool. The tool will stand alone and not become a part or a basic
structure or building.
   TANGIBLE ASSETS. Assets that can be observed by one or more of the physical
senses. They may be seen and touched and, in some environments, heard and
smelled.

§ 34.110 RECORDING AND ACCOUNTING.
   (A)   The city and its various departments shall classify capital
expenditures as capital outlays within the fund from which the expenditure was
made in accordance with the Chart of Accounts of the Cities and Towns Account
manual. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes all expenditures
necessary to put the asset into position and ready for use. For purposes of
recording capital assets of the city and its departments, the valuation of
assets shall be based on historical cost or where the historical cost is
indeterminable, by estimation for those assets in existence.
   (B)   (1)   The city's municipally owned utilities shall record acquisition
of capital assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
When an asset is purchased for cash, the acquisition is simply recorded at the
amount of cash paid, including all outlays relating to its purchase and
preparation for intended use. Assets may be acquired under a number of other
arrangements including:
         (a)   Assets acquired for a lump-sum purchase price;
         (b)   Purchase on a deferred payment contract;
         (c)   Acquisition under a capital lease;
         (d)   Acquisition by exchange of nonmonetary assets;
         (e)   Acquisition by issuance of securities;
         (f)   Acquisition by self-construction;
         (g)   Acquisition by donation or discovery.
      (2)   Some of these arrangements present special problems relating to the
cost to be recorded, for example in utility accounting, interest during a
period of construction has long been recognized as a part of the asset cost.
Reference to an intermediate accounting manual will illustrate the recording of
acquisition of assets under the aforementioned acquisition arrangements. For
purposes of recording fixed assets of the utilities the valuation of assets
shall be based on historical cost.
   (C)   An asset register (prescribed form) shall be maintained to provide a
detailed record of the capital assets of the governmental unit.

   (A)   Capital expenditures made by the city, its various departments and
utilities are in accordance with management's authorization as documented in §§
32.65 and
32.66;
   (B)   Transactions of the utilities are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with general accepted
principles;
   (C)   Adequate detailed records are maintained to assure accountability for
city- and utility- owned assets;
   (D)   Access to assets is permitted in accordance with management's
authorization;

assets at least every two years and appropriate action is taken with respect to
any differences.

§ 50.32 RESIDENTIAL ACCOUNTS.
   (A)   When a previously terminated account (owner-occupied or renter)
returns to establish a new account after a period of time has elapsed, any
amounts previously written off as bad debts must be reimbursed before a new
account will be established.
   (B)   If an active account (owner occupied or renter) continually becomes or
remains past due (determined by multiple application of penalty charges against
the account), or service has been disconnected due to non-payment, a deposit
equal to double the schedule established above may be required for continuation
or reestablishment of service.
   (C)   A residential deposit shall always be required before utility service
will be rendered.
   (D)   When a rental account moves to a new account, a new "Application for
Utility Service" shall be required. The old deposit normally shall be
transferred to the new account. If, however, the customer has developed a
history of being past due (see § 50.35 for "History Defined"), the old deposit
shall stay with the old account and a new deposit shall be required for the new
account. In this event, the deposit required on the new account may be double
the regular deposit requirement. The old deposit will be applied to the current
and final bills of the old account, and the balance, if any, will be refunded.
If the old account is past due on the moving date, a new account will not be
established until the old account is brought current.
   (E)   If, after the final bill is prepared, the old deposit is not
sufficient to cover the remaining charges on the old account and the old
account becomes past due, the new account will be subject to service
termination as though the two accounts were one.
   (F)   When planning a move, the Utility Business Office should be given
sufficient notice so that services can be terminated on the planned date of
vacating the premises.

   (A)   Commercial, industrial, governmental, and institutional accounts shall
require a deposit before utility service(s) will be rendered.
   (B)   If an account is disconnected because of non-payment, the deposit may
be used to pay all existing charges. Upon re-establishing service, a new
deposit is required, and the payment of reconnect fees and the payment of any
charges not covered by the deposit shall be made in full before services will
be restored.

§ 50.37 DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS.
   (A)   Meter readings are taken on or about the first of each month for the
previous month's usage. The Utility Office calculates the charge due and bills
are mailed on or about the fifteenth of each month with the total due on the
fifth of the following month. If the fifth falls on a holiday or weekend then
the first business day following will be the due date. If the total due is not
paid on the due date, a penalty is charged and a notice sent with a cut off

(Ord. 01-02, passed 5-7-01; Am. Ord. 2002-05, passed 7-1-02)
§ 50.38 BILLING AND COLLECTION; BILLING ADJUSTMENTS.
   (A)   Billing and collection. The Clerk-Treasurer shall be directly
responsible for the billing and collection of rates and charges of the
Monticello Water and Sewage Utilities. Pursuant to IC 36-4-10-7(c), the Clerk-
Treasurer shall appoint those employees who are responsible for such billing
and collection, which employees shall serve at the Clerk-Treasurer's pleasure.
   (B)   Billing adjustments.
      (1)   Appropriate adjustments shall be made for billing errors on part of
the Utility Office. One billing adjustment due to a sudden and accidental water
leak per customer may be approved within a 24 month period. The account
adjustment may be made for up to a maximum of 30 consecutive days limited to
within portions of up to two billing cycles. Property owner/tenant/
representative must apply for the adjustment, in person, to the Board of Public
Works within 30 days of a customer's receipt of its monthly utility bill unless
it can show there are extenuating circumstances (i.e. sickness, vacations,
etc.). The consumption spike must be higher than 25% of the average utility
bill from the prior 12 months. The leak must be repaired prior to the approval
of an adjustment. If the source of a leak or excessive water usage is due to
theft or vandalism, the customer must report the theft or vandalism to the
police. A copy of the police report must be submitted with the application for
a water leak adjustment in a timely manner. Should the customer or party in
control of the property fail to repair the leak within a reasonable time
period, as determined by the city, no adjustment will be granted. Customer or
personal representative must present their case to the Board of Works, either
in person or virtually. If an adjustment is approved the next opportunity for
an adjustment by the same customer would be after two years. Example: If the
approval date is 9-1-23, next opportunity for an adjustment would be 9-2-25. No
refund checks will be issued for approved account adjustments.
      (2)   Other billing adjustments, including incorrect tariff applications,
may be adjusted to the known date of error or for a period of one year,
whichever period is shorter.
      (3)   Discounted utility use shall be considered on a case-by-case basis
for users that contribute more than 5% of the average dry-weather flow to the

         (c)   After applying the sanitary waste exclusion above, discharges in
the above divisions that have a volume exceeding 25,000 gallons per day or the
weight of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) or suspended solids (SS) equivalent
to that weight found in 25,000 gallons per day of sanitary waste are considered
industrial users. SANITARY WASTE shall have the same meaning as “normal
domestic wastes” defined in this section.
      (2)   Any nongovernmental user of the city's sewage works which
discharges waste water to the treatment works which contains toxic pollutants
or poisonous solids, liquids or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or
by interaction with other wastes, to contaminate the sludge of any municipal
systems, or injure or interfere with any sewage treatment process, or which
constitutes a hazard to humans or animals, creates a public nuisance, or
creates any hazard in or has an adverse effect on the waters receiving any
discharge from the treatment works.
   NONINDUSTRIAL USERS. Any user of the city's sewage works which does not meet
the definition of “industrial user.”
   NORMAL DOMESTIC WASTES. Wastes which do not exceed a BOD strength of 200 mg/

other services not included under the specific project number and the approved
plans, specifications and approved change orders for the project which are on
file in the city hall, and by reference made a part of this subchapter as fully
as if same were attached hereto or incorporated herein.
   RECONSTRUCTION AND EXPANSION AMOUNTS. Those amounts which represent a
minimum of 80% of the amount retained by the city, together with interest
earned thereon. These amounts shall be used solely for reconstruction and
expansion of waste treatment facilities which must be approved by the U. S.
Environmental Protection Agency. The remaining 20% of retained amounts may be
used at the discretion of the city.
   RECOVERED AMOUNTS. The annual payments from industrial users for their share
of the federal grant allocable to the cost of treating industrial waste, which
is determined by dividing the amount of the total federal grant, allocable to
the treatment of industrial waste, by the recovery period.

trade or process discharges.
('77 Code, § 20-73) (Ord. 375, passed 4-3-78; Am. Ord. 412, passed 7-16-79)
§ 51.101 RATES AND CHARGES.
   In order to comply with federal regulations, in the case of federal grant
assistance for the construction of waste treatment works, where it has been
determined that “industrial users” as defined in
§ 51.100 above, or as amended by appropriate federal regulations, are required
to reimburse a portion of the federal grant amount allocable to the capital
cost of construction facilities for the treatment of industrial wastes, rates
and charges shall be collected from each industrial user connected to the
municipal sewage works or who otherwise discharges sewage, water or liquids,
either directly or indirectly, into the municipal waste treatment system, which
charges shall be payable as hereinafter provided and shall be in an amount
determinable as follows:
   (A)   (1)   The industrial cost recovery charges for the treatment of
industrial wastes shall be based upon the volume of sewage flow billed to
industrial users, as determined in accordance with appropriate provisions for
determining billed flow included in the rate ordinance and the total strength
and character of industrial wastes which is introduced into the waste treatment
system.
      (2)   The strength and character of industrial wastes shall be measured
at the industrial user's expense as provided for in the rate ordinance and
furnished to the city.
      (3)   The owner or industrial user shall furnish a central sampling point
available to the city at all times. In the event that measurement of the
strength and character of industrial wastes are not provided to the city on a
timely basis, the measurements of the strength and character of industrial
wastes shall be determined by the city on the basis of a sample, authorized
hereunder, to be taken by the city for the purpose of appropriate billing.
      (4)   The industrial cost recovery rates for the treatment of wastes
shall be as follows:
         (a)   Monthly volume flow, which includes normal domestic wastes (BOD
200 mg/l, suspended solids 210 mg/l and phosphorus 10 mg/l, per 100 cubic feet,
$0.165.
         (b)   Monthly pounds of BOD in excess of 200 mg/l, per pound, $0.024.
         (c)   Monthly pounds of suspended solids in excess of 210 mg/l, per
pound, $0.042.
         (d)   Monthly pounds of phosphorus in excess of 10 mg/l, per pound,
$0.085.
   (B)   The rates stated in division (A)(4) above, would result in total
recovery of the federal grant amount if all users were subject to the
industrial cost recovery requirement, and provided that the treatment plant was
operated at capacity during the cost recovery period. Therefore, these rates
will ensure that each industrial user will pay only that portion of the federal
grant amount applicable to the costs of the treatment facilities actually
utilized to treat industrial wastes, as determined by each industrial user's
flow and pollutant loadings.
   (C)   In the event an industrial user can and does show to the satisfaction
of the city that a portion of the total monthly billed sewage flow is from
sanitary conveniences, then the flow and pollutant loadings to which the
industrial cost recovery charge is applied shall be determined on the basis of
net flow and pollutant loadings excluding sanitary conveniences.
   (D)   The industrial cost recovery charges for treatment services on or
after the effective date as stated in
§ 51.106 shall be prepared and billed quarterly.
('77 Code, § 20-74) (Ord. 375, passed 4-3-78; Am. Ord. 412, passed 7-16-79)
§ 51.102 MANNER TO DETERMINE USERS TO BE SUBJECT TO CHARGE.
   The city shall determine which users are subject to paying the industrial
cost recovery charges, in the following manner:
   (A)   The city shall require appropriate employees of the sewage works to
review billing records and prepare a list of all potential industrial users, as
identified in each of the divisions listed in
§ 51.100, above.
   (B)   The list of all potential industrial users shall be analyzed on the
basis of data available at the sewage works billing office (for example, type
of business, volume charges, excessive loading charges, estimated number of
employees, and the like) for the purpose of developing preliminary lists of
probable industrial and probable nonindustrial users.
   (C)   The city shall conduct an immediate survey of all probable industrial
users in order to substantiate the validity of classifying a particular user as
an industrial user. Users initially classified as an industrial user shall be
notified as to their classification.
   (D)   After completing the survey of all probable industrial users, the city
shall review the list of probable nonindustrial users to determine if the
initial classification of any of these users should be reconsidered. Where
appropriate, individual users will be contacted in order to determine the
proper classification.
   (E)   After an industrial user has been notified of his classification, the
user may request reconsideration by furnishing data and measurements acceptable
to the city for the determination of sewage discharges. The city shall have the
right to measure and determine the strength and content of all sewage and waste
discharges, either directly or indirectly, into the city's sanitary sewage
system, in such manner and by such method as it may deem practicable in the
light of the conditions and attending circumstances of each case in order to
determine the proper user classification.
   (F)   Within a reasonable period of time following completion of the sewage
works construction project, the city shall have completed the initial
classification of all industrial users. During the first calendar year of
operation, subsequent to completion of the construction project, and annually
thereafter, the city will review, classify and reclassify all users as either
industrial or nonindustrial users based upon measurements and data obtained by
the city or furnished by individual users. Normally, each user will retain his
classification until the next succeeding classification period. However, if
there is a substantial change in the strength, volume or delivery flow rate
characteristics introduced into the treatment works by an individual user, then
the classification of that user may be reviewed and established during the year
in the light of the conditions and attending circumstances of each case.
('77 Code, § 20-75) (Ord. 375, passed 4-3-78)
§ 51.103 ACCOUNTING PROCEDURE.
   The city shall account for all industrial cost recovery payments in the
following manner:
   (A)   All revenues derived from the industrial cost recovery rates and
charges shall be segregated and kept in a special fund, separate and apart from
all other funds of the city. The special fund shall be designated the Sewage
Works Industrial Cost Recovery Fund, and payment of said amount into said fund
shall be deemed a reasonable expense of operation of the sewage works for the
purpose of computing net operating revenue.
   (B)   Within 45 days following the end of the first calendar year after
completion of construction of the sewage facilities and annually thereafter,
the city shall return 50% of the amounts recovered through the industrial cost
recovery charges, together with any interest earned thereon, to the U.S.
Treasury. The remaining 50% retained by the city shall be invested in
authorized obligations of the U.S. government or any agency thereof.
   (C)   Eighty percent of the funds retained by the city in the Sewage Works
Industrial Cost Recovery Fund or authorized investments and the interest earned
thereon, shall be expended only for the purpose of eligible costs of expansion
or reconstruction of the treatment works. All such expansion or reconstruction
programs must be approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to
commitment or expenditure of the retained funds. The remaining 20% of the funds
retained by the city may be utilized for any authorized use associated with the
sewage works.
('77 Code, § 20-76) (Ord. 375, passed 4-3-78)
§ 51.104 REVIEW OF RECORDS BY FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVES.
   Upon request from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the city shall
encourage each industrial user to permit representatives of the EPA to review
appropriate industrial sewage records for the purpose of independently
verifying the flow and characteristics of industrial wastes which are
introduced into the treatment works. No waste introduced into the waste
treatment system shall interfere with the operation or performance of the
sewage treatment works. All users are subject to the requirements of
pretreatment standards established by federal and state law.

§ 51.118 QUANTITY OF WATER.
   The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewerage system and
obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the city shall be
determined by the city in such manner as the city shall reasonably elect, and
the sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates. Further, as
is hereinafter provided in this section, the city may make proper allowances in
determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be
consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the city that such
quantities do not enter the sanitary sewage system.
   (A)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the city
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the city, and the water used thereon or
therein is not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not
acceptable to the city, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise
measured or determined by the city. In order to ascertain the rate or charge
provided in this chapter, the owner or other interested party shall, at his
expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or
any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the
determination of sewage discharge. If there is not meter or any adequate and
approved method of measurement for residential lots or residential parcels of
real estate, then the service charge for such sewage service shall be $27.85
per month.
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the city's
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the city and, in addition, is a user of
water from another source which is not measured by a water meter or is measured
by a meter not acceptable to the city, then the amount of water used shall be
otherwise measured or determined by the city. In order to ascertain the rates
or charges, the owner or other interested parties, shall, at his expense,
install and maintain meters weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the
determination of sewage discharge.
   (C)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the city's
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in
excess of 4,000 cubic feet per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction
of the city that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters
does not and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other
interested party shall install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring
devices, or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the
city for the determination of sewage discharge.
(Ord. 98-7, passed 3-2-98)
§ 51.119 RATE SURCHARGE.
   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably adjusted to
the service rendered to industrial users, the city shall base its charges not
only on the volume, but also on strength and character of its stronger-than-
normal domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose of.
The city shall require the industrial user to determine the strength and
content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly in
to the sanitary sewage system, in such manner and by such method as the city
may deem practicable in the light of the conditions and attending circumstances
of the case, in order to determine the proper charge. The industrial user shall
furnish a central sampling point available to the city at all times.
   (A)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a biochemical
oxygen demand of 220 milligrams per liter of fluid, suspended solids in excess
of 230 milligrams per liter of fluid, phosphorus in excess of 10 milligrams per
liter of fluid, and ammonia in excess of 18 milligrams per liter of fluid.
Additional charges for treating stronger-than-normal domestic waste shall be
made on the following basis:
      (1)   Rate Surcharge Based Upon Suspended Solids. There shall be an
additional charge of $.19 per pound for suspended solids received in excess of
230 milligrams per liter of fluid.
      (2)   Rate Surcharge Based Upon BOD. There shall be an additional charge
of $.20 per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for BOD received in excess of
220 milligrams per liter of fluid.
      (3)   Rate Surcharge Based Upon Phosphorus. There shall be an additional
charge of $.72 per pound for phosphorus received in excess of 10 milligrams per
liter of fluid.
      (4)   Rate Surcharge Based Upon Ammonia. There shall be an additional
charge of $.71 per pound of ammonia received in excess of 18 milligrams per
liter of fluid.
   (B)   The determination of Suspended Solids and a Five-day Biochemical
Oxygen Demand contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the latest
copy of “Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage, and Industrial
Wastes,” as written by the American Public Health Association, the American
Water Works Association, the Water Pollution Control Federation, and in
conformance with “Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of
Pollutants,” Regulation CFR Part 136, published in the Federal Register on
October 16, 1973.
(Ord. 98-7, passed 3-2-98)
§ 51.120 BILLING.
   Such rates and charges shall be prepared, billed, and collected by the city
in the manner provided by law and ordinance.
   (A)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed
monthly.
   (B)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying

the various users of user classes, the city shall cause a study to be made
within a reasonable period of time following the first 12 months of operation,
following the date on which this subchapter goes into effect. Such study shall
include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the costs associated with the

following the normal accounting period, the city shall cause a similar study to
be made for the purpose of reviewing the fairness and equity of the rates and
charges for sewage services on a continuing basis. The studies shall be
conducted by offices or employees of the city or by a firm of certified public
accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers, which firms shall have
experience in such studies, or by such combination of officers, employees,
certified public accountants, or engineers as the city shall determine to be
best under the circumstances.

   (A)   If the person owning, keeping or harboring an animal which has been
impounded, notifies the Shelter Keeper within three days of his claim to such
animal, the Shelter Keeper shall permit such persons to redeem the animal by
paying a shelter fee plus a maintenance fee for each day or fraction thereof
during which the animal was impounded; also, in the case of dogs, by paying to
the township assessor any license fee due for the current year. If such
impounded animal has received medical or surgical attention, the person
redeeming such animal shall also pay the cost thereof to the City Clerk-
Treasurer who will authorize release to the owner by the Shelter Keeper. Such
shelter fees and maintenance fees shall be as established from time to time by
the Board of Public Works and Safety.
   (B)   Any animal, except for licensed dogs, may be redeemed by anyone upon
paying to the Shelter Keeper all accrued fees anytime after the three day
period as also set forth in division (A), above.
   (C)   Licensed dogs shall not be redeemed by other than the owner prior to
the expiration of three days. The owner shall be liable for the shelter fee and
maintenance fee set forth in this subchapter; provided however, that wherever
the Shelter Keeper can reasonably determine the owner of an animal, he shall
notify such owner, in writing, that he has three days to redeem said animal by
paying the accrued shelter and maintenance fees and tax, if any, by depositing
such notice in the U.S. Mail, postage prepaid, addressed to such owner at his
last known address certified with return receipt requested.
   (D)   An animal which appears to be suffering from rabies, mange or other
infectious diseases shall not be released, but shall be forthwith destroyed, if
it has not bitten anyone. If a dog is suspected of having rabies, or has bitten
a person and has not been immunized for rabies, such dog shall be immediately
confined by a leash or chain on the owner's premises and shall thereafter be
impounded by the city at the expense of the owner for a period of 15 days for
observation. Every owner, or other person, upon ascertaining or suspecting a
dog is rabid, shall immediately notify the city police who shall either remove
the dog for observation or summarily destroy it.
   (E)   Where the Shelter Keeper is a licensed veterinarian and determines
that any impounded animal requires medical and/or surgical or dental treatment
he may provide such treatment immediately, and the prior consent of the owner
of said animal to said treatment shall not be required.
   (F)   Except for licensed dogs, any animal which is not redeemed may be
destroyed by the Shelter Keeper anytime after the three-day period set forth
above.
   (G)   Licensed dogs which are not redeemed by their owners may be destroyed
by the Shelter Keeper anytime after the three-day period set forth above, or
upon expiration of the three-day notice to the owner, whichever is later.
   (H)   The Shelter Keeper may also give any impounded animal away, rather
than destroying it, if a suitable home can be found for the animal.
   (I)   Where the Shelter Keeper is a licensed veterinarian and determines
that an impounded animal is incurably ill or injured, or is suffering unduly,
he may destroy the animal immediately, and the prior consent of the owner of
said animal shall not be required.

§ 92.01 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the “Monticello Disaster Emergency
Declaration Ordinance” and shall apply to all streets or rights-of-way
maintained by the Street Department.
(Ord. 2012-02, passed 3-19-12)
§ 92.02 PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The Mayor, after consultation with:
      (1)   The Police Chief;
      (2)   The City Street Superintendent; and
      (3)   The County Emergency Management/ Homeland Security Director;
if available, or the respective representative designated by each as the person
to consult in his/her absence for the purpose of recommending a declaration of
local disaster emergency, may declare a local disaster emergency that may also
contain a “warning level” travel advisory by executive order when, in the
Mayor's judgment, such order would be appropriate under IC 10-14-3-29 and in
the best interest of the public safety and welfare of city residents.
   (B)   If, with or without the issuance of a declaration of local disaster
emergency, the Mayor determines that conditions require an “advisory” or
“watch” level of travel advisory, the Mayor may issue an “advisory” or a
“watch” travel advisory.
   (C)   Pursuant to IC 10-14-3-29.5, a “warning” level travel advisory may be
issued only after or as a part of a declaration of local disaster emergency.
Such emergency shall continue in effect until the Mayor thereafter determines
an emergency no longer exists and terminates the emergency order.
   (D)   The Mayor may declare a “warning” level travel advisory upon the
Mayor's determination that the conditions are appropriate for the issuance of a
local disaster emergency under IC 10-14-3-29, and the further determination
that the criteria set forth in §
92.03 below have been met.
(Ord. 2012-02, passed 3-19-12)
§ 92.03 LOCAL TRAVEL ADVISORIES.
   A local travel advisory shall be declared in accordance with IC10-14-3-29.5
and this chapter. The purpose of a local travel advisory is to keep the city
residents informed of the weather and city street road conditions, and to
assist the Street Department in the clearing of the city streets by eliminating
stranded vehicles.
   (A)   Advisory level travel advisory. This level may be declared when
routine travel or activities may be restricted in areas of the city because of
a hazardous situation; citizens should use caution or avoid these areas.
Schools and businesses may begin to implement their emergency action plans.
   (B)   Watch level travel advisory. This level may be declared when
conditions are threatening to the safety of the public. Only essential travel
is recommended (i.e., to and from work, emergency situations, and the like). At
this level, emergency action plans should be implemented by businesses,
schools, government agencies and other organizations.
   (C)   Warning level travel advisory. This level may be declared when streets
have become impassable and the Street Department is not able to keep the
streets cleared because extreme weather conditions, such as a severe snowfall,
high drifts or blizzard-like conditions, are present. Travel may be restricted
to emergency management workers only and essential emergency travel by members
of the public, such as privately employed health care workers, as the Mayor may
further direct. Further restrictions that the Mayor deems necessary may be
included within the local disaster declaration.
(Ord. 2012-02, passed 3-19-12) Penalty, see §
92.99
§ 92.04 PUBLICATION.
   Any order or proclamation declaring, continuing or terminating a local
disaster emergency shall be given prompt and general publicity, and shall be
filed promptly in the office of the Clerk-Treasurer pursuant to IC 10-14-3-22
(b)(2). Publication and broadcast of an advisory, watch or warning level travel
advisory shall be made or caused to be made by the Mayor using a press release
to all law enforcement agencies, fire departments, hospitals and news media in
the city. The declaration shall be promptly forwarded to the Indiana Department
of Homeland Security and shall be kept on file by the Clerk-Treasurer and the
County Emergency Management Agency/Department of Homeland Security.
(Ord. 2012-02, passed 3-19-12)
§ 92.05 EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   Vehicles exempt from the travel and parking restrictions imposed in a
travel advisory pursuant to this chapter include medical assistance, law
enforcement, fire department, emergency management, public utility, and fuel-
hauling vehicles, and employees of any of the above exempt services, if engaged
in performing their respective duties.
   (B)   Any other vehicles violating this chapter or any of the parking
restrictions contained in a local declaration of disaster emergency or a
“warning” travel advisory are subject to removal by towing or other means at
the expense of the owner of the vehicle, when such towing and/or removal is
deemed necessary by a duly authorized representative of any one or more of the
following: the Street Department, the Police Department, the Fire Department,
the County Sheriff's Department, a State Conservation Officer, or the Indiana
State Police.
(Ord. 2012-02, passed 3-19-12) Penalty, see §
92.99
§ 92.99 PENALTY.
   Any persons violating any provisions of this chapter or the vehicle use or

a “warning” travel advisory shall be guilty of the commission of an infraction,
and may be fined any sum not to exceed $100. The infraction shall be
enforceable in the County Superior Court. In addition to such fine, the Court
shall be authorized to direct the violator to repay the city any monetary
losses or expenses incurred in the incident.

(hereinafter “these regulations”).
(Ord. 98-16, passed 9-8-98)
§ 112.02 PURPOSES.
   (A)   The City of Monticello has previously recognized the necessity to
regulate the location and installation of wireless communications facilities
within the city and, on April 20, 1998, entered into a wireless communications
consulting and marketing contract for the purpose of promoting the placement of
such facilities on existing city utility structures.
   (B)   In order to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community, while accommodating the communication needs of residents and
business these regulations are necessary in order to:
      (1)   Facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunication services to
the residents and businesses of the City of Monticello;
      (2)   Minimize adverse visual effects of towers through careful design
and siting standards;
      (3)   Encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas through
performance standards and incentives;
      (4)   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through structural standards and setback requirements; and,
      (5)   Provide mechanisms for the mitigation of tower proliferation
through tower sharing requirements for all new tower applicants and those
existing towers that are physically capable of sharing.
(Ord. 98-16, passed 9-8-98)
§ 112.03 AUTHORITY.
   The Common Council of the City of Monticello (hereinafter “Council”) is
vested with the authority to review, approve, conditionally approve, and
disapprove applications for wireless communication facilities, including
sketch, preliminary, and final plans.
(Ord. 98-16, passed 9-8-98)

County Area Plan Commission.
(Ord. 98-16, passed 9-8-98)
§ 112.05 ENACTMENT.
   In order that wireless communications facilities may be constructed in

provisions of these regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements
for the protection of public health, safety, and general welfare. These
regulations shall be construed broadly to promote the purposes for which they
are adopted.
   (B)   Conflict. These regulations are not intended to interfere with,
abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other
provision of law except as provided in these regulations. Where any provision
of these regulations imposes restrictions different from any other ordinance,
rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law, the provision which is
more restrictive or imposes higher standards shall control.
   (C)   Separability. If any part or provision of these regulations or the
application of these regulations to any service provider or circumstances is
adjudged invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, the judgment shall be
confirmed in its operations to the part, provision, or application which is
