§ 10.01 TITLE OF CODE.
   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the county, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered and consolidated into component codes, titles,
chapters and sections, shall be known and designated as the “Marshall County
Code,” for which designation “code of ordinances,” “codified ordinances” or
“code” may be substituted. Code title, chapter and section headings do not
constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.
§ 10.02 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.03 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.04 CONSTRUCTION OF CODE.
   (A)   This code is a codification of previously existing laws, amendments
thereto and newly enacted laws. Any previously existing law or amendment
thereto reenacted by this code shall continue in operation and effect, as if it
had not been repealed by this code. All rules and regulations adopted under
laws reenacted in this code shall remain in full force and effect unless
repealed or amended subsequent to the enactment of this code.
   (B)   Any appropriation repealed and reenacted by this code is continued
only for the period designated in the original enactment of that appropriation.
   (C)   The numerical order and position of sections in this code does not
resolve a conflict between two or more sections.
   (D)   Any irreconcilable conflict between sections shall be resolved by
reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or division.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning, application
or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)
§ 10.05 RULES OF INTERPRETATION; DEFINITIONS.

or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.

feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,
and words in the plural shall include the singular; the use of a verb in the

definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.

§ 10.06 SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   If any section of this code now enacted or subsequently amended or its
application to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid section
or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is severable.
If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of
whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a section or amendment stating that the provisions of a

refers to any board, bureau, commission, division, department, officer, agency,
authority or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; on the effective date of that ordinance or following the
effective date, the rights, powers, duties or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date
or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which the duties,
liabilities, powers and rights were transferred.
(I.C. 1-1-6-1)
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
the error.
§ 10.10 REASONABLE TIME.
   (A)   In all cases where an ordinance requires an act to be done in a
reasonable time or requires reasonable notice to be given, REASONABLE TIME OR
NOTICE shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of the act or the giving of the notice.

be computed by excluding the first day and including the last. If the last day
be a Saturday, Sunday or a state holiday, it shall be excluded.
§ 10.11 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected
by the repeal and reenactment; but all suits, proceedings and prosecutions for

enacted.

County Information Technology Department so that the restriction on that
address can be lifted.
   (J)   The county is not liable for failure to timely restrict disclosure of
an address under this chapter unless the county’s act or omission constitutes
gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct (see I.C. 36-1-8.5-12).
   (K)   The public access of removed information can only be done at the
request of the original covered person. Per the code, a covered person may
request reinstatement of their excluded information. Should any changes to the
title of a covered parcel be made, the existing residence will be removed from
the list of confidential properties. A new request will need to be made in
order to have the parcel covered.
   (L)   All requests made to the unit by a covered person are confidential
(see I.C. 36-1-8.5-11).
   (M)   This section is in effect for the covered person’s primary residence
only per I.C. 36-1-8.5-7. If a covered person owns or is involved in additional
properties that might be utilized as a primary home address or as a mailing
address, such parcels will be displayed unless the covered person wishes to
have those addresses restricted as well and which will require a $25 fee
applied upon submission.
   (N)   The county reserves the right to amend or revise the contents of this
section. Further, a copy of this section shall be circulated to the local
judges, law enforcement officers through the local law enforcement agencies in
the county, and other local units of government who may have individuals that
are included as a covered person. The County Prosecutor’s office will be sent a
copy of this section for distribution to any victim of domestic violence that
may be a covered person.

§ 32.19 COUNTY PUBLIC PROPERTY DATABASE USE.
   (A)   The county hereinafter adopts and incorporates by reference I.C. 36-1-
8.5-1 through 36-1-8.5-12 and any amendments thereto.
   (B)   I.C. 36-1-8.5-2 defines a covered person as:
      (1)   A judge;
      (2)   A law enforcement officer;
      (3)   A victim of domestic violence; and
      (4)   A public official.
   (C)   The county’s public property database website is an internet website
that is: available to the general public over the internet; does not require
registration, subscription or the creation of a username and password to search
the website; and connects a covered person’s home address to the covered
person’s name so that a search of the website for the covered person’s name
discloses the covered person’s home address.
   (D)   Upon proper request, the duty to prevent disclosure of an address as
it falls under I.C. 36-1-8.5 rests upon the County Information Technology
Department.
   (E)   (1)   A covered person may submit a completed form to the County
Information Technology Department, which form will include the information
necessary for restricting that covered person’s home address. A copy of the
form is attached to the ordinance codified in this section. The form may be
obtained in the County Auditor office for submittal to the Information
Technology Department. The forms will be returned to the Auditor’s office and
maintained in a confidential file.
      (2)   If requested, the covered person may be required to certify or
provide proof of additional information. Victims of domestic violence must
submit proof of program participation as is required by statute.
   (F)   If an application for restriction is denied by the County Information
Technology Department, the applicant may appeal such denial to the Board of
County Commissioners.
   (G)   As a result of the request, the following changes will be made to the
appropriate county information system or third-party systems managed by the
county.
      (1)   GIS. The search results for GIS will reflect the changes made to
the database for those records marked as “confidential.” It is the intention of
the county to comply with the intent of the code to not make the property
accessible by means of removing the link between name and parcel information.
      (2)   Portal. Once the option to suppress has been enabled to a specific
parcel, it will not be returned in search results or display on the map.
   (H)   Victims of domestic violence will not be required to pay a fee for
restricted access. A fee of $25 per parcel will be accessed for all other
covered person requests. An additional $25 per parcel fee will be accessed for
any changes to the title of the parcel or relocation of the covered person. All
fees collected will be deposited to the County General Fund.
   (I)   (1)   It is requested and recommended that a covered person having
submitted the form shall resubmit the form on an annual recurring basis so as
to assist the County Information Technology Department in assuring that the
covered person’s home address is restricted on the database website. However,
there is no additional fee for the recurring form filing. If a form has not
been submitted for five years, the address with the restricted access will be
automatically lifted.
      (2)   If a covered person moves from an address that is restricted, the
covered person must submit a written request to allow public access on the
public property database website to the County Auditor for forwarding to the
County Information Technology Department so that the restriction on that
address can be lifted.
   (J)   The county is not liable for failure to timely restrict disclosure of
an address under this chapter unless the county’s act or omission constitutes
gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct. See I.C. 36-1-8.5-12.
   (K)   The public access of removed information can only be done at the
request of the original covered person. Per the code, a covered person may
request reinstatement of his or her excluded information. Should any changes to
the title of a covered parcel be made, the existing residence will be removed
from the list of confidential properties. A new request will need to be made in
order to have the parcel covered.
   (L)   All requests made to the unit by a covered person are confidential.
See I.C. 36-1-8.5-11.
   (M)   This policy is in effect for the covered person’s primary residence
only per I.C. 36-1-8.5-7. If a covered person owns or is involved in additional
properties that might be utilized as a primary home address or as a mailing
address, such parcels will be displayed unless the covered person wishes to
have those addresses restricted as well and which will require a $25 fee
applied upon submission.
   (N)   The county reserves the right to amend or revise the contents of this
policy and ordinance. Further, a copy of this section shall be circulated to
the local judges, law enforcement officers through the local law enforcement
agencies in the county, and other local units of government who may have
individuals that are included as a covered person. The County Prosecutor’s
office will be sent a copy of this section for distribution to any victim of
domestic violence that may be a covered person.

§ 32.20 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
   The County Board of Commissioners establishes and adopts this Gift Rule/
Conflict of Interest Policy.
   (A)   Policy. The following provisions apply to all public officials and
employees of the county.
      (1)   No officers or employees of the county shall neither solicit nor
accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary value from consultants,
potential consultants or parties to subagreements, unless in accordance with
this Conflict of Interest Policy. The aforementioned prohibition does not
include gratuities, favors or anything of monetary value under $100 per day,
any financial interest under $100 per day shall be considered not substantial
in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations.
      (2)   This policy conforms to the standards set forth in the Code of
Federal Regulations and by the State Department of Transportation. For the
purpose of this section, a CONSULTANT is defined as an individual or firm
providing engineering and design-related services as a party to a contract with
a recipient or subrecipient of federal assistance.
   (B)   Application. The terms of this policy apply to all elected officials
and employees of the county.
   (C)   Exceptions.
      (1)   The dollar value of $100 per day, below which any financial
interest or value of any gratuity is not substantial and may be accepted per
this policy.

political committee formed to support any elected official or employee’s
candidacy for elected office.
(Ord. 2017-26, passed 11-6-2017)

   The county’s Title VI Nondiscrimination Implementation Plan and Policy
attached to the ordinance codified herein is hereby adopted and shall be in
full force and effect upon adoption.
(Ord. 2020-05, passed 1-6-2020)
§ 32.22 CREDIT CARDS AND PURCHASING CARDS.
   (A)   This section is adopted in compliance with the State Board of Accounts
Accounting and Uniform Compliance Guidelines Manual for Counties, Chapter 1,
authorizing certain elected officials and department heads to use credit cards
for certain purchases.
   (B)   (1)   The issuance and handling of said credit cards shall be
administered by the County Auditor. The Auditor will maintain a log, which
would include the names of the individual’s requesting usage of the cards,
their position, estimated amounts to be charged, fund and account numbers to be
charged, date the card is issued and returned.
      (2)   When the purpose for which the credit card has been issued and
accomplished, the credit card should be immediately returned to the custody of
the Auditor’s office.
   (C)   It will be the responsibility of the elected official or department
head to safeguard the usage and security of said cards. If the elected official
or department head elects a designee to use the credit card, it must be logged
to clearly indicate the physical custody of said credit card to that employee,
and the related physical transfer back to the holder. Designated cardholders
shall sign the attached statement pledging receipt and responsibility.
   (D)   Payment of credit card charges shall be subject to the audit
requirements of Accounts Payable claim vouchers in conformity with I.C. 5-11-10
and 36-4-8, along with the compliance procedures of the State Board of
Accounts. It is the responsibility of the cardholder or the designee to obtain
proper itemized receipts other than the credit card receipt for the item
charged.
   (E)   Credit card and purchasing card charges that do not meet state audit
requirements, including charges that include the imposition of state sales tax
for which the county is otherwise exempt, are the responsibility of the
employee authorizing the charge. The State Department of Revenue General Sales
Tax Exemption Certificate, Form ST-105, is available upon request to the
Auditor’s office.
   (F)   The credit cards will only be used in the performance of county
business for purchase of goods or services for the official business of the
county, including supplies, certain hotel charges and certain equipment
purchases. County credit cards can only be used to purchase items and services
already approved for purchase within the budget as approved by the County
Council and accounted for in a specific line item of the budget. Credit cards
should be used for purchases requiring an immediate need. Cards may not be used
for entertainment, or any personal charges by the holder. Personal use of
county credit cards is expressly prohibited. Such use would be subject to
personnel action as described in the County Personnel Policies Handbook § 6.13,
Employee Conduct.
   (G)   Upon completion of the credit card transaction, elected officials or
department heads must complete an accounts payable voucher with all proper
itemized receipts and submit to the Auditor’s office at least seven business
days from the date of the transaction. If interest charges or late fees are
incurred as a result, it will be the financial responsibility of the cardholder
to pay those fees. Payment will not be made based on a statement or credit card
slip only. Procedures for payments should be no different than for any other
claim. Supporting documents such as paid bills and receipts must be submitted.
Additionally, any interest or penalty incurred due to late filing or furnishing
of documentation by an officer or employee will be the responsibility of that
officer or employee.
   (H)   The Auditor’s office will review each credit card statement and all
documentation submitted by county employees to ensure transactions comply with
the policy. Any transactions not submitted with an itemized credit card receipt
and a signed voucher will be immediately investigated. Transactions that do not
appear to comply with this policy will be reported to the Commissioners.
   (I)   Each month, the balance due on the credit cards for all verified
transactions will be paid when they are due to avoid the assessment of interest
and late charges. The Commissioners will not approve a payment to the entity
issuing the credit card until all transactions have been verified.
   (J)   County-issued credit cards are the property of the county, and if a
card is lost or stolen, the employee must report the missing card immediately
to the Auditor’s office.
   (K)   The County Commissioners further authorize an annual fee may be paid
for said credit cards, if required.

§ 33.010 FIXED ASSET CAPITALIZATION AND INVENTORY POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of establishing a capital asset policy is to:
      (1)   Safeguard the investments of the taxpayers of the county;
      (2)   Comply with the standards of the Government Accounting Standards
Board Statement 34;
      (3)   Fix responsibility for the custody of the assets;
      (4)   Maintain accurate records of all fixed assets that are capitalized,
including infrastructure;
      (5)   Provide data for financial reporting for increased accuracy and
clarity;
      (6)   Demonstrate appropriate stewardship responsibility for public
assets.
   (B)   Definition. For the purpose of this section, the following definition
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      CAPITAL ASSETS.
         (a)   Assets having a useful life of more than one year and an
acquisition cost of $5,000 or more. Capital assets include land, land
improvements, buildings, building improvements, machinery and equipment,
vehicles, construction work in progress, works of art, historical treasures and
infrastructure, the latter of which are long-lived capital assets that normally
are stationary in nature and normally can be preserved for a significantly
great number of years than most capital assets.
         (b)   All items with a useful life of more than one year and a cost of
$5,000 or more shall be capitalized, including acquisitions by lease-purchase
agreements and donated items. All land will be capitalized but not depreciated.
Construction work in progress will be included in the capital asset inventory
and will be depreciated once the project is complete and transferred to the
appropriate county department. Items costing less than $5,000 that are
permanently installed as a part of the cost of the original construction or
installation of a larger building or equipment unit, or that prolong a fixed
asset’s economic life or expand its usefulness, will be in included in the cost
of the larger unit.
         (c)   All capital assets meeting the criteria will be included in the
county’s fixed asset inventory and reported in the county’s financial
statements. Assets that are not capitalized are expensed in the year of
acquisition. Departments must maintain an inventory of capital assets under
their supervision.
   (C)   Capitalization threshold and inventory.
      (1)   Capitalization threshold.
         (a)   To be considered a fixed asset for financial reporting purposes,
an item must be at or above the capitalization threshold and have a cost
greater than $5,000. The cost of the asset will include all expenses necessary
to make the asset fully operational. Assets acquired through lease purchase
agreements that meet these specifications are to be capitalized. This cost will
be determined as the present value or discounted value of the future stream of
lease payments, and not the total lease.
         (b)   Capital assets are recorded at actual cost. Normally, the cost
recorded is the purchase price or construction cost of the asset, but it may
also include any other reasonable and necessary costs incurred to place the
asset in its intended location and intended use, including:
            1.   Legal and title fees and closing costs;
            2.   Appraisal and negotiation fees and surveying costs;
            3.   Land preparation costs and demolition costs;
            4.   Architect, engineering and accounting fees;
            5.   Transportation charges.

market value on the date donated. If no cost is available for a fixed asset, a
replacement cost or a historic cost index may be used. Items that do not meet
the definition of capital assets are to be expensed in the year the asset is
acquired.
      (2)   Capital assets valuation. Capital assets are defined by the
following categories.
         BUILDINGS and IMPROVEMENTS. All structures designed and erected to
house equipment, services or functions are included. This includes systems and
fixtures within the buildings and attachments such as stairs, fire escapes,
canopies, lighting fixtures, flagpoles and other items that serve the building.
Plumbing systems, lighting systems, heating, cooling, ventilating and air
handling systems, sound systems, surveillance systems, elevators, built-in
casework, walk-in coolers and freezers, fixed shelving and other fixed
equipment are included as building components.
         EQUIPMENT. Includes all other types of physical property, such as
mechanical equipment, heavy equipment, office furniture, appliances,
furnishings, machinery items, maintenance equipment, communication equipment,
laboratory equipment and data processing equipment. Supplies that typically get
used within one year are not included.
         INFRASTRUCTURE. Long-lived capital assets that normally can be
preserved for a significantly greater number of years than most capital and
that are normally stationary in nature. Examples include new roads, bridges,
stormwater and drainage systems.
         LAND. Specified land, lots, parcels or acreage including rights-of-way
owed by the county.
         VEHICLE. Includes all vehicles for which title and license must be
obtained including cars, trucks, buses, road-going trailers, dump trucks and
highway trucks. Vehicle accessories will be identified as a component asset of
the vehicle to which they are attached.
   (D)   Responsibilities for inventory and reporting of capital assets.
      (1)   Responsibilities of county departments.
         (a)   Department heads are the stewards for each piece of property
utilized by their department. The steward will be the focal point for questions
for availability, condition and usage of the asset.
         (b)   The steward shall be designated as the person to record the
receipt of the asset, to examine the asset to make sure no damage was incurred
during shipment and to make sure the asset was received in working order. The
steward is also responsible for arranging the necessary preventative
maintenance and any needed repairs to keep the asset in working condition. The
steward also ensures that the asset is used for the purpose for which it was
acquired and that there is no personal or unauthorized use. The steward is
responsible for reporting any loss, theft or damage to the assets.
         (c)   Departments are to maintain inventories of all capital assets,
including those that are capitalized and reported on the county’s capital asset
inventory and controllable assets with an acquisition cost of $4,999 or less
and which are tracked and inventoried.
         (d)   Department heads are to report newly acquired assets, retired
assets, transferred assets and assets in use that previously were not included
in the county’s asset inventory to the County Auditor’s office. Department
heads are required to use the Auditor’s office prescribed forms and to meet
with the Auditor’s office, or its designee, if necessary, for the proper
preparation of the capital asset reports.
         (e)   Department heads must abide by all Auditor office deadlines for
the reporting. Typically, asset reporting is to be completed by the first
Friday of the first full week in January each year.
         (f)   Assets below the capitalization threshold but considered
sensitive may include, but are not limited to, weapons, radios, computers,
chain saws, small motor equipment and power tools. These minor but sensitive
items shall be inventoried and controlled at the department level by the head
of the operating department. Stated inventory shall be conducted annually. The
County Auditor’s office is to receive a copy of the inventory and/or updated
inventories for minor but sensitive items.
         (g)   Department heads are responsible for ensuring that acquisitions
of capital assets follow all policies, statutes and regulations, including
proper advertising, use of proper budgetary codes and accounting forms and all
required appropriation approvals.
         (h)   The County Commissioners and the Auditor’s office may conduct
spot checks of the asset inventory and condition on a random, unannounced
basis.
      (2)   Responsibilities of the County Auditor’s office.
         (a)   The County Auditor’s office is responsible for ensuring that
accounting for capital assets is being exercised by establishing a capital
asset inventory that is updated annually for additions, retirements, transfers
and items retroactively added.
         (b)   The Auditor’s office is responsible for securing a fixed asset
advisor for the county, if deemed necessary, and for the financial reporting of
the capital assets, including depreciation expense and assets included in the
inventory but not depreciated.
   (E)   Depreciation methods.
      (1)   The county will depreciate capital assets by using the straight-
line method. Assets will be depreciated based on the estimated useful life of
each asset.
      (2)   The following are the estimated useful lives for each asset class:
Building components and improvements 20 year
Buildings                            50 years
Car                                  5 years

   (A)   Prior resolutions; areas to be designated.
      (1)   Except insofar as abatements now in effect have been granted under
prior ordinance or resolution, or except with respect to areas designated as
economic revitalization areas with respect to abatements previously granted,
the areas hereafter designated as economic revitalization areas shall be
specifically designated.
      (2)   After approval of any resolution designating an economic
revitalization area or approving an application for abatement within an
economic revitalization area, the County Council shall publish notice of the
adoption and substance of the resolution in accordance with I.C. 5-3-1 and file
the following information with each taxing unit in the geographic area where
the economic revitalization area is located:
         (a)   A copy of the notice published under I.C. 5-3-1; and

designation must meet the following requirements.
      (1)   Real property must be in an area which is undesirable for normal
development.
      (2)   The intended use of the property must be allowed by the applicable
zoning restrictions. If it is not, the necessary variance, rezoning or approval
petition must be on file at the time of the filing of the designation
application, and the variation, rezoning or approval petition must be approved
before the final hearing on the economic revitalization area resolution shall
be conducted.
      (3)   The application must be made by all owners of the properties or

permit or initiating construction on the project in the case of real property.
Exceptions may be allowed by the County Council if substantial evidence is
provided by the owner that the obtaining of a building permit or accomplishment
of construction was necessitated by emergency circumstances. Examples of
possible exceptions would be construction to an existing building to prevent
structural failure, repair damage resulting from fire or natural disaster, or
to protect a building from the damage effects of weather.
         (b)   The County Council may approve a supporting document which
elaborates upon and provides additional detail relative to the standards set
forth in this division (B)(6)(b) and in division (F) below. The supporting
document shall have the same force and effect as this section. Additionally,
the County Council may elect to periodically modify the standards set forth in
the support document. The supporting document may set forth quantitative scales
for rating a proposed project with respect to various parameters in several
categories, which may include measures of:

project; or
            9.   Other factors.
         (c)   The rating scales and their application to a particular project
shall be developed and approved by the County Council. Ratings derived under
the quantitative scales may be used by the County Council as factors for its
consideration in evaluating a project application, but in no event will any
rating result be determinative of the decision of the County Council.
Determinations are to be made within the description of the County Council
based on the overall merit of a particular project viewed in the context of the
development and other needs of the county.
   (C)   Additional criteria. In addition to the requirements prescribed by
I.C. 6-1.1-12.1, the County Council shall consider the following general
criteria in evaluating a proposed project:
      (1)   With respect to jobs:
         (a)   How many jobs will be created or retained by the project?
         (b)   How do pay and benefits for these jobs compare with current pay
and benefits in comparable businesses in the county and the surrounding area?
         (c)   Are the jobs to be offered of a type that county residents would
desire and/or qualify for?
         (d)   Does the business proposing the project have a record as a good
employer in the state and elsewhere?
         (e)   What is the potential for expansion of the project to provide
more jobs?
         (f)   Will the project’s presence in the county attract related
industry jobs to the county or result in the increase of jobs by existing
county employers?
      (2)   With respect to overall growth of business in the county:

         (b)   Will the project expand in later phases and/or attract
additional development?
         (c)   Does the project meet a need for development in the county that
is not being met by existing business?
         (d)   Will the project improve a blighted area or alleviate site-
problems, such as environmental contamination?
      (3)   With respect to the overall impact of the project:
         (a)   What impact will the project have on the infrastructure needs of
the county, such as roads, water, sewage and the like, and how will the cost
and non-monetary burdens resulting from the impact be met?
         (b)   What government services will the project require?
         (c)   What will be the effect on the local schools, and how does the
benefit of increased taxation from the project compare with any increased costs
to the school districts affected?
         (d)   Is the project environmentally friendly or does it pose a
significant risk of any adverse environmental impacts?
         (e)   Is the project a type of activity that is compatible with the
general quality of life for county residents?

provide financial information including, without limitation, financial
statements, balance sheets and particularly in the case of new enterprises with
limited historic financial information, a business plan. All financial
information provided to the County Council shall be confidential and may not be

into an appropriate confidentiality agreement with respect to financial
information submitted in connection with an application.
   (E)   Designation determined by confirming resolution. The economic
revitalization area designation for a project will be conditioned in such
manner that it will be effective only relative to the project, which is
described in the confirming resolution, as supplemented by information in the
application, site plans and elevations.
   (F)   Letter of commitment.
      (1)   The County Council shall require the applicants for economic
revitalization area designation submit a letter of commitment with the county
following adoption of a preliminary resolution. The letter of commitment shall
contain the capital investment levels, job creation and/or retention levels,
and hourly wage rates the applicant has committed to the county in order to
receive consideration for economic revitalization area designation. The letter
of commitment shall be submitted to the county before confirming resolution and
any tax abatement are approved.
      (2)   Additionally, the letter of commitment shall indicate that the
county, by and through the County Council, reserves the right to terminate an
economic revitalization area designation and the associated real and personal
property tax abatement deductions, if it determines that the applicant has not
made reasonable efforts to substantially comply with all of the commitments,
and the applicant’s failure to substantially comply with the commitment was not
due to factors beyond its control.
      (3)   If the county terminates the economic revitalization area
designation and associated tax abatement deductions, it may require the
applicant to repay the county all or a portion of the tax abatement savings
received through the date of such termination. Additional details relative to
the re-payment of tax abatement savings may be required to be in the letter of
commitment.
   (G)   Compliance review. Under the authority of I.C. 6-1.1-12.1-5.1(b), the
County Council will review project receiving economic revitalization area
designations for compliance with the capital investment levels, job creation
and/or retention levels, and hourly wage rates or salary levels contained in
the designation application, the project description contained in the
attachments to the final resolution designating the subject real estate as an
economic revitalization area, the approved statement of benefits form, and the
signed letter of commitment. Taxpayers receiving abatements or their
representatives, may be required to appear before the County Council when their
abatements are reviewed by the County Council to respond to questions from and
provide information to the County Council with respect to their compliance with
the terms and conditions of their abatements. The County Council may reduce the
dollar amount of, rescind the deduction in its entirety, or rescind the
deduction and require re-payment of all or a portion of the tax abatement
savings received by an applicant for failure to make reasonable efforts to
substantially comply.
   (H)   Time limit on designation. Unless otherwise stated in the resolution
applicable to a specific project, the economic revitalization area designation
shall terminate five years after the date of the final resolution; however,
this termination does not limit the length of time a taxpayer is entitled to
receive an abatement of property taxes to five years.
   (I)   Compliance with other laws and zoning. All applicants must comply with
other federal, state and local laws in order to be approved, which laws include
zoning restrictions and compliance with federal S.A.R.A. Title III, also known
as the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, being 40 C.F.R.
parts 350 through 372, and I.C. 13-25-1 concerning hazardous substance handling
and reporting.
   (J)   Effective date. This section shall be in full force and effect from
and after its passage; however, designation applications dated or filed prior
to enactment of this section and receiving abatements thereunder shall be
continued to be governed by any resolutions or any requirements contained
specifically for the prior abatements in the confining resolution applicable to
such project which will take precedence over matters contained herein.

county, which investigations have revealed that the state prima facie speed
limits are greater than is reasonable or safe under conditions found to exist
upon certain county roads and highways in the county as hereinafter designated,
and said investigations have further revealed that the speed limits of the
county roads and highways, as hereinafter noted, should be as hereinafter
designated.
      (5)   The County Board of Commissioners desires to establish reasonable
and safe maximum speed limits upon certain county highways in the county which
are lower than the prima facie speed limits prescribed by state law.

§ 70.04 DISASTER EMERGENCIES; COUNTY ROADS.
   (A)   Title. This section shall be known as the county’s Local Disaster
Emergency Declaration Ordinance and shall apply to all roads, highways or
rights-of-way maintained by the county highway department. The mandatory
provisions of this section and of any local disaster emergency issued pursuant
to the ordinance, including the prohibitions on travel and the penalties for
violating those prohibitions shall not apply to streets maintained by a city or
town within the county nor to a state highway maintained by the State
Department of Transportation, nor to a federal interstate highway situated
within the county.
   (B)   Procedure.
      (1)   The County Board of Commissioners, after consultation with the
County Highway Superintendent and the County Emergency Management Agency
Director, if available, or the respective representative designated by each of
the persons to consult in his or her absence for the purpose of recommending a
declaration of local disaster emergency, may declare a local disaster emergency
which may also contain a warning level travel advisory by executive order when,
in the Commissioners judgment, by majority rule, such order would be
appropriate under I.C. 10-14-3-29 and in the best interest of the public safety
and welfare of the residents of the county.
      (2)   If only one member of the County Board of Commissioners is
available to sign the declaration of local disaster emergency, he or she can
declare a local disaster emergency if he or she has obtained and documented the
verbal or written concurrence of at least one other Board member.
      (3)   If, with or without the issuance of a declaration of local disaster
emergency, the Board of Commissioners or the County Emergency Management Agency
Director determines that conditions require an advisory or watch level of
travel advisory, the Board of Commissioners, by majority rule or the Emergency
Management Agency Director, upon written notice to the Board of Commissioners
may issue an advisory or watch travel advisory.
      (4)   Pursuant to I.C. 10-14-3-29.5, a warning level travel advisory may
be issued only after as part of a declaration of a local disaster emergency.
Such emergency shall continue in effect until the above-mentioned Board members
and/or officials or their respective designees who declared the emergency
thereafter determine an emergency no longer exists and terminate the emergency
order.
      (5)   The Board of Commissioners may declare a warning level travel
advisory upon its determination that the conditions are appropriate for the
issuance of a local disaster emergency under I.C. 10-14-3-29, and the further
determination that the criteria set forth in division (C) below have been met.
   (C)   Local travel advisories. A local travel advisory shall be declared in
accordance with I.C. 10-14-3-29.5 and this section. The purpose of a local
travel advisory is to keep the residents of the county informed of the weather
and county road conditions, and to assist County Highway Department in the
clearing of the county roads by eliminating stranded vehicles.
      (1)   Advisory level travel advisory. This level may be declared when
routine travel or activities may be restricted in areas of the county because
of a hazardous situation individuals should use caution to avoid these areas.
Schools and businesses may begin to implement their emergency action plans.
      (2)   Watch level travel advisory. This level may be declared when
conditions are threatening to the safety of the public. Only essential travel
is recommended (i.e., to and from work, emergency situations and the like). At
this level, emergency action plans should be implemented by businesses,
schools, government agencies and other organizations.
      (3)   Warning level travel advisory. This level may be declared when
roads have become impassable and the County Highway Department is not able to
keep the roadways cleared due to extreme weather conditions. Such conditions
may include ice covered roads, severe snow fall, high drifts or where blizzard
like conditions are occurring. Travel may be restricted to emergency management
workers only and essential emergency travel by members of the public as the
Board of Commissioners may further direct, such as privately employed health
care workers. Further restrictions that the Board of Commissioners deems
necessary may be included within the local disaster declaration.
   (D)   Publication.
      (1)   Any order or proclamation declaring, continuing or terminating a
local disaster emergency shall be given prompt and general publicity and shall
be filed promptly in the office of the clerk of the political subdivision
pursuant to I.C. 10-14-3-22(b)(2).
      (2)   Publication and broadcast of an advisory, watch or warning level
travel advisory shall be made or caused to be made by the Board of
Commissioners or other officials designating the level of travel advisory using
a press release to all law enforcement agencies, fire departments, hospitals
and news media in the county. The declaration shall be promptly forwarded to
the State Department of Homeland Security and shall be kept on file by the
County Emergency Management Agency, County Clerk and County Auditor.
   (E)   Exemptions. Vehicles which shall be exempt from the travel and parking
restrictions imposed in a travel advisory pursuant to this section shall
include medical assistance, law enforcement, fire department, emergency
management, public utility, railway maintenance, fuel hauling vehicles and
employees of any of the above exempt services, if engaged in performing their
respective duties.
   (F)   Violations.
      (1)   Any order or proclamation of a warning shall be issued when a state
of emergency has been declared by the Board of Commissioners.
      (2)   Travel and parking restrictions of such a declaration include that:
         (a)   No travel is permitted on county roads until the order closing
the roads has been terminated by the Board of Commissioners;
         (b)   The driver or person in charge of a vehicle, whether or not
stalled, that impedes, obstructs, prohibits, impairs or interferes with highway
snow removal crews or emergency personnel and vehicles responding to an
emergency may be directed to remove the vehicle from the county road;
         (c)   A person who stops, parks or leaves a vehicle shall leave a
sufficient unobstructed width of the roadway opposite the vehicle for the free
passage of other vehicles and a clear view of the stopped vehicle from a
distance of 200 feet in either direction;
         (d)   The driver of each vehicle shall drive at a reduced speed
appropriate to the weather and highway conditions; and
         (e)   It is unlawful for a person to knowingly fail to comply with a
lawful order or directions of a law enforcement officer invested by law with
the authority to direct, control or regulate traffic.

or at an address and location in the county that can only be accessed by said
county road.
      (3)   This restriction does not apply to school buses or fire trucks.
   (D)   Waiver. The Board of Commissioners, in extraordinary circumstances,
may grant permission to an applicant who applies in writing to permit deviation

providing a means whereby service providers shall become registered, and any

contractor’s work to be of any particular quality, and it is recommended that
the homeowner contract with contractors concerning additional insurance.

Appendix B:   Erosion and Sediment Control Ordinance
§ 153.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is recognized that smaller streams and drainage channels serving
the county may not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey stormwater
runoff, resulting when land use changes from open or agricultural use to a more
urbanized use. It is further recognized that deposits of sediment from
developments during and after construction can reduce capacities of storm
sewers and drainage systems and result in damages to receiving lakes and
streams.
   (B)   Therefore, it shall be the policy of the County Commissioners that the
storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff shall be required of all
new development, any redevelopment and other new construction in the county.
The release rate of stormwater from developed lands shall not exceed the
release rate from the land area in its present land use.
   (C)   Because topography and the availability and adequacy of outlets for
storm runoff vary with almost every site, the requirements for storm drainage
tend to be an individual matter for any project. It is recommended that each
proposed project be discussed with the County Surveyor and Plan Director at the
earliest practical time in the planning stage.
(Ord. 2011-03, passed 4-4-2011)
§ 153.02 COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER ORDINANCES.
   In addition to the requirements of this chapter, compliance with the
requirements set forth in other applicable ordinances with respect to
submission and approval of preliminary and final subdivision plats, improvement
plans, building and zoning permits, construction inspections, appeals and
similar matters, and compliance with applicable state statutes and regulations
shall be required.

(Ord. 2011-03, passed 4-4-2011)
§ 153.04 STORMWATER CONTROL POLICY.
   (A)   It is recognized that the smaller streams and drainage channels
serving the county may not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey
stormwater runoff resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, the
storage and controlled release rate of excess stormwater runoff shall be
required for any development, redevelopment and new construction located within
the county.
   (B)   Possible exceptions to the requirement are minor subdivisions as
described in §
155.01. The County Surveyor together with the County Plan Director, after
thorough investigation and evaluation, may waive the requirement of controlled
runoff for minor subdivisions.
      (1)   The release rate of stormwater from development, redevelopment and
new construction may not exceed the stormwater runoff from the land area in its
present state of development. The developer must submit to the Plan Commission
detailed computations of runoff before and after development, redevelopment or
new construction which demonstrates that runoff will not be increased.
      (2)   These computations must show that the peak runoff rate after
development for the 100-year return period storm of critical duration must not
exceed the ten-year return period pre-development peak runoff rate. The
critical duration storm is that storm duration that requires the greatest
detention storage.
   (C)   Computations for areas up to and including 200 acres may be based on
the rational method; typical runoff coefficients are listed herein. For areas
larger than 200 acres, hydrograph techniques and/or computer drainage modeling
methods may be used. Hydrograph techniques and computer modeling methods used
to determine stormwater runoff shall be proven methods, subject to approval of
the Plan Director, County Surveyor or if appropriate, the Technical Review
Committee.
   (D)   In the event the natural downstream channel or storm sewer is
inadequate to accommodate the release rate provided above, then the allowable
release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted by the capacity of the
receiving downstream channel or storm sewer system. Additional detention as
determined by the County Surveyor’s office may be required to store that
portion of the runoff exceeding the capacity of the receiving sewers or
waterways.
(Ord. 2011-03, passed 4-4-2011)

      (2)   Guidance to selection of the runoff coefficient “C” is provided by
Table 1 and Table 1A below which show values for different types of surfaces
and local soil characteristics. The composite “C” value used for a given
drainage area with various surface types shall be the weighted average value
for the total area calculated from a breakdown of individual areas having
different surface types.
      (3)   Table 2 below provides runoff coefficients and inlet times for
different land use classifications. In the instance of undeveloped land
situated in an upstream area, a coefficient or coefficients shall be used for

Rainfall intensity shall be determined from the rainfall frequency curves
shown in Tables 5A in §
153.06(c)(3)(b) and Table B in this division (B). The time of concentration
(tc) to be used shall be the sum of the inlet time and flow time in the
drainage facility from the most remote part of the drainage area to the point
under consideration. The flow time in the storm sewers may be estimated by
the distance in feet divided by velocity of flow in feet per second. The
velocity shall be determined by the Manning formula
Inlet time is the combined time required for the runoff to reach the inlet of
the storm sewer. It includes overland flow time and flow time through
established surface drainage channels such as swales, ditches and sheet flow
across such areas as lawns, fields and other graded surfaces. It may be
computed by using the image below, also known as Figure 1 as shown in this
division (B)

§ 153.07 AMOUNT OF RUNOFF QUANTITIES.
   Various parts of a drainage facility must accommodate runoff water as
follows.
   (A)   (1)   The minor drainage system such as inlets, catch basins, street
gutters, swales, sewers and small channels which collect stormwater must
accommodate peak runoff from a ten-year return period storm.
      (2)   Rainfall duration shall be equal to the time of concentration or
one hour if the time of concentration is less than one hour.
      (3)   A first quartile storm distribution shall be used for computer
modeling.
      (4)   These minimum requirements must be satisfied.
         (a)   1.   The allowable spread of water on collector streets is
limited to maintaining two clear ten-foot moving lanes of traffic.
            2.   One lane is to be maintained on local roads, while places can
have a water spread equal to one-half of their width.

R The hydraulic radius in feet
S The slope of the energy grade line in feet per foot
N Manning’s “n” or roughness coefficient
 
      (2)   The hydraulic radius, R, is defined as the cross-sectional area of
flow divided by the wetted flow surface or wetted perimeter. Typical V values
and maximum permissible velocities for storm sewer materials are listed in
Table 3 in division (C) below. Roughness coefficient (n) values for other sewer
materials can be found in standard hydraulics tests and references.
   (B)   Minimum size. The minimum size of all storm sewers shall be 12 inches.
Rate of release for detention storage shall be controlled by an office plate or
other devices, subject to approval of the Plan Commission, where the 12-inch
pipe will not limit rate of release as required.
   (C)   Grade. Sewer grade shall be such that, in general, a minimum of two
feet of cover is maintained over the top of the pipe. Pipe cover less than the
minimum may be used only upon approval of the Plan Commission office. Uniform
slopes shall be maintained between inlets, manholes and inlets to manholes.
Final grade shall be set with full consideration of the capacity required,
sedimentation problems and other design parameters. Minimum and maximum
allowable slopes shall be those capable of producing velocities of two and one-
half and 15 feet per second, respectively, when the sewer is flowing full.

V, R, S and N Explained in §
              153.08(A)
 
   (B)   Channel cross-section and grade.
      (1)   (a)   The required channel cross-section and grade are determined
by the design capacity, the material in which the channel is to be constructed
and the requirements for maintenance.
         (b)   A minimum depth may be required to provide adequate outlets for

         (c)   The channel grade shall be such that the velocity in the channel
is high enough to prevent siltation but low enough to prevent erosion.
      (2)   (a)   Velocities less than one and on-half feet per second should
be avoided because siltation will take place and ultimately reduce the channel
cross-section.
         (b)   The maximum permissible velocities in vegetal-lined channels are
shown in division (C)(1)(c) below.
         (c)   Developments through which the channel is to be constructed must

combination with a stone, concrete or highly resistant vegetative center
section.
(4) Do not use on slopes steeper than 5% except for vegetated side slopes in
combination with stone, concrete or highly resistant vegetative center section.
(5) Annuals, use on mild slopes or as temporary protection until permanent
covers are established.
(6) Use on slopes steeper than 5% is not recommended.
 
      (2)   Side slopes steeper than one and one-half may be used for lined
channels; provided, that the side lining and structural retaining wall are
designed and constructed with provisions for live and dead load surcharge.
   (D)   Channel stability.
      (1)   Characteristics of a stable channel are:
         (a)   It neither aggrades nor degrades beyond tolerable limits;
         (b)   The channel banks do not erode to the extent that the channel
cross-section is changed appreciably;
         (c)   Excessive sediment bars do not develop;
         (d)   Excessive erosion does not occur around culverts, bridges or
elsewhere; and
         (e)   Gullies do not form or enlarge due to the entry of uncontrolled
surface flow to the channel.
      (2)   (a)   Channel stability shall be determined for an aged condition
and the velocity shall be based on the design flow or the bank full flow,
whichever is greater, using “n” values for various channel linings as shown in
§
153.08(C).
         (b)   In no case is it necessary to check channel stability for
discharges greater than that from a 100-year return period storm.
      (3)   (a)   Channel stability must be checked for conditions immediately
after construction. For this stability analysis, the velocity shall be
calculated for the expected flow from a ten-year return period storm on the
watershed, or the bank full flow, whichever is smaller. The “n” value for
newly-constructed channels in fine-grained soils and sands may be determined in
accordance with the National Engineering Handbook 5, Supplement B, Soil
Conservation Service, and shall not exceed 0.025.
         (b)   The allowable velocity in the newly-constructed channel may be
increased by a maximum of 20% to reflect the effects of vegetation to be
established under the following conditions.
            1.   The soil and site in which the channel is to be constructed
are suitable for rapid establishment and support of erosion controlling
vegetation.
            2.   Species of erosion controlling vegetation adapted to the area
and proven methods of establishment are shown.
            3.   The channel design includes detailed plans for establishment
of vegetation on the channel side slopes.
   (E)   Drainage of waterways.
      (1)   Vegetated waterways that are subject to low flows of long duration
or where wet conditions prevail shall be drained with a tile system or by other
means such as paved gutters.
      (2)   Tile lines may be outletted through a drop structure at the end of
the waterway or through a standard tile outlet.
   (F)   Establishment of new regulated drain.
      (1)   The County Drainage Board may mandate that storm drains and
detention basins in residential subdivisions become regulated drains to ensure
the proper maintenance of the system.
      (2)   If the Board mandates the establishment of a new regulated drain,
each developer must provide the necessary information and meet the requirements
of the 1965 State Drainage Code, as amended, for the establishment of a new
regulated drain.
      (3)   The Board shall determine the necessary easements for adequate
maintenance of any new regulated drain.
   (G)   Appurtenant structures.
      (1)   (a)   The design of channels will provide all structures required
for the proper functioning of the channel and the laterals thereto and
travelways for operation and maintenance.
         (b)   Recessed inlets and structures needed for entry of surface and
subsurface flow into channels without significant erosion or degradation shall
be included in the design of channel improvements.
         (c)   The design is also to provide the necessary flood gates, water
level control devices and any other appurtenance affecting the functioning of
the channels and the attainment of the purpose for which they are built.
      (2)   (a)   The effect of channel improvements on existing culverts,
bridges, buried cables, pipelines and inlet structures for surface and
subsurface drainage on the channel being improved and laterals thereto shall be
evaluated to determine the need for modification or replacement.
         (b)   Culverts and bridges which are modified or added as part of
channel improvement projects shall meet reasonable standards for the type of
structure and shall have a minimum capacity equal to the design discharge or
governmental agency design requirements, whichever is greater.
   (H)   Disposition of spoil. Spoil material resulting from clearing, grubbing
and channel excavation shall be disposed in such a manner which will:
      (1)   Minimize overbank wash;
      (2)   Provide for the free flow of water between the channel and
floodplain unless the valley routing and water surface profile are based on
continuous dikes being installed;
      (3)   Not hinder the development of travelways for maintenance;
      (4)   Leave the right-of-way in the best condition feasible, consistent
with the project purposes, for productive use by the owner;
      (5)   Improve the aesthetic appearance of the site to the extent
feasible; and
      (6)   Be approved by the IDNR or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (whichever
is applicable), if deposited in the floodway.

§ 153.12 STORMWATER DETENTION.
   The following shall govern the design of any improvement with respect to the
detention of stormwater runoff.
   (A)   Acceptable detention methods.
      (1)   The increased stormwater runoff resulting from a proposed
development should be detained on-site by the provisions of appropriate wet or
dry bottom reservoirs, by storage on flat roofs, parking lots, streets, lawns
or other acceptable techniques.
      (2)   Measures which retard the rate of overland flow and the velocity in
runoff channels shall also be used to control the runoff rate partially.
      (3)   Detention basins shall be sized to store excess flows from storms
with a 100-year return period.
      (4)   Control devices shall limit the discharge to a rate no greater than
that prescribed by divisions (E) and (F) below.
   (B)   Design storm. Design of stormwater detention facilities shall be based
on a return period of once in 100 years. The storage volume and outflow rate
shall be sufficient to handle stormwater runoff from a critical duration storm,
as defined in divisions (E) and (F) below. Rainfall intensity duration
frequency relationships shall be those given in division (C)(3)(b) below.
   (C)   Allowable release rate.
      (1)   The allowable release rate of stormwater originating from a
proposed development shall not exceed the amount specified in §
153.04 and as described in divisions (E) and (F) below.
      (2)   In the event the natural downstream channel or storm sewer system
is inadequate to accommodate the release rate provided above, then the
allowable release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted by the capacity
of the receiving downstream channel or storm sewer system, and additional
detention as determined by the Plan Commission shall be required to store that
portion of the runoff exceeding the capacity of the receiving sewers or
waterways.
      (3)   (a)   Generally. If more than one detention basin is involved in
the development of the area upstream of the limiting restriction, the allowable
release rate from any one detention basin shall be in direct proportion to the
ratio of its drainage area to the drainage area of the entire watershed
upstream of the restriction.
         (b)   Precipitation intensity estimates in inches per hour.

(Ord. 2011-03, passed 4-4-2011)
   (D)   Drainage system overflow design. Drainage systems shall have adequate
capacity to convey the stormwater runoff from all upstream tributary areas
through the development under consideration for a storm of 100-year design
return period calculated on the basis of the upstream land in its present state
of development. An allowance, equivalent to the reduction in flow rate
provided, shall be made for upstream detention when such upstream detention and
release rate have previously been approved by the Board and evidence of its
construction can be shown.
   (E)   Determination of storage volume; rational method.
      (1)   Generally. For areas of 200 acres or less, the rational method may
be used to determine the required volume of stormwater storage. The following
11-step procedure may be used to determine the required volume of storage.
Other design methods may also be used, subject to approval of the Board, and as
described in division (F) below.
      (2)   Step procedure.
         (a)   Determine total drainage area in acres “A”;
         (b)   Determine composite runoff coefficient “Cu” based on existing
land use (undeveloped);
         (c)   Determine time of concentration “tc” in minutes based on
existing conditions;
         (d)   Determine rainfall intensity “Iu” in inches per hour, based on
time of concentration and using Figure 1 in §
153.06(B), or from data given in Table 5 in division (C)(3)(b) above for the
ten-year return period;
         (e)   Compute runoff based on existing land use (undeveloped) and ten-
year return period (Qu=CuIuA);
         (f)   Determine composite runoff coefficient “Cd” based on developed
conditions and a 100-year return period;
         (g)    Determine the 100-year return period rainfall intensity “Td”
for various storm durations “td” up through the time of concentration for the
developed area using Table 5 in division (C)(3)(b) above;
         (h)   Determine developed inflow rates “Qd” for various storm
durations “td,” measured in hours;
         (i)   Compute a storage rate “Std” for various storm durations, ”td”
up through the time of concentration of the developed area (S(Td)=(Qd)-(Qu));
         (j)   Compute required storage volume “SR” in acre-feet for each storm
duration “td.” This assumes a triangular hydrograph of duration (two times d)
hours with the peak flow of “Std” at “td” hours (SR = S(td)(td)/12); and
         (k)   Select the largest storage volume computed in division (E)(2)(j)
above for detention basin design.
   (F)   Determination of storage volume; other methods.
      (1)   Generally. Methods other than the rational method for determining
runoff and routing of stormwater may be used to determine the storage volume
required to control stormwater runoff. The procedures or methods used must
receive the prior approval of the Plan Director and County Surveyor. The TR-20
and TR-55 models are approved for the appropriate use in analysis of the runoff
and routing of stormwater. The use of these models or other approved procedures
can be defined in a seven-step procedure to determine the required storage
volume of the detention basin.
      (2)   Step procedure.
         (a)   Calibrate the hydrologic/hydraulic model that is to be used for
prediction of runoff and routing of stormwater;
         (b)   For each storm duration listed in division (C)(3)(b), perform
steps in division (F)(2)(c) through (F)(2)(f) below;
         (c)   Determine the ten-year, undeveloped peak flow. Denote this flow
by Qu10;
         (d)   Determine the 100-year runoff hydrograph (Hd100) for developed
conditions;
         (e)   Determine the hydrograph that must be stored (Hs100) by
subtracting a flow up to Qu10 from the hydro graph (Hd100) found in (F)(2)(d)
above;
         (f)   Determine the volume of water (Vs) to be stored by calculating
the area under the hydrograph Hs100; and
         (g)   The detention basin must be designed to store the largest volume
(Vs) found for any storm duration analyzed in division (F)(2)(f) above.
   (G)   General detention basin design requirements.
      (1)   Basins shall be constructed to detain temporarily the stormwater
runoff which exceeds the maximum peak flow rate authorized by this chapter. The
volume of storage provided in these basins, together with such storage as may
be authorized in other on-site facilities shall be sufficient to control excess
runoff from the 100-year storm.
      (2)   The following design principles shall be observed.
         (a)   The maximum volume of water stored and subsequently released at
the design release rate shall not result in a storage duration in excess of 48
hours unless additional storms occur within the period.
         (b)   The maximum planned depth of stormwater stored (without a
permanent pool) shall not exceed four feet.
         (c)   All stormwater detention facilities shall be separated by not
less than 75 feet from any building or structure to be occupied.
         (d)   All excavated excess spoil may be spread so as to provide for
aesthetic and recreational features such as sliding hills, sports fields and
the like. Slopes no steeper than six horizontal to one vertical for safety,
erosion control, stability and ease of maintenance shall be permitted.
         (e)   Safety screens having a maximum opening of four inches shall be
provided for any pipe or opening to prevent children or large animals from
crawling into the structures.
         (f)   Danger signs shall be mounted at appropriate locations to warn
of deep water, possible flooding conditions during storm periods and other
dangers that exist. Fencing shall be provided if deemed necessary by the Board.
         (g)   Outlet control structures shall be designed to operate as simply
as possible and shall require little or no maintenance and/or attention for
proper operation. They shall limit discharges into existing or planned
downstream channels or conduits so as not to exceed the predetermined maximum
authorized peak flow rate.
         (h)   Emergency overflow facilities such as a weir or spillway shall
be provided for the release of exceptional storm runoffs or in emergency
conditions should the normal discharge devices become totally or partially
inoperative. The overflow facility shall be of such design that its operation
is automatic and does not require manual attention.
         (i)   Grass or other suitable vegetative cover shall be provided
throughout the entire basin area. Grass should be cut regularly at
approximately monthly intervals during the growing season or as required.
         (j)   Debris and trash removal and other necessary maintenance shall
be performed on a regular basis to assure continued operation in conformance to
design.
         (k)   1.   A report shall be submitted to the Plan Commission
describing the following:
               a.   The proposed development;
               b.   The current land use conditions;
               c.   The method of hydraulic and hydrologic analysis used,
including any assumptions or special conditions;
               d.   The results of the analysis; and
               e.   The recommended drainage control facilities.
            2.   Hydraulic and hydrologic calculations, including input and
output files, shall be included as appendices to the report.
   (H)   Dry bottom basin design requirements. Detention basins which will not
contain a permanent pool of water shall comply with the following requirements.
      (1)   Provisions shall be incorporated to facilitate complete interior
drainage of dry bottom basins, to include the provisions of natural grades to
outlet structures, longitudinal and transverse grades to perimeter drainage
facilities, paved gutters or the installation of subsurface drains.
      (2)   The detention basin shall, whenever possible, be designed to serve
a secondary or multi-purpose function. Recreational facilities, aesthetic
qualities (open spaces) or other types of use shall be considered in planning
the detention facility.
   (I)   Wet bottom basin design requirements.
      (1)   Where part of a detention basin will contain a permanent pool of
water, all the items required for detention storage shall apply, except that
the system of drains with a positive gravity outlet required to maintain a dry
bottom basin will not be required. A controlled positive outlet will be
required to maintain the design water level in the wet bottom basin and provide
required detention storage above the design water level.
      (2)   However, the following additional conditions shall apply.
         (a)   Basins designed with permanent pools or containing permanent
ponds shall have a water area of at least one-half acre. If fish are to be
maintained in the pond, a minimum depth of approximately ten feet shall be
maintained over at least 25% of the pond area. The remaining pond area shall
have no extensive shallow areas, except as required by division (I)(2)(c)
below.
         (b)   In excavated ponds, the underwater side slopes in the pond shall
be stable. In the case of valley storage, natural slopes may be considered to
be stable.
         (c)   A safety ledge four to six feet in width is required and must be
installed in all ponds approximately 30 to 36 inches below the permanent water
level. In addition, a similar maintenance ledge 12 to 18 inches above the
permanent water line shall be provided. The slope between the two ledges shall
be stable and of a material such as stone or riprap which will prevent erosion
due to wave action.
         (d)   A safety ramp exit from the pond is required in all cases and
shall have a minimum width of 20 feet and exit slope to six horizontal to one
vertical. The ramp shall be of a material that will prevent its deterioration
due to vehicle use and/or wave action.
         (e)   Periodic maintenance is required in ponds to control weed and
larval growth. The pond shall also be designed to provide for the easy removal
of sediment which will accumulate during periods of pond operation. A means of
maintaining the designed water level of the pond during prolonged periods of
dry weather is also required.
         (f)   For emergency use, basin cleaning or shoreline maintenance,
facilities shall be provided or plans prepared for auxiliary equipment to
permit emptying and drainage.
         (g)   Facilities to enhance and maintain pond water quality shall be
provided if required to meet applicable water quality standards. Design
calculations to substantiate the effectiveness of these aeration facilities
shall be submitted with final engineering plans. Agreements for the perpetual
operation and maintenance of aeration facilities shall be prepared to the
satisfaction of the Plan Commission.
   (J)   Roof top storage. Detention storage requirements may be met in total
or in part by detention on flat roofs. Details of such designs are to be
included in the building permit application and shall include the depth and
volume of storage, details of outlet devices and down drains, elevations of
emergency overflow provisions and certification of the structural portion of
the building design plans by a structural engineer. This type of storage is
allowable but should only be utilized as a last resort if no other options are
available.
   (K)   Parking lot storage. Paved parking lots may be designed to provide
temporary detention storage of stormwaters on all or a portion of their
surfaces. Outlets will be designed so as to empty the stored waters slowly.
Depths of storage must be limited to a maximum depth of seven inches so as to
prevent damage to parked vehicles and so that access to parked vehicles is not
impaired. Ponding should, in general, be confined to those positions of the
parking lots farthest from the area served.
   (L)   Facility financial responsibilities. The construction cost of
stormwater control systems and facilities as required by this chapter shall be
accepted as part of the cost of land development. If general public use of the
facility can be demonstrated, negotiations for public participation in the cost
of such development may be considered.
   (M)   Facility maintenance responsibility.
      (1)   Maintenance of detention/retention facilities during construction
and thereafter shall be the responsibility of the land developer/owner.
Assignment of responsibility for maintaining facilities serving more than one
lot or holding shall be documented by appropriate covenants to property deeds,
unless responsibility is formally accepted by a public body, and shall be
determined before the final drainage plans are approved.
      (2)   Stormwater detention and retention basins may be donated to the
county or other unit of government designated by the county, for ownership and
permanent maintenance, providing:
         (a)   The county or other governmental unit is willing to accept
responsibility;
         (b)   The facility has been designed and constructed according to all
applicable provisions of this chapter;
         (c)   All improvements have been constructed, approved and accepted by
the county for the land area served by the drainage basin;
         (d)   Retention ponds containing a permanent pool of water have all
slopes between the riprap and high water line sodded and the remaining land
area hydroseeded; are equipped with electrically driven aeration devices, if
required, to maintain proper aerobic conditions and sustain aquatic life; have
a four-foot wide crushed limestone walkway at the high water line entirely
around the body of water; provided, suitable public access acceptable to the
responsible governmental agency; and have the high water line not closer than
75 feet to any property line; and
         (e)   Dry detention ponds shall have all slopes, bottom of the basin
and areas above the high water line hydroseeded; and shall have the high water
line not closer than 50 feet to any development boundary.
   (N)   Inspections. All public and privately-owned detention storage
facilities can be inspected by representatives of the county not less often
than once every two years. If inspected, a certified inspection report covering
physical conditions, available storage capacity and operational condition of
key facility elements will be provided to the owner.
   (O)   Corrective measures. If deficiencies are found by the Building
Inspector, the owner of the detention/retention facility will be required to
take the necessary measures to correct such deficiencies. If the owner fails to
do so, the county will undertake the work and collect from the owner using lien
rights, if necessary.
   (P)   Joint development of control systems. Stormwater control systems may
be planned and constructed jointly by two or more developers as long as
compliance with this chapter is maintained.
   (Q)   Installation of control systems. Runoff and erosion control systems
shall be installed as soon as possible during the course of site development.
Detention/retention basins shall be designed with an additional 6% of available
capacity to allow for sediment accumulation resulting from development and to
permit the pond to function for reasonable periods between cleanings. Basins
should be designed to collect sediment and debris in specific locations so that
removal costs are kept to a minimum.
   (R)   Detention facilities in floodplains. If detention storage is provided
within a floodplain, only the net increase in storage volume above that which
naturally existed on the floodplain shall be credited to the development. No
credit will be granted for volumes below the elevation of the regulatory flood
at the location unless compensatory storage is also provided.
   (S)   Off-site drainage provisions. When the allowable runoff is released in
an area that is susceptible to flooding, the developer may be required to
construct appropriate storm drains through such area to avert increased flood
hazard caused by the concentration of allowable runoff at one point instead of
the natural overland distribution. The requirement of off-site drains shall be
at the discretion of the Plan Commission.

APPENDIX B: EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL ORDINANCE

   The intent of this ordinance is the control of soil erosion and
sedimentation caused by land disturbing activities within Marshall County.
Measures taken to control erosion and sedimentation should assure that sediment
is not transported from a site by storm events or construction activities.
1. AUTHORITY
   This ordinance is adopted under the authority granted by I.C. 36-1-4-11,
I.C. 36-7-4 and all acts supplemental and mandatory thereto. This authority
provides for the administration, enforcement, and amendment of this ordinance
for controlling soil erosion within Marshall County.
2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
   A.   Soil erosion resulting from land disturbing activities causes a
significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to be transported off-site
to locations including ditches, streams, wetlands, lakes, and reservoirs.
   B.   The purpose of this ordinance is to conserve the natural resources; to
protect the quality of air and water, and to protect and promote the health,
safety, and welfare of people to the extent practicable by minimizing the
amount of sediment and other pollutants, resulting from soil erosion due to and
disturbing activities, from being transported off-site to adjacent public or
private lands including ditches, streams, lakes, wetlands, and reservoirs.
3. APPLICABILITY
   The ordinance applies to all land disturbing activities on land within the
boundaries and jurisdiction of Marshall County unless superseded by local city
or town ordinance. Agricultural Land Disturbing Activities as defined in § 5,
and Soil & Water. Conservation projects, implemented through the Marshall
County Soil and Water Conservation District and the Marshall County Surveyor’s
Office, are exempt from the requirements of this ordinance.
   This section applies to the following sites with land disturbing activities:
   A. Those requiring a minor or major subdivision plat approval or local
improvement location permit for the construction of commercial, residential,
industrial or institutional buildings on lots of approved subdivision plats;
   B. Those involving grading, removal of protective ground cover or
vegetation, excavation, land filling or other land disturbing activity
affecting a surface area of 10,000 square feet or more;
   C. Those involving excavation, filling or a combination of excavation and
filling affecting 1,000 cubic yards or more of soil, sand, gravel, stone or
other material.
   This ordinance does not preclude the applicant from acquiring any other
necessary local, state, and federal permits.
4. CONFLICTING ORDINANCES/REQUIREMENTS
   The provisions of this ordinance shall be deemed as additional requirements
to minimum standards required by the Indiana General Permit Rule for Stormwater
Runoff Associated With Construction Activity (Rule 5), 327 I.A.C. 15-5 (or most
recent revision). In case of conflicting requirements, the most restrictive
shall apply.
5. DEFINITIONS
   Administering authority means the designated unit of government given the
authority to issue permits.
   Agricultural land disturbing activities means the disturbance of land,
including the clearing of land, for the production of animal or plant life,
including forestry, pasturing of livestock, and planting, growing, cultivating,
and harvesting crops for human or livestock consumption. This also includes the
construction of farm facilities such as dwellings, barns, sheds or other
structures.
   Erosion means the detachment and movement of soil, sediment or rock
fragments by water, wind, ice or gravity.
   Erosion control measure means a practice or a combination of practices to
control erosion and resulting sedimentation.
   Erosion control plan means a written description of pertinent information
concerning erosion control measures designed to meet the requirements of this
ordinance.
   Land disturbing activity means any man-made change of the land surface,
including removing vegetative cover, excavating, filling, transporting, and
grading.
   Runoff means waters derived from melting snow or rain falling within a
tributary drainage basin that exceed the infiltration capacity of the soils of
that basin, flow over the surface of the ground, or are collected in channels
or conduits.
   Site means the entire area included in the legal description of the land on
which land disturbing activity has been proposed in the permit application.
   SWCD means Soil and Water Conservation District, a subdivision of state
government charged with the responsibility of establishing programs and setting
policy to protect the natural resources with Marshall County boundaries.
6. GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The following principles apply to all land disturbing activities subject to
this ordinance.
   A.   To minimize the potential for soil erosion, development should fit the
topography and soils of the site. Areas with steep slopes where deep cuts and
fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours
should be followed as closely as possible.
   B.   Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible.
Areas immediately adjacent to watercourses and lakes also should be left
undisturbed wherever possible.
   C.   All activities on a site should be conducted in a logical sequence so
that the smallest practical area of land will be exposed for the shortest
practical period of time during development.
   D.   Provisions should be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by
changed soil and surface conditions (impervious areas) during and after
development.
   E.   Minimize the length and steepness of slopes to reduce erosion
potential.
7. DESIGN CRITERIA, STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR EROSION CONTROL MEASURES
   All erosion control measures, including, but not limited to those required
to comply with this ordinance shall meet the design criteria, standards, and
specifications for erosion control measures similar to or the same as those
outlined in the Indiana Handbook for Erosion Control in Developing Areas
published by the State Department of Natural Resources.
8. EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL REQUIREMENTS
   The following requirements shall govern erosion and sediment control
practices on all sites:
   A.   Sediment-laden water flowing from the site shall be detained by erosion
control measures appropriate to minimize sedimentation.
   B.   Water shall not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion at or
downstream of the point of discharge.
   C.   All access to building sites that cross a natural watercourse, drainage
easement, or swale/channel shall have a culvert of appropriate size.
   D.   Wastes or unused building materials, including, but not limited to,
garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater, toxic materials, and hazardous
substances, shall not be carried by runoff from a site. All wastes shall be
disposed of in a proper manner.
   E.   Sediment being tracked from a site onto public or private roadways
shall be minimized. This can be accomplished initially by a temporary gravel
construction entrance, in addition to a well planned layout of roads, access
drives, and parking areas.
   F.   Public or private roadways shall be kept cleared of accumulated
sediment. Bulk clearing of sediment shall not include flushing the area with
water.
   G.   All storm drain inlets shall be protected against sedimentation with
barriers meeting accepted criteria, standards, and specifications.
   H.   Runoff passing through a site from adjacent areas shall be controlled
by diverting it around disturbed areas, where practical. Diverted runoff shall
be conveyed in a manner that will not erode the channel and receiving areas.
Alternatively, the existing channel may be left undisturbed or improved to
prevent erosion or sedimentation from occurring.
   I.   Drainage ways and swales shall be designed and adequately protected so
that their final gradients and resultant velocities will not cause channel or
outlet scouring.
   J.   All disturbed ground left inactive for fourteen (14) or more days shall
be stabilized by seeding, sodding, mulching, covering, or by other equivalent
erosion control measures.
   K.   Appropriate sediment control practices shall be installed prior to any
land disturbance and thereafter whenever necessary.
   L.   During the period of construction activity at a site, erosion control
measures necessary to meet the requirements of this ordinance shall be
maintained by the applicant.
9. EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL ON PROJECTS THAT DISTURB LESS THAN ONE (1) ACRE
   Although individual lots within a larger development may not appear to
contribute as much sediment as the overall development, the cumulative effect
of lot development is of concern. From the time construction on an individual
lot begins, until the individual lot is stabilized, the builder must take steps
to:
   (A)   protect adjacent properties from sedimentation
   (B)   prevent mud/sediment from depositing on the street
   (C)   protect drainageways from erosion and sedimentation
   (D)   prevent sediment laden water from entering storm sewer inlets
   The standard plan includes perimeter silt fence, stabilized construction
entrance, curb inlet protection, drop inlet protection, stockpile containment,
stabilized drainage swales, downspout extensions, temporary seeding and
mulching, and permanent vegetation. Every relevant measure should be installed
at each individual lot site.
   All erosion and sediment control measures must be properly maintained
throughout construction. Temporary and permanent seeding should be watered as
needed until established. For further information on individual lot erosion and
sediment control, see the State Department of Natural Resources, Division of
Soil Conservation’s pamphlet titled “Erosion and Sediment Control for
Individual Building Sites.”

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The state legislature has, in I.C. 36-7-4, granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
County Commissioners does hereby adopt the following floodplain management
regulations.
(Ord. 2016-11, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 154.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately floodproofed or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 2016-11, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 154.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
   (F)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the county by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2016-11, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 154.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in floodplains; and
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
(Ord. 2016-11, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 154.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt or a combination of both. In A ZONES,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below.
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   ZONE AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. (ZONE AE is on new and revised maps in place of ZONES
A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community’s
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. The portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular
program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   D ZONE. Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding
is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is
not required by regulation in this zone.
   DEVELOPMENT.
      (1)   Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction or placement of a structure or any
addition to a structure;

manufactured home or installing a recreational vehicle on a site for more than
180 days;
         (c)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction
of roads or similar projects;
         (d)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements and the like;
         (e)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation or drilling
operations;
         (f)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;

   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation or the runoff of surface waters from any source.

Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.

provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable) and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOOD.)

preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited
to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances and other applications of police power which control development in
flood prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to
as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention
ordinance and floodplain management requirements.
   FLOODPROOFING or DRY FLOODPROOFING. A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact

greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. The portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP. As related to variances of this chapter, the exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The County
Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual and
peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial HARDSHIP alone is
not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional HARDSHIP. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition or any combination thereof. All renewal and new business
flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997, will
include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include letter of map amendment (LOMA), letter of map revision
(LOMR) and letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below.

currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations and elevations.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision
by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA’s determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the

resistance to the flow of floodwaters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the

authorized public body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations
or ordinances that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land
development or occupancy in flood prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Lands within the jurisdiction of the
county subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the county
are generally identified as such on the county’s flood insurance study of the
county and incorporated areas dated November 16, 2011, as well as any future
updates, amendments or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as Zone A,
AE, A1-A30, AH, AR, A99 or AO.)
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building,

the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary or safety code requirements.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification or other evidence of compliance required in this
chapter is presumed to be in VIOLATION until such time as that documentation is
provided.

Shaded X ZONES shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X ZONES (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type
of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. See definition for A ZONE.
   ZONE B, C AND X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(ZONE X is used on new and revised maps in place of ZONE B and ZONE C.)

available regulatory flood data is listed below.
   (A)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the county shall be as delineated on
the 1% annual chance flood profiles in the county’s flood insurance study of
the county and incorporated areas dated November 16, 2011, and the
corresponding flood insurance rate map dated November 16, 2011, as well as any
future updates, amendments or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency with the most recent date.
   (B)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway and fringe limits for each of
the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the county, delineated as an “A Zone” on
the county’s incorporated areas flood insurance rate map dated November 16,
2011, as well as any future updates, amendments or revisions, prepared by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date, shall be
according to the best data available as provided by the State Department of
Natural Resources; provided, that the upstream drainage area from the subject
site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party disagrees with the best
available data, the party needs to replace existing data with better data that
meets current engineering standards. To be considered, this data must be
submitted to the State Department of Natural Resources for review and
subsequently approved.
   (C)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification
on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway and fringe limits of
any watercourse in the community’s known flood prone areas shall be according
to the best data available as provided by the State Department of Natural
Resources; provided, that the upstream drainage area from the subject site is
greater than one square mile.
   (D)   Upon issuance of a letter of final determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.
(Ord. 2016-11, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 154.08 ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   A floodplain development permit shall be required in conformance with the
provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development
activities in areas of special flood hazard.

§ 154.09 COMPLIANCE.
   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally
altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. No land or stream within the SFHA shall
hereafter be altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and
other applicable regulations.

§ 154.11 DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND ELEVATIONS.
   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles shall govern.
   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
   (C)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the
base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site shall be
considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied.
The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA.

   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
(Ord. 2016-11, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 154.13 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this chapter does not create any
liability on the part of the county, the State Department of Natural Resources
or the state, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter
or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.

fill, storage of materials or equipment; drainage facilities; and the location
of the foregoing.
   (B)   Specifically, the following information is required.
      (1)   Application stage.
         (a)   A description of the proposed development;
         (b)   Location of the proposed development sufficient to accurately
locate property and structure(s) in relation to existing roads and streams;
         (c)   A legal description of the property site;
         (d)   A site development plan showing existing and proposed
development locations and existing and proposed land grades;

         (a)   Upon establishment of the lowest floor of an elevated structure
or structure constructed on fill, it shall be the duty of the applicant to
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the NAVD 88 or NGVD
elevation of the lowest floor, as built. Said certification shall be prepared
by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or
professional engineer and certified by the same. The Floodplain Administrator
shall review the lowest floor elevation survey data submitted. The applicant
shall correct deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is
allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said
corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop work order for the
project. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the elevation certification
shall be at the applicant’s risk.
         (b)   Upon establishment of the floodproofed elevation of a
floodproofed structure, it shall be the duty of the applicant to submit to the
Floodplain Administrator a floodproofing certificate. Certification shall be
prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered professional
engineer and certified by same. (The Floodplain Administrator shall review the
floodproofing certification submitted.) The applicant shall correct any
deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is allowed to
proceed. Failure to submit the floodproofing certification or failure to make
correction required shall be cause to issue a stop work order for the project.
      (3)   Finished construction. Upon completion of construction, an
elevation certification (FEMA Elevation Certificate Form 81-31 or any future

(Ord. 2016-11, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 154.28 VARIANCE AND APPEALS PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Generally. In passing upon such applications, the Board shall consider
all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in
other sections of this chapter and:
      (1)   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (2)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (3)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (4)   The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (6)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;

of transport of the floodwaters at the site; and
      (10)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and
bridges.
   (B)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued when there is:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
      (2)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §§
154.44 and
154.46(A) may be granted.
      (3)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §§

154.46(A) will require a permit from the State Department of Natural Resources.
      (4)   Variances to the Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction found in §
154.41 may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (6)   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of
any structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places
or the State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
      (7)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation. (See §
154.28(C).)
      (8)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the State Department of Natural Resources upon request. (See §
154.28(C).)
   (C)   Variance notification.
      (1)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted that allows the lowest
floor of a structure to be built below the flood protection grade shall be
given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
         (a)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
flood protection grade will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
         (b)   Such construction below the flood protection grade increases
risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the
Floodplain Administrator in the office of the County Recorder and shall be
recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected
parcel of land.
      (2)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance.
   (D)   Historic structure. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as an “historic structure” and the variance is the minimum to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (E)   Special conditions. Upon the consideration of the factors listed in §§
154.27 and
154.28 and the purposes of this chapter, the County Board of Zoning Appeals may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.

below. Structures located in all “A Zones” may be floodproofed in lieu of being
elevated if done in accordance with the following:
      (1)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the structure has been designed so that below the FPG, the structure and
attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the
effects of the regulatory flood. The structure design shall take into account
flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic pressures and impacts
from debris or ice. Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator as set forth in §
154.25(C)(12).
      (2)   Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human intervention
and without an outside source of electricity.

floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls. Designs must meet the following minimum criteria.
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings located in a minimum of two
exterior walls (having a total net area of not less than one square inch for
every one square foot of enclosed area).
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no more than one foot above
the exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath each opening,
whichever is higher.

partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
         (f)   The interior grade of such enclosed area shall be at an
elevation at or higher than the exterior grade.
         (g)   Openings are to be not less than three inches in any direction
in the plane of the wall. This requirement applies to the hole in the wall,
excluding any device that may be inserted such as typical foundation air vent
device.
         (h)   Property owners shall be required to execute a flood openings/
venting affidavit acknowledging that all openings will be maintained as flood
vents, and that the elimination or alteration of the openings in anyway will
violate the requirements of this division (D). Periodic inspections will be
conducted by the Floodplain Administrator to ensure compliance. The affidavit
shall be recorded in the office of the County Recorder.
         (i)   Property owners shall be required to execute and record with the
structure’s deed a non-conversion agreement declaring that the area below the
lowest floor (where the interior height of the enclosure exceeds six feet)
shall not be improved, finished or otherwise converted; the community will have
the right to inspect the enclosed area. The non-conversion agreement shall be
recorded in the office of the County Recorder.
   (E)   Structures constructed on fill. A residential or nonresidential
structure may be constructed on a permanent land fill in accordance with the
following.
      (1)   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep
before compacting to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with either the
standard or modified Proctor test method. The results of the test showing
compliance shall be retained in the permit file.
      (2)   The fill shall extend ten feet beyond the foundation of the
structure before sloping below the BFE.
      (3)   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during
flooding by vegetative cover, riprap or bulkheading. If vegetative cover is

(Ord. 2016-11, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 154.43 CRITICAL FACILITIES.
   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities
shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and
sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be
displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above
the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. 2016-11, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 154.44 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs established in §
154.07 are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris and
potential projectiles and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the State Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1, a permit for
construction in a floodway from the State Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving and the like undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the State Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the State Department of Natural
Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
State Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in the
floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the State Department of Natural Resources, the
Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit;
provided, that the provisions contained in §§
154.40 through
154.47 have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the State
Department of Natural Resources. However, a community’s more restrictive
regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed that, when acting alone or in
combination with existing or future development, will adversely affect the
efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse
effect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at
least 0.15 of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation
under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition
as proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees), the county shall submit the data and request that the Federal
Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping
standard regulations found at 44 C.F.R. § 65.12.
(Ord. 2016-11, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 154.45 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   (A)   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
154.40 through
154.47 have been met.
   (B)   The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or
substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.
(Ord. 2016-11, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 154.46 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the State Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the State Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the State Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in §§
154.40 through
154.47 have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit; provided, that the provisions contained in §§
154.40 through
154.47 have been met.
   (C)   Total effect. The total cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not
increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and shall not increase
flood damages or potential flood damages.
(Ord. 2016-11, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 154.47 STANDARDS FOR FLOOD PRONE AREAS.
   All development in known flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or
where no FEMA published map is available, shall meet applicable standards as
required per §§

154.47.
(Ord. 2016-11, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 154.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit in the SFHA or
failure to comply with the requirements of a floodplain development permit or
conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter. All
violations shall be considered a common nuisance and be treated as such in
accordance with the provisions of §
155.02.
   (B)   (1)   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the
violation continues to exist.
      (2)   The County Commissioners shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      (3)   Nothing herein shall prevent the county from taking such other
lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.
