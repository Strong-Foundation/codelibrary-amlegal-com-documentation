codified, rearranged, renumbered and consolidated into component codes, titles,
chapters and sections, shall be known and designated as the “Town of
Bargersville Code”, for which designation “code of ordinances”, “codified

same rules of construction, definition and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.

   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless

resolve a conflict between two or more sections.

reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or division.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning, application
or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)
§ 10.05 RULES OF INTERPRETATION; DEFINITIONS.

sense. Technical words and phrases having a peculiar and appropriate meaning in

construed as imputing authority to a majority of the persons, unless otherwise
declared in the section giving the authority.
      (3)   Where a section requires an act to be done which, by law, an agent
or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.
      (4)   Words denoting the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the
feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,
and words in the plural shall include the singular; the use of a verb in the
present tense shall include the future, if applicable.

§ 10.06 SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   If any section of this code now enacted or subsequently amended or its
application to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid section
or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
non-severability provision, each division or part of every section is
severable. If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the
invalidity does not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of
whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a section stating that the provisions of an act are
severable as provided in division (B) does not affect the operation of division
(B) with respect to that act.
(I.C. 1-1-1-8)
§ 10.07 REFERENCE TO OTHER SECTIONS.
   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof, the
reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified or renumbered unless the subject matter is changed
or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OFFICES; NAME DESIGNATIONS.
   (A)   Reference to offices. Reference to a public office or officer shall be
deemed to apply to any office, officer or employee of this municipality
exercising the powers, duties or functions contemplated in the provision,
irrespective of any transfer of functions or change in the official title of
the functionary.
   (B)   Name designations. Whenever any ordinance or resolution of the Council
refers to any board, bureau, commission, division, department, officer, agency,
authority or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; or at the time of the effective date of that ordinance or
subsequent thereto, the rights, powers, duties or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date
or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which the duties,
liabilities, powers and rights were transferred.
(I.C. 1-1-6-1)
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
the error.
§ 10.10 REASONABLE TIME.
   (A)   In all cases where an ordinance requires an act to be done in a
reasonable time or requires reasonable notice to be given, reasonable time or
notice shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of the act or the giving of the notice.
   (B)   The time within which an act is to be done, as herein provided, shall
be computed by excluding the first day and including the last. If the last day
be a Saturday, Sunday or a state holiday, it shall be excluded.
§ 10.11 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected
by the repeal and reenactment; but all suits, proceedings and prosecutions for

§ 32.08 NEPOTISM; CONTRACTING WITH UNIT BY A RELATIVE.
   (A)   The town finds it is necessary and desirous to adopt a policy of
conduct with regard to nepotism in the employment with the town and in
contracting with the town in order to continue to be able to provide local

requirements that are “more stringent or detailed” and that more detailed are

town with authority over employees in the town cannot act for such a governing
body to make work assignments, compensation, grievances, advancement or a
performance evaluation without the prior authority of a majority of the
governing body, when a statute provides that a majority is needed to act, and
therefore, without the authority by the majority the single member of the
governing body will not be in the direct line of supervision.
   (H)   All elected and appointed officials and employees of the town are
hereby directed to cooperate fully in the implementation of the policies
created by this section and demonstrate compliance with these same policies.

§ 32.09 LONGEVITY PROGRAM.
   (A)   A longevity program is hereby adopted for eligible employees of the

police officer of the town; (b) has been continuously employed as a police
officer for a consecutive period of at least one calendar year; and (c) is

will be eligible to receive longevity on the first longevity date following
such return. In such cases, the employee’s reward will be calculated based on
all full calendar years of service since their most recent date of hire.
      (2)   The longevity date for any eligible employee with a break in
service (i.e., an employee who has more than one date of hire) is calculated
based only on full calendar years of service since the most recent date of
hire. The longevity program is specifically intended to reflect the town’s
appreciation for employees who have remained with the town consistently over
time, so prior periods of employment are not included in the calculation.
   (E)   The town reserves the right to alter or discontinue the longevity
program at any time. Neither this section nor any aspect of the town’s
longevity program creates any new right, claim, or obligation on behalf of the
town or any town employee.

   (C)   The Clerk-Treasurer may sell any securities acquired and may do
anything necessary to protect the interests of the funds invested, including

COST PRINCIPLES FOR SPENDING FEDERAL FUNDS
§ 33.30 IN GENERAL.
   This subchapter is adopted and is to be implemented by the Town Clerk-
Treasurer and followed by the town and its elected and hired employees.
(Ord. 2023-14, passed 9-26-2023)
§ 33.31 IMPLEMENTATION.
   The Clerk-Treasurer is responsible for the efficient and effective
administration of grant funds through the application of sound management
practices. Such funds shall be administered in a manner consistent with all
applicable federal, state, and local laws, the associated agreements/
assurances, program objectives and the specific terms and conditions of the
grant award.
(Ord. 2023-14, passed 9-26-2023)
§ 33.32 COST PRINCIPLES.
   Except where otherwise authorized by statute, costs shall meet the following
general criteria to be allowable under federal awards:
   (A)   (1)   Be necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient performance
and administration of the federal award and be allocable thereto under these
principles.
      (2)   To be determine whether a cost is reasonable, consideration shall
be given to:
         (a)   Whether a cost is a type generally recognized as ordinary and
necessary for the operation of the town or the proper and efficient performance
of the federal award;
         (b)   The restraints or requirements imposed by such factors as sound
business practice at arm’s length bargaining, federal, state, local, tribal,
and other laws, and regulations;
         (c)   Market prices for comparable goods or services for the
geographic area;
         (d)   Whether the individuals concerned acted with prudence in the
circumstances considering their responsibilities; and
         (e)   Whether the cost represents any significant deviation from the
established practices or policy of the town which may increase the expense.
      (3)   (a)   While federal regulations do not provide specific
descriptions of what satisfies the “necessary” element beyond its inclusion in
the reasonableness analysis above, whether a cost is necessary is determined
based on the needs of the program. Specifically, the expenditure must be
necessary to achieve an important program objective. A key aspect in
determining whether a cost is necessary is whether the town can demonstrate
that the cost addresses an existing need and can prove it.
         (b)   When determining whether a cost is necessary, consideration may
be given to whether:
            1.   The cost is needed for the proper and efficient performance of
the grant program;
            2.   The cost is identified in the approved budget or application;
            3.   There is a benefit to the town, or its residents associated
with the cost;
            4.   The cost aligns with identified needs based on results and
findings from a needs assessment; and
            5.   The cost addresses program goals and objectives and is based
on program data.
         (c)   A cost is allocable to the federal award if the goods or
services involved are chargeable or assignable to the federal award in
accordance with the relative benefit received.
   (B)   Conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth as cost principles
in 2 C.F.R. Part 200 or in the terms and conditions of the federal award.
   (C)   Be consistent with policies and procedures that apply uniformly to
both federally financed and other activities of the town.
   (D)   Be afforded consistent treatment. A cost cannot be assigned to a
federal award as a direct cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose
in like circumstances has been assigned as an indirect cost under another
award.
   (E)   Be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.
   (F)   (1)   Be representative of actual cost, net of all applicable credits
or offsets.
      (2)   The term APPLICABLE CREDITS refers to those receipts or reductions
of expenditures that operate to offset or reduce expense items allocable to the
federal award. Typical examples of such transactions are purchase discounts;
rebates or allowances; recoveries or indemnities on losses; and adjustment of
overpayments or erroneous charges. To the extent that such credits accruing to
or received by the state relate to the federal award, they shall be credited to
the federal award, either as a cost reduction or a cash refund, as appropriate.
   (G)   Not be included as a match or cost-share unless the specific federal
program authorized federal cost to be treated as such.
   (H)   Be adequately documented:
      (1)   In the case of personal services, the Clerk-Treasurer shall
implement a system for town personnel to account for time and efforts expended
on grant funded programs to assure that only permissible personnel expenses are
allocated;
      (2)   In the case of other costs, all receipts and other invoice
materials shall be retained, along with any documentation identifying the need
and purpose for such expenditure if not otherwise clear.
(Ord. 2023-14, passed 9-26-2023)
§ 33.33 SELECTED ITEMS OF COST.
   (A)   The town shall follow the rules for selected items of cost at 2 C.F.R.
Part 200, Subpart E when charging these specific expenditures to a federal
grant.
   (B)   When applicable, town staff shall check cost against the selected
items of cost requirements to ensure cost is allowable, In addition, state,
city, town, and program-specific rules, including the terms and conditions of
the award, may deem a cost as unallowable, and town personnel shall follow
those rules as well.
(Ord. 2023-14, passed 9-26-2023)
§ 33.34 COST COMPLIANCE.
   The Clerk-Treasurer shall require that grant program funds are expended and
are accounted for consistent with the requirements of the specific program and
as identified in the grant application. Compliance monitoring includes
accounting for direct or indirect cost and reporting them as permitted or
required by each grant.
(Ord. 2023-14, passed 9-26-2023)
§ 33.35 DETERMINATION OF DIRECT/INDIRECT COST BY CLERK-TREASURER.
   (A)   Direct costs.
      (1)   DIRECT COSTS are those costs that can be identified specifically
with a particular final cost objective, such as a federal award, or other
internally or externally funded activity, or that can be directly assigned to
such activities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy.
      (2)   These costs may include salaries and fringe benefits of employees
working directly on a grant-funded project; purchased services contracted for
performance under the grant; travel of employees working directly on a grant-
funded project; materials, supplies, and equipment purchased for use on a
specific grant; and infrastructure cost directly attributable to the program
(such as long-distance telephone calls specific to the program, and the like).
   (B)   Indirect costs.
      (1)   INDIRECT COSTS are those that have been incurred for a common or
joint purpose benefiting more than one cost objective and are not readily
assignable to the cost objectives specifically benefitted without effort
disproportionate to the results achieved. Costs incurred for the same purpose
in like circumstance shall be treated consistently as either direct or indirect
costs.
      (2)   These costs may include general data processing, human resources,
utility costs maintenance, accounting, and the like.
      (3)   Federal education programs with supplement not supplant provisions
must use a restricted indirect cost rate. In a restricted rate, costs are
limited to general managements costs. General management costs do not include
divisional administration that is limited to one component of the town, the
Town Council, compensation for the Clerk-Treasurer, and operation of the
immediate offices of these officers.
      (4)   The salaries of administrative and clerical staff normally should
be treated as indirect costs. Direct charging of these costs may be appropriate
only if all the following conditions are met:
         (a)   Administrative or clerical services are integral to a project or
activity.
         (b)   Individuals involved can be specifically identified with the
project or activity.
         (c)   Such costs are explicitly included in the budget or have the
prior written approval of the federal awarding agency.
         (d)   The costs are also not recovered as indirect costs.
   (C)   Where a federal program has a specific cap on the percentage of
administrative costs that may be charged to a grant, that cap shall include all
direct administrative charges as well as any recovered indirect charges.
   (D)   Effort should be given to identify costs as direct costs whenever
practical, but allocation of indirect costs may be used where not prohibited
and where indirect cost allocation is approved ahead of time by the Indiana
State Board of Accounts or the pass-through entity (federal funds subject to 2
C.F.R. Part 200 pertaining to determining indirect cost allocation).
(Ord. 2023-14, passed 9-26-2023)
§ 33.36 TIMELY OBLIGATION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   Obligations are orders placed for property and services, contracts and
subawards made, and similar transactions during a given period that require
payment by a non-federal entity during the same or a future period.
   (B)   The following table illustrates when funds are determined to be
obligated under any federal agency regulations:
   (C)   If obligation is for:
      (1)   Acquisition of property - on the date which the Town Council makes
a binding written commitment to acquire the property.
      (2)   Personal services by an employee of the town - when the service is
performed.
      (3)   Personal services by a contractor who is not an employee of the
town - on the date which the town makes a binding written commitment to obtain
the services.
      (4)   Public utility services - when the town receives the services.
      (5)   Travel - when travel is taken.
      (6)   Rental of property - when the town uses the property.
      (7)   A pre-agreement cost that was properly approved by the Secretary
under the cost principles in 2 C.F.R. Part 200, Subpart E - Cost Principles -
on the first day of the project period.
(Ord. 2023-14, passed 9-26-2023)
§ 33.37 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE.
   (A)   All obligations must occur on or between the beginning and ending
dates of the grant project. This period of time is known as the period of
performance. The period of performance is dictated by statute and will be
indicated in the grant award notification (“GAN”). As a general rule, state-
administered federal funds are available of obligation within the year that
Congress appropriates the funds for. However, given the unique nature of
educational institutions, for many federal education grants, the period of
performance is 27 months. This maximum period includes a 15-month period of
initial availability, plus a 12-month period of carryover. For direct grants,
the period of performance is generally identified in the GAN.
   (B)   In the case of a state-administered grant, obligations under a grant
may not be made until the grant funding period begins or all necessary
materials are submitted to the granting agency, whichever is later. In the case
of a direct grant, obligations may begin when the grant is approved, unless an
agreement exists with the State Board of Accounts or the pass-through the
entity to reimburse for pre-approval expenses.
   (C)   For both state-administered and direct grants, regardless of the
period availability, the town shall liquidate all obligations incurred under
the award not later than 90 days after the end of the funding period unless an
extension is authorized. Any funds not obligated within the period of
performance or liquidated within the appropriate timeframe are said to lapse
and shall be returned to the awarding agency. Consequently, the town shall
closely monitor grant spending throughout the grant cycle.

§ 33.38 VALIDITY.
   This subchapter is and shall be valid upon adoption and publication as

  Use of vehicles - including Town-owned Take-Home Vehicles - by Police

  and instructions.
§ 34.01 GENERAL POLICY.
   Employees may, upon specific written direction or approval of the Town
Council of the Town of Bargersville (the "town"), be assigned a town-owned
vehicle that can be taken to and from the employee's home ("take"home
vehicle"). A take-home vehicle is a privilege determined at the Town Council's
sole discretion, and, as such, no employee is entitled to a take-home vehicle
as part of employment with the town. These vehicles represent a significant
investment of capital and trust by the town and should always be used and
maintained with efficiency, cost, and the public trust in mind. Take-home
vehicles are, at all times, the sole and exclusive property of the town, and

DISPOSAL OF PERSONAL PROPERTY
§ 34.15 PURPOSE AND INCORPORATION.
   (A)   The Indiana Code provides for the sale or disposition of personal
(and/or surplus property). The authority under the Indiana Code is found at
I.C. 5-22-22 et seq. The town hereby incorporates I.C. 5-22-22 et seq. as in
effect at the time of the adoption of this Ordiance and as it may be in effect
in the future. The procedures outlined in this policy are meant to supplement
I.C. 5-22-22 et seq. and serve as the basic guidelines for the disposal of the
Town of Bargersville's personal property. Personal property may also be
referred to as surplus property as in the I.C. 5-22-22 et seq.
   (B)   This policy applies to all town employees and has been developed to
provide guidance for employees on the disposal and/or redistribution of town
personal property. The goals of the chapter are as follows:
      (1)   To ensure that the town receives the greatest possible return for
its property;
      (2)   To ensure that personal property is used, wherever possible, across
multiple departments within the town as the usage throughout multiple town
departments is the most efficient and economical use of personal property and
should always be considered as the first option.
      (3)   To ensure that the decision to dispose of town personal property
and the method of disposal shall not be the responsibility of a single person.
(Ord. 2020-02, passed 3-10-2020)
§ 34.16  DISPOSITION METHODS.
   (A)   Regardless of the disposition method chosen pursuant to the Indiana
Code, the first step is to obtain authorization from the Town Council. Either
the Town Manager or Utility Administrator or Chief of Police shall submit a
written request along with the Authorization for Disposal of Surplus Items to
the Town Council for approval.
   (B)   Scrap/worthless property.
      (1)   Indiana Code 5-22-22-8 covers the disposition of scrap/worthless
property. In addition to the requirements of the Indiana Code, the town
requires a photo(s) of the item(s) to be scrapped and a short memo justifying
the disposal of the personal property as scrap/worthless property.
      (2)   Upon approval by the Town Council to dispose of the worthless/scrap
property the property may be demolish/junked. No money may be accepted for the
property and property may not be given to town employees or the public. The
worthless/scrap property must be disposed of within 30 days from approval by
the Town Council.
   (C)   Recycle/salvage. Indiana Code 5-22-22-7 provides for recycling of
surplus property. Property that is unusable but has some residual market value
and can be recycled may be sold directly to an authorized recycle or salvage
business. In addition to the requirements of the Indiana Code the town requires
a photo(s) of the item(s) to be recycled and a short memo justifying the
recycling/salvaging. The property must be recycled/salvaged within 30 days of
approval from the Town Council. The proceeds must deposited within the Clerk-
Treasurer's Office of the Town of Bargersville and a receipt must also be
provided. The receipt should indicate the date and amount of the sale.
   (D)   Trade-In. Indiana Code 5-22-22-6 provides for the trade-in of surplus
property. In addition to the requirements of I.C. 5-22-22-6 the town requires
the following:
      (1)   Original purchase documentation for the purchase of the property;
      (2)   An official quote from the vendor reflecting the quoted price; and
      (3)   Quote reflecting the trade-in-value and the difference between the
trade-in value and the quoted price for the new property.
   (E)   Sales or transfers to other local governmental entities/
municipalities.  Indiana Code 5-22-22-10 provides for the sale or transfer of
town property to other local governmental entities/municipalities. The
requirements of the I.C. 5-22-22-10 are incorporated into this policy.
Governmental entities may exchange property upon terms and conditions agreed
upon and evidenced by the adoption of similar matching resolutions of each
governmental entity. The resolution must include the name of the receiving
entity and description of the property.
   (F)   Sales to the public. Indiana Code 5-22-22-4, 4.5, 4.7, 5, and 6
provide for the sale of surplus sale to the general public in a variety of
manners. The relevant sections of the Indiana Code should be referenced for
procedures before proceeding with a public sale.
   (G)   Disposal of computer hardware and equipment. Prior to the disposal of
town computer equipment and storage devices all information contained on the
computer equipment and storage devices must be removed. Prior to disposal of
town computer equipment and storage devices all such equipment shall be
delivered to the Town IT Coordinator who shall ensure that all such equipment
is wiped clean.

§ 52.06 INSTALLATION OF CHECK VALVES ON ALL WATER SERVICES.
   (A)   With the approval of the Indiana State Board of Health, the water
utility is now installing check valves on all water services.
      (1)   This is to prevent backflows due to high water temperatures that
some new appliances require.
      (2)   The water pressure caused by high temperature when the water is
heated results in the pressure release valve operating.
      (3)   If the pressure relief valve does not operate properly, the water
pressure could raise to a level that might cause damage to some appliances.
   (B)   To alleviate this problem, the water utility recommends that all water
heaters have an expansion tank installed on them.
   (C)   The water utility also recommends the use of a pressure reducing valve
where the water pressure exceeds 80 p.s.i. Pressure reducing valves can be
supplied at the owner’s request per the appropriate sections of this code of
ordinances.
(Res. 2015-9, passed 6-23-2015)
§ 52.07 CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   To provide for the protection of the public potable water system
from the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within its
water customers' private water systems any contaminants or pollutants which
could, under adverse conditions, backflow into the public potable water system.
      (2)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will, effectively, prevent or control existing or
potential cross connections.
   (B)   Definitions. As used in this chapter, the following terms have the
following meanings:
      AIR GAP. An unobstructed vertical distance through atmosphere between the
discharge end of a pipeline supplied from a public water supply and the
overflow rim of the receiving portion of the customer water system.
      APPROVED BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY. An assembly that is in accordance
with 327 IAC 8-10-7(b).
      BACKFLOW. The flow of water or contaminants into the public potable water
system from a source other than the public water supply.
      CONTAINMENT. A method of backflow prevention which requires an approved
backflow prevention assembly at the water service entrance.
      CROSS CONNECTION. Any physical arrangement, including cross connection
control devices not in working order, whereby the public potable water system
is directly connected, either continuously or intermittently, with any
secondary source of supply, sewer, drain, conduit, pool, piping, storage
reservoir, plumbing fixture, or other device that contains, or may contain, and
is capable of imparting to the public water supply, contaminants, contaminated
water, sewage, or other waste or liquid of unknown or unsafe quality.
      CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL DEVICE INSPECTOR. A person that meets the
definition of 327 IAC 8-10-1(8).
      CUSTOMER WATER SYSTEM. All piping, fixtures, and appurtenances, including
secondary sources of supply, used by a customer to convey water on his or her
premises.
      DEGREE OF HAZARD (POLLUTANT OR CONTAMINANT). Either a "low hazard
pollutant" which is only aesthetically objectionable (i.e., unusual taste,
odor, beverages, and the like) or a "high hazard contaminant" that could cause
illness or death if ingested (i.e., bacteriological, toxic chemicals,
radioactive materials, and the like).
      DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY. A device or assembly composed of two tightly
closing shutoff valves surrounding two independently acting check valves, with
four test cocks, one upstream of the four valves and one between each of the
four check and shutoff valves.
      HEALTH AGENCY. The health authority having jurisdiction; federal, state
or local.
      POINT OF DELIVERY. See SERVICE CONNECTION.
      PRIVATE FIRE SERVICE. Refers to a privately owned arrangement of pipes,

entering the public potable water system and to require certain backflow
prevention assemblies in private customer water systems to prevent backflow
into the public potable water system.
      (2)   Water customers have the responsibility to test and maintain their
respective private customer water systems free of cross connections and to
comply with all federal, state, county and town laws, ordinances and
regulations pertaining to cross connections.
      (3)   The utility shall be the interpreter of this chapter and the
arbiter and judge as to whether a backflow assembly is required. If such a
backflow assembly is required, exact installation, alignment and elevation
requirements shall be determined by reference to 327 IAC 8-10-7 and other
applicable state and local regulations.
   (D)   Policy.
      (1)   The policy of the utility is to control backflow by containment of
all cross connections which shall be found to exist or which may be installed
in the future on private customer water systems. Containment shall be achieved
by:
         (a)   Assuring that the customer water system, or any portion thereof,
which may create or is causing backflow, is physically disconnected from the
public potable water system; or
         (b)   Installing an approved backflow prevention assembly at the
appropriate location to isolate said customer water system from the public
potable water system.
   (E)   Backflow prevention is required when one or more of the following
situations apply:
      (1)   By Order of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management in
accordance with 327 IAC 8-10-04 Cross Connection Hazards.
      (2)   By order of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management in
accordance with 327 IAC 8-10-05 Secondary Sources of Supply.
      (3)   By order of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management in
accordance with 327 IAC 8-10-06 land irrigation buried below ground.
      (4)   By Order of the utility, provided that notice is given that
specifies the nature of the customer activity that necessitates designation of
the facility as cross connection hazard and a date by which the facility must
comply with the order.
      (5)   For new construction of any of the following facilities:
         (a)   Facilities that present a cross-connection hazard as defined in
division (E);
         (b)   Proposed facilities with unknown tenants, commonly known as
"spec buildings";
         (c)   Facilities with a secondary source of supply, including but not
limited to, emergency use, fire prevention, irrigation; or
         (d)   Facilities that plan to use fire protection service lines in the
facility.
      (6)   For existing facilities requiring the following types of
modifications:
         (a)   Installation of a new customer service line if the facility is
one of the types of facilities identified in section (E)(5);
         (b)   Modifications to a facility's customer service line if the
facility is one of the types of facilities identified in section (E)(5); or
         (c)   Modifications involving the installation of additional or larger
capacity meters if the facility is one of the types of facilities identified in
section (E)(5).
   (F)   Installation, testing, reporting, access, and inspections.
      (1)   Use of backflow prevention assembly. When backflow prevention is
required as set forth in section (E), the water customer shall install, at the
water customer's expense, an approved backflow prevention assembly that is in
accordance with 327 IAC 8-10-7 and provides protection commensurate with the
degree of hazard, hydraulic conditions, and is appropriate with the length of
time the backflow prevention assembly is subject to be under pressure.
      (2)   Location. The backflow prevention assembly shall be located
immediately downstream of the water meter and shall not be bypassed by any
means. There shall be no taps upstream of the backflow prevention assembly that
are not protected by additional backflow prevention assemblies. The existence
of backflow prevention assemblies on the water customer's premises other than
at this required location shall not negate the requirement at this location.
Exact installation, alignment and elevation requirements shall be determined by
reference to 327 IAC 8-10-7 and other applicable state and local regulations.
      (3)   Air gap or reduced pressure principle backflow preventer required.
A reduced pressure principle backflow preventer shall be required for cross-
connections defined in 327 IAC 8-10-4(c).
      (4)   Uninterrupted service. Water customers needing continuous service
that cannot be interrupted for testing the backflow prevention assembly shall
install dual backflow prevention assemblies in parallel so that they can be
checked separately.
      (5)   Looped taps. Heat exchange loops intentionally returning water to
the public potable water system shall not be allowed. Any other loop or set of
taps into a private customer water system allowing water to return to the
public potable water system shall require approved backflow prevention
assemblies on all taps.
      (6)   Private fire service. No connection shall be made to any fire
hydrant or private fire service without an approved backflow prevention
assembly. Private fire service that is permanent in nature shall incorporate a
double check valve assembly in 100% water systems or a reduced pressure
principle backflow preventer in chemical systems. Where domestic service is
tapped into a private fire service, the domestic tap shall be subject to all
the provisions of this chapter.
      (7)   Pre-existing facilities. In general, pre-existing backflow
preventers will not be allowed simply because they were approved before the
enactment of this chapter. The utility will review the operation and hazard of
each facility with backflow preventers and determine acceptability based on
operability and present hazard. If the backflow preventers are found
unacceptable, they shall be replaced with an approved backflow prevention
assembly, at the water customer's expense, in accordance with this chapter.
Pre-existing facilities that have no backflow prevention assembly and where
there is a definite present hazard shall be required to install an approved
backflow prevention assembly, regardless of whether their plumbing system was
previously approved by the town.
      (8)   Testing intervals. The water customer shall have its backflow
prevention assembly(ies) tested by a cross connection control device inspector
at intervals in accordance with 327 IAC 8-10-8 at the water customer's expense.
      (9)   Reporting requirements. State certified cross connection control
device inspectors shall submit the backflow assembly testing result and
assembly repair and/or overhaul reports to the utility pursuant to procedures
required by the utility within ten calendar days after the test has been
completed.
      (10)   Access. The customer shall permit access to the customer's
premises by the Bargersville Inspector, or the Commissioner ("Commissioner"
means the Commissioner of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management,")
at reasonable times, and upon presentation of identification, for inspection of
the customer water system or testing of cross connection control devices
installed in accordance with 327 IAC 8-10. On request, the owner, lessee, or
occupant of any property so served shall furnish to the inspection agency any
pertinent information regarding the piping system or systems on such property.
If access for inspection is denied for any reason, a maximum hazard shall be
assumed requiring a reduced pressure backflow prevention assembly.
      (11)   Inspection intervals. The town may cause inspections to be made of
all properties served by the public water system where cross connections with
the public water system are deemed possible. The frequency of any such
inspections and re-inspections based on potential health hazards involved may
be established by the town.
   (G)   Temporary water service.
      (1)   With the prior consent of the utility, a water customer may receive
temporary water service.
      (2)   The water customer must rent a meter for temporary water service
from the utility and pay a fee as set forth in the utility's schedule of non-
recurring rates and charges. The water customer shall submit a deposit for a
meter.
      (3)   Any approved backflow prevention assembly shall be provided at the
water customer's sole expense and shall at all times remain the property of the
water customer. It is the water customer's responsibility to ensure the
approved backflow prevention assembly is in working order at all times
temporary water service is being used.
      (4)   If an air gap is used for backflow prevention, it is the water
customer's responsibility to ensure that the air gap meets the requirements of
327 IAC 8-10-7(a).
      (5)   Failure to comply with the provisions of this section shall subject
the water customer to enforcement procedures outlined in section (H).
   (H)   Enforcement.
      (1)   Disconnection of water service. Service of water to any customer
water system or any temporary water service connection shall be discontinued by
the utility if one or more of the following occurs:
         (a)   It is found that an approved backflow prevention assembly
required by this chapter is not installed, tested, maintained and reported
appropriately, or if it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been
removed or bypassed on a customer water system connected to the public potable
water system, or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises.
Service will not be restored until such conditions are corrected.
      (2)   Customer fines. Customers who are in violation of this chapter
shall be subject to a fine of $250 for each violation if one or more of the
following occurs:
         (a)   It is found that an approved backflow prevention assembly
required by this chapter is not installed, tested, maintained and reported
appropriately, or if it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been
removed or bypassed on a customer water system connected to the public potable
water system, or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises.
Service will not be restored until such conditions are corrected.
   (I)   Procedure.
      (1)   Notice of violation. A written notice will be sent by first class
mail to the water customer stating the specific violation, the recommended
action, the time by which the violation must be cured, and the penalty for
failing to cure such violation.
      (2)   Discontinued service. When the water customer has been provided
with the notice of noncompliance and fails to cure the same as provided in the
written notice, service to the water customer will be discontinued.
      (3)   Discontinued service will consist of closing the control valve to
or separating the control valve from the customer water system, or fire hydrant
in the case of temporary water service, and the water customer will incur the
standard monetary penalties for delinquent water shut-off. The utility will not
restore service to the water customer until the utility has determined that the
water customer is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   If it is found that a cross connection control device inspector is
in violation of any part of this chapter or 327 IAC 8-10, the utility reserves
the right to discontinue accepting backflow prevention assembly testing results
and assembly repair and/or overhaul reports in any format performed by the
cross connection control device inspector found in violation at the discretion
of the utility for a duration of time determined by the utility.

§ 52.08 PROCEDURE FOR ADJUSTMENT OF EXCESSIVE WATER BILLS CAUSED BY LEAKAGE.
   (A)   Applicability. This section applies only to residential water utility
customers (hereinafter the “customer”).
   (B)   Water leak adjustment procedure. If a customer is experiencing a leak
(s) in any underground service pipe, crawl space, or concrete floor
(“underground leaks”), the Billing Manager may approve a water leak adjustment
in accordance with the following:
      (1)   Within 30 days of receipt of a bill from the water utility the
customer must apply for a leak adjustment with the water utility’s billing
department. If a customer fails to apply for a leak adjustment within the
specified time the customer is not eligible for an adjustment.
      (2)   The customer request for an adjustment must be in writing.
      (3)   The customer has not received a leak adjustment within the previous
12 months.
      (4)   The customer will be responsible for 25% of the total charges
billed for the wasted water. Those charges shall be estimated from the
beginning date of the leak to the date of repair. Repair shall not exceed two
regular meter reading periods unless otherwise extended by missed readings.
      (5)   For the purposes of this division (B), the term WASTED WATER shall
be considered the amount used above the customer’s normal consumption, as
determined by the customer’s consumption record. If there is no consumption
record, the average consumption for the previous calendar year for the
appropriate customer classification will be used as the normal consumption.
      (6)   An adjustment may only be given under this division (B) after the
customer has repaired the condition causing the leak and the premises has been
inspected by the town to determine that repairs have been properly made, and
there is no longer apparent evidence of a leak.
      (7)   Any type of leak in underground irrigation systems, swimming pools,
and/or sump pumps are not included in the term “underground leaks” and are not
eligible for an adjustment under this division (B).
   (C)   If a customer is experiencing a leak that is not an underground leak
covered by division (A) above (“other hidden leaks”), the billing manager may

   (D)   There shall be two classes of building sewer permits: (a) for
residential and commercial (nonindustrial) service, and (b) for service to
industries producing industrial waste. In either case, the application shall be
supplemented by any plans, specifications, or any other information considered
pertinent in the judgment of the town. Any industry, as a condition of permit
authorization, must provide information describing its wastewater constituents,
characteristics, and type of activity.
   (E)   All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and connection
of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner(s). The owner(s) shall
indemnify and hold harmless the town from any loss or damage or claim thereof,
including but not limited to costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, that may be
directly or indirectly occasioned by the installation and connection of the
building sewer.
   (F)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building, except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or driveway. The
building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and
the whole considered one building sewer. However, it is the responsibility of
the owner of the rear building to obtain such easement and/or other permission
from the owner of the front building as is necessary to connect to the building
sewer of the front building. The town is not responsible for obtaining such
permission, and the town does not and will not assume any obligation or
responsibility for damage caused by or resulting from any such connection.
   (G)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found, on examination and testing by the Utilities Administrator,
to meet all requirements of this chapter.
   (H)   The size, slopes, alignment and materials of construction of a
building sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe,
jointing, testing, and backfilling of the trench, shall all conform to the
requirements of the State of Indiana Building and Plumbing Code and any other
applicable rules and regulations of the town. In the absence of code
provisions, the materials, procedures and specifications set forth in the ASTM
and WPCF Manual of Practice No. 9, shall apply.
   (I)   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at an elevation at least two feet below ground level. In all buildings in which
any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer,
sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved
means and discharged to the building sewer.
   (J)   No person(s) shall make connection of roof downspouts, foundation
drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a
building sewer or otherwise directly or indirectly to the POTW.
   (K)   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall
conform to the requirements of 327 IAC 3-6-8 and any applicable rules and
regulations of the town, or the procedures set forth in appropriate
specifications of the ASTM. All such connections shall be made gastight and
watertight, and verified by proper testing to prevent the inclusion of
infiltration/inflow. The town prior to installation must approve any deviation
from the prescribed procedures and materials.
   (L)   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the town when
the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer.
The connection and inspection shall be made under the supervision of the
Utilities Administrator.
   (M)   All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard, and
such is the responsibility of the applicant and of his or her contractors,
employees or other persons performing such work. The town does not undertake to
supervise, inspect or be responsible for the safety of such excavations and
installations, and the town shall assume no duty in that regard. Streets,
sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the
work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the town.
   (N)   No person shall make a service connection with any public sewer unless
licensed by the State of Indiana to perform such work, and no permit shall be
granted to any person who is not so licensed.
   (O)   Any person desiring to make a service connection with public sewers
shall contact the town and provide satisfactory evidence that the applicant or
his employee or contractor is licensed to perform such work.

§ 53.06 GENERAL SEWER USE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   General prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through
or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW
whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any
other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements.
   (B)   Specific prohibitions.
      (1)   No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW the
following pollutants, substances, or wastewater:
         (a)   Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW,
including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint of
less than 140°F (60°C) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21;
         (b)   Wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or more than 9.5, or
otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment;
         (c)   Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause
obstruction of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference but in no case
solids greater than 1/2 inches (0.5") in any dimension;
         (d)   Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.),
released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which,
either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference
with the POTW;
         (e)   Wastewater having a temperature greater than 150°F (65.6°C), or
which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in
interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the
introduction into the treatment plant to exceed 104°F (40°C);
         (f)   Non-polar fats, oils and greases such as petroleum oil,
nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in amounts
that will cause interference or pass through;
         (g)   Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors,
or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and
safety problems;
         (h)   Trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points
designated by Wastewater Supervisor in accordance with §
53.09(D) of this chapter;
         (i)   Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other
wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are
sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry
into the sewers for maintenance or repair;
         (j)   Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the
treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable
tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's
effluent, thereby violating the town's NPDES permit;
         (k)   Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except
in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations;
         (l)   Storm water, surface water, ground water, artesian well water,
roof runoff, subsurface drainage, swimming pool drainage, condensate, deionized
water, noncontact cooling water, and unpolluted wastewater, unless specifically
authorized by the Wastewater Supervisor;
         (m)   Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of
industrial wastes;
         (n)   Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the
Wastewater Supervisor in an individual wastewater discharge permit;
         (o)   Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources,
the treatment plant's effluent to fail toxicity test;
         (p)   Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances which
that might cause excessive foaming in the POTW; or
         (q)   Polar fats, oils, or greases in concentrations greater than 100
milligram per liter.
      (2)   Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section
shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged
to the POTW.
   (C)   National categorical pretreatment standards. Users must comply with
the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N,
Parts 405-471.
      (1)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in
terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Wastewater Supervisor may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with divisions (C)(4) and (5) below.
      (2)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the
Wastewater Supervisor may convert the limits to equivalent limitations
expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent
concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to
individual industrial users.
      (3)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Wastewater
Supervisor shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e).
      (4)   When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the town
convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert
concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the Wastewater
Supervisor. The town may establish equivalent mass limits only if the
industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in (B)(4)(a)1. through (B)
(4)(a)5. below.
         (a)   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user
must:
            1.   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of
its individual wastewater discharge permit;
            2.   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
            3.   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's
actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term
average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-
term average production rate must be representative of current operating
conditions;
            4.   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the discharge; and
            5.   Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user's request
for equivalent mass limits.
         (b)   An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
            1.   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
            2.   Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use
of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
            3.   Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify
the Wastewater Supervisor whenever production rates are expected to vary by
more than 20% from its baseline production rates determined in division (C)(4)
(f). Upon notification of a revised production rate, the Wastewater Supervisor
will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to
reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
            4.   Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to division B(4)(a)1. so
long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
         (c)   When developing equivalent mass limits, the Wastewater
Supervisor:
            1.   Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial
user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for
the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
            2.   Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess
the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect
changed conditions at the facility; and
            3.   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial user's actual
average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of
water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow
rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not
based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to division
(G). The industrial user must also be in compliance with §
53.16(C) regarding the prohibition of bypass.
      (5)   The Wastewater Supervisor may convert the mass limits of the
categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to
concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to
individual industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the
Wastewater Supervisor.
      (6)   Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with
the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated
categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived.
      (7)   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where
such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be
used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation.
      (8)   Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating
equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based
standard shall notify the Wastewater Supervisor within two business days after
the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the
Wastewater Supervisor of such anticipated change will be required to meet the
mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original
estimate of the long term average production rate.
   (D)   State pretreatment standards. Users must comply with Indiana
pretreatment standards codified at 327 IAC 5-18-1 to 5-18-10.
   (E)   Local limits.
      (1)   The Wastewater Supervisor is authorized to establish Local Limits
pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c).
      (2)   The following pollutant limits are established to protect against
pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing
in excess of the following daily maximum allowable discharge limits.
Parameter Limit (mg/L)
Parameter      Limit (mg/L)
Arsenic        0.92
Chromium       0.49
Copper         0.48
Lead           0.19
Mercury        0.00065
Nickel         5.34
Oil and grease 100
Selenium       0.33
Zinc           2.32
 
   The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to
the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless
indicated otherwise. The Wastewater Supervisor may impose mass limitations in
addition to the concentration-based limitations above.
      (3)   The Wastewater Supervisor may develop Best Management Practices
(BMPs), by ordinance or individual wastewater discharge permits, to implement
local limits and the requirements of divisions (A) and (B).
   (F)   Town's right of revision. The town reserves the right to establish, by
ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, more stringent
standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose
of this chapter.
   (G)   Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in
any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The
Wastewater Supervisor may impose mass limitations on users who are using
dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other
cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

§ 53.07 USER RATE SCHEDULE FOR CHARGES; AVAILABILITY AND CONNECTION FEES.
   (A)   Rates and charges. For the use of and the services rendered by the
POTW, rates and charges shall be collected from the owner or user of each and
every lot, parcel of real estate or building that is connected with the town’s
sanitary sewage system or otherwise discharges sanitary sewage, industrial
waste, water or other liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the sanitary
sewer system of the Town of Bargersville, which rates and charges are payable
as hereinafter provided and shall be in an amount determinable as follows:
      (1)   The sewage rates and charges shall be computed on a base charge/
flow charge system related to the quantity of water used on or in the premises
subject to such use, and shall be composed of (1) a monthly base charge, based
on the water meter size and (2) a gallonage charge per 1,000 gallons, all
subject to an overall monthly minimum charge, except as otherwise provided in
this chapter. Sewage service rates, based upon these factors, shall be as
follows:
         (a)   Metered rates:
 
Metered Rates     Phase I (effective 1-1-2022) Phase II (effective 1-1-2023)
Per 1,000 gallons $9.17                        $10.31
 
         (b)   Base charge per month. In addition to the metered block rate or
applicable minimum consumption schedule, each user shall pay a monthly base
charge in accordance with the following applicable size of meter installed:
Meter Size Charge per Month
           Phase I (effective 1-1-2022) Phase II (effective 1-1-2023)
Meter Size      Charge per Month
                Phase I (effective 1-1-2022) Phase II (effective 1-1-2023)

10 inch         $2,320.68                    $2,608.44
 
         (c)   Minimum consumption:
 
Minimum Charge Phase I (effective 1-1-2022) Phase II (effective 1-1-2023)
2,000 gallons  $30.41                       $34.19
 
      (2)   Notwithstanding division (A)(1) of this section, the minimum charge
per month for sewage service for any user, whether a metered water consumer or
a user who is not a water user, is $34.19.
      (3)   For the services rendered to the Town of Bargersville, the town
shall be subject to the same rates and charges as hereinbefore provided, or to
charges and rates established in harmony therewith.
      (4)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate
or buildings discharging sewage, water or other liquids into the town’s POTW,
either directly or indirectly, are users of water and the quantity of water is
measured by a single water meter, then in each such case, for billing purposes,
the minimum charge of the sewage rates and charges shall be multiplied by the
number of residential lots, parcels of real estate or buildings served through
the single water meter.
      (5)   In the event two or more dwelling units, such as trailers,
apartments or housekeeping rooms, discharging sewage, water or other liquids
into the town’s POTW, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and the
quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in such case, for
billing purposes, the minimum charge of the sewage rates and charges shall be
multiplied by the number of dwelling units. A dwelling unit shall be
interpreted as a room or rooms or other living space or spaces, in which
cooking facilities are provided.
      (6)   Water which is used in the process of manufacture or for any other
purpose, which does not discharge into the POTW shall be exempt from charges;
provided, however, that the property owner shall install the necessary meters
to indicate the amount of water which does not discharge into a combined or
sanitary sewer of the POTW of Town of Bargersville, which meter shall be
subject to the approval of the town.
      (7)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary waste, water or other liquid into the POTW of the town, either
directly or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied by the town, and the
water used thereon or therein is not measured by a town water meter or by a
meter acceptable to the town, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise
measured or determined by the town in order to determine the rate of charge
provided for in this chapter, or the owner, or other interested party, at his
or her own expense, may install and maintain a water meter or other water or
sewage measuring device acceptable to the town for said purpose, and the
quantity of water used, as measured by said meter, shall be used to determine
the sewage service charge and there shall be charged an amount determined by
the sewage service rates as herein set forth.
      (8)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharges
sewage in the form of industrial waste, either directly or indirectly, into the
POTW of the town, and the town finds it is not practicable to attempt to
measure such wastes by meter, it shall measure the same in such manner and by
such method as it may find practical in the light of the conditions and
attendant circumstances of the case in order to determine the rates and charges
according to the corresponding rates provided in this chapter. If the town
finds that it is practicable to attempt to measure such wastes by meter, then
the owner of the property shall install and maintain a meter acceptable to the
town on ten days’ notice.
      (9)   Special service rates.
         (a)   Special service rates shall be applicable to all users who
generate wastewater which contains any nonconventional pollutants or strengths
of BOD, SS, TKN, or TP that exceed the system average strengths of 300 ppm BOD,
300 ppm SS, 40 ppm TKN, and 7 ppm TP as determined by testing to be included in
the user’s individual discharge permit. Strength charges are to be computed on
actual measured strengths and volumes.
         (b)   Special service rates shall be determined by the Wastewater
Supervisor.
      (10)   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered, the town shall have the right to base its
charges not only on volume, but also on the strength and character of the
sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly, into the town’s
POTW in such manner and by such method as it may find practicable, in light of
the conditions and attending circumstances of the case in order to determine
the proper charges. The charges shall, where deemed necessary, be adjusted on a
flat rate basis by the month.
      (11)   Such rates and charges shall be billed monthly and shall be due
and payable on or before the last day of the calendar month next succeeding the
day of billing; provided, however, that the first billing may be for a period
of more or less than a full month, in order to make the monthly collection
periods correspond with the water meter readings of the town, depending upon
the date the sewage works rates and charges go into effect.
      (12)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants
occupying the properties served, if requested in writing by the owner, but such
billing shall not relieve the owner from liability in the event payment is not
made by the tenant or tenants as herein required. The owners of properties
served which are occupied by tenants shall have the right to examine the
collection records of the town for the purpose of determining whether such
rates and charges have been paid by such tenants, provided that such
examination shall be made at the office in which the records are kept and
during the hours that the office is open for business.
      (13)   The Town of Bargersville is hereby authorized to make any
adjustment in any charges billed to a metered user of water for any purpose
where such water does not enter the sewer system of the town.
      (14)   Nonadditional metered residential users.
         (a)   This division (A)(14) applies only to nonadditional metered
residential users of the POTW. NONADDITIONAL METERED means and refers to a
residential user whose usage of the sewage works is billed entirely through one
water meter and who has no additional water meter to bill for special or
nonresidential uses, including but not limited to commercial or industrial
uses, and lawn sprinkling, the filling of swimming pools and other uses that do
not enter the sanitary sewer system.
         (b)   A residential user is a user of the sewage works whose premises
or building is used primarily as a residence for one or more persons, including
all dwelling units. In the event a portion of the premises or building is used
for commercial or industrial purposes or other nonresidential purposes, the
owner shall have the privilege, at the owner’s cost, of separating water
service so that the residential portion of the premises or building is served
through a separate meter, and in such case, the water usage as registered by
the water meter serving such portion of the premises used for residential
purposes shall qualify for the rates set pursuant to this division (A)(14).
         (c)   In order that there will be no additional sewage charges to
nonadditional metered residential users for water used in lawn sprinkling and
other uses that do not enter the sewer system during the months of May, June,
July, August, September and October of each year (“the summer months”), the
monthly sewage billing for nonadditional metered residential users for each
May, June, July, August, September and October in each year shall be determined
as follows:
            1.   The lower of (i) actual or estimated units of water used as
billed by the town pursuant to the normal rates provided in divisions (A)(1)
and (2) of this section as amended or (ii) 1.334 x (times) the winter average.
            2.   The winter average shall be defined as the actual or estimated
units of water used as billed by the municipal water utility during the
preceding months of December, January, February, March and April divided by
five.
            3.   Nonadditional metered residential users without a winter
average shall be billed the lower of (i) actual or estimated units of water
used as billed by the town pursuant to the normal rates provided in divisions
(A)(1) and (2) of this section as amended or (ii) the charge for 5,000 gallons
of water x (times) 1.334 of the normal rates provided in (a) divisions (A)(1)
and (2) of this section.
      (15)   Special adjustments.
         (a)   NONADDITIONAL METERED has the same meaning in this division as
in division (A)(14) of this section.
         (b)   The town, acting through the Utilities Administrator, is hereby
authorized to consider and act upon all requests for adjustments in sewer
charges received from large volume water users such as swimming pool owners,
persons using automatic sprinkler systems, persons experiencing major water
leaks on their premises and other persons whose measured water use does not
fairly reflect the amount of the sewage being introduced into the sewage
system. The granting and amount of any adjustment is in the discretion of the
utility.
         (c)   In the case of draining and/or refilling swimming pools, no
adjustment shall be made unless the nonmetered user contacts the utility prior
to draining and/or refilling his or her pool and makes arrangements for the
adjustment. In the case of nonmetered users seeking adjustments on account of
watering new sod or newly seeded lawns or newly repaired lawns, no adjustment
shall be made unless the nonmetered user contacts the utility prior to watering
and makes arrangements for the adjustment. In the cases of leaks in water lines
where the leak does not cause or allow water to enter the sewage system, the
granting in the amount of any adjustment may be conditioned upon, among other
things, prompt repair of such leaks.
   (B)   Availability and connection fees.
      (1)   No connection to the town’s POTW shall be allowed until a permit is
obtained and payment of sewer availability fee, force main availability fee and
sewer connection fee have been made to the town, except as provided in division
(B)(7) of this section.
      (2)   Sewer availability fee (or SAF). For a standard single-family
residence which is not part of a subdivision and for any user which is not
residential and which also is not part of a commercial subdivision, the SAF is
charged and paid at the time of connection to the town’s POTW. For a
subdivision, residential or commercial, the developer shall pay one-half of the
SAF for each lot in the subdivision to the town at the time of the execution of
a sewer service agreement. For a subdivision, residential or commercial, the
other one-half of the SAF shall be paid to the town by the lot owner at or
before the issuance of a building permit.
      (3)   Force main availability fee (or FMAF). For a standard single-family
residence which is not part of a subdivision and for any user which is not
residential and which also is not part of a commercial subdivision, the FMAF is
charged and paid at the time of connection to the town’s POTW. For a
subdivision, residential or commercial, the developer shall pay all of the FMAF
for each lot in the subdivision to the town at the time of the execution of a
sewer service agreement.
      (4)   Sewer connection fee (or SCF). The SCF is paid at the time of
connection to the town’s POTW.
      (5)   (a)   The sewer availability fee is hereby established in the
amount of$4,100 effective January 1, 2022 (Phase I) and $4,100 effective
January 1, 2023 (Phase II) per standard single-family residential unit.
         (b)   The force main availability fee is hereby established in the
amount of$400 effective January 1, 2022 (Phase I) and $400 effective January 1,
2023 (Phase II) per standard single-family residential unit.
      (6)   (a)   The SAF and FMAF for users which are not standard single-
family residential units shall be based on equivalent domestic units (“EDUs”).
(For example, if it is determined that a user which is not a standard single-
family residential unit will use two EDUs per day, the SAF for such user shall
be $5,100 and the FMAF shall be $500.) See the table below. SAFs and FMAFs are
not computed in fractions and are rounded up.
         (b)   For purposes of determining the estimated average flow in
gallons per day for users other than a standard single-family residence and for
purposes of calculating the SAF and FMAF, the number of EDUs for a user, other
than a standard single-family residence, shall be determined according to the
table below, which estimated flow shall be divided by 310 gpd to derive the
number of EDUs and to calculate the resulting SAF and FMAF:

§ 53.08 POWERS AND AUTHORITY OF INSPECTORS.
   (A)   Right of entry; inspection and sampling. The Wastewater Supervisor
shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the
user is complying with all requirements of this chapter and any individual
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the
Wastewater Supervisor ready access to all parts of the premises for the
purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the
performance of any additional duties.
      (1)   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Wastewater Supervisor shall be permitted to
enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
      (2)   The Wastewater Supervisor shall have the right to set up on the
user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
      (3)   The Wastewater Supervisor may require the user to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure
wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated as recommended by equipment
manufacturer to ensure their accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
user at the written or oral request of the Wastewater Supervisor and shall not
be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Wastewater Supervisor access to
the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
   (B)   Search warrants. If the Wastewater Supervisor has been refused access
to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the town designed to verify compliance with
this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, the Wastewater Supervisor
may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

§ 53.09 PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER.
   (A)   Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all
categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out
in §
53.06 within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or Wastewater
Supervisor, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for
compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense.
Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to Wastewater Supervisor for review, and shall be acceptable to the
Wastewater Supervisor before such facilities are constructed. The review of
such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge
acceptable to the town under the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Additional pretreatment measures.
      (1)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Wastewater Supervisor may require
users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that
certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial
wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW
and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   The Wastewater Supervisor may require any person discharging into
the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a
suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An
individual wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow
equalization.
      (3)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Wastewater Supervisor, they are necessary for the proper
handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand;
except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All
interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Wastewater
Supervisor, shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired by the
user at their expense.
      (4)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
   (C)   Accidental discharge/slug discharge control plans. The Wastewater
Supervisor shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/slug
discharge control plan or other action to control slug discharges. The
Wastewater Supervisor may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and
implement such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary to
control slug discharges. Alternatively, the Wastewater Supervisor may develop
such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan
shall address, at a minimum, the following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Wastewater Supervisor of
any accidental or slug discharge, as required by §
53.11(F) of this chapter; and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   (D)   Hauled wastewater.
      (1)   Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations
designated by the Wastewater Supervisor, and at such times as are established
by the Wastewater Supervisor. Such waste shall not violate §
53.06 of this chapter or any other requirements established by the town. The
Wastewater Supervisor may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain
individual wastewater discharge permits.
      (2)   The Wastewater Supervisor may require haulers of industrial waste
to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits. The Wastewater Supervisor
may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain individual
wastewater discharge permits. The Wastewater Supervisor also may prohibit the
disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste
is subject to all other requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations
designated by the Wastewater Supervisor. No load may be discharged without
prior consent of the Wastewater Supervisor. The Wastewater Supervisor may
collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable
standards. The Wastewater Supervisor may require the industrial waste hauler to
provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.
      (4)   Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for
every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the
industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and
addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The
form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste
constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.
(Ord. 2019-25, passed 11-26-2019)
§ 53.10 INDIVIDUAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS.
   (A)   Wastewater analysis. When requested by the Wastewater Supervisor, a
user must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its
wastewater within 60 days of the request. The Wastewater Supervisor is
authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require
users to update this information.
   (B)   Individual wastewater discharge permit requirement.
      (1)   No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the
POTW without first obtaining an individual wastewater discharge permit from
IDEM.
      (2)   The Wastewater Supervisor may require other users to obtain
individual wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes
of this chapter.
      (3)   The Wastewater Supervisor is authorized to accept or deny new or
increased dischargers. A permit from IDEM does not supersede this authority.
      (4)   Any violation of the terms and conditions of an individual
wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and
subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in §§
53.14 and
53.15. Obtaining an individual wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a
permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment
standards or requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state, and
local law.
   (C)   Existing connections. Any user required to obtain an individual
wastewater discharge permit who was discharging wastewater into the POTW prior
to the effective date of this chapter and who wishes to continue such
discharges in the future, shall, within 30 days after said date, apply to the
IDEM for an individual wastewater discharge permit.
   (D)   New connections. Any user required to obtain an individual wastewater
discharge permit who proposes to begin or recommence discharging into the POTW
must obtain such permit prior to the beginning or recommencing of such
discharge. An application for this individual wastewater discharge permit, must
be filed at least 90 days prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin
or recommence.
(Ord. 2019-25, passed 11-26-2019)
§ 53.11 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Baseline monitoring reports.
      (1)   Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical
pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category
determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing
categorical industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge
to the POTW shall submit to the Wastewater Supervisor a report which contains
the information listed in division (A)(2), below. At least 90 days prior to
commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become
categorical industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical standard, shall submit to the Wastewater Supervisor a report which
contains the information listed in division (B), below. A new source shall
report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable
categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its
anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
      (2)   Users described above shall submit the information set forth below.
         (a)   All information required in §
53.10(E)(1)(a)1., §
53.10(E)(1)(b), §
53.10(E)(1)(c)1., and §
53.10(E)(1)(f).
         (b)   Measurement of pollutants.
            1.   The user shall provide the information required in §
53.10(E)(1)(g)1. through 4.
            2.   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this division.
            3.   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed
with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the
flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream
formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment
standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated
in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting
data shall be submitted to the control authority;
            4.   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with
division (J);
            5.   The Wastewater Supervisor may allow the submission of a
baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data
provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial
pretreatment measures;
            6.   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of
sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the POTW.
         (c)   Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's
authorized representative as defined in §
53.01(e) and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
         (d)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will
be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which
the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided.
The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance
date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance
schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in
division (B) of this section.
         (e)   Signature and report certification.  All baseline monitoring
reports must be certified in accordance with (N)(1) of this chapter and signed
by an authorized representative as defined in §
53.01(E).
   (B)   Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall
apply to the compliance schedule required by division (A)(2)(d) of this
chapter:
      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months;
      (3)   The user shall submit a progress report to the Wastewater
Supervisor no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the
final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied
with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate,
the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and
      (4)   In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such
progress reports to the Wastewater Supervisor.
   (C)   Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline.
Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject
to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the Wastewater
Supervisor a report containing the information described in §
53.10(E)(1)(a) and (b) and (A)(2)(b) of this chapter. For users subject to
equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the
procedures in §
53.06(C), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-
term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with §
53.11(N)(1). All sampling will be done in conformance with division (K).
   (D)   Periodic compliance reports.
      (1)   Except as specified in division (D)(3), all significant industrial
users must, at a frequency determined by the Wastewater Supervisor submit no
less than twice per year (June and December) reports indicating the nature,
concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment
standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the
reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance
with a Best Management Practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the
user must submit documentation required by the Wastewater Supervisor or the
pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
      (2)   The town may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical
pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a
categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated
through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither
present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at
background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant
due to activities of the industrial user. This authorization is subject to the
following conditions:
         (a)   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to
be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility
provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable
categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
         (b)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver
before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater
discharge permit. See §
53.10(E)(1)(h).
         (c)   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes.
         (d)   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with §
53.01(E), and include the certification statement in (N)(1) (40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)
(ii)).
         (e)   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a
demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from
40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was
used in the analysis.
         (f)   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Wastewater Supervisor
must be included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons supporting
the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the
waiver must be maintained by the Wastewater Supervisor for three years after
expiration of the waiver.
         (g)   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the
user's permit by the Wastewater Supervisor, the industrial user must certify on
each report with the statement in division (N)(3) below, that there has been no
increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the
industrial user.
         (h)   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or
is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's
operations, the user must immediately comply with the monitoring requirements
of division (D)(1) or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by
the Wastewater Supervisor, and notify the Wastewater Supervisor.
         (i)   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.
      (3)   The town may reduce a user's requirement for periodic compliance
reports to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year, unless
required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the state, where
the industrial user's total categorical wastewater flow does not exceed the
requirements listed in 40 CFR 403.12(e)(3).
      (4)   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with division (N)(1) of this section.
      (5)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      (6)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the Wastewater Supervisor, using the procedures
prescribed in division (K) of this section, the results of this monitoring
shall be included in the report.
   (E)   Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the Wastewater
Supervisor of any significant changes to the user's operations or system which
might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 60 days
before the change.
      (1)   The Wastewater Supervisor may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §
53.10(E).
      (2)   The Wastewater Supervisor may issue an individual wastewater
discharge permit under §
53.10(N) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under §
53.10(K) in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
   (F)   Reports of potential problems.
      (1)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause
potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and
notify the Wastewater Supervisor of the incident. This notification shall
include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume,
if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
      (2)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the Wastewater Supervisor, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve
the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be
incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of
any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this
chapter.
      (3)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in division (A), above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
      (4)   Significant industrial users are required to notify the Wastewater
Supervisor immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential
for a slug discharge.
   (G)   Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain an
individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the
Wastewater Supervisor as the Wastewater Supervisor may require.
   (H)   Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the Wastewater
Supervisor within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall
also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat
analysis to the Wastewater Supervisor within 30 days after becoming aware of
the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the town
performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the town
performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was
conducted and the time when the user or the town receives the results of this
sampling, or if the town has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the
industrial user.
   (I)   Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
      (1)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this division need be submitted only once for
each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions
must be submitted under division (E) of this section. The notification
requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by
users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring
requirements of divisions (A), (C), and (D) of this section.
      (2)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (I)(1),
above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
      (3)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Wastewater Supervisor,
the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous
waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the
effective date of such regulations.
      (4)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
      (5)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
   (J)   Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part
136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical
techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other
applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested
by the Wastewater Supervisor or other parties approved by EPA.
   (K)   Sample collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements
must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis
performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is
representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
      (1)   Except as indicated in divisions (K)(2) and (3) below, the user
must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Wastewater Supervisor. Where time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the town, the samples must
be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures
as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the town, as
appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with
instantaneous limits.
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
      (3)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in division (A) through (C), a minimum of four grab
samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide
and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling
data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are
available, the Wastewater Supervisor may authorize a lower minimum. For the
reports required by division (D) (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the
industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to
assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements.
   (L)   Date of receipt of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have
been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed,
postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal
Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
   (M)   Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this chapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with Best Management Practices established under §
53.06(E)(3). Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user
or the town, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the Wastewater Supervisor.
   (N)   Certification statements.
      (1)   Certification of permit applications, user reports and initial
monitoring waiver. The following certification statement is required to be
signed and submitted by users submitting permit applications in accordance with
§
53.10(F); users submitting baseline monitoring reports under (A)(2)(e); users
submitting reports on compliance with the categorical pretreatment standard
deadlines under division (C); users submitting periodic compliance reports
required by division (D)(1) through (4), and users submitting an initial
request to forego sampling of a pollutant on the basis of division (D)(2)(d).
The following certification statement must be signed by an authorized
representative as defined in §
53.01(E):
      "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system
designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the
information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage
the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine
and imprisonment for knowing violations."
      (2)   Annual certification for non-significant categorical industrial
users. A facility determined to be a non-significant categorical industrial
user by the Wastewater Supervisor pursuant to the definition as laid out in §
53.01 and §
53.10(F)(3) must annually submit the following certification statement signed
in accordance with the signatory requirements in §
53.01. This certification must accompany an alternative report required by the
Wastewater Supervisor:
      "Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for
managing compliance with the categorical Pretreatment Standards under 40 CFR
         , I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that during
the period from                ,                 to                  ,
                             [months, days, year]:
      (a)   The facility described as                    [facility name] met
the definition of a non-significant categorical industrial user as described in
§
53.01 ;
      (b)   The facility complied with all applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements during this reporting period; and
      (c)   The facility never discharged more than 100 gallons of total
categorical wastewater on any given day during this reporting period.
      This compliance certification is based on the following information.
                                                                                                       
                                                                                                       "
      (3)   Certification of pollutants not present. Users that have an
approved monitoring waiver based on §
53.11(D)(2) must certify on each report with the following statement that there
has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of
the user.
      "Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for
managing compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40 CFR                
[specify applicable National Pretreatment Standard part(s)], I certify that, to
the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of
                  [list pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities
at the facility since filing of the last periodic report under §
53.11  (D)(2)."
(Ord. 2019-25, passed 11-26-2019)
§ 53.12 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge permits and
monitoring programs, and from the Wastewater Supervisor's inspection and
sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction,
unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Wastewater Supervisor, that the release of such information
would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to
protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must
be asserted in writing at the time of submission of the information or data.
When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such
information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might
disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request
to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment
program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as
defined at 40 CFR 2.302 shall not be recognized as confidential information and
shall be available to the public without restriction.
(Ord. 2019-25, passed 11-6-2019)
§ 53.13 PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   The Wastewater Supervisor shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions
served by the POTW, a list of the users which, at any time during the previous
12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall be
applicable to all significant industrial users (or any other industrial user
that violates divisions (C), (D) or (H) of this section) and shall mean:
   (A)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant
parameter taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric
pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits as defined
in §
53.01;
   (B)   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter
during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric
pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined
by §
53.06 multiplied by the applicable criteria;
   (C)   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by §
53.06 (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative
standard) that the Wastewater Supervisor determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
   (D)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Wastewater
Supervisor's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a
discharge;
   (E)   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
   (F)   Failure to provide within 45 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with
categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports,
and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
   (G)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   (H)   Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of Best
Management Practices, which the Wastewater Supervisor determines will adversely
affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
(Ord. 2019-25, passed 11-26-2019)
§ 53.14 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notification of violation. When the Wastewater Supervisor finds that a
user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Wastewater Supervisor may serve upon
that user a written notice of violation. The notice shall include increased
sampling of the parameter in violation within 30 days and the requirement that
immediate corrective action to correct the problem. Within five days of the
receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Wastewater Supervisor.
Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Wastewater Supervisor
to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement
action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders. The Wastewater Supervisor may enter into consent
orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to divisions
(D) and (E) of this section and shall be judicially enforceable.
   (C)   Show cause hearing. The Wastewater Supervisor may order a user which
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Wastewater
Supervisor and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not
be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered
or certified mail at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be
served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall
not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user.
   (D)   Compliance orders. When the Wastewater Supervisor finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an
individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Wastewater Supervisor may issue an
order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come
into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into
compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless
adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring
and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants
discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (E)   Cease and desist orders. When the Wastewater Supervisor finds that a
user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an
individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are
likely to recur, the Wastewater Supervisor may issue an order to the user
directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and
desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
   (F)   Administrative fines.
      (1)   When the Wastewater Supervisor finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Wastewater Supervisor may fine such user in an amount not
to exceed $2,500. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day
basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits,
fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
      (2)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 45 calendar days,
be assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance, and interest
shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 1% per month. A lien against the user's
property shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
      (3)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request
for the Wastewater Supervisor to reconsider the fine along with full payment of
the fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request
has merit, the Wastewater Supervisor may convene a hearing on the matter. In
the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any
interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The Wastewater
Supervisor may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions,
such as notices and orders, to the fine. Issuance of an administrative fine
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user.
   (G)   Emergency suspensions. The Wastewater Supervisor may immediately
suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which
reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment
to the health or welfare of persons. The Wastewater Supervisor may also
immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to
respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which
presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Wastewater Supervisor may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The
Wastewater Supervisor may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the
user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Wastewater Supervisor that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in
division (H) of this section are initiated against the user.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Wastewater Supervisor prior to the date
of any show cause or termination hearing under division (C) or (H) of this
section. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
   (H)   Termination of discharge. In addition to the provisions in §
53.10(M), any user who violates the following conditions is subject to
discharge termination:
      (1)   Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §
53.06.
   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and
be offered an opportunity to show cause under division (C) why the proposed
action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the Wastewater
Supervisor shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
(Ord. 2019-25, passed 11-26-2019)
§ 53.15 JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Injunctive relief. When the Wastewater Supervisor finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an
individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Wastewater Supervisor may petition
the court having jurisdiction through the Town's Attorney for the issuance of a
temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels
the specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, order,
or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The
Wastewater Supervisor may also seek such other action as is appropriate for
legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct
environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (B)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to
the town for a maximum civil penalty of $2,500 per violation, per day. In the
case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall
accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
      (2)   The Wastewater Supervisor may recover reasonable attorneys' fees,
court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities,
including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages
incurred by the town.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (C)   Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this chapter are
not exclusive. The Wastewater Supervisor may take any, all, or any combination
of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment
violations will generally be in accordance with the town's enforcement response
plan. However, the Wastewater Supervisor may take other action against any user
when the circumstances warrant. Further, the Wastewater Supervisor is empowered
to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
(Ord. 2019-25, passed 11-26-2019)
§ 53.16 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Upset.
      (1)   For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of division (A)(3), below, are met.
      (3)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence that:
         (a)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         (c)   The user has submitted the following information to the
Wastewater Supervisor within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five days:
            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
         (d)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
         (e)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on
any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
         (f)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
   (B)   Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
general prohibitions in §
53.06(A) or the specific prohibitions in §
53.06(B) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its
discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would
cause pass through or interference and that either:
      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through
or interference; or
      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
the town was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   (C)   Bypass.
      (1)   For the purposes of this section:
         (a)   Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a user's treatment facility; and
         (b)   Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      (2)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of divisions (C)(3) and (4) of this section.
      (3)   Bypass notifications.
         (a)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Wastewater Supervisor, at least ten days before the
date of the bypass, if possible.
         (b)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Wastewater Supervisor of
an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission
shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of
the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass
and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times,
and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected
to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Wastewater Supervisor may waive the written
report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24
hours.
      (4)   Bypass.
         (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Wastewater Supervisor may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            3.   The user submitted notices as required under division (C)(3)
of this section.
         (b)   The Wastewater Supervisor may approve an anticipated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, if the Wastewater Supervisor determines
that it will meet the three conditions listed in division (C)(4)(a) of this
section.
(Ord. 2019-25, passed 11-26-2019)
§ 53.17 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Pretreatment charges and fees. The town may adopt reasonable fees for
reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the town's pretreatment
program, which may include:
      (1)   Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the
cost of processing such applications;

system.
   (B)   Stormwater discharge improvements related to development of lands
located within the corporate boundaries of the town.
   (C)   Drainage control systems installed during new construction and grading
of lots and other parcels of land.
   (D)   Stormwater, including stormwater runoff, snowmelt runoff, and surface
runoff drainage, associated with construction activity.
   (E)   Stormwater discharges from construction support activities directly
related to construction sites subject to this chapter.
   (F)   Erosion and sediment control systems installed during new construction
and grading of lots and other parcels of land.
   (G)   The design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater drainage
facilities and systems.
   (H)   The design, construction and maintenance of stormwater quality
facilities and systems.
(Res. 2024-03, passed 7-22-2024; Ord. 2024-15, passed 8-13-2024)
§ 55.002 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   This chapter shall regulate all development and redevelopment
occurring within the town. No permit shall be issued and no land disturbance
started for any construction in a development, as defined in this chapter,
until the plans required for such construction have been accepted, in writing,
by the town. With the exceptions provided for in this chapter, single-family
dwellings (attached and detached) within accepted subdivisions, and land
disturbing activities less than 10,000 square feet of area shall be exempt from
the requirements of this chapter. All land disturbing activities associated
with agriculture shall also be exempt from this chapter.
   (B)   In addition to the requirements of this chapter and its companion
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, compliance with all applicable
ordinances of the Town of Bargersville as well as with applicable federal,
State of Indiana, and other local statutes and regulations shall also be
required. Unless otherwise stated, all other specifications referred to in this
chapter shall be the most recent edition available. If the project is located
within a Town of Bargersville County Regulated Drain Watershed, the applicant
is required to verify requirements of the Johnson County Surveyor's Office to
learn if additional requirements, specific to that regulated drain, would apply
to the site. In the event of a conflict between requirements contained in this
chapter and applicable requirements contained in other regulatory documents,
the most restrictive shall prevail.
   (C)   Any construction project which has had its final drainage plan
accepted by the Town of Bargersville within a two-year period prior to the
effective date of this chapter shall be exempt from all requirements of this
chapter that are in excess of the requirements of ordinances in effect at the
time of acceptance. Such an exemption is not applicable to the requirements
detailed in this chapter.
   (D)   The Town of Bargersville has the authority to modify, grant
exemptions, and/or waive any and all the requirements of this chapter and its
associated technical standards document. A pre-submittal meeting with the
Department of Development may be requested by the applicant to discuss the
applicability of various provisions of the chapter and its associated technical
standards document with regards to unique or unusual circumstances relating to
a project. However, any initial determination of such applicability shall not
be binding on future determinations of the Town of Bargersville that may be
based on the review of more detailed information and plans.

§ 55.003 FINDINGS.
   The Town of Bargersville finds that:
   (A)   Water bodies, roadways, structures, and other property within the Town
of Bargersville are at times subjected to flooding;
   (B)   Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is
also a danger to the natural resources of the region;
   (C)   Land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds,
resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, increased flooding,
increased stream channel erosion, and increased sediment transport and
deposition;
   (D)   Soil erosion resulting from land-disturbing activities causes a
significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to be transported off-site
and deposited in ditches, streams, wetlands, lakes, and reservoirs;
   (E)   Increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments and
pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects
within the Town of Bargersville will, absent reasonable regulation and control,
adversely affect the town's water bodies and water resources;
   (F)   Pollutant contributions from illicit discharges within the Town of
Bargersville will, absent reasonable regulation, monitoring, and enforcement,
adversely affect the town's water bodies and water resources;
   (G)   Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, non-point source pollution, and
illicit sources of pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation
of stormwater management;
   (H)   Adopting the standards, criteria, and procedures contained and
referenced in this chapter and implementing the same will address many of the
deleterious effects of stormwater runoff and illicit discharges; and
   (I)   Adopting this chapter is necessary for the preservation of public
health, safety, and welfare, for the conservation of natural resources, and for
compliance with state and federal regulations.
(Res. 2024-03, passed 7-22-2024; Ord. 2024-15, passed 8-13-2024)
§ 55.004 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the Town of Bargersville through the
regulation of stormwater and non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage
system and to protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land and
water resources within the town. This chapter establishes methods for managing
the quantity and quality of stormwater entering into the storm drain system.
The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To reduce the hazard to public health and safety caused by excessive
stormwater runoff;
   (B)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain system
from runoff from new development and redevelopment;
   (C)   To prohibit illicit discharges into the storm drain system; and
   (D)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, monitoring,
and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.

§ 55.005 RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMINISTRATION.
   The Department of Development shall administer, implement, and enforce the
provisions of this chapter. Any powers granted or duties imposed upon the
authorized enforcement agency may be delegated in writing by the Town of
Bargersville to qualified persons or entities acting in the beneficial interest
of or in the employ of the town.
(Res. 2024-03, passed 7-22-2024; Ord. 2024-15, passed 8-13-2024)
§ 55.006 RATES AND CHARGES.
   (A)   The monthly stormwater utility fee shall be a user fee.
      (1)   Types of properties and accounts.
         (a)   Residential accounts. These accounts incorporate all residential
and agricultural properties within the corporate limits of the town. Including,
but not limited to, single- family residential, two-family residential, mobile
homes, condominiums, and agricultural properties.
         (b)   Non-residential accounts. Non-residential accounts shall
incorporate commercial, industrial, tax exempt, apartments, and residential
common areas located within the corporate boundary.
      (2)   The monthly user fee shall be a flat rate for all residential
accounts. Non-residential accounts shall be based on an equivalent residential
unit (ERU). One ERU shall equal 4,110 square feet of impervious surface.
      (3)   Non-residential monthly user fees shall be determined by using a
multiplier, which shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the total square
feet of impervious surface area within a non-residential property by a divisor
of 4,110 square feet, then rounded to the next whole number. The rounded
multiplier will then be multiplied by the non-residential rate to obtain the
monthly stormwater management user fee. The monthly stormwater management user
fee for a non-residential property located in the district shall not be less
than the base non-residential rate.
      (4)   The monthly user fee shall be established and updated as required
by I.C. 36-9-23-26 and the following procedure.
         (a)   The Stormwater Utility Board shall hold a public hearing
regarding the monthly user fee and recommend, by resolution, a rate to the Town
Council.
         
         (b)   The Bargersville Town Council shall consider the recommended
rate increase at a public meeting and adopt all rate modifications by chapter.
   (B)   Late charge. If the monthly storm water utility fee is not paid by the
due date stated on the bill, a late charge of 10% shall be assessed, together
with costs of collection, if any, including reasonable attorney fees.
   (C)   Discount. A discount is available to any residential account customer
who pays their stormwater user fee annually. The discount shall be $6 per year
($0.50 per month) if the customer pays the entire annual bill in January of
each year. If the discounted rate is applied, the rate shall apply to the
property at of the date of payment; if a customer pays annually and sells the
property within that one year period no refund shall be applied and the new
customer will not be responsible for stormwater fees until January of the
following year.

      (3)   All measures taken to clean up the accidental discharge, and all
measures proposed to be taken to prevent any recurrence; and
      (4)   The name and telephone number of a person making the report and the
name and telephone number of a person who may be contacted for additional
information on the matter.
   (B)   A properly reported accidental discharge shall be an affirmative
defense to a civil infraction proceeding brought under this chapter against a
discharger for such discharge. It shall not, however, be a defense to a legal
action brought to obtain an injunction, to obtain recovery of costs or to
obtain other relief because of or arising out of the discharge. A discharge
shall be considered properly reported only if the discharger complies with all
the requirements of this section. This requirement does not relieve discharger
from notifying other entities as required by state or federal regulations.

§ 55.021 INSPECTIONS AND MONITORING.
   (A)   Storm drainage system. The town has the authority to periodically
inspect the portion of the storm drainage system under the town's control, in
an effort to detect and eliminate illicit connections and discharges into the
system. This inspection will include a screening of discharges from outfalls
connected to the system in order to determine if prohibited flows are being
conveyed into the storm drainage system. It could also include spot testing of
waters contained in the storm drainage system itself to detect the introduction
of pollutants into the system by means other than a defined outfall, such as
dumping or contaminated sheet runoff.
   (B)   Potential polluters. If, as a result of the storm drainage system
inspection, a discharger is suspected of an illicit discharge, the town may
inspect and/or obtain stormwater samples from stormwater runoff facilities of
the subject discharger, to determine compliance with the requirements of this
chapter. Upon request, the discharger shall allow the town's properly
identified representative to enter upon the premises of the discharger at all
hours necessary for the purposes of such inspection or sampling. The town or
its properly identified representative may place on the discharger's property
the equipment or devices used for such sampling or inspection. Identified
illicit connections or discharges shall be subject to enforcement action as
described in this chapter.
   (C)   New development and re-development. Following the final completion of
construction and the receipt of as-built drawings by the Department of
Development, the town has the authority to inspect new development and
redevelopment sites to verify that all on-site stormwater conveyances and
connections to the storm drainage system are in compliance with this section.

STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT
§ 55.035 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   The storage and controlled release of excess stormwater runoff shall be
required for all new business, institutional developments, commercial and
industrial developments, residential subdivisions, planned development, rural
estate subdivisions, and any redevelopment or other new construction located
within the town's corporate boundary. The town, after thorough investigation
and evaluation, may waive the requirement of controlled runoff for minor
subdivisions and parcelization. Additional potential exemptions regarding the
detention requirements are provided under §
55.036 
(Res. 2024-03, passed 7-22-2024; Ord. 2024-15, passed 8-13-2024)
§ 55.036 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that most streams and drainage channels serving the
Town of Bargersville do not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey
stormwater runoff resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, the
storage and controlled release of excess stormwater runoff as well as
compensation for loss of floodplain storage shall be required for all
developments and redevelopments located within the town. Release rate
requirements, downstream restriction considerations, acceptable outlet,
adjoining property impact considerations, policy on dams and levees, policy on
Fluvial Erosion Hazard corridors, and compensatory floodplain storage rates are
detailed in the Town of Bargersville Stormwater Technical Standards.
   (B)   Due to unknowns regarding the future development patterns and the
associated proposed stormwater quantity management systems within a watershed,
it is the policy of the town to discourage direct release of runoff from a new
development or redevelopment without providing detention. However, in rare
circumstances, where a comprehensive watershed-wide hydrologic study or
watershed plan of a major stream (not a "beat the peak" analysis) adopted by
the town substantiates the benefits of (or allows for) direct release for a
proposed development located adjacent to a major stream, the detention
requirements set in this chapter may be waived. Other special circumstances
when such a waiver may be considered by Town of Bargersville Stormwater Utility
Board include situations where the design of a regional pond has already taken
into account the provision of direct release in certain areas in the watershed.

§ 55.037 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of all
stormwater facilities shall meet the design criteria, standards, and
specifications outlined in the Bargersville Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual. The methods and procedures in the Stormwater Technical Standards Manual
are consistent with the policy stated above.

   Drainage easements shall be designed in accordance with this chapter.
(Res. 2024-03, passed 7-22-2024; Ord. 2024-15, passed 8-13-2024)
§ 55.039 PLACEMENT OF UTILITIES.
   No utility company may disturb existing storm drainage facilities without
the consent of the Department of Development staff, whose decision may be
appealed to the Stormwater Utility Board with authority to grant appeals. All
existing drainage facilities shall have senior rights and damage to said
facilities shall result in penalties as prescribed in this chapter.

§ 55.040 STRUCTURES NEAR COUNTY REGULATED DRAINS.
   For regulated drains not located in platted subdivisions, unless otherwise
accepted by the Johnson County Drainage Board, no permanent structure
(including fences) shall be erected within 75 feet measured at right angles
from:
   (A)   The existing top edge of each bank of a regulated open drain, as
determined by the Johnson County Drainage Board; or
   (B)   The center line of a piped regulated drain. The Indiana Drainage Code
may be consulted for further details.

§ 55.041 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING, AND REPORTING.
   (A)   After the approval of the stormwater management permit by the town and
the commencement of construction activities, the town has the authority to
conduct inspections of the work being done to insure full compliance with the
provisions of this section, the Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, Design
and Construction Standards, and the terms and conditions of the approved
permit.
   (B)   The town also has the authority to perform long-term, post-
construction inspection of all public or privately owned stormwater quantity
facilities. The inspection will cover physical conditions, available storage
capacity, and the operational condition of key facility elements. Stormwater
quantity facilities shall be maintained in good condition, in accordance with
the designed and approved performance specifications for the facilities, in
addition to any prescribed operation and maintenance procedures, and shall not
be subsequently altered, revised or replaced except as approved by the town. If
deficiencies are found during the inspection, the owner of the facility will be
notified by staff and will be required to take all necessary measures to
correct such deficiencies. If the owner fails to correct the deficiencies
within the allowed time period, as specified in the notification letter, the
town will undertake the work and collect from the owner using lien rights if
necessary.
   (C)   Assignment of responsibility for maintaining facilities serving more
than one lot or holding shall be documented by appropriate covenants to
property deeds, unless responsibility is formally accepted by a public body,
and determined before the final stormwater permit is approved.

STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION FOR CONSTRUCTION SITES
§ 55.060 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   The Town of Bargersville will require a Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWPPP), which includes erosion and sediment control measures
and materials handling procedures, to be submitted as part of a project's
construction plans and specifications. Any project located within the corporate
boundaries of the town that includes clearing, grading, excavation or other
land disturbing activities resulting in the disturbance of 10,000 square feet
or more of total land area is subject to the requirements of this section. This
includes both new development and re-development. This section also applies to
disturbances of land that are part of a larger common plan of development or
sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb 10,000 square feet or
more of total land area. Section 55.062 provides guidelines for calculating
land disturbance. Projects meeting the coverage requirements of IDEM's draft
CSGP shall also be in compliance with the requirements contained in that
permit.
   (B)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion and sediment control
measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10.
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34.
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM)
under 329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including
the expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either
within or outside the original solid waste permit.
   (C)   For an individual lot where land disturbance is expected to be one
acre or more, the individual lot owner must complete their own notice of intent
letter, apply for a stormwater permit from the town, and ensure that a
sufficient construction and stormwater pollution prevention plan is completed
and submitted in accordance with §§
55.080 through
55.089, regardless of whether the individual lot is part of a larger permitted
project site. For an individual lot where land disturbance is 10,000 square
feet or more but less than one acre, an individual lot plot plan permit
application is required prior to receiving a building permit. Details of the
permitting process are contained in §§
55.080 through
55.089.
   (D)   An individual lot with land disturbance less than 10,000 square feet,
located within a larger permitted project site, is considered part of the
larger permitted project site, and the individual lot operator must comply with
the terms and conditions of the stormwater permit approved for the larger
project site. The stormwater permit application for the larger project site
must include detailed erosion and sediment control measures for individual
lots. In addition, these individual lots are required to submit individual lot
plot plan permit applications prior to receiving a building permit. Details of
the permitting process are contained in §§ 55.080 through 55.089 and additional
requirements for individual lots may be found in the Bargersville Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual.
   (E)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan is
completed and submitted to the Department of Development in accordance with §§
55.080 through
55.089. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure
compliance with this chapter during the construction activity and
implementation of the construction plan, and to notify the town upon completion
of the project and stabilization of the site, requesting a termination
inspection to be performed. However, all persons engaging in construction and
land disturbing activities on a permitted project site meeting the
applicability requirements must comply with the requirements of this section
and this chapter.

§ 55.061 POLICY ON STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION.
   (A)   Effective stormwater pollution prevention on construction sites is
dependent on a combination of preventing movement of soil from its original
position (erosion control), intercepting displaced soil prior to entering a
waterbody (sediment control), and proper on-site materials handling.
   (B)   For land disturbance of one acre or more, the developer must submit to
the town, a SWPPP with detailed erosion and sediment control plans as well as a
narrative describing materials handling and storage, and construction
sequencing. The SWPPP and the project management log must be retained for at
least three years from the date the project permit is terminated. For land
disturbances totaling 10,000 square feet or more but less than one acre,
appropriate erosion and sediment control measures that are consistent with the
Bargersville Stormwater Technical Standards Manual must be designed and shown
on the plans.
   (C)   The required IDEM general and implementation requirements that apply
to all land-disturbing activities are contained in the Bargersville Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual.

§ 55.062 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   In calculating the total area of land disturbance, for the purposes of
determining applicability of this section to a project, the following
guidelines should be used:
      (1)   Off-site construction activities that provide services (for
example, road extensions, sewer, water, offsite stockpiles, and other
utilities) to a land disturbing project site, must be considered as a part of
the total land disturbance calculation for the project site, when the activity
is under the control of the project site owner.
      (2)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by this
section, the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the total
area of land disturbance for improvements, such as, roads, utilities, or common
areas, and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as determined
by the following:
         (a)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
one-half (0.5) acre or more, a minimum of one-half (0.5) acre of land
disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance.
         (b)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
less than one-half (0.5) acre in size, the total lot must be calculated as
being disturbed.
         (c)   To calculate lot disturbance on all other types of project
sites, such as industrial and commercial projects project sites, a minimum of
one acre of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance,
unless the lots are less than one acre in size, in which case the total lot
must be calculated as being disturbed.
   (B)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction sites shall meet
the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the Indiana
Stormwater Quality Manual, the Bargersville Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual, and the product guidance/specifications of the manufacturer. The
methods and procedures included in these two references are in keeping with the
above stated policy and meet the requirements of the draft IDEM's CSGP. A Copy
of the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual may be obtained online through IDEM.
   (C)   The design requirements that would apply to all land-disturbing
activities and shall be considered in the selection, design, and implementation
of all stormwater quality and management measures contained in the SWPPP are
contained in the Bargersville Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
(Res. 2024-03, passed 7-22-2024; Ord. 2024-15, passed 8-13-2024)
§ 55.063 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING, AND REPORTING.
   (A)   Following approval of the stormwater management permit or individual
lot plot plan permit by the town and commencement of construction activities,
the Department of Development has the authority to conduct inspections of the
site to ensure full compliance with the provisions of this section, the
approved Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan, the Indiana Stormwater Quality
Manual, and the terms and conditions of the approved permit.
   (B)   A self-monitoring program (SMP) must be implemented by the project
site owner to ensure the stormwater pollution prevention plan is working
effectively. A trained individual, acceptable to the town, shall monitor and
manage project construction and stormwater activities. Details regarding the
required monitoring activities are contained in the Bargersville Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual.
   (C)   The stormwater pollution prevention plan shall serve as a guideline
for stormwater quality but should not be interpreted to be the only basis for
implementation of stormwater quality measures for a project site. The project
site owner is responsible for implementing, in accordance with this section,
all measures necessary to adequately prevent polluted stormwater runoff.
Recommendations by the trained individual for modified stormwater quality
measures should be implemented.

STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION
§ 55.075 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   In addition to the requirements of §§ 55.060 through 55.063, the
stormwater pollution prevention plan, which is to be submitted to the town as
part of the stormwater management permit application, must also include post-
construction stormwater quality measures. These measures are incorporated as a
permanent feature into the site plan and are left in place following completion
of construction activities to continuously treat stormwater runoff from the
stabilized site. Any project located within the corporate boundaries of the
town that includes clearing, grading, excavation, and other land disturbing
activities, resulting in the disturbance of 10,000 square feet or more of total
land area is subject to the requirements of this section. This includes both
new development and re-development, and disturbances of land less than 10,000
square feet of total land area that are part of a larger common plan of
development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb 10,000
square feet or more of total land area. In addition, regardless of the amount
of disturbance, the town reserves the right to require pre-treatment BMPs for
proposed hot spot developments in accordance with provisions contained in the
Bargersville Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (B)   The requirements under this section do not apply to construction
activities associated with single-family residential dwellings disturbing less
than one acre, when the dwelling is not part of a larger common plan of
development or sale; or individual building lots within a larger permitted
project.
   (C)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10.
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34.
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under
329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the
expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or
outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
   (D)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan is
completed and submitted to the town in accordance with §§
55.080 through
55.089. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure
proper construction and installation of all stormwater BMP's (especially, the
protection of post-stormwater BMPs during construction phase) in compliance
with this chapter and with the approved stormwater management permit, and to
notify the town upon completion of the project and stabilization of the site,
requesting a termination inspection to be performed by the town. However, all
eventual property owners of stormwater quality facilities meeting the
applicability requirements must comply with the requirements of this section
and this chapter.
(Res. 2024-03, passed 7-22-2024; Ord. 2024-15, passed 8-13-2024)
§ 55.076 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to undeveloped
areas, generally have increased imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates,
increased runoff rates, and increased concentrations of pollutants such as
fertilizers, herbicides, greases, oil, salts and other pollutants. As new
development and re-development continues within the corporate boundaries
Bargersville, measures must be taken to intercept and filter pollutants from
stormwater runoff prior to reaching regional creeks, streams, and rivers.
Through the use of appropriate Best Management Practices (BMP's), stormwater
runoff will be filtered and harmful amounts of sediment, nutrients, and
contaminants will be removed.
   (B)   It is also recognized that another major source of pollution in many
Indiana streams, including those within the corporate boundaries of
Bargersville, is the streambank erosion associated with urbanizing watersheds.
Stream channels develop their shape in response to the volume and rate of
runoff that they receive from their contributing watersheds. Research has shown
that in hydrologically stable watersheds, the stream flow responsible for most
of the shaping of the channel (called the bankfull flow) occurs between every
one to two years. When land is developed, the volume and rate of runoff from
that land increases for these comparatively small flooding events that are not
normally addressed by the detention practices and the stream channel will adapt
by changing its shape. As the stream channel works to reach a new stable shape,
excess erosion occurs. As new development and re-development continues within
the corporate boundaries of Bargersville, measures must be taken to minimize
the impact of such development or re-development on streambank erosion. Through
the use of appropriate Best Management Practices (BMP's), the volume and rate
of runoff for channel forming flows will be reduced in an attempt to minimize
increased streambank erosion in the receiving streams and channels.
   (C)   The project site owner must submit to the town a Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWPPP) that shows placement of appropriate BMP(s) from a pre-
approved list of BMP's specified in the Bargersville Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual. The SWPPP submittal shall include an Operation and
Maintenance Manual for all post-construction BMP(s) included in the project and
a notarized maintenance agreement, consistent with the sample agreement
provided in the Bargersville Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, providing
for the long-term maintenance of those BMPs, both of which shall be recorded
with the deed for the property on which the project is located. The noted BMP
(s) must be designed, constructed, and maintained according to guidelines
provided or referenced in the Bargersville Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual. Practices other than those specified in the pre-approved list may be
utilized. However, the burden of proof, as to whether the performance and ease
of maintenance of such practices will be according to guidelines provided in
the Bargersville Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, would be placed with
the applicant. Details regarding the procedures and criteria for consideration
of acceptance of such BMP's are provided in the Bargersville Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual.
   (D)   Gasoline outlets and refueling areas must install appropriate
practices to reduce lead, copper, zinc, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in
stormwater runoff. These requirements will apply to all new facilities and
existing facilities that replace their tanks, regardless of the size of the
facility.
   (E)   Discharges from new development and redevelopment sites will not be
allowed directly into karst features without pretreatment.

§ 55.081 PERMIT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   This section applies to all development, or re-development of land,
that results in land disturbance of one acre or more. Individual lots with land
disturbance less than one acre shall refer to §§
55.060 through
55.063 and §§
55.075 through
55.079 for plan review requirements and procedures. The Town of Bargersville
issues inclusive permits whereas stormwater is reviewed and approved as a part
of the building or improvement location permit. These projects do not require a
separate stormwater management permit. Projects that are not associated with
another permit will be required to obtain a drainage modification permit from
the Department of Development.
      (1)   (a)   General procedures. The project site owner shall submit an
application for a stormwater management permit to the town. The application
will include a completed application checklist, construction plan sheets, a
stormwater drainage technical report, a stormwater pollution prevention plan,
and any other necessary support information. Specific information to be
included in the application can be found in § 55.082 below. Digital copies of
all required information must be submitted to the Department of Development in
.pdf format via the Citizen's Self Service Portal or provided on a thumb drive.
The town may, at its discretion, require submission to the Johnson County
Surveyor, or other entity deemed appropriate by the town.
         (b)   After the town's receipt of the application, the applicant will
be notified as to whether their application was complete or insufficient. The
applicant will be asked for additional information if the application is
insufficient. If the application is complete, it will be reviewed in detail by
the town and/or its plan review consultant(s). Once all comments have been
received and review completed, the town will either approve the project,
request modifications or deny the project. If the applicant does not agree with
or accept the review findings and wishes to seek an appeal, staff will place
the project on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the
Bargersville Stormwater Utility Board, provided the agenda for the meeting has
not yet been advertised or published. If time for notification does not allow,
the project shall be placed on the following regularly scheduled meeting of the
Stormwater Utility Board. The town will furnish the applicant a complete list
of comments and objections to the plans and accompanying data prior to the
scheduled meeting. After the scheduled meeting, the Stormwater Utility Board
will either issue a permit, request modifications to the construction plans, or
deny the project.
         (c)   The project site owner must notify the town and IDEM before
beginning construction. Notification to the town shall be in the form of an
email while the notification to IDEM shall be in the form of an online IDEM NOI
submittal. Once a permit has been issued and the pending construction
notifications submitted to the town and IDEM before the beginning of
construction, construction may commence. Once construction starts, the project
owner shall monitor construction activities and inspect all stormwater
pollution prevention measures in compliance with this chapter and the terms and
conditions of the approved permit. Upon completion of construction activities,
a Certification of Completion and Compliance and as-built plans must be
submitted to the Department of Development (this should be done at the same
time a final inspection is requested). Once the construction site has been
stabilized and all temporary erosion and sediment control measures have been
removed, a notification shall be sent to the town requesting a termination
inspection. The town, or its representative, shall inspect the construction
site to verify that the completed project is fully stabilized and meets the
requirements of Bargersville's stormwater ordinance and its technical standards
and that the terms and conditions of the permit. Once the applicant receives a
signed copy of the Termination Inspection Checklist confirming compliance, they
must forward a copy to IDEM along with the required IDEM NOT form. Permits
issued by the town under this scenario will expire five years from the date of
issuance. If construction is not completed within five years, an updated permit
application must be submitted to the town and an updated NOI must be
resubmitted to IDEM at least 90 days prior to expiration.
   (B)   SWPPP review time limits. Pursuant to I.C. 13-18-27, an MS4-designated
entity or other review authority such as SWCD must make a preliminary
determination as to whether the construction plan associated with SWPPP is
substantially complete before the end of the tenth working day after the day on
which the construction plan associated with SWPPP is submitted to the review
authority, in the case of a less than five acres construction activity site or
the fourteenth working day after the day on which the construction plan
associated with SWPPP is submitted to the review authority, in the case of a
five acres or larger construction activity site. Depending on the outcome of
the SWPPP review, the following scenarios may play out:
      (1)   No SWPPP review notification received. If the review authority does
not notify of its preliminary determination as to whether the construction plan
is substantially complete within either ten or 14 days as noted above, the
project site owner may submit a notice of intent letter to IDEM including the
information required by IDEM, or this chapter and the Bargersville Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual, and after submission of the notice of intent letter
to IDEM, may begin the construction project including the land disturbing
activities of the construction project.
      (2)   SWPPP not substantially complete. If the review authority notifies
the construction plan is not substantially complete, the project site owner may
not submit a notice of intent letter to IDEM until the review authority makes a
conclusive favorable determination concerning the construction plan under the
IDEM rule/permit, or this chapter and the Bargersville Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual.
      (3)   Unfavorable SWPPP. If the review authority notifies the
construction plan is substantially complete; and makes a conclusive unfavorable
determination concerning the construction plan under IDEM rule/permit, or this
chapter and the Bargersville Stormwater Technical Standards Manual; the land
disturbing activities of the construction project must stop when the review
authority notifies the project site owner of the review authority's conclusive
unfavorable determination concerning the construction plan.
   (C)   Note that the above time limits only apply to the SWPPP portion of the
overall stormwater permit submittal and does not affect any official or non-
official permit review timelines set by the entity for other aspects of the
stormwater permit application.

§ 55.086 REQUIRED ASSURANCES.
   This section shall apply to all projects whether the stormwater management
system or portions thereof will be dedicated to the town or retained privately.
As a condition of approval and issuance of the permit, the town shall require
the applicant to provide assurance in form of an irrevocable letter of credit
or a bond when the stormwater management plan has been accepted and before
construction begins. Said assurance will guarantee a good faith execution of
the stormwater drainage plan, the stormwater pollution prevention plan, the
stormwater quality management plan, and any permit conditions. The assurance
shall be for an amount equal to 120% of the total costs of all stormwater
management measures for the entire project. The above-mentioned costs shall be
based on an estimate as prepared by a registered engineer or land surveyor.
Said costs shall be for the installation and ongoing monitoring and maintenance
of erosion control measures and the construction and ongoing monitoring and
maintenance of storm drainage infrastructure, detention/retention facilities,
and stormwater quality BMP's, as regulated under this chapter, until the

§ 55.087 TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PERMITS.
   (A)   In granting a stormwater management permit, the town may impose such
terms and conditions as are reasonably necessary to meet the purposes of this
chapter. The project site owner shall insure compliance with such terms and
conditions. Non-compliance with the terms and conditions of permits will be
subject to enforcement as described in §§
55.100 through
55.103.
   (B)   The project site owner shall inform all general contractor,
construction management firms, grading or excavating contractors, utility
contractors, and the contractors that have primary oversight on individual
building lots of the terms and conditions of the stormwater management permit
and the schedule for proposed implementation.
   (C)   In the event that a project site is determined to impact or discharge
to a sensitive area or is located in an impact drainage area, the town may
require more stringent stormwater quantity and quality measures than detailed
in this chapter or in the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual.
      (1)   Determination of sensitive areas. Sensitive areas include highly
erodible soils, wetlands, karst areas, threatened or endangered species
habitat, outstanding waters, impaired waters, recreational waters, and surface
drinking water sources. Any discharge from a stormwater practice that is a
Class V injection well shall meet the Indiana groundwater quality standards and
registered with US EPA as required by the IDEM. If wetlands are suspected on a
site, a wetland delineation should be completed in accordance with the
methodology established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE). The need for
the applicant to check for the presence of threatened or endangered species
habitat will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Special terms and
conditions for development determined to impact or discharge to any sensitive
area shall be included in the stormwater management permit.
      (2)   Determination of impact drainage areas. 
         (a)   The following areas shall be designated as impact drainage
areas, unless good reason for not including them is presented to the town.
            1.   A floodway or floodplain as designated by the most updated
FEMA Code dealing with floodplain regulation and / or by the Best Available
Data through IDNR.
            2.   Land within 25 feet of each bank of any ditch within the Town
of Bargersville's system.
            3.   Land within 15 feet of the centerline of any stormwater
infrastructure or enclosed conduit within the town's system.
            4.   Land within 75 feet of each bank of a county open regulated
drain.
            5.   Land within 50 feet of a natural drainageway.
            6.   Land within 75 feet of the centerline of any tiled regulated
drain.
            7.   Land within the Fluvial Erosion Hazard (FEH) corridor.
            8.   Land within the expected breach inundation zone of an existing
or proposed new dam, and areas protected from flooding by a levee.
         (b)   The town or Town's Engineer is authorized, but is not required,
to classify certain geographical areas as impact drainage areas. In determining
impact drainage areas, the town may consider such factors as topography, soil
type, capacity of existing drains, and distance from adequate drainage
facility.
         (c)   Land that does not have an adequate outlet, taking into
consideration the capacity and depth of the outlet, may be designated as an
impact drainage area by the town. Special terms and conditions for development
within any impact drainage area shall be included in the stormwater management
permit.
      (3)   Determination of designated drainage areas served by regional
facilities. The town is authorized, but is not required, to classify certain
geographical areas as designated drainage areas that are or will be served by
regional facilities, such as a regional pond. In such cases, an Infrastructure
Development Fee (IDF) rate may be established for the designated drainage area.
The basis for determining such a fee for a proposed development or
redevelopment within a designated drainage area will be as detailed in the
Bargersville Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.

compliance, following the release of performance assurances, the property
owner, developer, or contractor shall be required to file a three-year
maintenance bond or other acceptable guarantee with the town in accordance with
§ 6.23(D) of the Unified Development Code in order to assure that such
stormwater system installation was done according to standards of good
workmanship, that the materials used in the construction and installation were
of good quality and construction, and that such project was done in accordance
with the accepted plans, and this chapter and that any off-site drainage
problems that may arise, whether upstream or downstream of such project, will
be corrected if such drainage problems are determined by the town to have been
caused by the development of such project. The bond or other acceptable
guarantee shall be in effect for a period of three years after the date of the
release of required performance assurances referenced in § 55.086 above. The
beneficiary of all maintenance bonds shall be the Town Council of the Town of
Bargersville, Indiana.
   (B)   To verify that all stormwater infrastructure is functioning properly,
visual recordings (via closed circuit television) of such infrastructure,
including all subsurface drains, shall be required twice, once following the
completion of installation of the stormwater management system and submittal of
as-builts, and the second time before release of maintenance bonds. These
visual recordings will be scheduled through the Department of Development and
paid for by the developer. Notices shall be provided to the Department of
Development within 72 hours following the completion of installation and again
at least 60 days prior to the expiration date of the maintenance bond so that
the noted recordings may be scheduled. Reports summarizing the results of the
noted visual recordings shall be reviewed and accepted by the town before the
plat is recommended for recording and again before the maintenance bond shall
be recommended to be released.
   (C)   Additional requirements for transfer of any applicable stormwater BMP
Maintenance Agreement, O&M Maintenance Manual, and Maintenance Escrow accounts
to subsequent owners prior to release of the maintenance bond is discussed in
§§ 55.075 through 55.079.

required. Unless otherwise stated, all other specifications referred to in this
chapter shall be the most recent edition available. Violations of the
requirements of this chapter are subject to the penalties listed below.
   (A)   Violations. Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of
this chapter, the requirements of an approved stormwater management design plan
or permit, and/or the requirements of a recorded stormwater maintenance
agreement may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section.
Any such action or inaction is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated
by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of any of the penalties
described below shall not prevent such equitable relief.
   (B)   Warning notice. When the town finds that any person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued
hereunder, the town may serve upon that person a written warning notice,
specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting
the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution
whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of
the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the alleged
violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of
the warning notice. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
town to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement
action, without first issuing a warning notice.
(Res. 2024-03, passed 7-22-2024; Ord. 2024-15, passed 8-13-2024)

shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not
less than $1,000, and such person shall also pay such costs as may be imposed
in the discretion of the court. A permit reinstatement fee will be assessed by
the town.
      (3)   For construction projects that are operating under a SWPPP approved
by the town, if a stop work order is issued on the grounds that the erosion and
sediment control measures included in the construction plan are not adequate,
the project site owner must be notified in writing of the inadequacies in the
erosion and sediment control measures and the project site owner has 72 hours
after receiving written notice to resolve the identified inadequacies before
the stop work order can take effect.
      (4)   The 72 hour period to resolve identified inadequacies on a
construction project does not apply if the stop work order is issued to a
construction project where the project site owner is creating a public health
hazard or safety hazard.
   (E)   Withhold certificate of occupancy. The town may refuse to issue a
certificate of occupancy for the building or other improvements constructed or
being constructed on the site until the applicant or other responsible person

otherwise satisfied the requirements of this chapter as determined by the town.
   (F)   Suspension, revocation, or modification of permits. The town may
suspend, revoke, or modify any existing permit that the violator may also have
been previously granted. A suspended, revoked, or modified permit may be
reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the
remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured
the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated upon
such conditions as the town may deem necessary to enable the applicant or other
responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such
violations.
   (G)   Suspension of access to the stormwater drainage system.
      (1)   Emergency cease and desist orders.
         (a)   When the town finds that any person has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or
that the person's past violations are likely to recur, and that the person's
violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened
discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to
present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or to the environment, the town may issue an order to the violator
directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing
the violator to immediately comply with all ordinance requirements and take
such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a
continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations
and/or terminating the discharge.
         (b)   Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under
this section shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering
discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the emergency order, the town may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the stormwater drainage system or
waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to persons or to the
environment, including immediate termination of a facility's water supply,
sewer connection, or other municipal utility services.
      (2)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The
town may, without prior notice, suspend stormwater drainage system discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
stormwater drainage system or waters of the state if the violator fails to
comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the town may take such
steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the stormwater
drainage system or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to persons.
      (3)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the stormwater drainage system in violation of this chapter may
have their stormwater drainage system access terminated if such termination
would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The town will notify a violator of
the proposed termination of its stormwater drainage system access. The violator
may petition the Stormwater Utility Board for a reconsideration and hearing. A
person commits an offense if the person reinstates stormwater drainage system
access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior
approval of the Stormwater Utility Board.
      (4)   Criminal penalties for violations. For intentional and flagrant
violations of this chapter, the town may issue a notice to the applicant or
other responsible person and the owner of the property, requiring such person
to appear in the Circuit or Superior Court of Johnson County to answer charges
for such violation. Upon conviction, such person shall be punished by a fine as
set by the Bargersville Town Council, plus costs, damages, and expenses or
imprisonment for 60 days or both. Each act of violation and each day upon which
any violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense.

   (A)   In addition to any other remedies, should any owner fail to comply
with the provisions of this chapter, the town may, after giving notice and
opportunity for compliance, have the necessary work done, and the owner shall
be required to promptly reimburse the town for all costs of such work.
   (B)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the town from taking such other
lawful action as may be necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. All costs
connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. Costs
include, but are not limited to, repairs to the stormwater drainage system made
necessary by the violation, as well as those penalties levied by the EPA or
IDEM for violation of the town's NPDES permit, administrative costs, attorney
fees, court costs, and other costs and expenses associated with the enforcement
of this chapter, including sampling and monitoring expenses.
   (C)   If the amount due for abatement of the violation is not paid within a
timely manner as determined by the decision of the town or by the expiration of
the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special
assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for
the amount of the assessment.
(Res. 2024-03, passed 7-22-2024; Ord. 2024-15, passed 8-13-2024)

and the comments of other persons having knowledge of the matter. In
considering any such appeal, the Stormwater Utility Board may grant a variance
from the terms of this chapter to provide relief, in whole or in part, from the
action being appealed, but only upon finding that the following requirements
are satisfied:
      (1)   The application of the chapter provisions being appealed will
present or cause practical difficulties for a development or development site;
provided, however, that practical difficulties shall not include the need for
the developer to incur additional reasonable expenses in order to comply with
the chapter; and
      (2)   The granting of the relief requested will not substantially prevent
the goals and purposes of this chapter, nor result in less effective management
of stormwater runoff.
   (B)   Enforcement measures after appeal. If the violation has not been
corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation,
or, in the event of an appeal, within five days of the decision of the
Stormwater Utility Board upholding the decision of the town, then
representatives of the town shall enter upon the subject private property and
are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation
and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent
or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the town or its

      (1)   Nonpoint activities include source silvicultural activities such as
nursery operations, site preparation, reforestation and subsequent cultural
treatment, thinning, prescribed burning, pest and fire control, harvesting
operations, surface drainage, or road construction and maintenance from which
there is natural runoff. Some of these activities (such as stream crossing for
roads) may involve the placement of dredged or fill material which may require
a CWA section 404 permit and a 401 Water Quality Certification.

   SLOPE. Degree of deviation of a surface from the horizontal, measured as a
numerical ratio or percent. Expressed as a ratio, the first number is commonly
the horizontal distance (run) and the second is the vertical distance (rise) -
- e.g., 2:1. However, the preferred method for designation of slopes is to
clearly identify the horizontal (H) and vertical (V) components (length (L) and
width (W) components for horizontal angles). Also note that according to
international standards (Metric), the slopes are presented as the vertical or
width component shown on the numerator -- e.g., 1V:2H. Slope expressions in
this chapter follow the common presentation of slopes -- e.g., 2:1 with the
metric presentation shown in parentheses-e.g., (1V:2H). Slopes can also be
expressed in “percent”. Slopes given in percent are always expressed as (100*V/
H) -- e.g., a 2:1 (1V:2H) slope is a 50% slope.

   SWALE. An elongated depression in the land surface that is at least
seasonally wet, is usually heavily vegetated, and is normally without flowing
water. Swales conduct stormwater into primary drainage channels and may provide
some groundwater recharge.

§ 92.05 FEE IN LIEU OF SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The Town of Bargersville supports the installation of sidewalks by
the development community at the time of development and construction; however,
circumstances may arise when current site conditions or other considerations
justify the acceptance of a fee in lieu of sidewalk constriction.
      (2)   It is the purpose of this section, and rules and regulations set
forth, to establish a fee in lieu of sidewalk construction program for the Town
of Bargersville to provide an alternative method for funding sidewalk
construction requirements and to establish a sidewalk fund to facilitate the
construction, improvement, and maintenance of pedestrian facilities within the
town.
   (B)   Fee in Lieu of Sidewalk Construction Program.
      (1)   A Fee in Lieu of Sidewalk Construction Program is hereby
established for any project that is required to install sidewalks under the
standards of the Town of Bargersville Unified Development Code.
      (2)   Fee calculation. The fee calculation for approved payments in lieu
of sidewalk construction shall be based on the square feet of sidewalk required
as part of the development.
      (3)   Fee. Approved applicants shall pay $17 per square foot of required
sidewalk into the sidewalk fund.
         (a)   The per square foot fee shall increase automatically on December
1 of each calendar year by 2% or the 12-month consumer price index as reported
by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics; whichever is greater.
      (4)   Fee shall be due prior to:
         (a)   Transfer of ownership and acceptance of maintenance bonds for
applicable residential developments.
         (b)   Issuance of a building permit for applicable residential and
commercial projects.
   (C)   Evaluation criteria.
      (1)   While any project may submit a request to pay a fee in lieu of
sidewalk construction, it is the intention of the town to limit the approval of
such requests to those that merit serious consideration. The following list of
criteria shall be used for the purpose of evaluating a payment in lieu of
construction request. A project is not required to meet all the following
criteria to be considered eligible.
         (a)   There are no sidewalks within 1,320 feet of the exterior
boundaries of the project, and it is unlikely that there will be development
within 1,320 feet that would require the installation of sidewalks in the
future.
         (b)   A stormwater drainage ditch or similar public utility facility
prevents the installation of the sidewalk, and neither the sidewalk nor the
facility can be reasonably relocated to accommodate both the sidewalk and the
facility.
         (c)   The topography would require the construction of a retaining
wall more than six-feet in height to accommodate the sidewalk.
         (d)   There is a planned roadway or infrastructure improvement
scheduled to be implemented within the next five-years which would require the
removal or relocation of the required sidewalk.
         (e)   Other unusual circumstances make the sidewalk installation
requirement unreasonable or inappropriate.
   (D)   Establishment of a Sidewalk Fund.
      (1)   Fund establishment. There is hereby established a special fund for
the deposit of all sums paid in lieu of sidewalk construction per this policy
(hereafter referred to as the "Sidewalk Fund"). These funds shall only be used
to install new sidewalks or new pedestrian facilities as detailed in division
(D)(2). Costs associated with sidewalk repairs shall be otherwise budgeted by
the town and shall not utilize the Sidewalk Fund.
      (2)   Eligible facilities. The Sidewalk Fund shall be used to install new
pedestrian facilities including, but not limited to, the following:
         (a)   New sidewalks or trails that fill a gap between two existing
sidewalk or trail segments.
         (b)   New ADA compliant curb ramps.
         (c)   New pedestrian crosswalks pavement marking.
         (d)   New pedestrian warning signs and / or signals.
      (3)   Prioritization. The town shall periodically complete a priority
listing for the installation of sidewalk improvements, giving full
consideration to the following:
         (a)   Pedestrian ways along one side of the streets that constitute
major walking routes to a public school.
         (b)   Pedestrian ways along one side of the streets that constitute
major walking route to a public facility or along streets designated as major
or minor thoroughfare in the town's comprehensive plan.
         (c)   Pedestrian ways along a second side of the streets that
constitute a major walking route to public schools, other public facilities, or
along major or minor thoroughfares, where pedestrian facilities already exist
on one side.
         (d)   Pedestrian ways that fill a gap between two existing segments.
         (e)   Facilities that address pedestrian safety when crossing a major
or minor thoroughfare.
         (f)   Other improvements, other than those described, as determined by
the town.
   (E)   Process. All requests for payment in lieu of sidewalk construction
shall be heard by the Bargersville Town Council and evaluated on the criteria
provided in this section.
(Ord. 2024-12, passed 5-28-2024)
 
§ 92.99 PENALTY.
   Any person, firm, partnership or corporation who violates any provision of
this chapter shall be guilty of an ordinance violation and, upon conviction, be
fined up to $2,500 and, for violations continued or renewed after one
conviction, each day's violation shall constitute a separate offense.

if the special conditions required for approval of the event are not met. In

event, or place additional restrictions on the event, if it is deemed that the
public health, safety, or welfare would be better served with additional

   (A)   Procedure: declaring an animal to be vicious.
      (1)   If the Animal Control Warden has reason to believe that an animal
is vicious, the Animal Control Warden may conduct such investigation as he
deems necessary regarding the matter. After the investigation, the Animal
Control Warden may convene a hearing for the purpose of determining whether the
animal shall be declared vicious. The Animal Control Warden shall provide
reasonable notice of the hearing to the owner.
      (2)   Prior to the hearing, if the Animal Control Warden has probable
cause to believe that an animal is vicious and may pose a threat to public
safety, the Animal Control Warden may obtain a search warrant pursuant to the
laws of this jurisdiction and impound the animal pending disposition of the
case. The owner of the animal shall be liable for the cost and expenses of
keeping the animal at the Animal Shelter. The owner shall pay on the first day
of detention of the animal the full amount of costs for 15 days of impoundment
as the animal is held pending hearings and appeals.
      (3)   The hearing shall be held no less than five and not more than 20
days, excluding holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays, after service of notice upon
the animal's owner. The hearing shall be informal and open to the public. The
owner shall have the opportunity to present evidence as to why the animal
should not be declared vicious and why it would not pose a threat to public
safety if returned to its owner. The Animal Control Warden may present all
issues for or against the owner of the animal regardless of whether the owner
appears at the hearing.
      (4)   Within ten days after the hearing, the Animal Control Warden shall
make a determination of whether or not the animal is vicious and shall notify
the owner in writing of the determination.
      (5)   The owner may, within five days after a determination that an
animal is vicious, seek an appeal of the determination before the Animal
Control Review Panel. An appeal is initiated by delivering to the Animal
Control Warden a written request for an appeal. During the pendency of the
appeal, the owner must comply with the requirements for owning vicious animals,
set out in §
94.04.
      (6)   A decision by the Animal Control Review Panel overturning the
Animal Control Warden shall result in the return of the animal to the owner.
      (7)   If, after an animal is determined vicious, additional incidents
which identify the animal as vicious occur, the Animal Control Warden may
request a court order to humanely euthanize the animal.
   (B)   Animal Control Review Panel.
      (1)   The Animal Control Review Panel (or "Panel") shall decide appeals
of determinations of the Animal Control Warden.
      (2)   The Panel shall consist of three members, appointed on a case by
case basis; two shall be appointed by the Town Council President or his
designee and one shall be appointed by the Chief of Police or his designee. An
officer involved in the apprehension of the potentially vicious animal may not
serve on the Panel when it considers an appeal regarding that animal.
   (C)   Public complaints of regarding vicious or public nuisance animals. Any
person may file a complaint with the Animal Control Warden or the Bargersville
Police Department that a particular animal harbored within the town is a
vicious animal or a public nuisance animal. An officer thereafter shall
investigate complaint, which may include, but not be limited to, discussions
with the owner and others regarding such complaint.

151.99 below.
   (D)   (1)   The Clerk-Treasurer, through town employees or contractors hired
by the town, may enter the lot to abate the violation of this subchapter.
      (2)   After the Clerk-Treasurer has effected the removal of the trash,
the Clerk-Treasurer shall prepare a sworn statement showing the cost of the
work performed and any publication or mailing costs and shall bill the owner of
record, the occupant and/or lessee. The bill shall be due and payable at the
time of receiving statement in the minimum amount of $50.
      (3)   If the full amount due to the town is not paid by the owner within
90 days after the work has been performed, as provided in division (B)(2)
above, then and in that case, the Clerk-Treasurer shall cause to be recorded in
the County Recorder’s office a sworn statement showing the cost and expenses
incurred for the work and notification of the owner therefor, the date the work
was done and the location of the parcel of real estate on which the work was
done. The recordation of the sworn statement shall constitute a lien on the
parcel of real estate, and it shall remain in force and effect for the
principal amount due, plus interest computed in the manner and amount allowed
by law for unpaid real estate taxes, plus costs of for collection if any, until
final payment has been made. The costs and expenses shall be collected in the
manner fixed by law for the collection of real estate taxes and further shall
be subject to a delinquent penalty the same as real estate taxes in the event
same are not paid in full on or before the date the tax bill on which the
charges appear becomes delinquent. A sworn statement recorded in accordance
with the provisions hereof shall be prima facie evidence that all legal
formalities have been complied with and that the work has been done properly
and satisfactorily, and it shall be full notice to every person concerned that
the parcel of real estate designated or described in the statement is subject
to a lien and the same is due and collectible as provided by law.

   (A)   Title. This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Addressing
Ordinance of Bargersville, Indiana”.
   (B)   Compliance. No structure shall be assigned an address or street named
in any matter whatsoever within the incorporated area of the town except in
full compliance with all provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of this chapter shall be to set standards for residence
and other structure numbering and road naming in the town and establish the
authority and methods to be used when assigning addresses to properties in the
town.
      (2)   These standards shall be used to establish residence and other
structure locations which will be used in the implementation of an Enhanced 911
emergency response system in the town. Although the standards may not be exact,
it is intended to provide continuity, avoid duplication and prevent general
confusion regarding the location of developed parcels of real estate in the
town.
   (D)   Application. It is not intended by this chapter to interfere with,
abrogate or amend any covenants or other agreements between parties, nor is it
intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate or annul or in any way interfere
with existing provisions of laws or ordinances not specifically repealed by
this chapter, or any rules or regulations previously adopted or issued pursuant
to law relating to the listing of contractors.
(Ord. 1998-13, passed 12-8-1998)
§ 152.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ADDRESS PLANNING AUTHORITY. The Bargersville Town Council shall serve as the
body with the responsibility for assigning street addresses within its
jurisdiction. The Town Council may coordinate its addressing efforts with other
agencies such as the Plan Commission, Utilities Superintendent, Town Building
Commissioner, Town Marshal, County Plan Commission, County Sheriff, local
postmasters and large mailers in the town such as utilities, government and the
like.
   BASE LINES. Existing recognizable lines which divide the town into quadrants
or sectors. The intersection of Harriman Avenue and Main Street is the center
point of the town for addressing purposes. Harriman Avenue and Main Street
generally form the BASE LINES for the town.
   BLOCK INTERVAL. The hundred number interval is the distance between grid
lines, or the point where the next highest block number designation is used.
   CUSTOMER (ADDRESSEE).  A family, individual, residence, business or industry
which receives mail at a delivery point.
   FRONTAGE INTERVAL. The distance in foot frontage along a street, highway or
road which is used to assign consecutive property numbers, beginning from the
nearest grid or base line. The address system used by the town assumes a
FRONTAGE INTERVAL of ten feet.
   GRID LINES. Imaginary lines or actual town streets or roads which are
located a specific distance from and perpendicular or parallel to base lines.
These lines indicate the point where block numbers change from one hundred to
the next higher hundred. GRID LINES are used to standardize the numbering of
parallel blocks at the same distance from the base lines.
   LOT. A lot is a designated parcel, tract, development or area of real estate
which is either now being or will be used eventually for construction of a
structure.
   OUT OF BOUNDS ADDRESS. An out of bounds address is a term used by the U.S.
Postal Service to designate addresses that are out of sequence with other
surrounding addresses. Often this occurs when mailboxes are located on the back
street of a property that faces another street or on corner lots.
   PRIMARY ADDRESS NUMBER (CITY-TYPE ADDRESS). The numeric or alphanumeric
component of a city-type address which precedes the street name (Example: 100
W. Harriman Avenue).
   STRUCTURE. A residential home, apartment building or business, commercial,
industrial, manufacturing or publicly owned building which fronts onto a public
street or road.
   TOWN. The Town of Bargersville, Indiana.
   TOWN COUNCIL. The Town Council of the Town of Bargersville, Indiana.
(Ord. 1998-13, passed 12-8-1998)
§ 152.03 NUMBERING SYSTEM.
   (A)   Advantages of a property address numbering system. A street numbering
system and corresponding property addresses provide individual structures with
an exact geographic location in the town. City-type street/road addresses are
necessary in order to provide a structure with a specific and more accurate
identification for efficient mail delivery; to provide an easily identifiable
geographic reference point for quick dispatch of police, fire and emergency
rescue equipment; to provide utility companies with a permanent address record
for billing and service calls tied to a specific structure; and to provide ease
of location identification for friends, service vehicles or other individuals
trying to locate a specific structure or a county road. A numbering system
should make it easy for anyone to find the location of a town street or
residential property in a short period of time and allow for a systematic
expansion of address numbers as community growth occurs.
   (B)   The grid coordinate system. The town will structure the naming of its
street system and the issuance of property addresses based on the Lyman/Purdue
Street Numbering System. The system is better known as the grid coordinate
system. The system utilizes two base lines which run at approximate right
angles to each other to divide the town into quadrants. Most of the town
streets are numbered based on their distance from the north-south and east-west
base lines.
   (C)   Street names and numbers. Existing town street names will be retained
where feasible. Some names will have to be changed to correct duplications,
multiple naming of the same street and other factors causing confusion.
   (D)   Property numbering intervals. Street addresses are assigned in
increasing order from each base and grid line. In the town, 1,000 potential
property addresses exist for each 5,000 feet of distance from the base lines.
There are approximately 50 address numbers that will be available for each side
of the street/road within each 500 feet. All of the available numbers will
probably not be needed, depending on the density of development along the
street/road. Therefore, addresses occur at each ten-foot interval. A specific
street/road address is determined by measuring the number of ten-foot intervals
between the grid line to the front entrance of a structure. Crooked streets and
roads and streets and roads running at angles (not true north-south or east-
west) will be addressed with the predominant north-south east-west direction.
Distances between address numbers will vary in these cases.
(Ord. 1998-13, passed 12-8-1998)
§ 152.04 PROPERTY ADDRESSING.
   (A)   Assignment of official permanent property addresses. All residential,
commercial, industrial and public structures located in the town shall be
assigned a permanent city-type street address. Structures located on the south
side of an east west street/road and those located on the east side of a north-
south street/road shall have an odd numbered property address. Structures
located on the north side of an east-west street/road and those located on the
west side of a north-south street/road shall have an even numbered property
address.
      (1)   In all situations the Town Council shall make the final
determination of which street/road will be used for an address. The criteria
for this determination will be based on the layout of the property, layout of
the structure and other factors that may affect emergency services and mail
delivery.
      (2)   Street addresses are to be assigned based on a measurement of the
distance from the grid line to a line perpendicular to the address street/road
that intersects one of the following: the structure, or the entrance to the
property that contains the structure, or the center of the lot.
   (B)   Determining a property address. An official street address shall
contain no more than five digits with the first digit, or the first two digits
if the structure is located ten or more miles from the baseline, indicating the
milepost or distance from the baselines. The third digit from the right shall
indicate the block number which will change each 500 linear feet. The last two
digits indicate the number of ten-foot intervals from the structure to the
nearest block or grid line.
   (C)   Placement and size of address numbers. Once a property address has
been assigned by the Town Council to a specific structure, it shall be the
responsibility of the property owner to provide visible and current address
numbers on both the structure and the mailbox.
      (1)   The letters and numbers on the mailbox shall be in compliance with
U.S. Postal Service regulations and recommendations. The lettering shall be at
least one inch in height. The color of the lettering shall be in contrast to
its background. The address shall be placed on both sides of the mailbox. In
cases where an address is considered an “out of bounds” address, the address
name of the street/road shall also be placed on both sides of the mailbox.
      (2)   The letters and numbers placed on structures shall be at least two
inches in height. The letters and numbers shall be placed on the main level in
a location which faces the street upon which it is addressed and near a main
entryway and placed higher than the height of the entryway. The color of the
lettering shall be in contrast to its background. If side or back entryways
open to a street, road or alley different from the address, the side of the
structure shall also have the full address, including address street/road name,
properly displayed.
      (3)   In situations where the mailbox is not located at the entrance to
the property and address numbers on the structure are not easily visible from
the street, a sign displaying the address with at least one inch lettering
shall be placed at the entrance to the property. The lettering color shall be
in contrast to its background. An alternative method shall be to paint the
address on the curb in front of the structure. The lettering on the curb shall
be at least two inches in height in black with a white background.
(Ord. 1998-13, passed 12-8-1998)
§ 152.05 OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY.
   The Town Council has the responsibility for the issuance of street names and
addresses in the town. The Town Council may, by resolution or pursuant to this
chapter, assign its duties and responsibilities to one or more town officials;
for example, the Town Utilities Superintendent, Town Building Commissioner and/
or Town Marshal. The Town Council (or its designee) shall issue and keep a
permanent record of all issued property addresses within its jurisdiction and
share the addresses with local postal authorities and E-911 personnel.
(Ord. 1998-13, passed 12-8-1998)
§ 152.06 PARTICULAR REQUIREMENTS FOR ADDRESSING.
   (A)   In the case of new subdivisions, street names and primary address
numbers shall be assigned as part of the platting process.
   (B)   Any renaming of existing streets shall be done by the Town Council.
   (C)   Any renumbering of existing addresses (primary address numbers) shall
be delegated by the Town Council to the Town Utilities Superintendent, Town
Building Commissioner and the Town Marshal.
   (D)   If a building permit is requested for a vacant parcel or vacant lot in
an existing subdivision (which has not been assigned an address pursuant to
division (A) above), the Building Commissioner shall assign a primary address
number as part of the issuance of the building permit.
   (E)   In no case shall an individual or business be permitted to assign an
address to his or her property or a structure on that property.
(Ord. 1998-13, passed 12-8-1998)
§ 152.07 ENFORCEMENT.
   The 1998 Readdressing Project is designed to review all addresses within the
town’s jurisdiction and to designate new addresses as described in this chapter
where necessary. Upon completion of the 1998 Readdressing Project, the town
will notify each affected property owner of any change to his or her address
and shall send a list of all changes to the appropriate Post Office or postal
authority. The Post Office will notify the owners of the effective date of the
change of address.

§ 153.01 FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The state legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 and
I.C. 14-28-4 granted the power to local government units to control land use
within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the Town Council does hereby adopt the
following floodplain management regulations.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities,
and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve those uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage;
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
      (6)   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures
and their contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the National
Flood Insurance Program.
   (D)   Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To protect human life and health;
      (2)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in floodplains;
      (6)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood prone areas in a manner so as to minimize flood blight
areas; and
      (7)   To ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is
in a flood area.
(Ord. 2007-16, passed 7-10-2007)
§ 153.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt or a combination of both. In A ZONES, flood
waters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM or FHBM. The definitions are
presented below.
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply.
      (2)   ZONE AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements
apply. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance
purchase requirements apply.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are one to three.
Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within
this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.
      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection. Mandatory flood insurance
purchase requirements apply.
      (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements
apply.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure that is located on
the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns and hay
sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community’s
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. The
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. The portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the Regular
Program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or

carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT FACILITY. A facility which ran not be used for its
intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to

Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual and peculiar
to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,

to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-
prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA).  Those lands within the jurisdictions
(including extraterritorial jurisdictions) of the town subject to inundation by
the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the town are generally identified as such on
the “Flood Insurance Rate Map of Johnson County and Incorporated Areas”, dated

prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date.
These areas are shown on a FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1-A30, AH, AR, A99 or AO.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual START means the first placement or permanent construction of a
structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of
slabs or footing, installation of piles, construction of columns or any work
beyond the stage of excavation for placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds

other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred “substantial
damage” or repetitive loss regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary or safety code requirements or any
alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structures continued designation as a “historic structure”.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification or other evidence of compliance required in this
chapter is presumed to be in VIOLATION until a time as that documentation is
provided.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.

Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88), National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929
(NGVD), or other datum where specified of floods of various magnitudes and
frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas.
   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X ZONES shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X ZONES (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FHBM or FIRM that reflects the severity
or type of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. See definition for A ZONE.
   ZONE B, C AND X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(ZONE X is used on new and revised maps in place of ZONES B AND C.)
(Ord. 2007-16, passed 7-10-2007)
§ 153.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all
SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the town.
   (B)   Basis for establishing regulatory flood data. This chapter’s
protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory
flood data is listed below. Whenever a party disagrees with the best available
data, the party submitting the detailed engineering study needs to replace
existing data with better data and submit it to the State Department of Natural
Resources for review and approval.
      (1)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs of the town shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles
in the “Flood Insurance Study of Johnson County and Incorporated Areas”, dated
August 2, 2007 and the corresponding FIRM dated August 2, 2007, as well as any
future updates, amendments or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency with the most recent date.
      (2)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway and fringe limits for each
of the unstudied SFHAs of the town delineated as an “A Zone” on the FIRM of the
county and incorporated areas shall be according to the best data available as
provided by the State Department of Natural Resources.
   (C)   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain
development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of
special flood hazard.
   (D)   Compliance. No structure shall hereafter be located, extended,
converted or structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with
the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. No land or stream
within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the
terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.
   (E)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (F)   Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground elevations.
      (1)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles shall govern.
      (2)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
      (3)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above
the base flood elevation, that site shall be considered outside the SFHA and
the floodplain regulations will not be applied. The property owner should be
advised to apply for a LOMA.
   (G)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (H)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Therefore, this chapter does not create any liability on the part of the town,
the State Department of Natural Resources, or the state, for any flood damage
that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder.

avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding;
      (9)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a
structure that is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall meet
the requirements of “new construction” as contained in this chapter; and
      (10)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a
structure that is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall
be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not further, extended or replaced.
   (B)   Specific standards. In all SFHAs, the following provisions are
required.
      (1)   Generally. In addition to the requirements of division (A) above,
all structures to be located in the SFHA shall be protected from flood damage
below the FPG. This building protection requirement applies to the following
situations:
         (a)   Construction or placement of any new structure having a floor
area greater than 400 square feet;
         (b)   Structural alterations made to:
            1.   An existing (previously unaltered structure), the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50% of the value of the pre-altered structure
(excluding the value of the land); and
            2.   Any previously altered structure.
         (c)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged structure that are
valued at more than 50% of the market value of the structure (excluding the

for more than 180 days;
         (e)   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new
manufactured home on an existing site. This chapter does not apply to returning
the existing manufactured home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it
was removed to avoid flood damage; and
         (f)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a repetitive loss structure.
      (2)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the
lowest floor; including basement, at or above the FPG (two feet above the base
flood elevation). Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood
waters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of division (B)(4)
below.
      (3)   Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure (or
manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to
or above the FPG (two feet above the base flood elevation). Structures located
in all “A Zones” may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated if done in
accordance with the following:
         (a)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the structure has been designed so that below the FPG, the structure and
attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the
effects of the regulatory flood. The structure design shall take into account

from debris or ice. The certification shall be provided to the official as set
forth in §
153.04(C)(10) above; and
         (b)   Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human
intervention and without an outside source of electricity.
      (4)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements
of elevated structures that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation
and other exterior walls below the flood protection grade shall be designed to
preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of
flood waters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls. Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by
a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area;

above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade);
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of flood waters in
both directions;
         (d)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to
allow for parking for vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator);
         (e)   The interior portion of the enclosed area shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms; and
         (f)   Portions of the building below the flood protection grade must
be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.
      (5)   Structures constructed on fill. A residential or nonresidential
structure may be constructed on a permanent land fill in accordance with the
following:
         (a)   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep
before compacting to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with the Standard
Proctor Test method;
         (b)   The fill should extend at least ten feet beyond the foundation
of the structure before sloping below the FPG;
         (c)   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during
flooding by vegetative cover, riprap or bulkheading. If vegetative cover is
used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical;
         (d)   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties; and
         (e)   The top of the lowest floor including basements shall be at or
above the FPG.
      (6)   Standards for structures constructed with a crawlspace. A
residential or nonresidential structure may be constructed with a crawlspace
located below the flood protection grade provided that the following conditions
are met:
         (a)   The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist
flotation, collapse and lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
         (b)   Any enclosed area below the flood protection grade shall have
openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the automatic
entry and exit of flood waters. Provide a minimum of two openings having a
total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of
enclosed area. The bottom of the openings shall be no more than one foot above
grade;
         (c)   The interior height of the crawlspace measured from the interior
grade of the crawlspace to the top of the foundation wall must not exceed four
feet at any point;
         (d)   Utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated above the
flood protection grade;
         (e)   An adequate drainage system must be installed to remove flood
waters from the interior area of the crawlspace within a reasonable period of
time after a flood event;
         (f)   Portions of the building below the flood protection grade must
be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; and
         (g)   The interior grade of the crawlspace must be at or above the
base flood elevation.
      (7)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially
improved on a site for more than 180 days must meet one of the following
requirements:
         (a)   The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent
foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse and lateral movement. This requirement applies to all manufactured
homes to be placed on a site:
            1.   Outside a manufactured home park or subdivision;
            2.   In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
            3.   In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision; or
            4.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which
a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as a result of a flood.
         (b)   The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the lowest floor
of the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other
foundation elevations that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and
be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse and lateral movement. This requirement applies to all
manufactured homes to be placed on a site in an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision that has not been substantially damaged by a flood; and
         (c)   Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either:
            1.   Be on site for less than 180 days;
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (defined as being
on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions); or
            3.   Meet the requirements for “manufactured homes” as stated
earlier in this section.
   (C)   Standards for subdivision proposals.
      (1)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
      (2)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage;
      (3)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards; and
      (4)   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres.
   (D)   Critical facility. Construction of new critical facilities shall be,
to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of
new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA
shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site.
Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into flood waters. Access
routes elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical
facilities to the extent possible.
   (E)   Standards for identified floodways.
      (1)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
153.03(B) above, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an
extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters, which carry
debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential.
      (2)   If the site is in an identified floodway, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the State Department of Natural
Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway.
      (3)   Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1, a permit for construction in
a floodway from the State Department of Natural Resources is required prior to
the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit,
construction or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes
land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving and
the like undertaken before the actual start of construction of the structure.
However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to existing
(lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26 allows
construction of non-substantial additions/improvements to residences in a non-
boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in a
floodway from the State Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if
fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval
(construction in a floodway permit) for the fill is required from the State
Department of Natural Resources.)
      (4)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit (when applicable) has been issued by the State Department of Natural
Resources granting approval for construction in a floodway. Once a permit for
construction in a floodway has been issued by the State Department of Natural
Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain
development permit, provided the provisions contained in §
153.05 above have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the State
Department of Natural Resources. However, a community’s more restrictive
regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
      (5)   No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in
combination with existing or future development, will increase the regulatory
flood more than 0.14 of one foot; and
      (6)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data.
   (F)   Standards for identified fringe. If the site is located in an
identified fringe, then the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit provided the provisions contained in this section
have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new
or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.
   (G)   Standards for SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or
floodways/fringes.
      (1)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the State Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment;
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway or a floodplain analysis/
regulatory assessment citing the 100-year flood elevation and the recommended
flood protection grade has been received from the State Department of Natural
Resources; and
         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment
approving the proposed development, a floodplain development permit may be
issued provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the State Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
      (2)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodway, fringe and 100-year flood elevation for the site; and
         (b)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in §
153.05 above have been met.
      (3)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and will not increase flood
damages or potential flood damages.
(Ord. 2007-16, passed 7-10-2007)
§ 153.06 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Designation of Variance and Appeals Board. The Board of Zoning Appeals
as established by Town Council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances from requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board. The Board shall hear and decide
appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision or
determination is made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the
Board may appeal the decision to the County Circuit Court, as provided by
statute.
   (C)   Variance procedures. In passing upon the applications, the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
all standards specified in other sections; of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (2)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of the damage on the individual owner;
      (3)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (4)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (6)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (7)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (8)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (9)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
of transport of the flood waters at the site; and
      (10)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued when there is:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
      (2)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §
153.05(E) or (G)(1) above may be granted.
      (3)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §
153.05(E) or (G)(1) above will require a permit from the State Department of
Natural Resources.
      (4)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §
153.05(B), may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot
of one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (6)   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of
any structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places
or the State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
      (7)   Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and
the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the
cost of the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. See division (E) below.
      (8)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the State Department of Natural Resources upon request. See division (E) below.
   (E)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   The construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property. The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report the
variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (F)   Historic structure. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as an “historic structure” and the variance is the minimum to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (G)   Special conditions. Upon the consideration of the factors listed in
this section, and the purposes of this chapter, the Board of Zoning Appeals may
attach the conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.
(Ord. 2007-16, passed 7-10-2007)
§ 153.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit in the SFHA or
failure to comply with the requirements of a floodplain development permit or
conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter.
   (B)   All violations shall be considered a common nuisance and shall be
punishable by a fine not exceeding $500.
      (1)   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the
violation continues to exist.
      (2)   The Floodplain Administrator shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      (3)   Nothing herein shall prevent the town from taking other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

154.181).
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.009 ZONING MAP.
   (A)   (1)   The zoning map for the jurisdiction of the Plan Commission in
effect on the date of adoption of this chapter is adopted as part of this
chapter by reference. The map may be referred to as the "Official Zoning Map"
and as the "zoning map".
      (2)   The Official Zoning Map is located in the office of the Department
and may be maintained as an electronic zoning map. Copies of the Official
Zoning Map must be labeled as copies and contain the last date of modification.
The Official Zoning Map should be revised annually or as the Plan Commission
determines necessary.
   (B)   The following rules apply where uncertainty exists about the exact
boundaries of any zoning district shown on the zoning map:
      (1)   Zoning district boundaries shown within or parallel to the lines of
streets, easements, and rights-of-way are deemed to follow the centerline of
the affected street, easement, or right-of-way. At the boundaries of the
jurisdiction of the Plan Commission, district boundaries are deemed to include
the full width of such streets, easements, and rights-of-way.
      (2)   Zoning district boundaries indicated as following or being parallel
to section or fractional sectional lines, lot lines, or town corporation lines
are interpreted as following or paralleling such lines.
      (3)   Zoning district boundaries indicated as approximately following the
centerline of streams, rivers, or other bodies of water are interpreted to
follow such centerlines.
      (4)   Zoning district boundaries indicated as approximately following the
parcel lines as established by the town are interpreted to follow such parcel
lines.
      (5)   If the boundary line of a district divides a lot in a manner
essentially perpendicular to a street, the district that applies to the larger
part of the lot applies to the entire lot.
      (6)   In the case of uncertainty, the Administrator interprets the intent
of the Zoning Map and determines the location of the boundary in question. If
the Administrator cannot definitively determine the location of a zoning
district boundary, the BZA determines the location of the zoning district
boundary.
   (C)   Unless changed by an amendment to this chapter, land annexed into the
town currently zoned for agricultural uses will be designated AG Agricultural
District and all other zoning districts will be designated R-1 Low Density
Single-Family Residential District. Whenever any right-of-way or other similar
area is vacated, the zoning districts adjoining each side of the right-of-way
or the area automatically extend to the centerline of such vacation. All areas
included in the vacation are then subject to the appropriate provisions of the
extended zoning district(s). In the event of a partial vacation, the adjoining
zoning district, or zoning district nearest the portion vacated, extends
automatically to include all the vacated area.
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.010 NONCONFORMING REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Upon the adoption of this chapter, the zoning map, and potentially
upon other government action (e.g., acquisition of right-of-way), some
buildings, structures, lots and uses may no longer conform to the regulations
of their zoning district. This chapter provides the rules, policies, and
regulations that apply to these buildings, structures, lots and uses.
   (B)   Any property, lot, or structure rendered nonconforming solely by the
action of a governmental agency modifying any street, is exempt from these
nonconformance provisions.
   (C)   (1)   Legal nonconforming. Legal nonconformance is caused by an
amendment to this chapter and not due to a change to the property, resulting in
the property no longer conforming to the standards of the applicable zoning
district. When this situation occurs, the property is deemed legal
nonconforming and is subject to the terms of this chapter.
      (2)   Illegal nonconforming. A building, structure, sign, or lot
constructed or used without an approved building permit, improvement location
permit, or approval from the BZA or Plan Commission is considered illegal
nonconforming when it does not conform to this chapter. An illegal
nonconforming property is subject to enforcement and penalties as set forth in
§§
154.180 to
154.183, and all other applicable state or municipal law. The illegal
nonconforming property must be altered to conform with all applicable standards
and regulations of this chapter.
   (D)   It is recognized that there exist within zoning districts certain
lots, buildings, structures and uses which were lawful before this chapter was
passed or amended, but are now prohibited, regulated or restricted under the
terms of this chapter. It is the intent to permit these legal nonconformities
to continue until they are removed but not to encourage their survival.
   (E)   Nonconforming lots, buildings, structures, and uses are declared by
this chapter to be incompatible with the provisions of the districts in which
they are located. It is the intent of this chapter that nonconformities not be
enlarged, expanded, or extended, except as otherwise permitted in this chapter,
nor be used as the reason to add other buildings, structures, or uses
prohibited elsewhere in the district.
   (F)   Nothing in this chapter serves as authorization for, or approval of,
the continuation of a use that violates the zoning regulations in effect at the
time of the adoption of this chapter.
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.011 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   A nonconforming use cannot be enlarged or increased, nor extended to
occupy a greater area of land or building area than was occupied on the
effective date this chapter.
   (B)   No part of any nonconforming use can be moved unless the movement
eliminates or reduces the nonconformity.
   (C)   If a nonconforming use is abandoned for any reason for a period of
more than one year, any subsequent use must conform to the requirements of this
chapter. A nonconforming use is determined to be abandoned if one or more of
the following conditions exists:
      (1)   Utilities serving the property—such as water, gas, and
electricity—have been disconnected;
      (2)   The property, buildings, and grounds, have fallen into disrepair,
as evidenced by broken windows, sagging or missing steps, structural defects,
overgrown grass or weeds, and similar conditions;
      (3)   Signs or other indications of the existence of the nonconforming
use have been removed;
      (4)   Equipment or fixtures necessary for the operation of the
nonconforming use have been removed;
      (5)   Other actions the Administrator deems to constitute an intention on
the part of the owner or lessee to abandon the nonconforming use.
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.012 NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful building or structure exists on the effective date of this
chapter that does not comply with the requirements of this chapter because of
restrictions such as lot area, lot coverage, width, height, or setbacks, that
building or structure may continue to be occupied and used so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (A)   If a nonconforming building or structure is destroyed to more than 50%
of its fair market value exclusive of the foundation, it must be reconstructed
in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. The Administrator may
consult with outside sources to determine fair market value. The BZA may permit
the reconstruction of the nonconforming building or structure if all the
following conditions are met:
      (1)   The prior nonconforming conditions are not increased;
      (2)   All building materials and architectural details conform to the
architectural standards found in §§
154.130 to
154.163.
      (3)   The new building or structure is placed on the original foundation,
unless the building or structure could be located to reduce the nonconformity
on the lot;
      (4)   The application to reconstruct the nonconforming building or
structure was filed with the Administrator within six months of the date the
building or structure was damaged or destroyed; and
      (5)   The reconstruction of the building or structure is not detrimental
to adjacent property and the surrounding neighborhood.
   (B)   If a nonconforming building or structure is moved for any reason and
for any distance, it must be moved to a location complying with the
requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.013 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   (A)   If a lot of record does not meet a minimum lot width or minimum lot
area requirement, the lot of record may be used for any use permitted in the
district in which it is located. Any building or structure constructed on the
lot must comply with the required front and rear setbacks and other
requirements for the zoning district. However, side setbacks may be reduced up
to the percentage to which the lot width relates to the minimum lot width
requirement. The nonconforming lot may also be used for special exception uses,
if it meets all applicable requirements of this chapter for those uses (see §
154.180).
   (B)   When two or more lots of record have continuous frontage and are under
single ownership but do not meet the requirements established for lot width or
lot area, the parcels involved are considered one undivided parcel for purposes
of this chapter. No portion of the parcel can be used or divided in a manner
that reduces compliance with lot width and area requirements established by
this chapter.
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.014 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   The following regulations apply to legal nonconforming structures and uses:
   (A)   Work may be done for ordinary repairs or replacement of walls,
heating, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing under the condition the square footage
and volume of usable space does not increase.
   (B)   If all or part of a structure is declared unsafe or condemned by an
authorized official and is not repaired or rebuilt within six months of the
declaration, the structure loses its nonconforming status. All future
improvements must conform to the standards of this chapter.
   (C)   Permits may be required for modifications or alterations of legal
nonconforming structures (see §
154.181).
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.015 EFFECTIVE DATE; TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   This chapter comprises a replacement ordinance for the jurisdiction of
the Town of Bargersville, as described in I.C. 36-7-4-602(a) and in I.C. 36-7-
4-700. Accordingly, the prior Bargersville Zoning Ordinance, which was adopted
on or about July 20, 2015, as amended, and the prior Bargersville Subdivision
Control Ordinance, which was adopted on or about December 1, 2015, as amended
are hereby repealed on the effective date of this chapter.
   (B)   The effective date of this chapter is the latest of the following
dates:
      (1)   The final day on which notice of the adoption of the penalty
provisions of this chapter (see §
154.183) is published under I.C. 36-7-4-610(a).
      (2)   The day on which this chapter is filed in the Clerk-Treasurer's
office under I.C. 36-7-4-610(f).
      (3)   August 1, 2022.
   (C)   This section applies to any application for a permit pending before
the Department on the effective date of this chapter. The applicant may request
the Administrator treat the application as an application filed according to
this chapter instead of the prior Bargersville Zoning Ordinance. If the
Administrator grants the request, the application is then approved or denied by
the Department, BZA, Plan Commission, or the Council according to the
provisions of this chapter.

(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.031 RURAL DISTRICTS STANDARDS AND USES.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   AG Agriculture. The Agriculture District is primarily to
accommodate agricultural operations and practices. In addition, the AG District
is intended to preserve and maintain the established rural character and
agricultural traditions of Bargersville and the surrounding area. It allows
agricultural development by reason of location and the availability of
resources and infrastructure, while allowing scattered single family homes at a
very low density.
      (2)   R-R Rural Residential. The Rural Residential District is intended
to protect those features within the rural areas of the town that are valued by
the community and contribute its character. The agricultural context, pastoral
setting, natural features, and wildlife habitats are essential components of
that rural character. Single-family homes are permitted within this district at
low densities, along with uses compatible with the openness of the district and
the country setting.
   (B)   Lot requirements.

   (H)   Miscellaneous provisions.
      (1)   Any lot of record zoned AG Agriculture that was within the A-1F
District at the time of annexation may be split by minor subdivision (see §
154.131(C)) provided the resulting parcels, including the lot of record, do not
exceed an average density of one dwelling unit per ten acres. If the resulting
density on a lot of record will exceed this density, the parcel must first be
rezoned to R-R Rural Residential prior to proceeding with an application for
subdivision approval.
      (2)   New residential dwelling units are required to connect to municipal
water and sanitary sewer services. The Town Council may grant a waiver to this
requirement (See §
154.145). Other jurisdictional permits may be required.
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.032 RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS STANDARDS AND USES.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   R-1 Low Density Single-Family District. The Low Density Single-
Family District is intended to accommodate new residential subdivision
development at densities of approximately two units per acre, along with
related uses.
      (2)   R-2 Moderate Density Single-Family District. Moderate Density
Single-Family District is intended to encompass some of the town's existing
single family residential neighborhoods and accommodate new development at
densities of about three units per acre.
      (3)   R-3 Medium Density Mixed Residential District. The Medium Density
Mixed Residential District is intended to provide wider housing options at
densities of up to six units per acre. The R-3 District lends itself to serving
as a buffer or transitional zone between lower density residential and non-
residential development. Single family dwellings, small-scale multifamily
dwellings, and townhomes are permitted, along with compatible public, quasi-
public and institutional uses.
      (4)   R-4 High Density Mixed Residential District. The High Density Mixed
Residential District is similar in character and purpose to the R-3 District,
but also permits multifamily dwellings. It allows development at higher
densities than any other district. Residential densities of up to 12 units per
acre are permitted in this district.
      (5)   R-5 Multi-Family Residential. The Multi-Family Residential District
is intended to provide large-scale multifamily housing options at densities of
up to 22 units per acre. This district is intended for large apartment
complexes with over 100 units with vehicular access to arterial or collector
streets. They can either front directly on the arterial or collector street or
be located as a transitional land use between nonresidential uses and lower
density residential zones.
   (B)   Lot requirements. See Image 2-1.

§ 154.033 COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS STANDARDS AND USES.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   C-1 Office/Service Business District. The Office/Service District
is intended to accommodate uses that can provide office and personal services
to the residents of Bargersville. The uses permitted in this district are low
intensity and an appropriate scale and appearance to be generally compatible
with most other uses. Among other purposes, this district may serve as a
transitional zone between residential and commercial or industrial districts
and between major thoroughfares and residential districts.
      (2)   C-2 Local Business District. The Local Business District is
intended to provide for the development of convenience business uses meeting
the daily needs of residents living in adjacent residential neighborhoods. This
district should be strategically located with access to a minor arterial or
collector street.
      (3)   C-3 General Business District. The General Business District
accommodates general retail and/or autodependent businesses. Uses within the
district typically require high visibility, arterial frontage, good access, and
ample parking. Uses in this district are intended to be confined to nodes to
prevent the creation of commercial strip development with its attendant traffic
congestion, unsightly clutter, distractions, and potential incompatibility with
adjoining residential uses.
   (B)   Lot requirements.

§ 154.034 INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND USES.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   I-1 Light Industry. This district is established to accommodate
light industrial uses in which all operations, including storage of materials,
would be confined within a building, and would include warehousing operations.

(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.036 FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS.
   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation
resulting in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption
of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for
flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, that adversely
affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. Additionally, structures
that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood
damage contribute to the flood loss. To minimize the threat of such damages and
to achieve the purposes of this section, these regulations are adopted.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to
flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding undertaken at public expense;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges)
located in floodplains;
      (6)   Maintain a stable tax base by providing uses of flood-prone areas
that minimize flood blight;
      (7)   Ensure that occupants of special flood hazard assume responsibility
for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties in and
around flood- prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure the flood storage and conveyance functions of the floodplain
are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible;
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (B)   Methods of reducing flood loss. To accomplish its purposes, these
regulations include provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses that are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or that result in damaging increases
in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring uses vulnerable to floods be protected against flood
damage at the time of initial construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, that accommodate or channel flood waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development activities that may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that
divert flood waters or increase flood hazards in other areas.
   (C)   Definitions. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used
in this section are interpreted with the meanings they have in common usage and
to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
      1% ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any given year. See REGULATORY FLOOD.
      ALTERATION OF A WATERCOURSE. A dam, impoundment, channel relocation,

of the channel or the channel capacity, or any other modification which may
alter, impede, retard, or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of
water during conditions of the base flood.
      ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A structure with a floor area of 400 square feet or
less on the same parcel as a principal structure the use of which is incidental
to the use of the principal structure. An ACCESSORY STRUCTURE excludes
structures used for human habitation.

structure includes at least two outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof.
         (b)   Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES include detached garages,
carports, storage and tool sheds, and small boathouses.
         (c)   The following may have uses that are incidental or accessory to
the principal structure on a parcel but are generally not considered to be
ACCESSORY STRUCTURES by the NFIP:

      FLOOD or FLOODING.
         (a)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
            1.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
            2.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
            3.   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by
flooding and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of
normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and
deposited along the path of the current.
         (b)   FLOOD or FLOODING also includes the collapse or subsidence of
land along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion
or undermining caused by waves or current of water exceeding anticipated
cyclical levels that result in a flood as defined above.
      FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Areas subject to the 1% annual chance flood. (See
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA).
      FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available
digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).
      FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM and
the water surface elevation of the base flood.
      FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOODPLAIN).
      FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The BFE plus two feet at any given location

any source. (See FLOOD).
      FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective
and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
      FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. Zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances
(such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control

flood-prone areas. The term describes such state or local regulations in any
combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage
prevention and reduction.
      FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure
that ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
      FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for
nonresidential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG.
      FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulative increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height.
      FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
      FRINGE or FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the floodplain lying outside the
floodway.
      FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended
purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The
term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for
the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship
repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related
manufacturing facilities.
      HARDSHIP (AS RELATED TO VARIANCES OF THIS CHAPTER). The exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
Town of Bargersville Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is
exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or
financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of
one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional HARDSHIP.
All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally
intended.
      HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a
structure.
      HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
         (a)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places

determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
         (b)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
         (c)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
         (d)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by (1)
an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of Interior; or (2)
directly by the Secretary of Interior in states without approved programs.
      HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. Analyses performed by a
professional engineer licensed by the State of Indiana, in accordance with
standard engineering practices that are accepted by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and FEMA, used to determine the base flood, other frequency
floods, flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries, and flood
profiles.
      INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL-EVALUATION SERVICE (ICC-ES) REPORT. A document
that presents the findings, conclusions, and recommendations from a particular
evaluation. ICC-ES REPORTS provide information about what code requirements or
acceptance criteria were used to evaluate a product, and how the product should
be identified, installed.
      LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
      LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They are broken down into the following categories:
         (a)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). FEMA's comment on a
proposed project that would, upon construction, result in modification of the
SFHA through the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
         (b)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (CLOMR-F). A
letter from FEMA stating that a proposed structure that will be elevated by
fill would not be inundated by the base flood.
         (c)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a building or of land is not
located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A
LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
         (d)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT OUT AS SHOWN (LOMA-OAS). An official
determination by FEMA that states the property or building is correctly shown
outside the SFHA as shown on an effective NFIP map. Therefore, the mandatory
flood insurance requirement does not apply. An out-as-shown determination does
not require elevations.
         (e)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
         (f)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). FEMA's
modification of the SFHA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill
outside the existing regulatory floodway.
      LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.
      LOWEST FLOOR. For floodplain management purposes, the lowest elevation
described among the following:
         (a)   The lowest floor of a building;
         (b)   The basement floor;
         (c)   The garage floor if the garage is connected to the building;
         (d)   The first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or pillars;
         (e)   The floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement, below
an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any resistance
to the flow of floodwaters. Designs for meeting the flood opening requirement
must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or
meet or exceed the following criteria:
            1.   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the
hydrostatic flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters.
            2.   At least two openings are designed and maintained for the
entry and exit of floodwater; and these openings provide a total net area of at
least one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of
all such openings must be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or
the interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher.
Doorways and windows do not qualify as openings.
         (f)   The first floor of a building elevated on pilings or columns in
a coastal high hazard area (as that term is defined in 44 CFR 59.1), as long as
it meets the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3.
      MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a RECREATIONAL VEHICLE.

of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
      MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk
to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of
MITIGATION is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the
cost of disaster response and recovery.
      NATURAL GRADE FOR FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. The elevation of the
undisturbed natural surface of the ground. Fill placed prior to the date of the
initial identification of the flood hazard on a FEMA map is also considered
natural grade.
      NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. Any structure for
which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulations adopted by a community and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
      NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
      NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88) AS ADOPTED IN 1993. A
vertical control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations
within the floodplain.
      OBSTRUCTION. Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization,
bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
      PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community's
FEMA map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations,
floodplain boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric
features. These changes typically occur as a result of structural works or
improvements, annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or
correction to base flood elevations or SFHAs.
      PREFABRICATED BUILDING. A building that is manufactured and constructed
using prefabrication. It consists of factory-made components or units that are
transported and assembled on-site to form the complete building.
      PRINCIPALLY ABOVE GROUND. At least 51% of the actual cash value of the
structure, less land value, is above ground.
      RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:

quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use.
      REGULATORY FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is
acceptable to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and
the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any
location is as defined in division (D)(2) of this section. The REGULATORY FLOOD
is also known by the term BASE FLOOD, 1% ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD, and 100-YEAR
FLOOD.
      REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
      RIVERINE. Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
      SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). (Synonymous with AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD
HAZARD and FLOODPLAIN.) Those lands within the jurisdiction of the Town of Avon
subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. SPECIAL FLOOD
HAZARD AREAS are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood
Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies as Zones A, AE, A99. The SFHA
includes areas that are flood-prone and designated from other federal, state or
local sources of data including but not limited to best available flood layer
maps provided by or approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood-prone soils associated with a watercourse.
      SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITY. Any facility involved in the storage or
disposal of non-liquid, non-soluble materials ranging from municipal garbage to
industrial wastes that contain complex and sometimes hazardous substances.
Solid waste also includes sewage sludge, agricultural refuse, demolition
wastes, mining wastes, and liquids and gases stored in containers.
      START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the
date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
      STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid
storage tank, which is principally above ground. The term includes a
manufactured home, as well as a prefabricated building. It also includes
recreational vehicles installed on a site for more than 180 consecutive days.
      SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
      SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "repetitive loss"
or "substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements.
      VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
      VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter.
      WALLED AND ROOFED. A building that has two or more exterior rigid walls
and a fully secured roof and is affixed to a permanent site.
      WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel, or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   (D)   General provisions.
      (1)   Applicability. This section applies to all SFHAs and known flood-
prone areas within the jurisdiction of the Town of Bargersville.
      (2)   Basis for establishing regulatory flood data. This section's
protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory
flood data is listed below.
         (a)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for
the studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the Town of Bargersville,
delineated as an "AE Zone" on the Johnson County, Indiana and Incorporated
Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated August 2, 2007 is determined from the 1%
annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Johnson County,
Indiana and Incorporated Areas and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRM) dated August 2, 2007 as well as any subsequent updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date. Should the floodway limits not be delineated on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map for a studied SFHA designated as an "AE Zone", the limits of
the floodway will be according to the best available flood layer as provided by
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
         (b)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for
each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the Town of Bargersville,
delineated as an "A Zone" on the Johnson County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas
Flood Insurance Rate Map, dated August 2, 2007, as well as any subsequent
updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency with the most recent date, must be according to the best available flood
layer provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, provided the
upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile.
Whenever a party disagrees with the best available flood layer data, the party
needs to replace existing data with better data that meets current engineering
standards. To be considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources for review and subsequently approved.
         (c)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community's known flood-prone areas is
according to the best data available as provided by IDNR, provided the upstream
drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile.
         (d)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study is utilized for
permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all previously
effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.
      (3)   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain
development permit is required in conformance with the provisions of this
section prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of
special flood hazard.
      (4)   Compliance. No structure can be located, extended, converted, or
structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of
this section and other applicable regulations. No land or stream within the
SFHA can be altered without full compliance with the terms of this section and
other applicable regulations.
      (5)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap, the
more stringent restrictions apply.
      (6)   Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground elevations.
         (a)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped
floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation
provided on the profiles governs.
         (b)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that portion of the site is included in the SFHA and regulated
accordingly.
         (c)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is
above the base flood elevation, that portion of the site is considered outside
the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied. The property owner
should apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).
      (7)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this
section all provisions are considered as minimum requirements; construed in
favor of the governing body; and, deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other
powers granted under state statutes.
      (8)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Therefore, this article does not create any liability on the part of the town,
the IDNR, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made.
      (9)   Penalties for violation. Failure to obtain a floodplain development
permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a floodplain
development permit or conditions of a variance is deemed a violation of this
chapter and subject to enforcement.
         (a)   A separate offense occurs each day the violation continues to
exist.
         (b)   The Administrator informs the owner that such a violation is
considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
suspension of a Standard Flood Insurance Policy.
         (c)   The town is not prevented from taking other lawful action to
prevent or remedy violations. All enforcement costs, including attorney's fees,
accrue to the persons responsible.
   (E)   Administration.
      (1)   Designation of Administrator. The Town Council appoints the
Administrator to administer and implement the provisions of this section and is
referred to as the Floodplain Administrator.
      (2)   Permit procedures. Application for a floodplain development permit
is made to the Floodplain Administrator on forms furnished by the Department
prior to any development activities and may include plans describing the
nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing

which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed
development. A hydrologic and hydraulic engineering study is required, and any
watercourse changes submitted to DNR for approval and then to FEMA as a Letter
of Map Revision. (See division (E)(3)(f) for additional information.)
            14.   Any additional information, as requested by the Floodplain
Administrator, which may be necessary to determine the disposition of a
proposed development or structure with respect to the requirements of this
chapter.
         (b)   At the construction stage the following information is required:
Upon establishment of the lowest floor of an elevated structure or structure
constructed on fill, it is the duty of the applicant to submit to the
Floodplain Administrator an elevation certificate for the building under
construction. The Floodplain Administrator reviews the elevation certificate.
Any deficiencies detected during the review must be corrected by the applicant
before work is allowed to continue. Failure to submit the survey or failure to
make said corrections required is cause to issue a stop-work order for the
project.
         (c)   At the completion of construction, the following information is
required: Upon completion of construction of any structure requiring
certification of elevation, an elevation certificate which depicts the "as-
built" lowest floor elevation and other applicable elevation data is required
to be submitted by the applicant to the Floodplain Administrator. The elevation
certificate is prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land
surveyor and certified by the same.
            1.   Upon completion of construction of an elevated structure
constructed on fill, a fill report is required to be submitted to the
Floodplain Administrator to verify the required standards were met, including
compaction.
            2.   Upon completion of construction of a floodproofing measure, a
floodproofing certificate is required to be submitted by the applicant to the
Floodplain Administrator. The floodproofing certificate is prepared by or under
the direct supervision of a registered professional engineer or architect and
certified by same.
      (3)   Duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. The
Floodplain Administrator is authorized to enforce the provisions of this
section. The Floodplain Administrator is authorized to render interpretations
of this section consistent with its intent and purpose. Duties and
responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator include:
         (a)   Enforce the provisions of this chapter;
         (b)   Evaluate application for permits to develop in special flood
hazard areas to assure that the permit requirements of this chapter have been
satisfied;
         (c)   Interpret floodplain boundaries and provide flood hazard and
flood protection elevation information;

permits may be required. If specific federal, state and/or local permits are
known, require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file
with the floodplain development permit;
         (f)   Conduct substantial damage determinations to determine whether
existing structures, damaged from any source and in special flood hazard areas
identified by FEMA, must meet the development standards of these regulations;
         (g)   For applications to improve structures, including alterations,
movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, change of occupancy, additions,
rehabilitations, renovations, substantial improvements, repairs of substantial
damage, and any other improvement of or work on such buildings and structures,
the Floodplain Administrator:
            1.   Verifies and documents the market value of the pre-damaged or
pre-improved structure;
            2.   Compares the cost to perform the improvement; or the cost to
repair a damaged building to its pre-damaged condition; or, the combined costs
of improvements and repair, if applicable, to the market value of the pre-
damaged or pre-improved structure. The cost of all work must be included in the
project costs, including work that might otherwise be considered routine
maintenance. Items/activities that must be included in the cost in keeping with
guidance published by FEMA to ensure compliance with the NFIP and to avoid any
conflict with future flood insurance claims of policyholders within the
community;
            3.   Determines and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage; the determination
requires evaluation of previous permits issued for improvements and repairs as
specified in the definition of "substantial improvement' for proposed work to
repair damage caused by flood, the determination requires evaluation of
previous permits issued to repair flood-related damage as specified in the
definition of substantial damage; and
            4.   Notifies the applicant if it is determined that the work

         (u)   Utilize and enforce all Letters of Map Change (LOMC) or Physical
Map Revisions (PMR) issued by FEMA for the currently effective SFHA maps of the
community;
         (v)   Request any additional information which may be necessary to
determine the disposition of a proposed development or structure with respect
to the requirements of this chapter.
      (4)   Administrative procedures.
         (a)   Inspections of work in progress. As the work pursuant to a
permit progresses, the Floodplain Administrator makes as many inspections of
the work as may be necessary to ensure that the work is being done according to
the provisions of the local ordinance and terms of the permit. In exercising
this power, the administrator has a right, upon presentation of proper
credential, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction at any
reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action.
         (b)   Stop work orders.
            1.   Upon notice from the Floodplain Administrator, work on any
building, structure or premises done contrary to the provisions of this section
must immediately cease.
            2.   The notice is in writing and given to the owner of the
property, or to his or her agent, or to the person doing the work, and states
the conditions under which work may be resumed.
         (c)   Revocation of permits.
            1.   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit or approval,
issued under the provisions of the ordinance, in cases where there has been any
false statement or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application
or plans on which the permit or approval was based.
            2.   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit upon
determination by the Floodplain Administrator that the construction, erection,
alteration, repair, moving, demolition, installation, or replacement of the
structure for which the permit was issued is in violation of, or not in
conformity with, the provisions of this chapter.
         (d)   Floodplain management records.
            1.   Regardless of any limitation on the period required for
retention of public records, records of actions associated with the
administration of this chapter must be kept on file and maintained under the
direction of the Floodplain Administrator in perpetuity. These records include
permit applications, plans, certifications, Flood Insurance Rate Maps; Letter
of Map Change; records of issuance of permits and denial of permits;
determinations of whether proposed work constitutes substantial improvement or
repair of substantial damage; required design certifications and documentation
of elevations required by this chapter; notifications to adjacent communities,
FEMA, and the state related to alterations of watercourses; assurances that the
flood carrying capacity of altered watercourses will be maintained;
documentation related to appeals and variances, including justification for
issuance or denial; and records of enforcement actions taken pursuant to this
chapter.
            2.   These records are available for public inspection at the
Bargersville Town Hall at 24 N. Main Street, Bargersville, IN 46106.
         (e)   Periodic inspection. Once a project is completed, periodic
inspections may be conducted by the Floodplain Administrator to ensure
compliance. The Floodplain Administrator has a right, upon presentation of
proper credential, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction
of the department at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or
other enforcement action.
      (5)   Map maintenance activities. To meet NFIP minimum requirements to
have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to ensure that the Town of
Bargersville flood maps, studies, and other data identified in division (E)(2)
accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain management
criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance activities
are identified:
         (a)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
            1.   For all development proposals that impact floodway
delineations or base flood elevations, the community ensures that technical
data reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date
such information becomes available. These development proposals include:
               a.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
               b.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed
structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special
flood hazard area;
               c.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and subdivision or large-scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations.
            2.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have required
technical data for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map
Revision and submitted to FEMA. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources
will review the submittals as part of a partnership with FEMA. The submittal
should be mailed to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources at the address
provided on the FEMA form (MT-2) or submitted through the online Letter of Map
Change website. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions are the
responsibility of the applicant.
            3.   The Floodplain Administrator requires a Conditional Letter of
Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for
proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood elevation.
            4.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator are conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to this section.
         (b)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission includes appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the Town Council of the Town of
Bargersville and may be submitted to FEMA at any time.
         (c)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator notifies FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the Town of
Bargersville have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Johnson County, Indiana, and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map
accurately represent the Town of Bargersville boundaries, include within such
notification a copy of a map of the Town of Bargersville suitable for
reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for
which the Town of Bargersville has assumed or relinquished floodplain
management regulatory authority.
      (6)   Variance procedures.
         (a)   The BZA hears and decides appeals and requests for variances
from requirements of this section.
         (b)   The BZA hears and decides appeals when it is alleged an error in
any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Floodplain
Administrator in the administration of this section. Any person aggrieved by
the decision of the BZA may appeal the decision to the Johnson County Circuit
Court.
         (c)   In acting upon applications, the BZA considers all technical
evaluations, relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this
chapter, and:
            1.   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            2.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
            5.   The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, where
applicable;
            6.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
            7.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
            8.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            9.   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment of transport of the floodwaters at the site;
            10.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         (d)   A written report addressing each of the above factors is
submitted with the application for a variance.
         (e)   Variances from the provisions of this chapter are only be
granted when the board can make positive findings of fact based on evidence
submitted at the hearing for the following:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance results in
exceptional hardship.
            3.   A determination that granting the variance does not increase
flood heights, increase threats to public safety, add extraordinary public
expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public, or
conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
         (f)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to
divisions (F)(5) and (7)(a) of this section may be granted.
         (g)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to divisions (F)(5)
and (7)(a) of this article requires a permit from IDNR.
         (h)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of
division (E)(2) are granted only when a new structure is located on a lot 0.5
acres or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the FPG.
         (i)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
"historic structures" upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an
"historic structure" and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
         (j)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use.
         (k)   Variances are only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         (l)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes
of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
         (m)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted is given written
notice specifying the difference between the Flood Protection Grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
         (n)   The Floodplain Administrator maintains the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request.
   (F)   Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
      (1)   Floodplain status standards.
         (a)   Floodways (riverine). Located within SFHAs, established in
division (E)(2), are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an
extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry
debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. Under the provisions
of the Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1) a permit for construction in a floodway
from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the
issuance of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction,
or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation
activities such as filling, grading, clearing, and paving undertaken before the
actual start of construction of the structure. General licenses and exemptions
to the requirements of the Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1 and 312 IAC 10) may
apply to qualified additions/improvements to existing lawful residential
structures, rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland restoration, utility line
crossings, outfall projects, creek rock removal, and prospecting.
            1.   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in
division (E)(2), the Floodplain Administrator requires the applicant to forward
the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for approval for construction
in a floodway, provided the activity does not qualify for a general license or
exemption (I.C. 14-28-1 or 312 IAC 10).
            2.   No action can be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. The floodplain
development permit must meet the provisions contained in this section.
            3.   The Floodplain Development Permit cannot be less restrictive
than an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to qualify for
a general license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site/
project. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any) takes
precedence.
            4.   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development cannot
cause an increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge without first obtaining a Conditional Letter of Map Revision and
meeting requirements of division (E)(5)(a). A Conditional Letter of Map
Revision cannot be issued for development that would cause an increase in flood
levels affecting a structure and such development should not be permitted.
            5.   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet
identified on the effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect
of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, cannot adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly
restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as an
increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least 0.15 foot as
determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project
condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with
hydraulic analyses.
            6.   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill
(including levees) the town submits the data and request that the Federal
Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping
standard regulations found at 44 CFR 65.12.
         (b)   Fringe (riverine). If the site is in the fringe (either
identified on the FIRM or identified by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources through detailed or approximate studies and not identified on a
FIRM), the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development
permit provided the provisions contained in this section have been met.
         (c)   SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/
fringes (riverine).
            1.   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square
mile:
               a.   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits
of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator requires the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
               b.   No action can be taken by the Floodplain Administrator
until written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
(approval for construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence
of general license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory
assessment citing the one-percent annual chance flood elevation and the
recommended flood protection grade has been received from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.
               c.   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be
issued, provided the conditions of the Floodplain Development Permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
            2.   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square
mile:
               a.   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits
of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
requires the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and one-percent annual chance flood elevation for the site.
               b.   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the
local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this
section have been met.
         (d)   SFHAs not identified on a map.
            1.   If a proposed development site is near a waterway with no SFHA
identified on a map, the Floodplain Administrator verifies the drainage area
upstream of the site. If the drainage area upstream of the site is verified as
being greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator requires the
applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and
specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and
comment.
            2.   No action can be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the one-percent annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood
protection grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
            3.   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be
issued, provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
      (2)   General standards. In all areas of special flood hazard, the
following provisions are required:
         (a)   All new construction, reconstruction, or repairs made to a
repetitive loss structure, and substantial improvements must be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure.
         (b)   New construction and substantial improvements must be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage
below the FPG.
         (c)   New construction and substantial improvements must incorporate
methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
         (d)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning
equipment, and other service facilities must be located at/above the FPG for
residential structures. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air
conditioning equipment, and other service facilities must be located at/above
the FPG or designed so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within
the components below the FPG for non-residential structures. Water and sewer
pipes, electrical and telephone lines, submersible pumps, and other
waterproofed service facilities may be located below the FPG.
         (e)   New and replacement water supply systems must be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
         (f)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems must be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
         (g)   On-site waste disposal systems must be located and constructed
to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.

structure that is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter must meet
the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter.
         (i)   Base flood elevation data must be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres.
         (j)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
         (k)   Fill projects that do not involve a structure must be protected
against erosion and scour during flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulk
heading. If vegetative cover is used, the slopes cannot be steeper than three
feet horizontal to one foot vertical.
         (l)   Non-conversion agreements are required for all new or
substantially improved elevated structures with an enclosure beneath the
elevated floor, accessory structures, and open-sided shelters.
         (m)   Construction of new solid waste disposal facilities, hazard
waste management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities are
not permitted in areas of special flood hazard.
         (n)   Whenever any portion of the SFHA is authorized for use, the
volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure
below the BFE must be compensated for and balanced by an equivalent volume of
excavation taken below the BFE. The excavation volume must be at least equal to
the volume of storage lost (replacement ratio of one to one) due to the fill or
structure.
            1.   The excavation takes place in the same floodplain on the same
property on which the authorized fill or structure is located, provided
sufficient space exists. If sufficient space does not exist on the same
property, the excavation takes place in the same floodplain no further than
1,000 feet from the site of the authorized fill or structure, provided
authorization/permission has been granted by the owners of any property where
the excavation is proposed.
            2.   Under certain circumstances, the excavation may be allowed to
take place outside of but adjacent to the floodplain provided that the
excavated volume will be below the regulatory flood elevation, will be in the
same property in which the authorized fill or structure is located, will be
accessible to the regulatory floodwater, will not be subject to ponding when
not inundated by floodwater, and that it must not be refilled.
            3.   The excavation provides for true storage of floodwater but
cannot be subject to ponding when not inundated by floodwater.
            4.   The excavation must be sufficiently stabilized and compacted
to remain firm and resist erosion.
            5.   A restrictive covenant stating the approved compensatory cut
area (excavation) cannot be altered without approval from the Floodplain
Administrator must be executed and recorded in the County Recorder's Office
that runs with the property.
            6.   The fill or structure cannot obstruct a drainage way leading
to the floodplain.
            7.   The grading around the excavation must be such that the
excavated area is accessible to the regulatory floodwater.
            8.   The fill or structure must be of a material deemed stable
enough to remain firm and in place during periods of flooding and must include
provisions to protect adjacent property owners against any increased runoff or
drainage resulting from its placement. When a structure is placed on fill it
must follow additional requirements of division (F)(4)(d) and(5)(d).
            9.   Plans depicting the areas to be excavated and filled must be
submitted prior to the actual start of construction or any site work; once site
work is complete, but before the actual start of construction, the applicant
provides to the Floodplain Administrator a certified survey of the excavation
and fill sites demonstrating the fill and excavation comply with this section.
      (3)   Specific standards - building protection requirement. In addition
to the general standards described in division (F)(2), structures to be located
in the SFHA must be protected from flood damage below the FPG. This building
protection requirement applies to the following situations:
         (a)   Construction or placement of a residential structure;
         (b)   Construction or placement of a nonresidential structure;
         (c)   Addition or improvement made to an existing structure where the
cost of the addition or improvement equals or exceeds 50% of the value of the
existing structure (excluding the value of the land). An addition and/or
improvement project that is continuous in scope or time is considered as one
project for permitting purposes;
         (d)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged structure where the
costs of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure (excluding the value of the
land) before damage occurred (the costs of any proposed additions or
improvements beyond restoring the damaged structure to its before damaged
condition must be included in the cost);
         (e)   Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site
for more than 180 days;
         (f)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a repetitive loss structure;
         (g)   Addition or improvement made to any existing structure with a
previous repair, addition or improvement constructed since the community's
first floodplain ordinance.
      (4)   Specific standards - residential construction.
         (a)   New construction or substantial improvement of any residential
structures must meet provisions described in division (F)(1) and applicable
general standards described in division (F)(2).

raised-slab-on-grade, and slab-on-stem-wall-with-fill) must be backfilled with
compacted structural fill, concrete, or gravel that supports the floor slab. No
flood openings are required for this type of construction.
      (5)   Specific standards - non-residential construction.
         (a)   New construction or substantial improvement of any non-
residential structures (excludes accessory structures) must meet provisions
described in Article 5, Section A and applicable general standards described in
division (F)(2).
         (b)   In Zone A and Zone AE, new construction, or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(excludes accessory structures) must either have the lowest floor, including
basement and, elevated to or above the FPG or be floodproofed to or above the
FPG. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure,
openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters must
be provided in accordance with the standards of division (F)(5)(c). Should fill
be used to elevate a structure, the standards of division (F)(5)(d) must be
met.
         (c)   Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior

§ 154.037 ARTERIAL CORRIDOR OVERLAY.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The Comprehensive Plan identifies certain arterial
roadways as important gateways and areas of economic opportunity. Additionally,
these streets serve a vital traffic carrying function for Bargersville and
surrounding communities. The intent of the Arterial Corridor Overlay District
is to establish specific requirements to preserve roadway capacity and safety;
ensure that development does not inhibit future improvements to these roadways;
minimize individual driveway access; protect property values along the
corridors; promote economic development; minimize distractions and establish a
high quality and inviting image at the entrances to the community.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   Boundaries. The Arterial Corridor Overlay District applies to all
property along the entire length and within 500 feet of the centerline on
either side of SR 135, SR 37, and CR 144. If any parcel, building, structure,
or improvement is only partially located within the overlay district, then the
provisions of this overlay apply to the entire parcel, building, structure, or
improvement, unless otherwise waived by the Plan Commission.
      (2)   Relation to underlying district. The requirements of this district
amend and supersede those imposed on the same lands by the underlying
districts.
      (3)   Regulated development. The regulations of this overlay district
apply in the circumstances cited below.
         (a)   Construction of any new building or structure;
         (b)   Enlargement or expansion of any existing non-residential
building or structure by more than 20% of its gross floor area;
         (c)   Proposed subdivision of land for non-residential uses; or
         (d)   Proposed construction or expansion of a parking lot by more than
five spaces.
Farms and single-family homes are exempt from these regulations unless there is
a change in use to a non-farm or non-single-family use.
      (4)   The BZA determines if the standards of this overlay apply to the
entire lot or if they may be limited to only improvements proposed after the
effective date of this chapter. The following factors are considered:
         (a)   The extent and location of the proposed improvements (e.g.,
buildings, parking, landscaping, drainage, etc.) on the parcel.
         (b)   The extent of conflicts in applying the standards of this
overlay with existing and/or planned improvements.
   (C)   Uses. All uses permitted in the underlying zoning district are
permitted except the following uses, that are prohibited within the overlay:
      (1)   Adult businesses;
      (2)   Bulk storage of petroleum items not used for on-site manufacturing;
      (3)   Manufacture, use, or storage of explosives;
      (4)   Manufactured home park;
      (5)   Manufactured home sales;
      (6)   Off-premise signage;
      (7)   Penal or correctional institution;
      (8)   Retail sales, service and repair, special handling;
      (9)   Salvage and wrecking;
      (10)   Sanitary landfill;
      (11)   Self-storage facility;
      (12)   Slaughterhouse or rendering plants.
   (D)   Spatial requirements. The minimum requirements for lot area, width,
height, and setbacks for the underlying district apply, except as modified in
Table 2-1.

Notes:
1   Front setbacks along SR 135 are measured from a point 65 feet from the
centerline of the street.
2   Parking refers to areas devoted to parking, drive aisles, loading
facilities, vehicle maneuvering areas, and pads for trash enclosures. Entry
drives into the site from the abutting street(s) or driveways/access streets
connecting to adjoining properties may cross this setback area.
3   Where a side or rear yard in a non-residential district abuts a
residential use in a residential district, the parking and building setbacks
must be increased to a minimum of 25 feet.
 
   (E)   Site design standards.
      (1)   Landscaping. In addition to the landscape requirements of §§
154.110 to
154.113, the area between the right-of-way line and the parking or building
setback line, as applicable, must meet the following requirements:
         (a)   Trees must be planted at a rate of at least one tree per 20
linear feet of street frontage. At least 20% of the required trees must be
evergreens. No more than 30% of any one species can be used.
         (b)   Shrubs must be planted at a rate of at least one shrub per ten
linear feet of street frontage. The shrub species used must have a mature
height of at least 48 inches. At least 20% of the required shrubs must be
evergreens. No more than 30% of any one species can be used.
         (c)   Clustering of trees and shrubs is encouraged. All areas not
containing trees or planter areas must be covered with grass or other living
groundcover. To the extent practical, all plant material should be native plant
species.
         (d)   Existing vegetation may be counted toward the requirements of §
154.110(D)(10).
         (e)   Detention/retention areas are permitted within the landscape
area if they do not hamper the effectiveness of the screening provided by the
landscaping. To the extent possible, detention/retention areas should have a
natural shape and be integrated with the landscape design.
      (2)   Signs. In addition to the signage requirements of §§
154.110 to
154.113, within the overlay freestanding signs are limited to ground signs with
a maximum height of six feet. The area surrounding the base of the sign must be
landscaped with shrubs, ground cover and/or other materials that complement the
sign but do not obstruct visibility of the sign or vehicles entering or exiting
adjacent driveways. Electronic changeable message signs may be contained within
the ground sign, in accordance with the applicable requirements of §§
154.110 to
154.113.
      (3)   Lighting. Site lighting should be of cohesive design, materials,
and color throughout the site. Light standards cannot exceed the building
height, or 25 feet, whichever is less. When light standards are within 90 feet
of a residential use or district, they cannot exceed a height of 15 feet. All
lighting must use concealed or shielded light fixtures.
      (4)   Parking. All parking requirements of §§
154.110 to
154.113 must be met. No more than 20% of all parking spaces may be located
within the front yard. All other parking must be in the side or rear yard.
However, if a frontage road connecting to the adjoining properties on either
side of the subject site is constructed in the front yard parallel to the
arterial street, all required parking may be placed in the front yard, if a
landscape greenbelt at least 15 feet wide is provided between the parking area
and the frontage road (see §
154.110(G)).
      (5)   Other site design requirements.
         (a)   Outdoor storage may be permitted after special exception
approval, if allowed within the underlying zoning district. The outdoor storage
area must be in the rear yard and must be screened on all sides with a solid
fence, wall, or landscaping (see §
154.110(H)).
         (b)   Loading and unloading areas are prohibited in any yard abutting
a street. Loading docks cannot face a street and must be screened to block
views from any adjacent street or residential district (see §
154.110(H)).
   (F)   Building design standards. The requirements of this section apply to
all residential and non-residential buildings within the Arterial Corridor
Overlay District, except single and two-family dwellings that are regulated by
§
154.147.
      (1)   The following exterior materials are permitted within the overlay:
brick, masonry, stone, glass curtain walls or glass block, or exposed
aggregate, bush-hammered, sand blasted or similarly finished concrete
(including precast concrete panels).
      (2)   At least three exterior materials, colors, or patterns are used on
a building facade.
      (3)   Doors, windows, or other architectural features must be used to
break large wall planes into smaller components. Building facades oriented to
and visible from an adjacent right-of-way cannot have unbroken wall planes
longer than 30% of the length of the facade.
      (4)   Permitted roofing materials include architectural shingles,
standing seam metal, and rubber membrane (flat roofs only).
      (5)   Pitched roofs must have a minimum pitch of 4 (vertical units): 12
(horizontal units). Flat roofs are permitted if they are surrounded by a
parapet in proportion to the supporting walls that conceals roofmounted
mechanical equipment.
      (6)   Rooftop equipment, excluding vents and stairwell accesses, visible
at ground level from the centerline of abutting public right-of-way, must be
screened from view through use of parapet walls, screens, or other building
elements or design features.
      (7)   Drive-through service windows must be placed on the side or rear
building facades.
      (8)   Entrances to service bays for vehicle repair businesses must be
oriented away from view of any arterial street. Vehicle repair and service uses
must take place within a fully enclosed area of the building.
      (9)   Chain-link fences and unpainted or unfinished block walls are
prohibited. Walls and fences visible at ground level from a public right-of-way
or an adjacent parcel must be architecturally finished (i.e., brick, wood, or
textured concrete masonry units).
      (10)   Properties with multiple tenants or multiple structures must
provide pedestrian connections between tenants and structures via walks or
paths at least five feet wide. Where applicable, walks or paths must align with
and connect to adjacent properties.
   (G)   Access management standards.
      (1)   All driveways serving attached single-family, multi-family,
commercial, office, institutional or industrial uses ("commercial driveways"),
must comply with the requirements of this section.
      (2)   Driveway locations must minimize interference with the free
movement of traffic, provide adequate sight distance, and provide the most
favorable driveway grade.
      (3)   Driveways must be located entirely within the frontage of the
premises unless otherwise approved by the town or INDOT, as applicable.
Driveways, turn lanes, or acceleration/deceleration lanes located on adjoining
property will not be approved unless the property containing these improvements
is dedicated as public right-of-way
      (5)    The minimum spacing between a commercial driveway and another
commercial driveway or street intersection within the overlay is based upon
posted speed limits along the parcel frontage. The minimum spacing indicated in
Table 2-2. is measured from centerline to centerline of the driveways.
Table 2-2: Minimum Commercial Driveway Spacing
Posted Speed Limit (mph) Arterial Street Collector or Local Street
Table 2-2: Minimum Commercial Driveway Spacing
Posted Speed Limit (mph) Arterial Street Collector or Local Street
25                       130 ft.         90 ft.
30                       185 ft.         120 ft.
35                       245 ft.         150 ft.
40                       300 ft.         185 ft.
45                       350 ft.         230 ft.
50                       395 ft.         275 ft.
55                       435 ft.         300 ft.
 
      (5)   To reduce left-turn conflicts, new commercial driveways must be
aligned with those across the street, where possible. If alignment is not
possible, driveways must be offset from those on the opposite side of the
street a minimum of 250 feet along arterial streets and 150 feet along
collector and local streets. These standards may be reduced by the Plan
Commission where there is insufficient frontage and shared access with an
adjacent site is not feasible. Longer offsets may be required depending on the
expected inbound left-turn volumes of the driveways.
      (6)   In the case of expansion, alteration, or redesign of an existing
driveway where it can be demonstrated that preexisting conditions prohibit
adherence to the minimum spacing standards, the Plan Commission may modify the
driveway spacing requirements. Modifications should be the minimum relief
necessary. Spacing of a full-access driveway cannot be less than 75 feet,
measured centerline to centerline.
      (7)   The number of commercial driveways serving a single property is the
minimum number necessary to provide reasonable access and access for emergency
vehicles, while preserving traffic operations and safety along the public
street.
      (8)   Access must be provided for each separately owned parcel. Access
may be via an individual driveway, shared driveway, or service drive. More than
one driveway may be permitted for property if:
         (a)   It has continuous frontage sufficient to satisfy the spacing
requirements of
Table 2-2;
         (b)   The Plan Commission determines additional access can be provided
without compromising traffic operations along the public street; and
         (c)   The Plan Commission determines there are no other reasonable
access alternatives such as: shared driveways, connected parking lots, frontage
roads, frontage roads or other alternate access routes.
      (9)   Commercial driveways must be designed according to the standards of
the Town of Bargersville or INDOT, as applicable.
      (10)   For high traffic generators or commercial driveways along streets
experiencing or expected to experience congestion, the Plan Commission may
require two egress lanes to provide separate right and left turns out of the
site.
      (11)   Where a boulevard entrance is proposed by the applicant or
required by the Plan Commission, a curbed island must separate the ingress and
egress lanes. The entrance must be designed to accommodate the largest vehicle
to use the driveway. The island must have a minimum area of 180 square feet.
      (12)   Where noted above or where the Plan Commission determines reducing
the number of access points is beneficial while preserving the property owner's
right to reasonable access, a shared commercial driveway, or frontage road
connecting two or more properties or uses may be required. Frontage roads may
be required near existing traffic signals or at locations having potential for
future signalization and along street segments with a relatively high number of
crashes or limited sight distance.
      (13)   Shared commercial driveways and frontage roads must be within
right-of-way or a recorded access easement. A draft of the access easement must
be provided to the Plan Commission for review and approval prior to approval
and recording.
      (14)   The Plan Commission may allow temporary access for up to 18 months
where the frontage road is not completed if a financial guarantee is provided
assuring the elimination of the temporary access upon completion of the
frontage road (see §
154.161). Building permits cannot be issued until the financial guarantee has
been submitted.
      (15)   Frontage roads are generally parallel to the front property line
and may be located either in front of, adjacent to, or behind principal
buildings. In considering the most appropriate alignment for a frontage road,
the Plan Commission considers the setbacks of existing buildings and
anticipated traffic flow for the site. The frontage road should be placed away
from the arterial to provide safe, efficient traffic flow and operation. The
distance between the roadway traffic and the first internal movement must meet
the minimum requirements shown in Table 2-3. For sites with high volumes or
heavy truck traffic located on high volume roadways, the required distance may
be increased to avoid interference with the arterial traffic flow. If no other
design alternatives exist, the Plan Commission may permit lesser separation
distances if a right-in/right-out entrance is used. Interior driveways must
accommodate at least 100 feet of vehicle stacking.
 
Table 2-3: Interior Separation of Frontage Road from Arterial
Lot Depth            Min. Required Distance
More than 1,000 ft.  200 ft.
500 ft. to 1,000 ft. At least 20% of lot depth
Less than 500 ft.    100 ft.
 
      (16)   Access easement. If not located within public right-of-way, the
frontage road must be within an access easement at least 40 feet wide
permitting traffic circulation between properties. The access easement must
meet the requirements of §
154.152(E).
      (17)   Construction standards. Frontage roads must have a curb and gutter
and be constructed per the town standards for public streets, except a frontage
road may have a minimum pavement width of 24 feet.
      (18)   Parking. The frontage road is intended exclusively for circulation
and not as a parking maneuvering aisle. The Plan Commission may require the
posting of "no parking" signs along the frontage road. In reviewing the site
plan, the Plan Commission may permit temporary parking in the easement area
where a continuous frontage road is not yet available if the layout allows
removal of the parking for the future extension of the frontage road.
      (19)   Access to frontage road. The Plan Commission approves the location
of all access points to the frontage road based on the driveway spacing
standards listed in
Table 2-2.
      (20)   Elevation. The required site plan must indicate the proposed
elevation of the frontage road at the property line. The town maintains a
record of all frontage road elevations so their grades can be coordinated. Once
constructed, the elevation of the frontage road must be provided to the town
for its records (see §
154.141).
      (21)   Landscaping. The area between a frontage road and the public
right-of-way must be landscaped as specified in §
154.110(F).
      (22)   Maintenance. Each property owner is responsible for maintenance of
the easement and frontage road.

§ 154.038 I-69 INTERCHANGE OVERLAY.
   (A)   General provisions.
      (1)   Purpose and intent. The Comprehensive Plan identifies the I-69
interchange as an important gateway into the town. The intent of the I-69
Corridor Overlay District is to establish specific requirements to promote
economic development opportunities offered by the interstate and establish a
high quality and inviting image at this entrance to the community.
      (2)   Character descriptions. Overall, the property covered by the I-69
Overlay District serves as a prominent gateway into Bargersville. Development
within the overlay should include well-designed roadways, gateway signage, and
cohesive signage, lighting, landscaping, and building styles and uses.
Technology industries, medical or research-based businesses, and office uses
are preferred. Business incubators, coworking spaces, or small maker spaces are
also appropriate here. Mixed-use developments should integrate commercial,
retail, and residential uses with open space. The property within the I-69
Interchange Overlay is categorized into five areas with distinct character.
         (a)   Area A is located west of I-69. This area is characterized by a
mix of technology-focused light industrial, office, and retail uses. Technology
manufacturing, research and development, and headquarters facilities are
encouraged in this area. Some retail use is anticipated near the CR 144
interchange.
         (b)   Area B is located immediately east of I-69 both north and south
of CR 144. This area is characterized by retail uses with a focus on higher end
destination retail with a regional focus, such as restaurants, hotels, and
regional shopping centers. The northeast quadrant of Area B may be developed
for medical/institutional uses.
         (c)   Area C is located east of Area B, north of CR 144. This area is
characterized by a mix of retail and mixed-density residential uses. Retail and
commercial uses should occur in nodes at major intersections and consist of
uses that serve the surrounding residential uses, such as small grocery stores,
offices, clinics, and other neighborhood-oriented retail and commercial uses.
Residential uses should consist of townhomes and apartments closer to CR 144
transitioning to lower density residential uses abutting the existing
residential uses.
         (d)   Area D is located east of Area B, south of CR 144. This area is
characterized by a mix of retail, mixed-density residential, and office uses.
The retail uses of Area B will extend into Area D and transition to office and
residential uses. Higher residential densities for townhomes and apartments are
expected near CR 144 and transition to lower density residential uses moving
south toward existing residential uses.
         (e)   Area E is located south of Area B and west of Area D. This area
is characterized by a mix of technical industry and office uses near I-69 and
transitioning to mixed-density residential uses and to low-density residential
uses moving south toward existing residential uses.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   Boundaries. The boundaries of the I-69 Interchange Overlay and its
areas are illustrated on the Official Zoning Map.
      (2)   Relation to underlying district. The requirements of this district
amend and supersede those imposed on the same lands by the underlying districts
and the Arterial Corridor Overlay.
      (3)   Regulated development. The regulations of this overlay district
apply in the following circumstances (individual single-family homes are exempt
from these regulations):
         (a)   Construction of any new building or structure;
         (b)   Enlargement or expansion of any existing non-residential
building or structure by more than 20% of its gross floor area; or
         (c)   Proposed subdivisions of land.
      (4)   The BZA determines if the standards of this overlay apply to the
entire lot or if they may be limited to only improvements proposed after the
effective date of this chapter. The following factors are considered:
         (a)   The extent and location of the proposed improvements (e.g.,
buildings, parking, landscaping, drainage, etc.) on the parcel.
         (b)   The extent of conflicts in applying the standards of this
overlay with existing and/or planned improvements.
   (C)   Approval process. Due to the integrated, mixed-use nature of this
district, proposed developments are approved as planned unit developments (PUD)
(see §
154.180(F)). Proposed PUDs must be at least 20 acres in size. Plats and site
plans following an approved PUD do not have a size limitation. Design review
approval is required for all proposed developments within this overlay
district.
   (D)   Uses. All uses permitted in the underlying zoning district are
permitted except as otherwise excluded or prohibited below.
      (1)   Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited uses within the
I-69 Corridor Overlay District:
         (a)   Adult businesses;
         (b)   Bulk storage of petroleum items not used for on-site
manufacturing;
         (c)   Manufacture, use, or storage of explosives;
         (d)   Manufactured home park;
         (e)   Manufactured home sales;
         (f)   Off-premise signage;
         (g)   Penal or correctional institution;
         (h)   Retail sales, service and repair, special handling;
         (i)   Salvage and wrecking;
         (j)   Sanitary landfill;
         (k)   Self-storage facility;
         (l)   Slaughterhouse or rendering plants;
         (m)   Truck stops.
      (2)   Preferred uses. Uses within a proposed PUD should align with the
uses associated with the character descriptions in division (A)(2) above.
   (E)   Spatial requirements. The spatial requirements specified in the
Arterial Corridor Overlay District apply to all parcels within the I-69
Interchange Overlay District regardless of their distance from CR 144.
   (F)   Site design standards. The site design standards specified in the
Arterial Corridor Overlay District apply to all parcels within the I-69
Interchange Overlay District regardless of their distance from CR 144.
   (G)   Building design standards. The building design standards specified in
the Arterial Corridor Overlay District apply to all parcels within the I-69
Interchange Overlay District regardless of their distance from CR 144.
   (H)   Access management standards. See §
154.037(G).
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.039 PERMITTED USES.
   (A)   Applicability. Buildings, structures, or land must only be used in a
manner permitted in the zoning districts where they are located. Buildings or
structures must be erected, reconstructed, or structurally altered in
compliance with this chapter.
   (B)   Land use specified. Each land use is classified as a permitted, not
permitted, or a special exception use for each zoning district in the use
tables of this chapter (the "Use Table") or elsewhere in this chapter.
   (C)   Special exception uses. A special exception use requires a greater
degree of review because of its potential impact upon the immediate
neighborhood and the community. The BZA reviews a special exception petition's
characteristics and impacts to determine its suitability in each location for
those Zoning Districts in which it is permitted. Special exception approval is
subject to a public hearing and review by the BZA (see §
154.180(H)).
   (D)   Unlisted or questionable land uses. If a land use is not specifically
listed on the Permitted Use Table, the Administrator determines the land use
classification of the use. This determination is appealable to the BZA (see §
154.180(C)).
   (E)   Primary use classifications, categories and specific use types.
      (1)   Primary use classifications. All primary land uses in the Permitted
Use Table are organized into one of the following five general land use
classifications:
         (a)   Residential uses;
         (a)   Civic, public and institutional uses;
         (b)   Commercial sales, service and repair uses;
         (c)   Industrial, manufacturing and wholesale uses;
         (d)   Agriculture.
      (2)   Primary use categories and specific use types. Primary uses are
further organized into use categories and specific use types under each general
classification. The Permitted Use Table is organized into the above five
general land use classifications, use categories and specific use types.
      (3)   Classifications and categories are mutually exclusive. The general
land use classifications and use categories listed in the Permitted Use Table
are mutually exclusive. For example, the use "Lodging Accommodations," cannot
be classified in a different use category, such as "Group Living," unless
otherwise expressly allowed by this chapter.
   (F)   Explanation of table cell entries. Each of the cells on the Permitted
Use Table indicates whether a use is permitted or not and what limitations
apply to the specific use. Items listed in the Use Limitations column refer to
conditions for a specific use (see §
154.040).
      (1)   Permitted use ("P"). A "P" in a table cell indicates the use is
permitted in the respective zone district and subject to compliance with the
use limitations referenced in the second column of the Permitted Use Table (Use
Limitation Notes).
      (2)   Use not permitted (blank cell). A blank table cell indicates the
use is not permitted in the zone district.
      (3)   Use subject to special exception review ("S"). An "S" in a table
cell indicates the use is generally appropriate in the neighborhood context and
zone district. Special exception uses may have the potential for limited
impacts on adjacent properties or on the established character of the
neighborhood context or zone district. "S" uses are subject to BZA public
hearing according to special exception review, which grants the BZA the
authority to impose conditions on the specified use to mitigate any potential
impacts. Such uses must comply with any applicable use limitations noted in the
condition column of the Permitted Use Table Use Limitation Notes), as well as
the review criteria stated in §
154.180.

§ 154.042 USE DESCRIPTIONS.
   (A)   Residential primary uses.
      (1)   Household living.
         (a)   Dwelling, single-family detached: standard. A single-family
detached dwelling: standard is a detached structure on a medium or large-size
lot containing one dwelling unit. It is typically located within a primarily
single-family neighborhood. This type is the most common type found in
Bargersville. Typically, this building type has a front-load garage, but side-
load garages are possible on corner lots or wider lots and rear-load garages
are possible on lots abutting an alley.

         (b)   Dwelling, single-family detached: compact. A single-family
detached dwelling: compact is a detached structure on a small lot containing
one dwelling unit. It is typically located within a primarily single-family
neighborhood in a walkable urban setting. This building type enables
appropriately scaled, well-designed higher densities, provides a broad choice
of housing types, and promotes walkability. Typically, this building type has a
rear-load garage, but front-load garages are possible if the garage is recessed
well behind the front facade of the house. It is important that the front
facade of this building type not be dominated by garage doors.

         (c)   Dwelling - duplex. A duplex dwelling is a small to medium-size
structure that consists of two side-by-side or stacked dwelling units, both
facing the street, and within a single building massing. This type has the
appearance of a medium to large single-family home and is appropriately scaled
to it within primarily single-family residential neighborhoods or medium-
density residential neighborhoods. It enables appropriately scaled, well-
designed higher densities, provides a broad choice of housing types, and
promotes walkability. Both units may be on one lot, or the lot can be split so
each unit is on its own lot.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1005.png]
 
         (d)   Dwelling - bungalow court. A bungalow court consists of a series
of small, detached structures, providing multiple units arranged on a single
lot to define a shared court that is typically perpendicular to the street. The
shared court takes the place of a private backyard and becomes an important
community-enhancing element of this type. This type is appropriately scaled to
it within primarily single-family or medium-density neighborhoods. It enables
appropriately scaled, well-designed higher densities, provides a broad choice
of housing types, and promotes walkability. Parking is typically located along
an alley at the rear of the lot.

         (e)   Dwelling - townhouse. A townhouse is a small to medium-size
typically attached structure that consists of two to eight townhouses placed
side by side. This type may also occasionally be detached with minimal
separations between the buildings. This type is typically located within
medium-density residential neighborhoods or in a location that transitions from
a primarily single-family residential neighborhood into a neighborhood main
street. This type enables appropriately scaled, well-designed higher densities,
provides a broad choice of housing types, and promotes walkability.

§ 154.077 WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEMS AS ACCESSORY USES.
   (A)   Wind energy conversion systems (WECS) are a permitted accessory use in
all zoning districts, subject to the requirements of this article. Wind energy
conversion systems do not count toward the maximum number of accessory
structures permitted. Most of the energy produced by an accessory WECS should
be consumed only on the property where it is located.
   (B)   As accessory uses WECS must be:
      (1)   Installed on a certified tubular free-standing tower, a lattice
tower, or a monopole tower. Towers may be guyed or self-supporting;
      (2)   Filtered, shielded, or otherwise designed and constructed to not
cause electro-magnetic interference;
      (3)   Grounded to protect against lightning strikes;
      (4)   Designed with automatic over speed control to render the system
inoperable when winds are blowing at higher speeds than the machine's
capability;
      (5)   Equipped with a redundant breaking system, including both
aerodynamic over speed controls and mechanical breaks. Mechanical brakes must
be operated in a fail-safe mode. Stall regulation is not a sufficient braking
system for over speed protection.
   (C)   The WECS owner and operator must make reasonable efforts to minimize
shadow flicker to any occupied building on a non-participating landowner's
property.
   (D)   A WECS must be setback from property lines at least 120% of the total
height of the WECS.
   (E)   A WECS must comply with the maximum height limitation for the zoning
district where it is located.
   (F)   WECS must be white, light gray, or another non-obtrusive color. Blades
may be black to facilitate de-icing. Finishes must be matte or non-reflective
and meet Federal Aviation Administration color requirements. No advertising or
signage is allowed on a WECS.
   (G)   A WECS requires an improvement location permit. The permit application
includes a site plan and a description of the project addressing: the number
and type of turbines, generating capacity, tower design and height, blade arc
diameter, total height, means of connection with the electrical grid, potential
equipment manufacturers, and all related accessory structures. The
manufacturer's engineer or another qualified professional engineer must certify
that the turbine, foundation, and tower design are within accepted professional
standards given local soil and climate conditions.
   (H)   Electric WECS components must have an Underwriters Laboratory (UL) or
equivalent listing.
   (I)   Wind energy conversion systems require approval of local building code
officials, consistent with the State of Indiana Building Code.
   (J)   For grid-tied WECS, the interconnection application must be submitted
to the utility prior to applying for required town permits. The WECS must be
designed to meet the utility's requirements for interconnection and operation.
Automatic and a manual controls that render the system inoperable in case of
loss of utility power is required. Off-grid systems are exempt from these
requirements.
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.078 WIND ENERGY CONVERSION AS A PRIMARY USE.
   The town permits the development of commercial wind energy conversion
systems (WECS) where they present few land use conflicts with current and
future development patterns.
   (A)   As a primary use WECS must meet the requirements below.
      (1)   WECS must conform to all industry standards. The applicant must
submit certificates the wind turbine manufacturers have obtained from
Underwriters Laboratories or an equivalent third party.
      (2)   WECS must be:
         (a)   Installed on a certified tubular free-standing tower, a lattice
tower, or a monopole tower. Towers may be guyed or self-supporting;
         (b)   Filtered, shielded, or otherwise designed and constructed to not
cause electromagnetic interference;
         (c)   Grounded to protect against lightning strikes;
         (d)   Designed with automatic over speed control to render the system
inoperable when winds are blowing at higher speeds than the machine's
capability;
         (e)   Equipped with a redundant breaking system, including both
aerodynamic over speed controls and mechanical breaks. Mechanical brakes must
be operated in a fail-safe mode. Stall regulation is not a sufficient braking
system for over speed protection;
         (f)   Designed with and automatic and manual control that will render
the system inoperable in case of loss of utility power to prevent the WECS from
supplying power to a de-energized electrical distribution grid;
         (g)   Designed to meet the requirements for interconnection and
operation as mandated by the utility managing the electrical grid where the
WECS is connecting. All structures, substations, feeder lines, facilities, and
accessory equipment must comply with the National Electrical Code and operate
per the electrical utility's service regulations applicable to WECS.
      (3)   Outside of a primary structure, the sound pressure levels from a
WECS component must not exceed 32 decibels on the "A" weighted scale. This
level may only be exceeded during short-term events such as utility outages or
severe windstorms.
      (4)   The WECS owner and operator must make reasonable efforts to
minimize shadow flicker to any occupied building on a non-participating
landowner's property.
      (5)   All lighting, including lighting intensity and frequency of strobe,
must adhere to but not exceed the requirements established by the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) permits and regulations. Except for lighting
required by the FAA, lighting must be shielded so that no glare extends beyond
the WECS.
      (6)   At least 20 feet of clearance is required between the ground and
the lowest point of the arc of any protruding blades utilized on a WECS. This
minimum clearance may be increased to provide additional clearance where
oversized vehicles may travel.
      (7)   The maximum tower height and maximum total height cannot exceed the
maximum height permitted by the FAA.
      (8)   Wind turbines must be setback from property lines and rights-of-way
at least 120% of the total height of the structure. A minimum separation of
2,640 feet is required between a wind turbine and any non-applicant primary
building. No new structure may be constructed within 800 feet of a wind turbine
unless this requirement is waived by the Plan Commission upon a determination
that the structure will not affect the WECS performance. Accessory structures
associated with the WECS must meet the setbacks for primary structures for the
zoning district where they are located.
      (9)   WECS must be white, light gray, or another non-obtrusive color.
Blades may be black to facilitate deicing. Finishes must be matte or non-
reflective and meet Federal Aviation Administration color requirements. No
advertising or signage is allowed on a WECS.
      (10)   For all guyed towers, visible and reflective objects (such as
plastic sleeves, reflectors, or tape) are required on the guy wire anchor
points and along the outer- and innermost guy wires to a height at least eight
feet above the finish grade.
   (B)   WECS are subject to the town's stormwater management, erosion, and
sediment control provisions and nonpoint pollution discharge elimination system
(NPDES) permit requirements and all applicable local, state, and federal
regulatory codes, including the State of Indiana Uniform Building Code, as
amended, and the National Electric Code, as amended.
   (C)   Site plan approval required. A WECS requires site plan approval by the
Plan Commission. In addition to the site plan requirements of §
154.180(G), the application must include a description of the project
addressing: the number and type of turbines, generating capacity, tower design
and height, blade arc diameter, total height, means of connection with the
electrical grid, potential equipment manufacturers, and all related accessory
structures. The site plan must show the location of all underground utility
lines associated with the WECS project. The manufacturer's engineer or another
qualified professional engineer must certify that the turbine, foundation, and
tower design are within accepted professional standards given local soil and
climate conditions. If there is an existing WECS within one mile of the
proposed WECS, a description of the potential impacts on the existing WECS and
wind resources on adjacent properties is required.
   (D)   Several WECS projects may be submitted as a single application and
reviewed under joint proceedings, including notices, hearings, reviews, and
approvals.
   (E)   Modification. Any physical modification to a WECS that alters the
mechanical load, mechanical load path, or major electrical components requires
new site plan approval prior to making any physical modifications. Like-kind
replacements are considered maintenance and do not require site plan approval.
   (F)   Decommissioning. A decommissioning plan is required to ensure that
facilities are properly removed after their useful life.
      (1)   Decommissioning of the system occurs if the project does not
produce power for 12 consecutive months. An owner may petition for an extension
of this period upon showing of reasonable circumstances causing the delay in
the start of decommissioning.
      (2)   The decommissioning plan identifies provisions for removing all
structures and foundations to a depth of 48 inches, restoring soil and
vegetation, and assurances that financial resources will be available to fully
decommission the site.
      (3)   The Plan Commission or Administrator may require the posting of a
bond, letter of credit, or other financial surety to ensure proper
decommissioning.

      (1)   Installation of new antenna. The installation of new antennas on
existing towers, including legal nonconforming towers, and existing alternative
structures (such as water towers, buildings, or church steeples) may be
approved by the Administrator subject to all requirements of this section. Any
new antenna that will add either 10% or 25 feet, whichever is less, above the
highest point of any existing tower or alternative structure is subject to the
provisions of this article for the installation of new towers.
      (2)   Installation of a new tower. The installation of any new tower is
reviewed as a special exception use by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (3)   Installation of new accessory structures. The installation of new
accessory structures, such as equipment buildings, to support the installation
of additional antennas on existing towers, or alternative structures may be
approved by the Administrator.
   (B)   Removal. Any tower unused or left abandoned for 12 consecutive months
must be removed by the property owner at his or her expense. Regardless of the
tower ownership, the property owner is responsible for removal. Upon the
request of the Administrator, the operator of any facility to which this
section applies must provide documentation of the use of that facility for the
purpose of verifying any abandonment.
   (C)   Interference with public safety facilities. No new wireless
communications facilities or tower will result in any interference with public
safety telecommunications.
   (D)   Required documentation for all facilities. In addition to the
requirements provided in this chapter for receipt of special exception use
approval, applications for new towers, new antenna, and new related facilities
must include the following. Where the equipment is mounted on an existing
building, the comparable information for that structure shall be provided.
      (1)   Engineer's report. A report from a professional engineer licensed
in the State of Indiana that:
         (a)   Describes the height and design of any new tower and/or antenna

and all other appropriate state and federal agencies.
      (4)   Removal affidavit. A letter committing all parties, including the
property owner and his or her successors, to remove the tower and all related
accessory structures, fences, landscaping, and equipment if the tower is
abandoned (unused for 12 consecutive months). The removal affidavit must be
recorded in the Office of the Johnson County Recorder, with a copy of the
recorded affidavit provided to the Administrator.
   (E)   Determination of new tower need. Any proposal for a new
telecommunications tower will only be approved if the applicant submits
verification from a professional engineer licensed in the State of Indiana
stating the antennas planned for the proposed tower cannot be accommodated on
any existing or approved towers or other structures within a two-mile radius of
the proposed tower location due to one or more of the following reasons:
      (1)   Inadequate structural capacity. The antennas would exceed the
structural capacity of the existing or approved tower or other structure.
      (2)   Interference. The antennas would cause interference impacting the
usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower site.
      (3)   Inadequate height. The existing or approved towers or structures
within the search radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at the height
necessary.
      (4)   Land availability. Additional land area is not available (when

width. Any portion of the entrance located in a public right-of-way must meet
the applicable public street or road design, construction, and pavement
requirements of the jurisdiction responsible for that street.
      (2)   Site area. The lot (or lease area) where the tower is located must
be large enough to accommodate all future anticipated accessory structures
needed by future antenna users. The size of the site must also sufficient to
allow the location of one additional tower and associated support facilities.
         (a)   The arrangement of the initial tower and the topography of the
site is considered in determining the sufficiency of the site area.
         (b)   The width of the tower site cannot be less than the height of
the tower and the depth of the tower site cannot be less than the tower height.
The tower must be placed within the property, so it is no closer to any lot
line than 50% of the tower height.
         (c)   All tower supporting and stabilizing wires must be located
within the site area.
      (3)   Setback. The required setbacks for related accessory facilities are
as follows:
         (a)   Side and rear setback. The minimum side and rear setback for all
buildings and related facilities, including the security fence is 25 feet.
         (b)   Front setback. The minimum front setback for all buildings and
related facilities is as specified by this chapter for the zoning district
where it is located. No part of a wireless telecommunications facility,
including the security fence, and any required guide wires or bracing is
permitted in any required front setback.
         (c)   Additional setback from residential zoning districts. No tower
may be placed closer than 150% of the total height of the tower or 200 feet,
whichever is greater, to any surrounding property in a residential district.
         (d)   Additional landscaping. Landscape screening may be provided in
the setback area.
      (4)   Encroachment. No part of any telecommunications facility nor
associated lines, cables, equipment, wires, or braces may extend across or over
any part of a public right-of-way, sidewalk, or property line.
      (5)   Fencing. An eight-foot-high security fence must surround the tower
and accessory equipment building site. Barbed wire, concertina wire, or
sharpened stakes, if used, must be at least six feet above grade. An area ten
feet in width must remain outside of the fence for the purpose of providing the
landscape screening described below.
   (H)   Landscape screening. In addition to the landscaping required in §
154.110, evergreen buffer plantings must be located and maintained around the
outermost perimeter of the security fence of all wireless communications
facilities. The landscape plan for the site must provide plants in number and
design to provide a screen of the fence, all equipment, and the base of the
tower, as determined by the Board of Zoning Appeals. A combination of trees and
shrubs is encouraged. The maximum spacing of evergreen shrubs is five feet on
center. The maximum spacing of evergreen trees is ten feet on center.

building setback.
   (E)   Where two or more lots entirely or partially within 200 feet of a
subject lot, on the same side of the street and on the same block, are occupied
by principal buildings whose existing front setback is less than required by
the zoning district, the average of the established setbacks for those
buildings shall be the minimum required front setback for the subject lot.
   (F)   Building setback lines established in a recorded subdivision establish
the setback of buildings in such subdivisions, except when such building
setback lines may be less restrictive than provided in this chapter.
   (G)   On through lots, the front yard is established by the existing
principal buildings in the block.
   (H)   Projections into required setbacks. Certain structures and
architectural features may project into the required yard setbacks as follows:
      (1)   Arbors, trellises, pergolas, awnings, and canopies attached to the
principal building may encroach up to: five feet into the front setback, three

(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS
§ 154.110 LANDSCAPE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. This section establishes regulations for the
preservation of natural features and minimum standards for the provision,
installation, and maintenance of landscape materials. These regulations are
intended to promote the health, attractiveness, and safety of the community;
foster aesthetically pleasing and environmentally sensitive development that
protects and preserves the appearance and character of the community; and
encourage the preservation of natural areas.
   (B)   Applicability. These regulations apply to development in all zoning
districts except for detached single-family and two-family dwellings not
located in a subdivision. Plantings and landscaping features required by this
chapter are subject to inspection to verify continued compliance with these
regulations.
   (C)   Landscape plan review.
      (1)   Landscape plans must be shown on a separate drawing at the same
scale as the required site plan. The plans must indicate all existing or
proposed utilities and easements to ensure the proposed landscaping is not
affected by, nor interferes with utilities. The plans must include:
         (a)   All proposed landscaping with circles indicating the anticipated
plant size at maturity;
         (b)   A table listing all proposed plants including the scientific
name, common name, quantities, and size at planting;
         (c)   Calculations illustrating how the plan complies with the
requirements of this chapter;
         (d)   Existing natural and man-made landscape features and proposed
buildings and structures;
         (e)   All existing trees (eight-inch caliper or greater) located in
portions of the site that will be built upon or otherwise altered. Trees must
be labeled "To Be Removed" or "To Be Saved" on the plan. Existing trees located
outside of areas to be disturbed may be illustrated as a tree mass;
         (f)   Measures to protect existing trees to be saved must be noted on
the plans;
         (g)   Contours shown at two-foot intervals.
      (2)   Review. Landscaping plans are subject to Plan Commission or
Administrator review and approval.
      (3)   Modifications. The Plan Commission may modify the requirements of
this section under any of the following circumstances:
         (a)   Existing vegetation or topographic features make compliance with
requirements unnecessary or difficult to achieve.
         (b)   The application of requirements will result in a significant
loss of existing vegetation, or natural or cultural features.
         (c)   Modification of requirements will clearly result in a superior
design that could not be otherwise achieved.
      (4)   Additional conditions. The Plan Commission or Administrator may
impose conditions on landscaping as part of site plan review.
      (5)   Performance guarantee. To ensure that all landscaping is installed
as shown on the plan and in conformance with the requirements of this chapter,
the Plan Commission may require the applicant to provide a financial guarantee,
as provided in §
154.161.
   (D)   Landscaping general requirements.
      (1)   Landscape plan required. A landscape plan must be submitted as a
part of all site plan and permit applications unless the Administrator
determines compliance with the provisions of these regulations can be
demonstrated without the use of a landscape plan. A landscape plan may be
combined with other required application materials if compliance with these
regulations can be demonstrated in the combined materials.
      (2)   Required plant materials. Tree and shrub species used to meet the
requirements of this chapter must be from the Approved Plant List. Plants
listed on the Prohibited Plant List cannot be used to fulfill any requirement
of this chapter. All plant material must be hardy to Central Indiana, suitable
for the site, free of disease and insects, and conform to the American Standard
for Nursery Stock (ANSI Z60.1-2004). The use of native plants is strongly
encouraged. The Administrator may authorize alternative species or cultivars
that meet the intended purpose, are not invasive or hazardous, and are equally
hardy.
      (3)   Minimum living materials. Within required landscaping areas, a
minimum of 60% of the surface area must be covered by living materials, not
gravel, stone, or other non-living materials.
      (4)   Soil condition and planting beds.
         (a)   Landscaping required by this chapter must be planted in
uncompacted soil at least two feet in depth.
         (b)   Stone mulch is not permitted in required landscape areas or
planting bed except as part of a storm water best management practice in
accordance with the Storm Water Specifications Manual.
         (c)   Landscaped areas must be protected from vehicular encroachment
by curbs or wheel stops. Curbs must be provided with openings to accommodate
surface collection of storm water runoff in vegetated swales and detention
facilities.
      (5)   Minimum plant sizes at installation. Unless otherwise specifically
noted, the minimum plant size at the time of installation of landscaping
required by this chapter is according to Table 5-1: Minimum Plant Sizes.
Table 5-1: Minimum Plant Sizes

Ground cover                                                   3" in height
 
      (6)   Plant material clearance. Except for buffer yard plantings, trees
and shrubs cannot be placed closer than three feet to any lot line. A minimum
five-foot clear area is required around fire hydrants, valve vaults, hose bibs,
manholes, hydrants, and fire department connections. Plants must have a minimum
five-foot separation from underground utilities. Any landscaping placed within
an easement is done at the owner's risk. Should the plant material need to be
removed to access the easement, the owner is responsible for the costs of
removing and replacing the plants.
      (7)   Plant material spacing. Plant materials may be grouped but must be
located within the landscape area to which it will be credited. The
Administrator may authorize adjustments to these spacing requirements when
necessary due to topography, drainage, utilities, or obstructions, provided the
total amount of required landscaping is not reduced.
      (8)   Species variation. No one species of tree may make up more than 35%
of the total number of trees. No one species of shrub may make up more than 35%
of the total number of shrubs.
      (9)   Protection of vision clearance areas. All landscaping must comply
with §
154.099.
      (10)   Existing vegetation credit and bonus.
         (a)   If existing vegetation meets the intent of the screening
requirements, preserved existing vegetation may be credited for landscape
materials required by this chapter. Credit will not be given for existing
vegetation listed on the Prohibited Plant List.
         (b)   If any vegetation fulfilling a requirement of this chapter dies
or is removed, replacement plant materials must be installed in accordance
these standards. Existing vegetation used to meet a requirement of this chapter
must be protected during construction by a fence erected around the area
encompassing an area one foot beyond the drip line of the vegetation. The
enclosed area must be protected from any land disturbing activity, including
placing materials within this protected area.
         (c)   Preservation of trees and surrounding vegetation will be given
credit toward fulfilling landscaping requirements in this section as follows:
            1.   Existing trees and surrounding vegetation may be credited only
one time towards any one buffer, screen, or other landscape area requirement.
            2.   Existing trees and surrounding vegetation must be located
within the required landscape area to which it will be credited.
            3.   Existing trees that conform to these standards and are
proposed to be used for credit must generally have location, species, caliper,
and drip line indicated on the required landscape plan.
            4.   Existing trees will be credited as fulfilling a requirement
based upon the tree size and provided that the minimum width of the surrounding
landscape area is according to the criteria and the quantities of Table 5-2:
Existing Tree Credits.
            5.   In the event an existing tree that was given credit is removed
or dies within three years of the improvement location permit issuance date,
replacement trees must be planted per Table 5-2: Existing Tree Credits. If the
site cannot accommodate the number of replacement trees required, the
Administrator may authorize an alternate location for the planting of the
replacement trees within the Town as close to the site as feasible.

      (11)   Native vegetation and natural landscaping areas.
         (a)   Growing native vegetation including ferns, grasses, sedges,
rushes, forbs, shrubs and trees is permitted in lieu of turfgrass lawn. Natural
landscape areas are permitted if planned and designed to control, direct, and
maintain the growth of natural vegetation, primarily native, and may include
the detention and infiltration of storm water runoff in the natural landscape
area.
         (b)   Natural landscaping areas must not be located within two feet of
a front lot line, or within four feet of any other lot line, except where the
natural landscaping is separated from adjacent lots by fencing or continuous
shrub growth three feet or more in height, or where the natural landscaping
area abuts another permitted natural landscaping area on an abutting lot.
         (c)   Where a natural landscaping area is installed or preserved, a
sign not exceeding one square foot should be installed indicating that the area
is a natural landscape area and generally not mowed.
      (12)   Rain gardens, bioswales and storm water management features. Areas
included in rain gardens or vegetated site features created to meet storm water
management requirements of the Storm Water Specifications Manual may be counted
towards any required interior site or parking lot landscaping, and if vegetated
to meet the requirements for any landscaped buffers may count towards those
buffer requirements. Where rain gardens or vegetated site features serving a
storm water management purpose are installed, a sign not exceeding one square
foot should be installed indicating the area should not be mowed.
      (13)   Retention and detention facilities. Landscaping must be provided
around the perimeter of all retention and detention basins. Such landscaping
must consist of trees, shrubs, and emergent plantings in a quantity, species,
and arrangement that will maintain an ecologically functional environment. Per
the Storm Water Specification Manual, tall plantings in the aquatic bench are
desirable to keep waterfowl from the site. Retention and detention basins
should be designed to resemble natural landforms, whenever possible. Such
landscaping must be integrated with the littoral zone of emergent vegetation
around the pond perimeter with the safety bench. Trees, shrubs, and upland
plantings are to be located above the normal water line; emergent or wetland
plantings are to be located below the normal water line. Vegetation must be
established on all side slopes to prevent erosion. A storm water management
easement and operation and maintenance agreement are required for each
facility, clearly marking inlet/outlet structures and easements for inflow/
outflow piping. Trees or deep-rooted vegetation must not be planted in any
easement with storm drainage pipe. Vegetation must not obstruct inlet/outlet
structures and inflow/outflow piping area.
      (14)   Alternative landscaping. The Administrator may approve an
alternate landscape plan that does not meet the specific requirements stated in
this if the Administrator determines that the alternative plan:
         (a)   Is consistent with the purposes of this chapter;
         (b)   Does not include invasive vegetation;
         (c)   Does not include a reduction of tree planting requirements;
         (d)   Provides equal or superior buffering of adjacent properties from
anticipated impacts of the proposed development; and
         (e)   Provides equal or superior visual appearance of the property
when viewed from the street;
      (15)   Installation and delay of installation due to season.
         (a)   Landscaping material used to meet the requirements of this
chapter must be installed in accordance with the planting procedures
established by the ANSI A300 Tree Care Operations: Standard Practices for Tree,
Shrub and Other Woody Plant Maintenance.
         (b)   Landscaping material must be installed prior to issuing a
certificate of occupancy. The Administrator may authorize a delay in
installation up to 120 days due to periods of adverse weather, availability of
plant material, or conflicts between construction scheduling and proper
planting conditions. As a condition of authorizing a delay in installation, a
surety or other guarantee, may be required, in a form acceptable to the Town,
in the estimated amount of the installation. During any delay in installation,
site management must comply with all applicable provisions for sediment and
erosion control.
      (16)   Maintenance.
         (a)   All landscaping required by this chapter must always be
maintained. Dead, missing, or damaged landscaping, or landscaping that supports
less than 50% healthy leaf growth or shows dead branches over a minimum of 50%
of the normal branching pattern must be replaced with healthy, live plants by
the end of the growing season to maintain compliance with this chapter.
         (b)   The owner is responsible for the maintenance, repair, and
replacement of all required landscaping, screening, and curbing.
         (c)   Fences, walls, and other barriers must be maintained in good
repair. All barriers that are damaged, broken, or with failing paint must be
repaired, replaced or refinished.
         (d)   Tree topping is prohibited. Tree topping is the practice of
removing whole tops of trees, large branches or trunks from the tops of trees,
leaving stubs or lateral branches that are too small to assume the role of a
terminal leader.
   (E)   Landscape buffers.
      (1)   General standards.
         (a)   A buffer zone is required along common property lines between
abutting land uses for the conditions described below. On properties with
multiple owners, it is preferred that the buffer be located on private lots
within a landscape easement rather than in a common area around the perimeter
of the site. The owner's association must have the right to maintain or replace
the required landscaping within the landscape easement if the property owner
fails to do so.
         (b)   A buffer area is not required along a public right-of-way.
         (c)   The buffer area must contain natural landscape materials such as
grasses, ground cover, shrubs, and trees. Parking or impervious surfaces are
prohibited within the buffer area. Plant spacing should be designed to minimize
sound, light, and noise impacts.
         (d)   If the adjacent property is undeveloped, the Plan Commission may
allow the installation of the buffer to be deferred until the adjacent property
is developed. A performance guarantee is required to ensure the buffer is
installed when the adjoining property is developed (see §
154.161).
         (e)   Except for access drives or private streets, determined by the
Plan Commission or Administrator to be necessary to provide safe access to a
property, a building, structure, or parking lot cannot encroach into a required
buffer area.

§ 154.112 PARKING STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of these regulations is to establish
standards for off-street parking and loading of motor vehicles, ensure adequate
parking and access are provided in a safe and convenient manner, and to afford
reasonable protection for adjacent land uses from light, noise, air pollution
and other effects of parking areas. These regulations are designed to alleviate
congestion of streets by establishing minimum requirements for on-site parking,
access, storage, loading, and/or unloading. Off-street parking and loading
facilities must be provided and maintained for all buildings, structures, or
premises according to the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   General requirements.
      (1)   Applicability of parking requirements.
         (a)   When the intensity of use of any building, structure, or
premises is increased through the addition of dwelling units, floor area, or
other unit of measurement, additional parking and loading facilities must be
provided for the increase based on the requirements.
         (b)   Whenever the existing use of a building, structure, or premises
changes or converts to a new use permitted by this chapter, parking and loading
facilities must be added, if needed, to comply with the parking requirements.
         (c)   When additional parking is required, the following standards
apply:
            1.   If the added parking or loading area comprises less than 50%
of the existing area used for parking or loading, only the added parking or
loading facilities are required to conform to the parking requirements.
            2.   If the added parking or loading area comprises 50% or more of
the existing area used for parking or loading, the entire parking or loading
area must be brought into conformance with the parking requirements.
         (d)   Nothing in this chapter prevents the voluntary establishment of
off-street parking or loading facilities serving existing uses if the parking
requirements are met.
         (e)   On-street parking is permitted, subject to the rules and
conditions of the jurisdiction with authority over the street. Unless otherwise
provided in this section, on-street parking does not count toward off-street
parking requirements.
      (2)   Limitations on parking areas.
         (a)   Required off-street parking facilities can only be used for the
parking of passenger vehicles or light trucks for patrons, occupants, or
employees of specified uses. Parking facilities cannot be used for storage,
display, sale, repair, dismantling, or wrecking of any vehicle, equipment, or
material. Inoperable vehicles cannot be stored in an off-street parking area
for more than 24 hours, except for areas approved for outdoor storage of
vehicles.
         (b)   Parking on residential properties is restricted to passenger
vehicles and no more than one commercial truck or van with a maximum capacity
of three tons capacity (manufacturer's rating).
   (C)   Required off-street parking.
      (1)   Except for certain residential uses, there are no minimum required
parking spaces. Instead, the owner provides parking spaces based upon the
number employees, expected level of customer traffic, or actual counts at
similar establishments. Consideration is given to the presence of convenient
municipal off-street parking or on-street spaces located adjacent to the site
and if walk-in trade is reasonable due to pedestrian connections to adjacent
residential neighborhoods or employment centers.
      (2)   The town has established a maximum number of parking spaces
permitted for each use. In determining the maximum number of off-street parking
spaces permitted, the following instructions apply:
         (a)   Off-street parking requirements are calculated based on gross
square footage of the use to which the parking is accessory, or as otherwise
provided on the Permitted Use Table.
         (b)   If the calculation of required parking spaces results in a
fraction, the fraction is rounded up to the next unit and counted as one
additional space.
         (c)   For uses not specified on the Permitted Use Table, the maximum
number of parking spaces permitted is determined by the Administrator, based on
requirements for similar uses, the gross square footage of the use, and the
relationship between the size of the use and the number of persons served or
employed.
      (3)   The maximum parking space requirements of this section cannot be
exceeded unless approved by the Plan Commission as part of site plan review. In
approving excess parking spaces, the Plan Commission determines the parking is
necessary to accommodate the use on a typical day. Additional parking spaces
approved by the Plan Commission must incorporate pervious paving materials to
the extent practical and as subsurface conditions allow.
      (4)   The minimum aisle width for angled parking is:
 
Angle of Parking Space Minimum Aisle Width
30 degrees             14 feet
45 degrees             18 feet
90 degrees             22 feet

   (D)   Design standards. Off-street parking areas must be developed according
to the standards of this section.
      (1)   Dimensions and layout.
         (a)   Each off-street parking space must open directly upon an aisle
or driveway to provide safe and efficient vehicular access to the parking
spaces aisles or driveways must remain unobstructed and always allow for the
passage of emergency vehicles.
         (b)   Off-street parking spaces must be at least nine feet wide and 18
feet long with a vertical clearance of seven feet. Parallel parking spaces must
be at least eight feet wide and 22 feet long. Parking spaces are exclusive of
access drives, aisles, ramps, columns, and work area.
      (2)   Parking surface. Driveways and drive aisles must be surfaced with
asphalt, concrete, or similar material to provide a durable and dustless
surface. Gravel driveways and drive aisles are prohibited, unless approved by
the Administrator for temporary uses or agricultural operations, including
seasonal roadside stands. Pervious parking spaces are encouraged to reduce
post-construction storm water runoff rates, volumes, and pollutant loads. The
Administrator may approve the use of permeable surfaces such as pervious
concrete, porous asphalt, permeable interlocking concrete pavers, and concrete
or plastic grid pavers.
      (3)   Curbing. Curbs and gutters built per the town's construction
standards are required around the perimeter of all parking facilities and
landscape islands within the parking facilities to prevent a parked vehicle
from extending beyond the parking area onto a street right-of-way or adjacent
property and to protect landscaped areas.
      (4)   Residential driveways. A residential dwelling unit is limited to
one driveway with a maximum width of 20 feet measured at the right-of-way line.
In addition, residential driveways must be located at least 75 feet from a
street intersection unless otherwise approved by the Administrator.
      (5)   Drainage or runoff. Parking areas must be graded and drained, so
water does not flow onto adjacent property or public sidewalks. Runoff
generated by parking areas must be collected in appropriate drainage facilities
per the Bargersville storm water standards.
      (6)   Striping of parking. Parking areas must be striped and maintained
to identify each parking space.
      (7)   Lighting. Parking lot lighting must comply with the standards of §
154.111.
      (8)   Landscaping. Off-street parking areas must be landscaped in
accordance with §
154.110(G).
      (9)   Accessible parking. Accessible parking must be provided pursuant to
the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, as amended, for any building
or use initiated after the effective date of this chapter.
      (10)   Accessibility. Off-street parking or loading facilities must be
designed with vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner that least
interferes with traffic movement on that street or alley. Vehicle maneuvering
space for parking and loading must be located on the subject property.
Properties deriving access to SR 135, SR 37, or CR 144 must comply with §
154.037(G).
      (11)   Location of parking and loading. Off-street parking and loading
spaces must be provided on the same lot as the use served, except as otherwise
provided in this chapter.
      (12)   Stacking requirements for drive-through facilities. The following
requirements apply to uses with drive-through facilities.
         (a)   General requirements.
            1.   Drive-through lanes and required stacking spaces must not
interfere with parking space maneuvering aisles, parking drive aisles, loading
spaces, internal site circulation, designated fire lanes or site access points.
            2.   Drive-through lanes and stacking spaces must be designed to
prevent vehicles from stacking in the right-of-way (Figure 5-6).
            3.   No stacking space may occupy any portion of a right-of-way.
            4.   A stacking space does not constitute a parking space.
            5.   All drive-through and stacking lanes must be delineated with
pavement markings or otherwise distinctly delineated, as approved by the
Administrator.
         (b)   A stacking space must be at least eight feet wide and 20 feet
long with direct forward access to a service window or station of a drive-
through facility.
         (c)   A lane at least eight feet wide parallel to a drive-through lane
must be provided around the drive-through facility to allow vehicles to exit
the drive-through lane and circumvent the stacking lane. This lane may be part
of the site's overall circulation plan.
         (d)   Noted below are the minimum number of required stacking spaces,
excluding the position at the service window or ordering station.
            1.   Fast food restaurant: seven stacking spaces;
            2.   Financial institutions, pharmacies, takeout, and deli-style
restaurant with drive-through three stacking spaces per service window;
            3.   All other facilities: two stacking spaces per service window;

   (E)   Parking options.
      (1)   Credit for on-street parking. Wherever on-street parking is
provided in the improvement of a street, credit toward off-street parking
requirements may be granted for every parking space provided. On-street parking
is subject to approval by the Administrator and specifically not permitted in
the following areas:
         (a)   On an expressway or arterial street;
         (b)   Within 20 feet of a corner;
         (c)   Within five feet of each side of a driveway or alley;
         (d)   Within a fire hydrant zone or other emergency access zone.
      (2)   Shared parking. Groups of users requiring parking spaces may create
a shared parking facility if all the criteria below are met. Approval by the
Plan Commission is required.
         (a)   Off-site, off-street parking facilities are within 600 feet of
the property.
         (b)   Safe and convenient pedestrian uses must be provided between the
parking facilities and uses.
         (c)   Interior vehicle access must connect the properties sharing the
parking facilities.
         (d)   A written reciprocal parking agreement or similar document with
a minimum duration of 20 years, signed by all property owners involved is
required. It must include provisions for: easements (if applicable),
maintenance, snow removal, ownership, and liability. The agreement must be
recorded in the County Recorder's office with a copy provided to the
Department. When the reciprocal parking agreement expires or terminates, the
uses for which the parking was provided are considered nonconforming.
Continuation or expansion of the uses is prohibited unless the use is brought
into compliance with the parking regulations of this chapter.
      (3)   Deferred parking. When development of a site will occur in phases,
the Plan Commission may defer some of the required parking until it is needed
if:
         (a)   A site plan shows all required parking but identifies those
spaces that will not be constructed until needed.
         (b)   Any area designated for deferred parking must be maintained in a
landscaped appearance. Parking lot landscaping required for the deferred spaces
can be installed when the deferred parking area is constructed.
         (c)   Construction of all or a portion of the deferred parking spaces
may be initiated by the owner or required by the Town based on actual parking
needs.
   (F)   Parking as a principal use. The Board of Zoning Appeals may approve
parking as a principal use of property as a special exception in according to
this section.
      (1)   Site plan. A site plan is filed with the BZA as part of the special
exception application. The site plan must indicate:
         (a)   All individual uses to be served by the parking, including the
location, use, and number of parking spaces required for each use;
         (b)   The location of buildings, parking areas, and access points on
all adjacent properties;
         (c)   The site layout drawn to scale and dimensioned of proposed
entrance and exit driveways, accel/decel lanes, parking spaces, setbacks,
drainage facilities, structures, buildings, landscaping, and buffer screening;
and
         (d)   Location, size, and design of proposed lighting, pavement, and
signs.
      (2)   Setbacks and access. Proposed parking facilities shall meet the
setback requirements for principal buildings.
      (3)   Legal encumbrance. Parking as a principal use is encumbered by an
instrument approved by the town that links the parking facilities to the uses
served. The instrument specifies and binds the time period to the anticipated
life of the building or use the parking facility serves. The instrument is
filed with the improvement location permit files of the Department and recorded
in the office of the Johnson County Recorder.
      (4)   Changes to site plans. Any change to a site plan resulting from
conditions imposed by the BZA is made to the plans and submitted to the
Administrator prior to issuing the permit. Other changes, such as modifying the
number of parking spaces, altering the layout, or placing or removing a
structure, requires approval of a new site plan. Minor changes (see §
154.180(G)(9) are approved by the Administrator. Changes other than minor
changes are approved by the BZA.
   (G)   Off-street loading requirements.
      (1)   Uses requiring loading areas. Buildings used for manufacturing,
storage, warehousing, retail sales, or other uses involving the receipt or
distribution of materials or merchandise must provide adequate space for
loading and unloading services to avoid undue interference with streets,
alleys, and parking spaces.
      (2)   Loading area design requirements.
         (a)   Loading and unloading spaces must be paved, located to the side
or rear of a building, and be at least ten feet wide by 50 feet long, with 15-
foot height clearance.
         (b)   Loading spaces and maneuvering space for loading spaces cannot
use any portion of a public right-of-way, private street, or access easement.
         (c)   Required loading spaces do not count toward required off-street
parking spaces.
      (3)   Number.
         (a)   Business and professional offices, medical facilities, schools,
hotels, clubs, and similar businesses must provide one loading berth for each
100,000 square feet of space or fraction thereof.
         (b)   Industrial manufacturing and warehousing uses must provide one
loading berth for each 40,000 square feet or fraction thereof.
         (c)   Other business uses must provide loading berths based upon the
size of the building as follows:
 
5,000 to 10,000 sq. ft.  One loading berth
10,001 to 25,000 sq. ft. Two loading berths
Over 25,000 sq. ft.      One additional loading berth for each 25,000 sq. ft.
                         or fraction thereof

§ 154.113 SIGNAGE.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare through reasonable, consistent, and
non-discriminatory sign standards. The sign regulations in this article are not
intended to censor speech or to regulate viewpoints, but instead are intended
to regulate the adverse secondary effects of signs, especially the secondary
effects that may adversely impact aesthetics and traffic and pedestrian safety.
   (B)   Exempt signs. The following signs are exempt from this section:
      (1)   Government signs, including signs erected by the town for
government purposes;
      (2)   Signs located entirely inside the premises of a building or
enclosed space, other than window signs;
      (3)   Signs on a vehicle, other than an unlawful vehicle sign;
      (4)   Signs protected by state statute;
      (5)   Traffic control device signs;
      (6)   Public art, including public art murals.
   (C)   Prohibited signs. The following signs are prohibited unless protected
by state statute, or otherwise allowed in this section:
      (1)   Abandoned signs;
      (2)   Signs that are animated, blink, flash, move, rotate, or have
scrolling text;
      (3)   Balloon or inflatable signs;
      (4)   Billboards or off-premise advertising signs;
      (5)   Pole signs;
      (6)   Reflective or fluorescent signs;
      (7)   Signs attached to or painted on trees or natural features;
      (8)   Signs within the right-of-way;
      (9)   Signs installed, attached to, or painted on fences;
      (10)   Signs or sign support structures obstructing a means of egress,
including any fire escape, window, door opening, stairway, exit, walkway, any
utility access, or fire department connection;
      (11)   Signs interfering with any opening required for ventilation;
      (12)   Signs resembling traffic control device signs;
      (13)   Signs with exposed raceways;
      (14)   Snipe or bandit signs;
      (15)   Unlawful vehicle signs.
   (D)   Sign plans and sign program.
      (1)   Comprehensive sign programs. A comprehensive sign program is
required for all projects consisting of multi-tenant buildings, nonresidential
complexes with multiple buildings, or large-scale mixed-use developments. A
comprehensive sign program provides design compatibility for all signs and
integrates sign design with the architecture of the buildings. The
comprehensive sign program must set design standards including: sign types,
placement, size, design, colors, materials, textures, and method of
illumination, as well as provide for the safe navigation for vehicles and
pedestrians. If a sign subject to the comprehensive sign program complies with
all the requirements of this chapter, it may be approved administratively. In
determining approval, the Administrator must not base any approval on the
message content of a sign.
      (2)   Master sign plans. The Plan Commission may approve a master sign
plan as an alternative to the requirements set forth in division (I) for the
following uses and developments:
         (a)   Multiple-tenant commercial, office, or employment uses;
         (b)   A multiple-building complex for a single commercial or
employment use in a project exceeding 40 net acres;
         (b)   Stand-alone office/employment buildings exceeding 100,000 square
feet;
         (c)   Indoor or outdoor entertainment and recreation uses;
         (d)   Auto malls;
         (e)   Hospitals;
         (f)   Hotels and commercial lodging having at least 150 guest rooms
and a full-service restaurant or conference and meeting rooms;
         (g)   Regional retail shopping malls.
            1.   Conditions. The Plan Commission may attach conditions as
necessary to assure the signs covered by the master sign plan will not be
materially detrimental to persons or property in the vicinity. In making its
determination, the Plan Commission must not base any condition on the message
content of a sign.
            2.   Evaluation criteria. Master sign plans are evaluated on the
following criteria:
               a.   Placement. Signs must be placed where they are visible and
legible. Consideration is given to a sign's location relative to traffic
movement and access points, site features, other structures, and orientation
relative to viewing distances and angles. Wall signs may be approved on
building walls other than the wall of the space occupied by the tenant in
commercial centers where tenants have little or no visibility from the street.
               b.   Quantity. The number of signs approved within any
development must be sufficient for internal traffic and navigation for vehicles
and pedestrians.
               c.   Size. Signs must be no larger than necessary for visibility
and legibility. A master sign plan must not contain a freestanding sign
exceeding any maximum height standard permitted by this chapter by more than
50%. A master sign plan must not contain a wall sign exceeding any maximum sign
area standard permitted by this chapter by more than 25%.
               d.   Design features and materials. Sign design themes and
materials must be compatible with the architecture, colors, and materials of
the project.
               e.   Development standards. The Plan Commission may not reduce
any sign development standard to less than 50% of any minimum standard, nor
increase any sign development standard by more than 100% of the maximum
standard. The Plan Commission must not base any decision on the message content
of a sign.
               f.   Amendments. The Administrator may approve minor amendments
to a master sign plan involving noncommunicative activity, where such changes
are determined to have little or no visual impact and are consistent with the
intent of the original approval.
   (E)   Review of sign applications for permanent signs. Applications for
permanent signs are considered by the Plan Commission, except for those
applications subject to administrative approval by the Administrator. Approval
for a permanent sign may be by:
      (1)   A comprehensive sign program;
      (2)   A master sign plan; or
      (3)   A separate Administrative Design Review application approved by the
Administrator.
   (F)   General provisions for signs. The following general provisions for
signs apply to this chapter and to all lawful conforming and nonconforming
signs, unless otherwise indicated.
      (1)   Viewpoint neutrality. Unless stated to the contrary in this
chapter, no sign or sign structure is subject to any limitation based upon the
viewpoint of the message contained on the sign or displayed on the sign
structure. It is the policy of the town to regulate signs to not favor
commercial speech over noncommercial speech. The town does not regulate
protected noncommercial speech by message content. Within this chapter,
distinction between onsite signs and offsite signs applies only to commercial
messages. It does not apply to noncommercial messages.
      (2)   Substitution of noncommercial speech for commercial speech. A sign
may contain a noncommercial message instead of a commercial message. The
noncommercial copy may be substituted in for the commercial copy. The
noncommercial copy may occupy all or part of the entire sign face. The sign
face may be changed from a commercial message to a noncommercial message or
from one noncommercial message to another noncommercial message, provided there
is no change in the sign structure.
      (3)   Approval criteria. When reviewing a sign permit or other sign
approval, consideration is given to the following:
         (a)   The location and placement of the sign will not endanger
motorists
         (b)   The sign will not interfere with the prominent view of a
structure or facade of historical or architectural significance;
         (c)   The sign will not obstruct views of users or adjacent buildings
to side yards, front yards or open space;
         (d)   The sign will not adversely impact the visual quality of a
public open space, such as a public recreation facility, square, plaza, park,
or courtyard;
         (e)   The sign is compatible with existing neighborhood building
heights;
         (f)   The sign's lighting will not cause hazardous or unsafe driving
conditions.
      (4)   Consent of legal owner of property. Except as required by state
law, no sign may be displayed without the consent of the legal owner of the
property where the sign is mounted or displayed.
      (5)   Signs on public property. Except as required by state law or
otherwise permitted by this chapter, a sign installed or placed on public
property is deemed illegal, forfeited to the public, and subject to
confiscation. In addition to other remedies in this chapter, the town has the
right to recover the cost of removal and disposal of the sign from the owner or
person placing such sign.
      (6)   Placement of signs.
         (a)   An encroachment permit from the town is required prior to
installing a permanent sign projecting into or over the public right-of-way.
         (b)   The lowest portion of any sign extending over an area intended
for pedestrian use must be at least eight feet above finished grade.
         (c)   The lowest portion of any sign extending over an area intended
for vehicular use must be at least 14 feet above the finished grade.
         (d)   Any sign placed on a sidewalk or other public right of way must
comply with this chapter and applicable provisions of the Americans with
Disability Act.
         (e)   Signs are prohibited within sight visibility triangles, except
for appropriately placed traffic control device signs.
      (7)   Flag brackets and stanchions. For each principal structure on a
parcel, up to two flag brackets or stanchions may be attached or placed for the
display of flags.
      (8)   Measurement of sign area. The area of a sign is measured or
calculated as follows (Figure 5-8):
         (a)   Background panel signs. Sign copy on a panel or area
distinctively colored or constructed as a background is measured as the area
contained within the sum of the geometric shapes enclosing both the sign copy
and the background.
         (b)   Background surface signs. The area of a sign consisting of copy
mounted as individual letters or graphics against a wall or building surface,
that is not altered to provide a distinctive background for the sign copy, is
measured as the sum of the smallest geometric shapes enclosing each word,
graphic or discrete visual element in the total sign.
         (c)   Illuminated background signs. The area of a sign with copy on an
illuminated surface is measured as the entire illuminated surface containing
sign copy.
         (d)   Double-faced signs. If a sign has two display faces, and the
interior angle between the two faces is 30 degrees or less, the sign area is
one sign face only. If the two faces are different sizes, the larger sign face
is used. If the sign has two display faces and the interior angle between the
two faces is greater than 30 degrees, then the sign area is the sum of the
areas of the two sign faces.
         (e)   Multi-faced signs. If a sign has three or more faces, the sign
area is equal to 50% of the aggregate area of all sign faces.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1057.png]
 
      (9)   Measurement of sign height. The height of a freestanding sign is
measured as the vertical distance from the average finished grade below the
sign to the top edge of the highest portion of the sign (Figure 5-9). Any
mounding or excavating solely for the purposes of increasing the height of the
sign is included in this measurement. The maximum height limit excludes
architectural embellishments less than 36 inches at the base of the sign and
less than 18 inches at the top of the sign. For the purposes of this section,
average finished grade below the sign is the lower of (a) the lowest elevation
where the base of the sign meets ground level; or (b) the top of the curb of
the nearest public street adjoining the property; or (c) the grade of the land
at the principal entrance to the lot.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1059.png]
 
      (10)   Signs must provide at least six feet horizontal clearance and 12
feet overhead clearance from electrical conductors and from communications
equipment or lines. Signs and their supporting structures must not interfere
with surface and underground utilities or drainage systems.
      (11)   The Administrator or Building Commissioner may order the repair of
signs declared a nuisance, and, with or without notice, may remove a
structurally unsafe sign if it presents an immediate peril to the public health
or safety.
      (12)   Replacement of a tenant sign panel containing the same design as
the original on an approved sign structure with removable panels does not
require a permit. Any tenant panel that is vacant or missing must be replaced
within 30 days.
      (13)   When a tenant vacates a building suite, the fascia of the wall
sign band must be repaired to its surrounding texture and color within 45 days
of sign removal.
   (G)   Temporary signs. A temporary sign is not permanently attached to the
ground, a building or another structure and is designed to be displayed
temporarily. Unless otherwise provided in this section, temporary signs must
meet the criteria below. A temporary sign may be displayed as a ground sign,
wall sign, or a window sign.
      (1)   General criteria for temporary signs. A temporary sign is unlawful
unless it meets the criteria established for the zoning district where it is
located as described in
Table 5-4. The general criteria and limitations in this section do not apply to
A-frame and T-frame signs, banner signs, flying banner signs, flags, and
umbrella signs.
      (2)   A-frame signs and T-frame signs. A-frame signs are portable, stand-
alone signs comprised of two separate panels or faces joined at the top and
spread apart at the bottom to form a base upon which the sign stands. A T-frame
sign. Is a portable, stand-alone sign comprised of one single double-sided
panel joined at the bottom to a spread apart base upon which the sign stands.
      (3)   A-frame signs and T-frame signs are unlawful unless they meet the
criteria and limitations set forth in
Table 5-5: Temporary Signs.
         (a)   A-frame signs and T-frame signs are permitted in all zoning
districts but may be placed in single-family residential districts only in

the building.
      (26)   Canopy signs for service islands. A canopy sign is mounted
permanently on or under a service island canopy. Each service island can have
up to two canopy signs per service island. The maximum sign area of a canopy
sign is 12 square feet. No part of the sign must project from a canopy wall by
more than six inches. The height cannot exceed 80% of the vertical dimension of
the canopy wall. The sign area of a canopy sign does not count against the
maximum sign area allowed for wall signs on the parcel.
      (27)   Historic markers. A historic marker commemorates a historic person
or event, or identifying a historic place, structure, or object. One historic
marker per parcel is allowed. The maximum sign area of a historic marker is six
square feet. A sign permit is not required for a historic marker.
   (J)   Permitted permanent signs by zoning district. The permanent sign types
allowed by zoning district and the applicable permitting plan, program, or
other review process are set forth below in
Table 5-8: Permitted Permanent Signs by Zoning District. Refer to each sign
type for criteria and limitations as specified in division (I).
   (K)   Sign maintenance. Maintaining legal signs is allowed without a permit.
Sign maintenance is the replacement or repair of a part of a sign required by
ordinary wear, tear, or damage, with like material, color, and design.
Maintenance of legal signs does not include changing the color, size, design,
or style of signs. Any sign or component which is damaged and constitutes a
danger to public safety must be promptly repaired or replaced. Surface
materials and components must be kept free of chipping, peeling, fading,
cracks, holes, buckles, warps, splinters, or rusting visible from an adjacent
property or street. Illuminated signs must be maintained in good operating
condition including prompt removal and replacement of all defective lamps,
damaged electrical wiring, and malfunctioning control devices and related
circuitry.
   (L)   Nonconforming signs.
      (1)   If a nonconforming sign becomes an abandoned sign, it must be
removed after notice to the property owner, unless the property owner
establishes sufficient facts to refute the presumption of abandonment. An
abandoned sign is a sign not operated or maintained for 180 calendar days or
longer. An abandoned sign includes a sign on which is advertised a business
that is no longer doing business on the parcel where the sign is located. An
abandoned sign includes a sign for a purpose for which the purpose has lapsed.
The following conditions shall be considered as the failure to operate or
maintain a sign:
         (a)   The sign displays advertising for a product or service which is
no longer available;
         (b)   The sign displays advertising for a business which is no longer
licensed; or
         (c)   The sign is blank.
      (2)   If a property or development is expanded or modified to add new
signage, all nonconforming signs must be removed or rebuilt to comply with the
provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   Sign faces may be replaced on non-conforming signs.
      (4)   Changes to a property that add or alters existing signage is
prohibited until all non-conforming signs are removed or rebuilt in conformance
with this chapter. Existing signage not conforming to the restrictions on
cabinet signs or raceways need not be brought into conformance if demonstrated
to the Administrator that the signage permitted by this chapter is not
structurally feasible.
   (M)   Sign violations.
      (1)   Requirement of permit. Unless specifically exempted, it is unlawful
for any person to construct, install, attach, place, paint, alter, relocate, or
otherwise maintain any sign in the town without first obtaining a sign permit
in according to the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   Requirement of compliance. Signs must be installed, placed, or
maintained in the town only in compliance with this chapter. Signs maintained
contrary to the provisions of this chapter are declared to be nuisances and may
be abated as provided by law. The responsibility for compliance with this
chapter rests upon the sign owner, the permit holder, and parties holding the
present right of possession and control of the property where a sign is
located, mounted, or installed, and the legal owner of the lot or parcel, even
if the sign was installed without the consent or knowledge of the owner and/or
other parties holding the legal right to immediate possession and control.
Signs not in compliance with this chapter are subject to enforcement
proceedings as specified in §§
154.180 to
154.183.

SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
§ 154.130 ESTABLISHMENT OF CONTROLS.
   Subdivision plats, replats, amendments or corrections to a recorded plat
cannot be recorded until approved according to this chapter. Approval must be
in writing on the plat by the Administrator. Amendments or corrections to a
recorded plat must be cited as an addendum to the approved plat.
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.131 SUBDIVISION TYPES.
   This subchapter establishes the process for subdividing land to ensure
conformity to the standards of this chapter. Subdivision applications will
generally be considered favorably by the Plan Commission and Administrator.
There are four types of subdivisions: exempt subdivisions, administrative
subdivisions, minor subdivisions, and major subdivisions. Subdivisions of all
types are permitted in all zoning districts except in the AG Agriculture
District where minor subdivisions and major subdivisions are prohibited.
   (A)   Exempt subdivisions. Exempt subdivisions are one of the following
types of land division:
      (1)   A division of land for the sale or exchange of tracts to correct
errors in an existing legal description, provided that no additional lots are
created by the division;
      (2)   A division of land pursuant to an allocation of land in the
settlement of a decedent's estate or a court decree for the distribution of
property;
      (3)   A division of land for the acquisition of street right-of-way or
easement;
      (4)   A division of land for the sale or exchange of tracts between
adjoining landowners, provided no additional lots are created by the division
and the lots meet the minimum standards of the zoning district of the land's
location;
      (5)   A division of land into cemetery plots for the purpose of burial of
corpses.
   (B)   Administrative subdivisions. This process applies to proposed
adjustments to property lines when no new lots are created or when parcels are
merged. The following situations qualify:
      (1)   Adjusting lot lines where the resulting lots conform to the
standards of this chapter. When the existing lots currently do not conform, the
adjustment should not increase nonconformance;
      (2)   Combining common ownership lots to lessen the total number of
buildable lots;
      (3)   Adjusting lot lines to address issues of property line encroachment
or buildings across property boundaries.
   (C)   Minor subdivisions. A minor subdivision results in four or fewer lots
(including the parent parcel) and does not involve the creation of new interior
streets, adjustments to design standards, or the creation of common areas.
   (D)   Major subdivisions. A major subdivision is any subdivision other than
an exempt subdivision, administrative subdivision, or a minor subdivision.
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.132 APPROVAL PROCESS OVERVIEW.
   (A)   The approval process varies based upon the type of subdivision.
      (1)   Exempt subdivision. No approval is required for exempt
subdivisions.
      (2)   Administrative subdivision. Approval of an administrative
subdivision is a one-step process involving the approval of a secondary plat.
The approval or disapproval of an administrative subdivision is delegated to
the Administrator.
      (3)   Minor subdivision. Approval of a minor subdivision is a one-step
process involving the approval of a secondary plat. The approval or disapproval
of a minor subdivision is delegated to the Administrator. The Plan Commission
may approve a waiver allowing the creation of more than four lots if the other
requirements for a minor subdivision are met.
      (4)   Major subdivision. Approval of a major subdivision is a two-step
process including the approval of a primary plat and a secondary plat. The
approval or disapproval of a primary plat is delegated to the Plan Commission.
After a primary plat approval, a property is eligible for secondary plat
approval. The approval or disapproval of a secondary plat is delegated to the
Administrator.
   (B)   Appeal. If the applicant does not agree with the approval conditions
or disapproval of a subdivision by the Administrator, the applicant may file a
petition of appeal to the Plan Commission. Appeals must be filed in writing at
least ten days before the next Plan Commission meeting.
   (C)   Requirement for site plan approval. Primary plat approval will not be
granted unless a site plan addressing the entire parent parcel is approved
prior to or simultaneously with the primary plat. Secondary plat approval will
not be granted unless a detailed site plan is approved prior to or
simultaneously with the secondary plat.
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.133 SKETCH PLAN REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Purpose. The sketch plan review helps minimize development planning
costs, avoid misinterpretation, identify required approvals, discuss checkpoint
agency and technical reviews, identify the need for modifications or variances,
and ensure compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Application requirements. Sketch plan review is required for major
subdivisions and recommended for the other types of subdivisions. The applicant
files: (1) an application provided on forms provided by the Department; (2) a
sketch plan; (3) all applicable fees; and (4) any supplemental information
required by the Administrator.
   (C)   Review process. The Administrator reviews the application for
completeness and sends a copy to the Town Engineer for review. The
Administrator may send the application to other members of the Technical
Advisory Committee for their review and comment. Within 20 days of the
submittal, the Administrator reviews the proposal, assembles comments from the
Town Engineer and other reviewers, and meets with the applicant to discuss the
proposed subdivision and possible modifications required to comply with the
requirements of this chapter.

§ 154.135 PRIMARY PLAT APPROVAL PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Submission dates. Applications must be filed according to the schedule
of meetings and filing deadlines and in the format specified by the Department.
   (B)   Application requirements. Following the sketch plan review, the
applicant files: (1) an application provided on forms provided by the
Department; (2) a primary plat; (3) all applicable fees; and (4) supplemental
information required by the application or Administrator.
   (C)   Compliance. Primary plats must be substantially similar to the sketch
plan as reviewed.
   (D)   Phasing. A primary plat may include all or only a part of a larger
overall development. However, a primary plat must include the entire parent
tract being subdivided unless otherwise deemed unnecessary by the Administrator
or Plan Commission. This requirement seeks to avoid the creation of remainder
parcels not complying with this chapter or inhibiting orderly development.
   (E)   Placement on the Plan Commission agenda. The Administrator reviews the
application for completeness. Applications determined to be in proper form are
numbered and docketed for a public hearing by the Plan Commission.
   (F)   Review of complete applications. The Technical Advisory Committee may
review any primary plat prior to the Plan Commission's consideration. The
Administrator may submit a written report to the Plan Commission stating facts
concerning the characteristics of the area involved in the primary plat,
surrounding land uses, public facilities available to service the area, or
other pertinent facts. The report may also contain the Administrator's opinions
concerning the primary plat proposal and a report from members of the Technical
Advisory Committee. A copy of the report is made available to the applicant and
the public.
   (G)   Preliminary drainage approval. Before the public hearing, the
applicant is encouraged to obtain preliminary approval from the Storm Water
Utility Board. If preliminary drainage approval has not been secured prior to
the public hearing, the Plan Commission may condition approval of the plat on
obtaining drainage approval from the Storm Water Utility Board.
   (H)   Public hearing notice. A public hearing by the Plan Commission is
required for all primary plats. Notification of the public hearing must comply
with the Plan Commission's Rules of Procedure. A certificate of mailing issued
by the U.S. Postal Service is evidence notice has been given. A date stamped
photograph of the public notice sign at the subject property also constitutes
evidence of notice.
   (I)   Public hearing and Plan Commission action. The Plan Commission will
hold the public hearing and review the application and supporting information
and act on the application according to this chapter, Indiana law, and the Plan
Commission's Rules of Procedure.
   (J)   Written commitments. The Plan Commission or Administrator may require
the applicant to prepare written commitments concerning the primary plat prior
to formal action on the application. If written commitments are part of the
primary plat approval, they must be recorded in the office of the Johnson
County Recorder within 90 days of primary plat approval. A copy of the recorded
commitments must be provided to the Department within 30 days of being
recorded.
   (K)   Effect of approval. Approval of a primary plat does not authorize the
development, construction, alteration or moving of any structure. The approval
allows the filing and processing of applications for approvals, such as a
secondary plat, detailed site plan, improvement location permit, building
permit, or certificate of occupancy.
   (L)   Effective period of primary approval. Unless extended, the approval of
a primary plat is valid for a period of three years. At the end of this time,
primary approval is null and void, and the applicant is required to resubmit a
new application beginning with sketch plan review and subject to all the zoning
restrictions and subdivision regulations in effect at the time of resubmission.
Prior to the expiration of the approval period, the applicant may submit a
written request to extend the approval period. The Plan Commission may extend
the approval of a primary plat in increments of up to 12 months beyond an
expiration date without further notice and public hearing.

§ 154.142 COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   Review. It is recognized that commercial and industrial subdivisions
face unique problems of lot design not normally encountered in residential
subdivisions. For this reason, the initial emphasis when reviewing non-
residential subdivisions is on the street layout, block arrangement, and
infrastructure design.
   (B)   Process. The initial secondary plat is expected to show the street and
block layout. Then, as prospective buyers express interest in lots sized to
their required specifications, the applicant submits for approval to amend the
recorded secondary plat. Approval of the re-plat follows the procedural
requirements for a secondary plat. Improvements built following an approved set
of construction plans associated with a previously approved secondary plat do
not have to be rebuilt if changes in design standards and specifications have
been adopted by the town.
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.143 RE-SUBDIVISION OF LAND.
   Any change affecting the street layout, area reserved for public use, or a
lot line of an approved secondary plat must be approved by the Plan Commission
as a major subdivision unless the proposed change qualifies as an exempt
subdivision, administrative subdivision, or minor subdivision. The
Administrator may refer any case to the Plan Commission for review and
approval.
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.144 VACATION OF PLATS.
   The procedure to vacate a recorded secondary plat follows the requirements
of Indiana Code (see I.C. 36-7-4-711). The vacation of a secondary plat cannot
be used to vacate rights-of-way or easements. Rights-of-way are vacated
following the requirements of I.C. 36-7-3-12. Easements are vacated following
the requirements of I.C. 36-7-3-16.

§ 154.147 RESIDENTIAL ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS.
   (A)   Architectural standards for small-scale residential dwellings.
      (1)   General provisions. The purpose of these design standards ensures
quality construction for developments and create variation and interest in the
built environment. These standards apply to all residential buildings
containing one to four dwelling units located on a parcel or within a
subdivision containing five or more dwelling units.
         (a)   Front facades, street side facades, and rear facades of
residential buildings must be articulated to avoid flat building facades. These
variations in the fagade plane may be achieved through:
            1.   Projections or recessions created by (a) one offset at least
four feet deep and a minimum height equivalent of one story or (b) two offsets
at least two feet deep and a minimum height equivalent of one story;
            2.   Front-load garage doors recessed at least two feet behind the
front facade of the building or four feet behind the posts of the front porch;
            3.   A covered porch at least 40 square feet in area on the front
facade or street side facade;
            4.   A sunroom or screened porch at least 64 square feet in area on
the street side facade or rear facade;
            5.   An exterior fireplace chase extending at least 18 inches from
the building facade, finished in masonry material, and extending above the
roofline;
            6.   A bay window projecting at least 12 inches from the wall;
            7.   A second-floor cantilever projecting at least 12 inches over
the first floor for at least 30% of the length of the building facade;
            8.   A covered patio or covered porch, as a projection or
recession, at least 120 square feet in area.
         (b)   At least three exterior color, materials, or patterns must be
used on each building facade. A well-chosen selection of contrasting trim and
accent colors can draw attention to architectural details. Care should be taken
in selecting a color palette that accents the building's architecture while
being harmonious in the context of the surrounding neighborhood.
      (2)   Architectural diversity standards along streetscapes.
         (a)   To improve the architectural diversity along a streetscape,
homes of the same elevation and color scheme are not permitted next to or
directly across the street from each other. Additionally, the home color scheme
may not be repeated for two homes on either side of the subject home and the
five homes directly across the street from the subject home. Figure 6-
1 illustrates this requirement.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1091.png]
 
            1.   Lots indicated with the number one must use a different
elevation and color scheme than the subject property, however, they may use the
same trim color as the subject property.
            2.   Lots indicated with the number two must use a different color
scheme than the subject property, however, they may use the same trim color and
brick or stone color as the subject property. These lots may use the same
building elevation as the subject property.
            3.   Lots indicated with the number three may use the same
elevation and color scheme as the subject property.
         (b)   In determining if a building elevation meets these standards,
the reviewer evaluates differentiation in the colors of the (1) siding; (2)
siding accents; (3) trim; (4) front door; (5) shutters; and (6) brick or stone.
      (3)   Perimeter lot enhancements. These standards are intended to improve
the appearance at the interface between new residential developments and
existing perimeter streets. Long, straight lines of homes, berming, or
landscaping parallel to perimeter streets is discouraged. Homes facing the
perimeter street and variation in the distance between homes and perimeter
streets is encouraged.
         (c)   For purposes of this section, a perimeter lot includes lots
abutting a perimeter street or a common area abutting a perimeter street. If a
lot abutting a common area is not within the viewshed from the perimeter
street, then the perimeter lot standards do not apply.
         (d)   Homes of the same elevation and color scheme are not permitted
next to each other. Additionally, the home color scheme may not be repeated for
two homes on either side of the subject home. In Figure 6-1, the homes located
on the same side of the street as the subject lot illustrate this requirement.
      (4)   Corner lot enhancements. Corner lot side facades adjacent to the
street must have similar architectural design and detailing as the front
facade. Additionally, landscape plantings of at least one shade tree, one
ornamental or evergreen tree, and five shrubs may be installed in lieu of the
architectural detailing.
   (B)   Architectural standards for non-residential uses in residential
districts. All nonresidential uses in a residential district must comply with
the following:
      (1)   To ensure compatibility of nonresidential uses with surrounding
residential uses in residential districts, all nonresidential uses must use
exterior building materials, roof line treatments and roofing materials
compatible and consistent with the residential character and building materials
of the surrounding residential area.
      (2)   Loading spaces or loading docks must not face a street.
      (3)   Loading spaces or loading docks facing a side or rear lot line of
an adjoining residential district must be screened from view from the
residential district (see §
154.110(H)).
   (C)   Architectural standards for multi-family dwellings. All new multi-
family buildings containing five or more dwellings must comply with the
following:
      (1)   Design detailing must continue completely around the building
consistent with the intended architectural style. Detailing elements include,
but are not limited to, number and style of windows, window placement, trim
detailing, roof design, and exterior materials.
      (2)   Permitted exterior materials include Exterior Insulation and Finish
System (EIFS), synthetic stucco, masonry materials, wood, fiber cement siding,
and polymeric cladding. Aluminum and vinyl siding are prohibited.
      (3)   At least 75% of each building facade, excluding windows and doors,
must be masonry materials or fiber cement siding.
      (4)   Each building facade must utilize at least two different exterior
building materials (excluding window, door, and roofing materials), colors, or
patterns.
      (5)   Windows: A building facade must incorporate a minimum of one window
(a minimum of 15 square feet) per dwelling unit located along the building
fagade. Required windows may be located anywhere on the building facade, as
architecturally appropriate. All windows must have shutters matching the size
of the window or casing at least three inches in width. Windows in a building
facade of a masonry material must have a casing or sill of natural or masonry
material. Windows in a building facade of a non-masonry material must be
trimmed to match the architectural style of the building.
      (6)   Roof design.
         (a)   The roof pitch of the main roof must be at least 6:12. Elements
such as porches, bays, walkways, may have a lower roof pitch. Lower roof
pitches may occur on rear elevations if concealed by side roof elements.
         (b)   The roof overhangs must be at least 11 inches, as measured prior
to the installation of masonry materials.
         (c)   The roof form and pitch design of a building must include, where
appropriate, varied pitches and ridge levels according to the intended
architectural style of the building and the building facade projections.
      (7)   Streetscape diversity.
         (a)   Building elevations of similar floor plans must have variety in
style, massing, use of materials, and detailing of elements. The same elevation
may occur as buildings are grouped together if each building plan has a minimum
of two different elevation styles.
         (b)   If more than one building is proposed, then the building(s) must
be located so no more than two buildings are in a straight, unbroken line. An
unbroken line includes an offset in the building setback at least one-third the
height of the adjacent building.
   (D)   The Plan Commission may adjust or waive the above requirements to
allow a cohesive design consistent with the architectural style of the building
and the intent of these regulations.

§ 154.148 BUSINESS AND MIXED-USE ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS.
   All new nonresidential buildings or additions located within a business
district must comply with the following:
   (A)   Buildings and structures within a single development should have
complementary architectural themes.
   (B)   All roof or ground mounted mechanical equipment must be completely
enclosed. Ground-mounted enclosures must be landscaped on all sides not facing
the building being served according to §
154.110(H).
   (C)   Each building facade visible from a street or oriented to an adjoining
residential or agricultural district must be:
      (1)   One hundred percent masonry materials, excluding window, door,
roofing, fascia, and soffit materials; or
      (2)   Incorporate two or more building materials, excluding window,
display window, door, and roofing materials, provided 60% of the building
facade is masonry materials.
      (3)   For all other building facades, up to 25% of the facade, exclusive
of windows (including faux windows and glazing), doors and loading berths, may
be covered with metal, fiber cement siding, polymeric cladding, EIFS, stucco,
or vinyl exterior building materials.
      (4)   The exterior building material selection for all building facades
must be further enhanced with: (i) the use of multiple colors, multiple
textures (e.g., rough, smooth, striated, etc.); or (ii) the addition of
architectural elements (e.g., quoins, pilasters, soldier courses, lintels,
friezes, cornices, dentils, architraves, etc.).
      (5)   Loading spaces, loading docks, or oversized service doors are
prohibited on building facades facing public streets. However, if all building
facades are determined to be facing public streets, then loading spaces,
loading docks, or oversized service doors may be permitted on the facade least
visible from a public street if screened according to §
154.110(H).
   (D)   All building facades visible from an adjacent lot or street must be
constructed with the same building material quality and level of architectural
detail on all building facades (e.g., 360-degree architecture).
   (E)   All building facades must have a defined base or foundation, a middle
or modulated wall, and a top formed by a pitched roof or articulated, cornice
or molding. Building facades 90 feet or greater in length must have offsets at
intervals no greater than 60 feet apart. Buildings less than 10,000 square feet
in gross floor area must have offsets at no more than 40-foot intervals.
Offsets can project or recess. They must extend the entire vertical plane of
the building facade. The offset must be at least four feet in depth and at
least 20% of the overall building facade length. Architectural elements (e.g.,
arcades, columns, piers, etc.) meeting the offset requirements may be used to
fulfill this requirement.
   (F)   Gutters and downspouts must be visually integrated with the
architectural style of the structure. The color of gutters and downspouts
should complement or be consistent with the building materials.
   (G)   Pitched roof designs must have a main roof with a minimum 5:12 pitch,
contain three or more roof slope planes, and be covered with high quality
roofing materials such as natural clay tiles, slate, concrete tiles (with
natural texture and color), high quality standing seam metal roofing, wood
shakes or shingles (with adequate fire protection), three-dimensional asphalt
or fiberglass shingles.
   (H)   Metal roofs must have a low-gloss finish to reduce glare.
   (I)   Flat roof designs must be edged by a parapet wall with an articulated,
three-dimensional cornice or molding. Parapet walls must be fully integrated
into the building's architectural design to create seamless transitions between
the main building mass and roof-mounted architectural elements. Modulation or
variation of the roofs and/or roof lines is required to eliminate the
appearance of box-shaped buildings. Flat roofs are prohibited for one-story
buildings unless otherwise approved by the Plan Commission after consideration
of the building architecture, context, and sensitivity to the character of the
area.
   (J)   All visible vents, attic ventilators, turbines, flues, and other
visible roof penetrations must be painted to match the color of the roof or
flat black; and oriented to minimize their visibility from adjacent lots and
streets.
   (K)   Building entrances must be clearly defined and articulated by multiple
architectural elements such as lintels, pediments, pilasters, columns, awnings,
porticos, and other design elements appropriate to the architectural style and
details of the building. The location, orientation, proportion, and style of
doors must complement the style of the building.
   (L)   Window designs must be compatible with the style, materials, color,
details, and proportion of the building. The number of window panes, the number
of window openings, window trim and other design elements to accent the windows
must be consistent and complementary to the architectural style of the
building.
   (M)   Window trim and other design elements to accent the windows are
required for all windows. Acceptable design elements include shutters,
keystones, masonry arches, awnings, decorative stone frames, masonry rowlock
frames, or other trim or design elements as approved by the Plan Commission or
Administrator.
   (N)   Fixed or retractable awnings are permitted if they complement the
building's architectural style, material, colors, and details. Awnings must be
made of a nonreflective material kept in good repair. Awnings used to comply
with the architectural design requirements of this chapter cannot be removed
unless the building facade otherwise complies with the architectural design
requirements without the awnings.
   (O)   The support structures for gasoline service station canopies must be
wrapped in material(s) complementing the principal building and the canopy roof
materials must match the color and texture of the principal building. To reduce
the visual impact of the canopy, the clearance between the underside of the
canopy and ground cannot exceed 16 feet and the canopy facia cannot be more
than 30 feet wide.
   (P)   The Plan Commission may adjust or waive the above requirements to
allow a cohesive design consistent with the architectural style of the building
and the intent of these regulations.
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.149 INDUSTRIAL ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS.
   All new nonresidential buildings or building additions located within an
industrial district must comply with the following:
   (A)   Buildings and structures within a single development should have
complementary architectural themes.
   (B)   All roof or ground mounted mechanical equipment must be completely
enclosed. Ground-mounted enclosures must be landscaped on all sides not facing
the building served according to §
154.110(H).
   (C)   Each building facade visible from a street or oriented to an adjoining
residential district, must have at least 60% masonry materials on the building
facade (exclusive of window and doors).
   (D)   Building facades 90 feet or greater in length, must have offsets at
intervals no greater than 60 feet apart. Offsets can project or recess. They
must extend the entire vertical plane of the building facade. The offset must
be at least 12 inches in depth and be at least 20% of the overall building
facade length. Architectural elements (e.g., arcades, columns, pilasters, etc.)
meeting the offset requirements may be used to fulfill this requirement.
   (E)   Loading spaces, loading docks or oversized service doors are
prohibited on a facade visible from a public street.
   (F)   If materials other than masonry materials are used on any building
facade, then the building facade must be enhanced with: (i) the use of multiple
colors and textures (e.g., rough, smooth, striated, etc.); or (ii) the addition
of architectural elements (e.g., quoins, pilasters, soldier courses, lintels,
friezes, cornices, dentils, architraves, etc.).
   (G)   The Plan Commission may adjust or waive the above requirements to
allow a cohesive design consistent with the architectural style of the building

§ 154.150 BLOCK STANDARDS.
   (A)   Dimensions. Block length and width within bounding streets must be
sufficient to accommodate the lot sizes required by the zoning district and to
provide convenient access, circulation, and safety of vehicular and pedestrian
traffic.
   (B)   Length. The maximum block length is 800 feet. This requirement does
not apply to blocks containing lots abutting the boundary lines of the parent
track of a subdivision. In granting modifications to allow blocks longer than
800 feet, the Plan Commission may require crosswalks and traffic calming
measures where useful to facilitate pedestrian circulation.
   (C)   Depth. Residential blocks must have sufficient depth to accommodate
two tiers of lots, except where reverse frontage lots bordering on a freeway,
arterial street or floodplain are used.
   (D)   Shape. Blocks should fit easily into the overall design of the
subdivision and their design must reflect consideration of lot layout,
configuration, traffic flow, and public areas.

§ 154.151 DRAINAGE STANDARDS.
   A drainage system is required for proper drainage of new developments. The
system must be designed and constructed per §
154.300.
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.152 EASEMENT STANDARDS,
   This section applies to all development.
   (A)   Drainage and utility easements. All developments submitted for
approval must allocate areas for drainage and utility easements. All easements
and corresponding utility location plans must be complete and approved prior to
the final approval of any plan. When located between lots, easements should be
centered on the lot line so each lot is encumbered by half the easement width,
unless otherwise approved by the Administrator or the appropriate utility
provider. Before determining the location of easements, the plan must be
discussed with the local public utility companies to assure proper placement
and installation of such services. No improvements (e.g., accessory buildings,
buildings, driveways, fences, retaining walls, structures) are permitted within
a drainage and utility easement, unless otherwise granted an encroachment
permit.
   (B)   Surface drainage. If any stream or necessary surface drainage course
is within the development area, an easement is established along all sides of
the drainage course according to the County Surveyor or Indiana law if a
regulated drain, or 20 feet per side (measured from the top of bank) if not a
regulated drain. The easement is for widening, deepening, sloping, improving,
or protecting the stream or surface drainage course.
   (C)   Easement instrument specifications. Where an easement is required by
this chapter but the standards for the easement type are not specified, or an
easement is required per a commitment or condition of approval, then the
property owner ("grantor") must execute the easement instrument in favor of the
appropriate party or entity ("grantee"). The instrument must:
      (1)   Specify the docket numbers of the complete applications of the
associated with the easement;
      (2)   Specify the activities the grantee is authorized to perform in the
easement;
      (3)   Specify the activities the grantor is prohibited from performing in
the easement;
      (4)   Be binding on all heirs, successors, and assigns to the property
where the easement is located;
      (5)   Be enforceable by the grantee and the town;
      (6)   Specify other specially affected persons and classes of specially
affected persons entitled to enforce the easement;
      (7)   Provide for modification in the manner stipulated in this chapter;
      (8)   Be cross-referenced to the most recently recorded deed to the
property where the easement is to be established;
      (9)   Include a metes and bounds description of the easement;
      (10)   Be signed by an authorized representative of the property owner of
record granting the easement and by an authorized representative of the grantee
accepting the easement.
   (D)   Easement certificate.
      (1)   When a secondary plat is being recorded, the applicant may print an
easement certificate on the secondary plat, the content of which has been
approved by the Administrator or Town Council.
      (2)   If a declaration of covenants, conditions, and restrictions is
included or cross-referenced on the secondary plat, an easement certificate
must be clearly separate from, and not incorporated into, the declaration of
covenants, conditions, and restrictions.
   (E)   Cross-access easements.
      (1)   Easement instrument specifications. When required by this chapter,
each property owner ("grantor") must execute a cross-access easement instrument
in favor of the adjoining property owner ("grantee"). The instrument must:
         (a)   Specify the docket numbers of the complete applications and/or
the project numbers of the permits associated with the easement;
         (b)   Grant the public the right to utilize the easement for purposes
of accessing adjoining parking facilities;
         (c)   Prohibit the parking of vehicles within the easement;
         (d)   Prohibit any person from placing any obstruction within the
easement;
         (e)   Be binding on all heirs, successors, and assigns to the
properties where the easement is located;
         (f)   Be enforceable by each party to the easement and by the town;
         (g)   Specify any other specially affected persons and classes of
specially affected persons that are entitled to enforce the easement;
         (h)   Provide for modification or termination in the manner stipulated
in this subchapter;
         (i)   Be cross-referenced to the most recently recorded deeds to the
properties where the easement is to be established;
         (j)   Include a metes and bounds description of the easement;

existing streets not conforming to the minimum right-of-way dimensions
established in the Thoroughfare Plan, must dedicate enough additional right-of-
way along the streets to meet the requirements of the Thoroughfare Plan. If the
development only contains property on one side of the street, then sufficient
right-of-way must be dedicated to bring the half right-of-way up to the
dimensions required in the Thoroughfare Plan.
      (1)   Passing blister. Where a passing blister is required and inadequate
right-of-way exists to install the passing blister, then the developer must
make a good faith effort to acquire property sufficient for the installation of

and/ or deceleration lane is required and the development does not contain
street frontage needed to install the lane, then the developer must make a good
faith effort to acquire property sufficient for the installation of the
acceleration lane and/or deceleration lane. If the property owners where the
acceleration lane and/or a deceleration lane is to be installed refuses to sell
the property, then the developer must provide the department copies of all
surveys, appraisals, written offers made by the developer to the property
owners, and correspondence from the property owners.

lanes, and deceleration lanes is vital to the health, safety, and welfare of
the motoring public. The town may, but is not obligated to, begin eminent
domain proceedings according to I.C. 32-24 for the acquisition of public right-
of-way sufficient for the installation of the passing blister, acceleration
lane and/or deceleration lane upon receipt of documentation illustrating the
developer's failure to acquire the needed property. Upon completion of the
eminent domain proceedings, the developer reimburses the town the price paid by
the town for the right-of-way acquisition, including professional and legal
expenses, any condemnation and relocation within the acquired right-of-way. The
developer then installs the passing blister, acceleration lane and/or
deceleration lane according to the town's Construction Standards.
   (E)   Private streets.

features, such as existing wooded areas, streams and creeks, historic
locations, or similar conditions that, if preserved, will add attractiveness
and value to the community.
      (3)   Streets must align and connect with existing or planned streets and
provide for connections with adjacent property. Where appropriate, proposed
streets must extend to the boundary line of the premises to provide for normal
circulation of traffic within the vicinity. Regard must be given to the
Thoroughfare Plan and Comprehensive Plan. Cul-de-sacs are discouraged and are
only permitted where street continuation is prevented due to topography or
other physical condition, or unless the Plan Commission finds such extension is
unnecessary for the coordination of development within the development or
between the development and adjoining property.
   (G)   Improvement standards. Streets must conform to the following:

required by the cross-sections and the work must be performed in the manner
prescribed in the Indiana Department of Transportation's Standard
Specifications.
         (c)   Where parkways or special types of streets are involved, the
Plan Commission may apply special standards to be followed in their design.
      (3)   Cul-de-sac design. Cul-de-sacs must conform to the following
standards:
         (a)   The maximum length of a cul-de-sac is 600 feet, measured along
the centerline from the center of the circle to the intersection of the nearest
through street.

proposed to be extended but is not yet constructed. An adequate easement or
right-of-way for a turn-around must be provided if the dead-end street extends
150 feet or more in length. If an easement, is used it must automatically
vacate to the abutting property owners when the street is extended.
         (e)   The Plan Commission or Administrator may require a pathway or
sidewalk to connect a cul-de-sac to an adjacent cul-de-sac or street to provide
reasonably direct connection between likely pedestrian destinations. Such
connection must be constructed according to §
154.155 and located within an easement or common area.
      (4)   Alleys. Alleys must be constructed according to the §
154.200, unless otherwise approved by the Town Council.
      (5)   Intersections. Street intersections must be designed and improved
according to §
154.146. Lot line corners must be rounded by arcs with minimum radii in
accordance §
154.146.
      (6)   Access points. The following standards apply to access points for a
development. The Plan Commission, Town Council, or Administrator may approve
access points if, due to the size of the development, or appropriate to improve
traffic circulation:
         (a)   Only one street, driveway or point of vehicle access is
permitted from a development onto an arterial or collector;
         (b)   The primary access for a multifamily development must be from an
arterial or collector, if available, and at least two access points must be
provided for adequate accessibility for emergency vehicles and school busses;
         (c)   Direct access from a residential driveway to any arterial or
collector is discouraged unless it is the lot's only means of access.
      (7)   Traffic control devices. Traffic control devices must comply with
the current edition of the Indiana Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
      (8)   Subsurface drainage. Subsurface drainage for streets must be
designed according to the town's Construction Standards.
   (H)   Delay of surface layer. Installation of the surface layer of asphalt
may be delayed with permission of the town up to the earlier of: (1) one year
or (2) until 80% of the lots within a section have been issued a building
permit. A separate performance bond covering the cost of installing the surface
layer of asphalt is required prior to approving the delayed installation.
   (I)   Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants must be provided throughout the
development as determined by the Bargersville Fire Department.
   (J)   Acceptance of improvements. Before any financial surety (see §
154.161) covering a street installation is released, the Plan Commission, Town
Council, or Administrator may request core borings for thickness determination.
The developer must engage the services of an independent testing laboratory to
take cores at locations selected by the town. The results of the testing must
be provided to the Administrator for review and approval.
   (K)   Rail corridors. The following regulations apply to all property
abutting a current or former railroad property line ("rail corridor"):
      (1)   The Administrator will work with owners of property adjacent to a
rail corridor should any question of development arise. Any new development
proposal adjacent to a rail corridor requiring an improvement location permit
or site plan review must be brought to the attention of the Administrator, who
will address this section with the applicant. The Administrator will then
inform the Director of the Parks Department and Town Council of the proposed
development.
      (2)   For any activity requiring an improvement location permit, the
Administrator will work with owners of property adjacent to a rail corridor
regarding setback, landscaping and any other development standards deemed
appropriate for the future development of the rail corridor and for the
property owner. For new development proposals adjacent to a rail corridor
requiring an improvement location permit or site plan review, the Administrator
will work with the applicant to determine how the rail corridor will be used
regarding setback, landscaping and any other development standards deemed
appropriate by the Administrator.
      (3)   The town will work with any rail corridor property owner that can
show best title as determined by a court of law with the intent of protecting
the rail corridor right-of-way for the use as presented in the Thoroughfare
Plan in a way that is beneficial to all.
      (4)   Any agreement must be approved by the Council and incorporated into
the town's plan approval process.
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.157 STREET STANDARDS.
   (A)   Principles. In designing a street system, the applicant is guided by
the following principles:
      (1)   Adequate vehicular and pedestrian access must be provided to all
parcels.
      (2)   Street connections into and from adjacent areas may be required.
      (3)   Local street patterns must provide reasonable direct access to the
primary circulation system.
      (4)   Interior circulation systems and land development patterns cannot
conflict with the efficiency of bordering arterial routes.
      (5)   Elements in the local circulation system should be designed with
the least amount of interruptions possible in order to function effectively and
safely.
      (6)   Planning and construction of streets must clearly relate to their
local function.
      (7)   Local streets are designed to discourage excessive speeds.
      (8)   Pedestrian-vehicular conflict points should be minimized.
      (9)   The number of intersections should be minimized.
      (10)   Local streets are designed to minimize impacts to significant
topographic features.
   (B)   Standards.
      (1)   Current INDOT standards, guides, and manuals are followed as design
standards unless otherwise specified in this chapter.
      (2)   Only one street, driveway or point of vehicle access is permitted
from a subdivision onto a collector street or road or an arterial street or
road for a subdivision of 50 or fewer lots. Two or more streets, driveways, or
points of vehicle access are required by the Plan Commission for subdivisions
with over 50 lots to improve the safety and traffic circulation in the area.
      (3)   Subdivisions with over 50 lots must include streets with a
boulevard design if a second entrance is not feasible due to the character of
the land, provided the internal street geometrics provides two access points at
its termination inside the development. Stub streets must be provided for any
future undeveloped land.
      (4)   Subdivisions with over 100 lots must provide internal circulation
routes which provide redundant or alternative access to multiple entrances.
      (5)   Half streets are not permitted.
      (6)   All street names and lot addresses are coordinated through the 911
Coordinator for the County and local postal service. No street names may be
used which will duplicate or be confused with names of existing streets, unless
considered exceptions by the Plan Commission. The streets, which are logical
extensions, continuations of, or alignment with any existing streets, either
constructed or appearing on any validly recorded plat, must bear the names of
such existing streets. Street addresses must be provided for every lot
conforming to the town and 911 coordinator's addressing standards.
      (7)   Rights-of-way and paving for proposed streets must be extended to
the boundary lines of the proposed subdivision so a connection can be made to
all adjacent properties unless such extension is not feasible because of
topography or other physical conditions, or unless, in the Plan Commission's
opinion, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination with
existing streets or the most advantageous development of adjacent tracts.
      (8)   Subdivisions cannot be designed to create or perpetuate the land-
locking of adjacent undeveloped land. Connectivity must be considered and
planned.
      (9)   A temporarily dead-end street is permitted in any case where a
street is proposed to be and should logically be extended but is not yet
constructed. A stub street with a dead-end sign is provided in this case
terminate in a temporary cul-de-sac with a minimum street radius of 50 feet or
hammerhead turnaround unless otherwise waived by the Plan Commission.
      (10)   In subdivisions that adjoin or include existing streets that do
not conform to the minimum right-of-way dimensions as established by this
chapter, the subdivider dedicates additional width along either one or both
sides to ensure conformance, provided the area to be used for widening is owned
by the subdivider or under the subdivider's control.
      (11)   Refer to §
154.099 for line-of-sight design requirements on corner lots.
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.158 STREET LIGHT STANDARDS.
   (A)   Street lights must be installed at all intersections, development
entrances, and along internal streets as required by the provisions of this
section. The Plan Commission may direct street lights at other locations if it
determines they are necessary to provide vehicular or pedestrian safety.
   (B)   Street lights providing the illumination necessary for vehicular and
pedestrian safety at all intersections within the development must be installed
per the town's Construction Standards and the public utility providing the
lighting. The Plan Commission may reduce the number of intersections required
to have street lighting. The provision of street lights at major intersections
involving collectors or arterials within the development cannot be waived.
   (C)   Lighting between intersections must be accomplished by:
      (1)   Installing street lights at the midpoint of the block or every 15
lots, whichever provides the shorter spacing between street lights;
      (2)   Installation of dusk-to-dawn lights on the street-side of each home
with such lights maintained in good operating condition by the property owner
in perpetuity; or
      (3)   A combination of the above options.
   (D)   If the town has established a street light standard along the street
where the entrance is located, the development must install the same lighting
standard. Luminaires must be shielded to prevent glare on residential
properties.
   (E)   Decorative street lights may differ from the town's Construction
Standards if approved by the Town Council. Decorative street lights must be
installed at the expense of the developer and maintained by the property
owners' association. An agreement between the town and the property owner's
association is required establishing that the property owner's association is
responsible for replacing the decorative street lights and poles when the
original street lights installed are lost or damaged. If the town or public
utility providing the lighting must replace a street light, it is not obligated
to use a decorative street light.
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.159 STREET SIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Streets must have the minimum number of street signs necessary to
create a safe environment for drivers and pedestrians and convey information to
efficiently find a certain street or address.
   (B)   A street name sign is required at each intersection within and at the
perimeter of the development.
   (C)   Street signs must comply with the current edition of the Indiana
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and the town's Construction
Standards. A street sign cannot be installed on top of stop signs.
   (D)   Street name and regulatory signs must be installed prior to any street
being opened to the public or the issuance of building permits within the
development section.
   (E)   Decorative street signs may differ from the town's Construction
Standards if approved by the Town Council. Decorative street signs must be
installed at the expense of the developer and maintained by the property
owners' association. An agreement between the town and the property owner's
association is required to establish that the property owner's association is
responsible for replacing the decorative street signs and poles when the
original signs installed are lost or damaged. If the town must replace a street
sign, it is not obligated to install a decorative sign.
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.160 UTILITY STANDARDS.
   (A)   This section applies to all development including, subdivisions,
improvement location permits and site plans.
   (B)   Public sanitary sewer and water hook-ups are required for development
in all zoning districts. Private septic systems must be approved by the Town
Council.
   (C)   Utilities must be installed underground in designated utility
easements or rights-of-way.
   (D)   Prior to approval of the primary plat or site plan, the applicant must
provide proof that each utility provider has the capacity and ability to serve
the property.
   (E)   Development must provide for the collection of all sanitary sewage
discharges by the installation of sanitary sewers. These sewers must be tied
into a public sanitary sewer system and constructed within right-of-way and/or
dedicated sewer and utility easements. When a public sanitary sewer is not
available, the Town Council may approve a septic sewer system on an individual
lot provided it is constructed to the requirements of the County Health
Department.
   (F)   Development must provide a complete water main supply system connected
to a municipal or a community water supply system approved by the County Health
Department. When a municipal or community water supply is not available, the
Town Council may approve an individual water supply on each lot provided it is
constructed to the requirements of the County Health Department.
(Ord. 2022-17, passed 7-19-2022)
§ 154.161 SURETY STANDARDS.
   (A)   As a condition of approval of a subdivision, site plan, special
exception, or planned development, a financial guarantee may be required to
assure the installation the improvements such as streets, curbing, landscaping,
fencing, walls, screening, lighting, drainage facilities, sidewalks, driveways,
utilities, and similar items.
   (B)   A bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or other guarantee acceptable to
the town ("financial surety") must be executed prior to issuing an improvement
location permit for single site developments or recording a secondary plat
prior to the completion of improvements.
   (C)   Construction/performance surety.
      (1)   A performance surety to the town must include any street, sidewalk,
pathway, storm sewer, erosion control, drainage facility, or any other facility
to be dedicated to the town. On-site and off-site improvements shown on the
approved plans must be covered by the performance surety.
      (2)   The performance surety must:
         (a)   Be 120% of the estimated costs determined by the town to be
sufficient to complete the improvements in compliance with this chapter and the
town's Construction Standards;
         (b)   Provide surety satisfactory to the town;
         (c)   Run to and be in favor of the town;
         (d)   Specify the time for the completion of all improvements; and
         (e)   Be on a form approved by the Council.
      (3)   Performance sureties must be effective from the date of approval to
begin construction of the project and must not terminate until released by the
Town Council. The performance surety must not be released until the Department
certifies the improvements have been installed according to the intent of the
approved construction plans.
      (4)   A dedicated account is created in a form acceptable to the State
Board of Accounts to hold and accumulate all funds paid pursuant to the
provisions of this section. Funds appropriated from the account must only be
used for the completion of infrastructure improvements approved by the town and
which had not been completed after having been initiated.
      (5)   The town may consider alternative forms of ensuring the proper
completion of improvements to be dedicated to the town or for the benefit of
the public.
      (6)   Upon completion of all improvements and installations as required
by this subchapter, the subdivider furnishes appropriate documentation
indicating that required improvements and installations have been constructed,
installed, and completed in compliance with the provisions of this subchapter,
the requirement of the Plan Commission and the provisions of other applicable
ordinances of the Town of Bargersville. The Plan Commission prescribes
procedures for determining whether all improvements, installations, and lot
improvements have been constructed and completed as required by this
subchapter.
      (7)   Upon acceptance of required improvements or installation, the
accepting agency or department of the Town of Bargersville provides a
completion letter to the subdivider that officially accepts maintenance
responsibility, subject to the terms of the required maintenance guarantees.
      (8)   Two months prior to the expiration of the performance or
maintenance guarantee, the Town Council determines if the public improvements
have been installed consistent with applicable standards and special conditions
or requirements, if any, established by the Town Council in approving the plat.
If the improvements have not been installed to the satisfaction of the Town
Council, the Council notifies the subdivider of their intent to secure the
funds pledged by the performance or maintenance guarantee, or at their
discretion, to grant one extension for a period up to 12 months, and the
subdivider files with the Town Council a new performance or maintenance
guarantee within the extension period. The Council may upon proof of
difficulty, grant one additional extension of the completion date for a maximum
period of up to 12 additional months, provided that the performance or
maintenance guarantee submitted for this extension period meets all other
requirements herein and the extension has been requested in writing prior to
the expiration of the first extension.
      (9)   Failure to complete public improvements. In cases where a
performance guarantee has been posted and the required public improvements have
not been installed within its terms, or if the Council finds upon inspection
that any of the improvements have not been constructed according to the
approved construction plans, then the Council may thereupon declare the
performance guarantee to be in default and cause all public improvements to be
installed according to secondary approval regardless of the extent to which
development has occurred at that point in time.
      (10)   Release or reduction of performance guarantee. A performance
guarantee may be reduced upon actual acceptance of public improvements and any
conditions imposed on the plat and then only by the amount originally estimated
for the completion of said public improvements. The Town Council cannot accept
required public improvements, nor reduce a performance guarantee, until the
subdivider has submitted a certificate attesting to satisfactory completion and
the subdivider's engineer or surveyor has provided the Council with certified
"as built" construction plans of the public improvements including the
utilities, indicating location, dimensions, materials, and other information
required by the Council and reviewed by the Town Engineer or representative.
Upon certification and evidence of satisfactory completion, the Administrator
recommends acceptance to the Town Council and the Town Council accepts the
applicable public improvements for maintenance according to established
procedures.
      (11)   Temporary public improvements. The subdivider must build and pay
all costs for temporary public improvements required by the Town Council and
must maintain the same for the period specified. Prior to construction of any
temporary public facility or improvement, the subdivider files with the Town
Council a separate suitable performance guarantee for temporary facilities,
which insures that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed,
maintained, and removed (except for turnaround at ends of the peripheral stub
streets intended for connection into adjacent future subdivisions).
   (D)   Maintenance surety.
      (1)   When the improvements are completed and accepted by the town, the
performance surety may be released. For three years after the date of
improvements were accepted by the town or applicable agency, the developer must
make all repairs to the improvements which may become necessary due to improper
workmanship or materials. Such maintenance does not include any damage to
improvements resulting from forces or circumstances beyond the control of the
developer.
      (2)   The developer must provide a maintenance surety to the town for any
street, sidewalk, pathway, storm sewer, erosion control, drainage facility, or
any other facility dedicated to the town. On-site and off-site improvements
shown on the approved plans must be covered by the maintenance surety.
      (3)   The maintenance surety must:
         (a)   Run to and be in favor of the town;
         (b)   Be in a sum of not less than 25% of the performance bonds
amount;
         (c)   Provide surety satisfactory to the town;
         (d)   Warrant the workmanship and materials used in the installation
of the improvements;
         (e)   Include a certification from the developer that all improvements
have been made according to the approved plans.
      (4)   Maintenance sureties are effective from the date of acceptance and
must not terminate until the Public Works Department certifies inspection and
approval of the improvements.
   (E)   Waiver of required public improvements. The Town Council may defer or
waive at the time of primary approval, subject to the appropriate conditions,
the provision of any or all such public improvements as in its judgment, are
not requisite in the interest of the public health, safety, and general
welfare, or are inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack of connecting
facilities.
   (F)   Use of funds. Any funds received from the performance and maintenance
guarantees can only be used for making improvements, installations or repairs
that were guaranteed by a bond or irrevocable letter of credit.

PROCESS AND ADMINISTRATION
§ 154.180 PROCESS.
   (A)   General provisions.
      (1)   Purpose. This chapter outlines the procedure for approvals,
permits, administration, and enforcement, as set forth in this chapter.
      (2)   Application. Application and informational packets may be obtained
through the Department and/or online through the town's website.
      (3)   Fees. A schedule of fees for applications, permits, and other
purposes required by this chapter is established by the Town Council and kept
in the office of the Administrator. Until all applicable fees, charges and
expenses have been paid in full, no final action can be taken on any
application or permit. This requirement applies not only to fees due for the
specific application or permit, but also to fees and fines owed relative to any
previously issued permit or violation of this chapter. Any person initiating
construction of a structure before obtaining an improvement location permit or
other required permit must pay twice the amount of the current permit fee.
      (4)   Public meetings. Applications requiring public meetings are filed
according to the adopted schedule of meeting and filing dates and subject to
the rules of procedure of the applicable hearing body.
      (5)   Permits and licenses void if in conflict. Any permit or license
issued in conflict with the provisions of this chapter are considered null and
void from the date of issue.
   (B)   Administrative determination.
      (1)   Purpose. The interpretation authority established by this chapter
recognizes that the provisions of this chapter, though detailed, cannot address
every specific situation to which they may have to be applied. Many such
situations can be addressed by an interpretation of the specific provisions of
this chapter considering the general and specific purposes for which those
provisions have been enacted. The interpretation authority established is an
administrative, not legislative, authority. It is not intended to add to or
change the essential content of this chapter. It is intended only to allow
authoritative application of content to specific cases.
      (2)   Applicability. Any person having a legal or equitable interest in
property that gives rise to the need for an interpretation may file an
application for an administrative determination. Interpretations based on
hypothetical circumstances or where the interpretation would have no effect
other than as an advisory opinion will not be entertained. The Administrator
may render interpretations of the provisions of this chapter and of any rule or
regulation issued according to it ("administrative interpretation" or
"administrative determination") by written order, subject to the procedures,
standards, and limitations of this chapter.
      (3)   Application procedures.
         (a)   Application. Applications for interpretations of this chapter
are filed according to the requirements of this article.
         (b)   Action on application. Within ten working days of the submission
of a completed application, the Administrator provides the applicant a
determination in writing, stating the specific precedent, reasons, and analysis
upon which the determination is based. Failure of the Administrator to act
within ten working days is deemed a decision denying the application.
         (c)   Records. Records of all applications for determinations are kept
on file in the office of the Administrator and may be recorded in the Office of
the Johnson County Recorder at the Director's discretion.
         (d)   Appeal. Appeals of interpretations rendered by the Administrator
are made according to division (C).
      (4)   Decision criteria. The following standards are considered when
issuing determinations:
         (a)   A use will not be permitted in a zoning district unless evidence
is presented that demonstrates:
            1.   The use is consistent with the purpose and intent of the
zoning district;
            2.   The use will comply with the general regulations established
for the zoning district; and
            3.   The use is like other uses permitted in the zoning district
and is more similar to those uses than to uses permitted in a more restrictive
zoning district.
         (b)   If a proposed use is most like a use permitted only as a special
exception in the zoning district where it is proposed to be located, the use
requires special exception approval according to division (H).
      (5)   Effect of favorable interpretations. A determination permitting a
proposed use does not authorize the establishment of a use nor the development,
construction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but only
authorizes the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any
permits and approvals that may be required by this chapter and other town

the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      (5)   Plan Commission action. Following the public hearing, the Plan
Commission may either forward the application to the Town Council with a
favorable recommendation, an unfavorable recommendation, or no recommendation
according to Indiana Code; or continue the request to a subsequent Plan
Commission meeting. The application may be continued by the Plan Commission
based on a request by the Administrator, applicant, remonstrator, or interested
party; an indecisive vote, or a determination by the Plan Commission that
additional information is required prior to acting on the request. The
continuing of applications and any potential additional legal notice must be
consistent with the Plan Commission's Rules and Procedure.
      (6)   Commitments. The Plan Commission may require the property owner to
make written commitments concerning the use or development of the property (see
division (D)).
      (7)   Certification. The Plan Commission certifies its recommendation to
the Town Council according to Indiana Code. The Administrator forwards the Plan
Commission certification, the application and supporting information, any
Department reports regarding the application, and an ordinance to the Town
Council for consideration.
      (8)   Town Council action. The Town Council reviews the rezoning
application and materials forwarded from the Plan Commission and may either
approve or deny the ordinance. If the Town Council fails to act within 90 days
of the Plan Commission's certification, and the applicant has not otherwise
withdrawn the request or requested additional consideration by the Plan
Commission, the rezone ordinance becomes effective or be defeated with the
provisions of I.C. 36-7-4-608. The Town Council may also seek modifications or
additions to any written commitments permitted by this chapter.
      (9)   Effect of approvals of PUD Ordinance. A PUD Ordinance becomes
effective after its approval by the Town Council and is recorded by the town in
the Office of the Recorder of Johnson County, Indiana. The Zoning Map is
amended accordingly. The use and development of the property are then governed
by the PUD ordinance, subject to review and approval of subsequent permits and
approvals as required by this section and chapter, and any other regulatory
processes which may be required prior to beginning construction within the PUD.
      (10)   Site plan approval. Site plan approval, as set forth in division
(G), is required for all PUDs. Site plans must conform to the approved PUD
ordinance and this chapter. An application for site plan approval must be filed
within 18 months of PUD ordinance approval. If needed, applicants may seek a
time extension of up to 18 months from the Town Council.

            1.   Multi-family developments or buildings containing seven units
or more;
            2.   Structures other than buildings (including towers and
antennas);
            3.   Parking lots containing more than ten spaces.
         (c)   The Administrator determines what level site plan review is
required by the proposed project. The Administrator may defer Level A approvals
to the Plan Commission. The Plan Commission may delegate Level B approvals to
the Administrator. For example, the Plan Commission may approve a large multi-
family development and delegate the review and approval of the individual
buildings within the development to the Administrator.
         (d)   Expiration of permits.
            1.   Initiation of work. Work described in any improvement location
permit and its associated site plan must begin within 180 days of the date the
ILP was issued.
            2.   Completion of construction. An improvement location permit
expires if the work described in an ILP is not completed within 12 months of
the date the ILP for a Level A site plan was issued or within 18 months of the
date the ILP for a Level B site plan was issued. Upon expiration of the ILP,
the permit is cancelled by the Administrator who provides written notice of the
cancellation to the permit holder. The notice also informs the permit holder
that future work cannot proceed until a new ILP is issued.
            3.   Extension of time. Prior to the expiration of the ILP, the
permit holder may submit a written request for an extension of time. For a
Level A site plan, the Administrator may grant one extension of time up to six
months. For a Level B site plan, the Plan Commission may grant one extension of
time up to 18 months. An extension will only be approved if the development
encountered unforeseen difficulties beyond the control of the permit holder and
the project will proceed within the extended period. If these provisions are
not fulfilled or the extension has expired prior to construction, the ILP
expires.
         (e)   Construction compliance. The ILP only covers the use,
arrangement, and construction specifically proposed in the approved site plan
associated with the ILP. Any other use, arrangement, or construction not
authorized by the ILP is a violation of this chapter.

this chapter and other applicable town standards. The Administrator may forward
the application to the Technical Advisory Committee for their review and
comment. The Administrator provides all review comments to the applicant and
notes areas of noncompliance with the town requirements.
         (c)   The applicant may submit revised comments in response to the
comments received.
         (d)   When a site plan has been reviewed and found in compliance with
town requirements, the Administrator may approve, or approve with conditions,
the application. Applicants not complying with town requirements will not be
approved.
         (e)   Upon approval, copies of the application and plan, signed by the
Administrator, are maintained on file at the town, with a copy provided to the
applicant.
         (f)   Approved site design.
            1.   Following approval of the site plan, the Administrator issues
an improvement location permit. The applicant is responsible for obtaining all
other applicable county, state or federal permits before issuance of a building
permit.
            2.   The property owner is responsible for maintaining the property
according to the approved site plan on a continuing basis. Any property owner
who fails to maintain the property according to the approved site plan is in
violation of this chapter.
            3.   Commitments may be imposed on site plan approval to ensure
compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
            4.   A performance guarantee may be required, according to §
154.161, to ensure completion of required improvements as specified in the ILP
and shown on the approved site plan.
      (4)   Level B site plan approval application procedures.

            2.   A Level B site plan;
            3.   A written description of the proposed project or use;
            4.   Payment of the application fee; and
            5.   Any additional information required for a complete review of
the application.
         (b)   The Administrator forwards the application to the Technical
Advisory Committee for their review and comment. If applicable, outside
consultants prepare a review of the site plans and provide written comments to
the Administrator prior to action being taken to approve or deny the
application. Costs related to this review are paid by the applicant in
accordance with the policy established by the town. The Administrator provides
all review comments to the applicant, noting areas of noncompliance with the
town requirements.
         (c)   The applicant may submit revised plans in response to the
comments. Revised plans must be submitted in sufficient time, as determined by
the Administrator, prior to a scheduled meeting. Revised plans submitted
without adequate time for review will not be considered.
         (d)   When a site plan has been reviewed and determined to be
complete, the Administrator places it on the Plan Commission agenda. Incomplete
applications will not be docketed. The Plan Commission reviews the ILP
application, site plan, and recommendations from staff, consultants and
reviewing agencies. The Plan Commission may approve, deny, approve with
conditions, or table action on the application.
         (e)   The applicant is required to obtain all other necessary agency
permits from the Town of Bargersville and any other county, state, or federal
agency with jurisdiction. The Plan Commission may approve a site plan
conditioned on obtaining necessary permits, if proof of application for
required permits is submitted.
         (f)   Each action taken for a site plan review, along with the reasons
for that action, are recorded in the minutes of the Plan Commission meeting.
Upon approval, copies of the application and plan, signed by the Administrator,
are maintained on file at the town, with a copy provided to the applicant.
         (g)   Approved site design.
            1.   Following approval of the site plan, the Administrator issues
an improvement location permit. The applicant is responsible for obtaining all
other applicable county, state, or federal permits before issuance of a
building permit.
            2.   The approved construction must commence and be completed
within the time periods specified in division (G)(2)(d).
            3.   The property owner is responsible for maintaining the property
according to the approved site plan on a continuing basis. Any property owner
who fails to maintain the property according to the approved site plan is in
violation of this chapter.
         (h)   Commitments may be imposed on site plan approval to ensure
compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
         (i)   A performance guarantee may be required, in accordance with §
154.161, to ensure completion of required improvements as specified in the ILP
and shown on the approved site plan.
      (5)   Decision criteria. Site plan approval is granted when the proposed
plan meets all applicable standards of this subchapter as outlined below:
         (a)   The site plan complies with all applicable requirements of this
chapter and all other applicable laws and regulations;
         (b)   The site is designed to minimize hazards to adjacent property
and to reduce the negative effects of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, and glare
to the maximum extent;
         (c)   Unless a more specific design standard is established by this
chapter, all uses and structures must comply with the following design
standards:
            1.   Traffic circulation. Access points and vehicular and
pedestrian circulation routes are designed to promote safe and efficient
circulation in and around the site. The number, spacing, and alignment of
existing and proposed access points are considered relative to their impact on
traffic movement on abutting streets and adjacent properties.
            2.   Storm water. Storm water systems are designed to not adversely
affect neighboring properties or public storm water drainage systems. Where
possible, storm water shall be removed from all roofs, canopies and paved areas
should be captured by surface drainage systems.
            3.   Landscaping. Where possible, existing landscape should be
preserved by minimizing unnecessary tree and soil removal.
            4.   Buffering. Landscape buffering is provided where potentially
incompatible uses abut one another, according to §
154.110(E).
            5.   Lighting. Lighting is designed to minimize glare on adjacent
properties and public streets. As a condition of plan approval, reduction of
lighting during nonbusiness hours may be required.
            6.   Utility service. All utility services are provided
underground, unless impractical.
            7.   Exterior uses. Exposed storage areas, machinery, heating and
cooling units, service areas, loading areas, utility buildings and structures,
and similar accessory areas are located and screened to have minimal negative
effect on adjacent properties (see §
154.110(H)).
            8.   Emergency access. All buildings and structures are readily
accessible to emergency vehicles.
            9.   Water and sewer. Water and sewer installations comply with all
town, county, and state specifications and requirements.
            10.   Signs. Permitted signs are located to avoid the creation of
distraction and visual clutter.
         (d)   Building design. New or substantially remodeled buildings are
reasonably compatible in appearance with or enhance the established general
character of other buildings in the immediate vicinity. The requirements of
division (E) are met regarding building design and materials.
      (6)   Possible action. The Plan Commission or Administrator may approve,
approve with conditions, deny, or continue the application.
      (7)   Commitments. The Plan Commission or Administrator may require the
property owner to make written commitments concerning the use or development of
the property (see division (D)).
      (8)   Site plan requirements. Site plans must contain the information
listed below. The Administrator may waive requirements for a Level A site plan
and the Plan Commission may waive requirements for a Level B site plan if it is
determined the requirement not apply to the property or use in question.

      (9)   Changes to approved site plans.
         (a)   Authority plan review. Any proposed change to an approved Level
A site plan may be approved by the Administrator. The Administrator may refer
approval of the proposed change to the Plan Commission.
         (b)   Minor changes. Minor changes to an approved Level B site plan
may be approved by the Administrator without requiring a resubmittal to the
Plan Commission. The applicant must notify the Administrator of any proposed
amendment prior to making the change on the site. The Administrator determines
if the proposed amendment is a minor change: one consistent with the basic
design and conditions of the original approval. Minor changes include:
            1.   Reduction in building size or increase in building size up to
5% of the total approved floor area;
            2.   Movement of buildings or other structures by no more than ten
feet;
            3.   Replacement of plant material specified in the landscape plan
with comparable materials of an equal or greater size;
            4.   Changes in building materials to a comparable or higher
quality;
            5.   Changes required or requested by county, state, or federal
regulatory agencies to conform with other laws or regulations;
            6.   Other minor changes determined by the Administrator to be
consistent with the approved plan and the uses included in the plan.
         (c)   Plan Commission review. Modifications other than minor changes
require review and approval of the Plan Commission.
   (H)   Special exception.
      (3)   Application procedures.
         (a)   Application. Applications must be filed according to the
schedule of meeting and filing deadlines in the format specified by the
Department. An applicant submits a completed application to the Administrator
on forms provided by the Department with the filing fee and the required
supporting information. The Administrator establishes the number of copies of
complete applications and supporting documentation required to be filed.
         (b)   Action by the Administrator. Within five business days of the
application submittal, the Administrator will inform the applicant if the
submittal is complete or if additional information is needed to process the
request. Applications determined complete are docketed for a hearing by the
BZA.
         (c)   Investigation of application. At the Administrator's discretion,
the Technical Advisory Committee may review an application for special
exception prior to the BZA's consideration.
      (4)   Public notice. Notification for the scheduled public hearing
regarding the special exception request must be completed consistent with the
schedule of meeting and filing dates and the BZA's Rules of Procedure.
      (5)   Public hearing. At a regularly scheduled meeting, the BZA reviews
the special exception application and supporting information.
         (a)   Representation. The applicant or applicant's representative must
be present at the meeting to present the application.
         (b)   Testimony. At the meeting, the BZA considers a report from the
Administrator and testimony from the applicant, remonstrators, the public, and
interested parties at the hearing.
         (c)   Procedures. The conduct of the hearing follows the BZA's Rules
of Procedure.
      (6)   Decision criteria. The BZA may approve a special exception upon a
determination that the proposed use:
         (a)   Is consistent with the vision, goals, and objectives of the
Comprehensive Plan;
         (b)   Complies with the requirements of this chapter;
         (c)   Is compatible with the character of the general vicinity;
         (d)   Can be adequately served by essential public facilities and
services, such as streets, police and fire protection, drainage systems, refuse
disposal, water and sewers, and schools;
         (e)   Does not create circumstances detrimental to people, property,
or the general welfare by producing excessive traffic, noise, smoke, fumes,
glare, odor, or other conditions incompatible with the uses permitted in the
zoning district; and
         (f)   Allows orderly development of the surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district.
      (7)   BZA action. Following the public hearing, the BZA may approve,
approve with conditions, deny, or continue the application. The application may
be continued by the BZA based on a request by the Administrator, applicant,
remonstrator, or interested party; an indecisive vote, or a determination by
the BZA that additional information is required prior to acting on the request.
The continuing of applications and any potential additional legal notice must
be consistent with the BZA's Rules and Procedure.
      (8)   Commitments. The BZA may require the property owner to make written
commitments concerning the use or development of the property (see division
(D)).
      (9)   Conditions of approval. Reasonable conditions may be imposed on the
approval of a special exception use to protect the public health, safety, and
general welfare, ensure adequate public services can be provided, enhance
compatibility with adjacent conforming land uses or activities, and protect
natural resources.
      (10)   No presumption of approval. The listing of a special exception on
the Permitted Use Table does not constitute a presumption of approval. Each
special exception is evaluated on an individual basis regarding compliance with
the standards and whether the use is appropriate at the location and in the
manner proposed.
      (11)   Resubmittal of special exception application. A special exception
application denied by the BZA cannot be resubmitted for 12 months from the date
of the denial, except when new evidence or information regarding changing
circumstances or other relevant factors is submitted that might alter the
decision. The Administrator determines if the new information constitutes a
substantive change.
      (12)   Limitations of approval. Approval only authorizes the special
exception use at the premises where the approval was granted. It is not
conditioned upon the property owner or operator of the approved use.
      (13)   Effect of approval. The approval of a special exception does not
authorize the development, construction, alteration, or moving of any building
or structure. The approval authorizes the filing and processing of applications
for permits or approvals required, such as approval of a site plan, improvement
location permit, building permit, and certificate of occupancy.
      (14)   Existing use. An existing use listed as a special exception
located in a zoning district where such special exception may be permitted is a
conforming use if the use meets the minimum lot area requirements of the zoning
district. Any expansion of the special exception involving the enlargement of
buildings, structures, and land area is subject to the requirements and
procedures described in this chapter.
      (15)   Expiration. Approval of a special exception use expires 36 months
after it is granted unless construction is complete, or commencement of the use
has occurred. Prior to the expiration of the initial approval, the applicant
may request in writing to the Administrator an extension of the approval
period. The BZA may extend the approval 12 months or more upon finding there
are no new conditions requiring reconsideration of the special exception use.
   (I)   Variances.
      (1)   Application procedures. The applicant files:
         (a)   A variance application;
         (b)   Property owner consent if the applicant is someone other than
the property owner;
         (c)   The applicable filing fee;
         (d)   A site plan drawn to scale showing the layout of the property
and all features relevant to the request;
         (e)   A statement of intent describing the details of the variance
being requested and stating how the request is consistent with the decision
criteria and proposed findings of fact. The statement should include any
written commitments being made by the applicant; and
         (f)   A copy of the most current property deed.
      (2)   Action by the Administrator. Within five business days of the
application submittal, the Administrator will inform the applicant if the
submittal is complete or if additional information is needed to process the
request. Applications determined complete are docketed for a hearing by the
BZA.
      (3)   Public notice. Notification for the scheduled public hearing
regarding the variance request must be completed consistent with the schedule
of meeting and filing dates and the BZA's Rules of Procedure.
      (4)   Public hearing. At a public hearing scheduled consistent with the
schedule of meeting and filing dates, the BZA reviews the variance application
and required supporting information.
         (a)   Representation. The applicant and/or applicant's representative
must be present at the public hearing to present the complete application and
address the decision criteria.
         (b)   Testimony. The BZA will consider a report from the Administrator
and testimony from the applicant, remonstrators, the public, and interested
parties at the hearing.
         (c)   Procedures. The presentation of reports and testimony and all
other aspects of the public hearing must be consistent with the BZA's Rules of
Procedure.
      (5)   Decision criteria. In acting on all variance requests, the BZA must
use decision criteria to approve or deny variances consistent with the
requirements of Indiana Code:
         (a)   Variances of use. A variance of land use may be approved upon
determining:
            1.   The use will not be injurious to the public health, safety,
morals, and general welfare of the community;
            2.   The use and value of the area adjacent to the property
included in the variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse
manner;
            3.   The need for the variance arises from some condition
particular to the property involved;
            4.   The strict application of the terms of the ordinance will
constitute an unnecessary hardship if applied to the property;
            5.   The use does not interfere substantially with the
Comprehensive Plan.
         (b)   Variances of development standards. A variance of development
standard may be approved only upon determining:
            1.   The approval will not be injurious to the public health,
safety, morals, and general welfare of the community.
            2.   The use and value of the area adjacent to the property
included in the variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse
manner.
            3.   The strict application of the terms of the ordinance will
result in practical difficulties in the use of the property.
      (6)   BZA action. The BZA may approve, approve with conditions, deny, or
continue the application according to I.C. 36-7-4-918.4 and 36-7-4-918.5. The
BZA will not consider an application that is substantially similar to a
variance application denied within the prior 12 months. The application may be
continued by the BZA based on a request by the Administrator, applicant,
remonstrator, or interested party; an indecisive vote; or a determination by
the BZA that additional information is required prior to action being taken on
the request. The continuing of all applications and any potential additional
legal notice must be consistent with the BZA's Rules of Procedure.
      (7)   Commitments. The BZA may require the property owner to make written
commitments concerning the use or development of the property (see division
(D)).
      (8)   Effect of approval. Approval of a variance does not authorize the
development, construction, alteration or moving of any building or structure.
The approval authorizes the filing and processing of applications for permits
or approvals required, such as approval of a site plan, improvement location
permit, building permit, and certificate of occupancy.
      (9)   Acknowledgment of variance. Approval of a variance must be recorded
in an acknowledgement of variance instrument prepared by the Administrator. The
instrument must specify the granted variance and any commitments made or
conditions imposed in granting of the variance. The applicant must record the
instrument in the Office of the Recorder of Johnson County, Indiana, within 14
days of the variance approval. The applicant must return a copy of the recorded
instrument to the Department within 14 days of recording. New applications for
approvals or permits for the property will not be processed until a copy of the
recorded instrument is provided to the Department.
      (10)   Compliance and violations. A permit will not be issued unless it
complies with an approved variance, conditions of approval, and commitments.
Violations of an approved variance, conditions of approval, and commitments are
subject to enforcement procedures.
   (J)   Waiver of subdivision standards. In connection with a site plan,
primary plat, or secondary plat, the Plan Commission may approve a request for
a waiver of the provisions in §§
154.160 to
154.163 if the intent and purpose of the design standards benefit from an
alternative proposal while upholding the intent and purpose of this chapter
(see §
154.145).
   (K)   Waiver of development standards.
      (1)   In connection with a site plan, primary plat, or secondary plat, a
request for a waiver of the dimensional and quantitative standards of up to 35%
for the provisions in §§
154.030 to
154.042,
154.090 to
154.100, and
154.110 to
154.113 may be approved consistent with the following requirements:
         (a)   The proposal does not create conditions detrimental to the
public health, safety, and welfare;
         (b)   The proposal is harmonious with the purpose and intent of the
zoning district where the project is located;
         (c)   The proposal enhances the overall site plan, preliminary plat,
or final plat, the abutting streetscapes and neighborhoods, and the surrounding
area;
         (d)   The proposal does not produce a site design that is impractical
or detracts from the appearance of the proposed development and the surrounding
area;
         (e)   The proposal provides improved site design characteristics such
as increased pedestrian connections, enhanced landscaping, tree preservation,
or public art.
      (2)   A waiver request form for each waiver sought must be included in
the application. For items where final approval has been delegated to staff,
the Administrator has the authority to grant wavers. In all other
circumstances, the Plan Commission may grant the waiver after a public hearing.
      (3)   In granting the waiver, the Plan Commission or Administrator may
impose conditions necessary to secure the purposes of this article. The
applicant retains the right to petition the Board of Zoning Appeals for a
variance from development standards (see division (I)).
   (L)   Zoning map amendments (rezones).

the applicant for such proposals.
         (b)   Property owner initiation. Property owners requesting a zoning
map amendment are the applicants and are responsible for preparing the
application.

this article. A CofC may: (i) be required by this chapter; (ii) serve as

chapter; or (iii) serve as a written verification of a property's zoning. The
Administrator may provide a CofC for:
         (a)   A change in use (e.g., change from residential to commercial
use);
         (b)   Exterior building or site improvements that would not otherwise
require an improvement location permit or site plan approval;

checked by the Administrator for compliance with this chapter. If the
Administrator is satisfied that the property, plans, and information provided
in the application conforms to the requirements of this chapter and other
applicable laws and ordinances, the Administrator issues a certificate of
compliance to the applicant.
      (4)   Effect. A CofC does not authorize the establishment of a use nor
the development, construction, alteration, or moving of any building or a
structure. A CofC certifies compliance of an existing property, use and/or
improvements made according to an approved permit on the date issued. The
filing and processing of applications for any permits and approvals may be
required by this chapter and other town ordinances including, a building
permit, a certificate of occupancy, primary and secondary plats, or site plan
approval, for proposed improvements or uses.
      (5)   Limitations. A CofC is limited only to the circumstance for which
it was issued and at the time it was issued. The CofC does not authorize any
allegedly similar circumstance requiring a separate review or certificate or a
change in circumstances, unless otherwise provided for in the CofC.
      (6)   Records of certificate of compliance. Every CofC issued according
to this article is kept on file in the office of the Department. Copies are
provided upon request to anyone having a proprietary or tenancy interest in the
building or land affected.

permitted property, the short-term rental permit is not transferable to the new
owner.
      (8)   Permit violation. Each short-term rental transaction completed
without a short-term rental permit constitutes a separate violation.
      (9)   Permit revocation. If three or more citations for ordinance
violations are issued to an owner for a permitted property within a calendar
year, the Administrator may revoke the short-term rental permit for up to one
year after the date the permit is revoked. An owner may apply for a short-term
rental permit when the revocation period has ended and all outstanding fines

         (d)   Initiate enforcement through an administrative proceeding before
the BZA, according to I.C. 36-1-6-9 and division (G) of this section.
         (e)   To bring a civil action in any court having jurisdiction,
according to I.C. 34-28-5-1 and division (H) of this section.
      (2)   Exercise of options. The town's exercise of the options specified
in this section, including the imposition of any penalties for an ordinance
violation, are not prerequisites for taking any other action against an alleged
violator of this chapter, nor do they prohibit the town from taking any further
action.
      (3)   Warnings. Before exercising any of the town's options under this
section, the Administrator may issue a warning to a person alleged to be in
violation of this chapter and give the person at least ten days but not more
than 60 days to remedy the alleged violation.
   (D)   Penalties.
      (1)   Maximum penalties. The maximum civil penalty for the first
violation of a provision of this chapter is a fine of $2,500. The maximum civil
penalty for the second or subsequent violation of a provision of this chapter
(other than a provision that regulates parking) is a fine of $7,500.
      (2)   Subsequent violations. The penalties listed above for subsequent
violations apply whenever the responsible party commits an additional violation
of the same provision within 12 months of the first violation, regardless of
whether the additional violation is on the same property as the first
violation.
   (E)   Stop work orders.
      (1)   Occurrence of violation. If the Administrator finds that a
violation is occurring or has occurred on a construction site, the
Administrator may place a stop work order on any land/property improvement
process.
      (2)   Procedure. Stop work orders must be a written letter stating the
nature of the violation and requiring the work and any other illegal activity
to stop immediately until the matter is resolved. If someone other than the
property owner occupies the property, a copy of the stop work order must be
provided to the occupant. This letter must be posted in a conspicuous place and
be delivered or mailed to the property owner.
      (3)   Reasons. Reasons for a stop work order may include:
         (a)   Not complying with any element of the development standards or
any regulation of the Ordinance;
         (b)   Not obtaining a permit or approval prior to the construction or
installation of any improvement requiring a permit or approval by this chapter;
         (c)   Not completing structures or other site improvements consistent
with any approved improvement location permit, variance, special exception,
site plan, or other approval;
         (d)   Not meeting the commitments imposed upon the approval of a
special exception, variance, rezoning, site plan, subdivision plat, or other
approval, whether recorded or not;
         (e)   Not meeting the conditions of a PUD ordinance or other rezoning,
or any written commitment imposed upon an approval, whether recorded or not;
         (f)   Illegal use or expansion of use of structures, or structures and
land in combination.
      (4)   Appeals. Any stop work order may be appealed to the BZA. Upon the
resolution of the violations to the satisfaction of the Administrator or the
BZA, the stop work order is lifted and construction activity may resume.
   (F)   Municipal action to enforce compliance.
      (1)   Entry into property. According to I.C. 36-1-6-2(a), if violation of
a provision of this chapter exists on real property, the Administrator may have
employees or contractors of the town enter the property and take appropriate
action to bring the property into compliance with the ordinance.
      (2)   Notice requirement. Before the town takes action to bring a
property into compliance, anyone holding a substantial interest in the property
must be given at least ten days but not more than 60 days to bring the property
into compliance. Notice must be served on such persons in person or by first
class mail. In addition, continuous enforcement orders (as defined in I.C. 36-
7-9-2) may be enforced, and liens may be assessed, without the need for
additional notice.
      (3)   Expenses constitute a lien. Whenever the Administrator takes action
to bring compliance under this section, the resulting expenses incurred by the
town constitute a lien against the property. The lien attaches when notice of
the lien is recorded in the office of the Johnson County Recorder. The lien is
superior to all other liens except liens for taxes and does not exceed:
         (a)   Ten thousand dollars for real property that: (a) contains one or
more occupied or unoccupied single or double family dwellings or the
appurtenances or additions to those dwellings, or (b) is unimproved; or
         (b)   Twenty thousand dollars for all other real property not
described in division (a).
      (4)   Issuance of bill to owner. According to I.C. 36-1-6-2(b), the
Administrator may issue a bill to the owner of the real property for all
expenses incurred by the town in bringing the property into compliance,
including administrative costs and removal costs. According to I.C. 36-1-6-2
(c), a bill issued under this section is delinquent if the owner of the
property fails to pay the bill to the Clerk-Treasurer within 30 days after the
bill is issued.
      (5)   Collection of fees and penalties. According to I.C. 36-1-6-2(d),
the Clerk-Treasurer's office may prepare a list of delinquent fees and
penalties enforceable under this section, including:
         (a)   The names of the owners of each lot or parcel of real property
on which fees or penalties are delinquent;
         (b)   A description of the premises, as shown on the records of the
Johnson County Auditor; and
         (c)   The amount of the delinquent fees or penalties.
      (6)   Preparation and recording of instrument. The Clerk-Treasurer's
office may then prepare an instrument for each lot or parcel of real property
on which fees or penalties are delinquent. The instrument is recorded with the
Johnson County Recorder, who charges a recording fee under the fee schedule
established in I.C. 36-7-2-10.
      (7)   Placement of lien on tax duplicate. According to I.C. 36-1-6-2(f),
the amount of a lien is placed on the tax duplicate by the Johnson County
Auditor. The total amount, including any accrued interest, is collected in the
same manner as delinquent taxes are collected and is disbursed to the general
fund of the town.
      (8)   Enforcement of lien against subsequent owner. According to I.C. 36-
1-6-2(g), a fee is not enforceable as a lien against a subsequent owner of
property unless the lien for the fee was recorded before conveyance to the
subsequent owner. If the property is conveyed before the lien is recorded, the
town must notify the person who owned the property at the time the fee became
payable. The notice must inform the person that payment, including penalty fees
for delinquencies, is due not later than 15 days after the date of the notice.
If payment is not received within 180 days after the date of the notice, the
amount may be considered a bad debt loss.
      (9)   Release of lien. According to I.C. 36-1-6-2(h), the town releases:
         (a)   Liens filed with the Johnson County Recorder after the recorded
date of conveyance of the property; and
         (b)   Delinquent fees incurred by the seller;
         upon receipt of a written demand from the purchaser or a
representative of the title insurance company or agent that issued a title
insurance policy to the purchaser. The demand must state that the delinquent
fees were not incurred by the purchaser as a user, lessee, or previous owner
and that the purchaser has not been paid by the seller for the delinquent fees.
      (10)   Removal of lien from tax duplicate. According to I.C. 36-1-6-2(i),
the Johnson County Auditor removes the fees, penalties, and service charges
that were not recorded before a recorded conveyance to a subsequent owner, upon
receipt of a copy of the written demand under Subsection I.
   (G)   Correcting immediate public risk violations.
      (1)   General requirements. If a condition violating a provision of this
chapter presents an immediate risk to public health, safety, or welfare or to
property in the town, the Administrator may opt to have employees or
contractors of the town enter the property and take immediate action to bring
the property into compliance. The Administrator is not required to provide
prior notice to the property owner or other person responsible for the
violation.
      (2)   Immediate public risks. Immediate public risk violations may
include:
         (a)   Obstructions. Signs, structures, landscaping, or other materials
placed in an easement, sight visibility triangle, or rights-of-way in violation
of this chapter;
         (b)   Distractions. Any sign, structure, landscaping, or other
material located on private property that serves to distract or inhibit
operators of motor vehicles on adjacent public ways, pedestrians, or other
members of the public; and
         (c)   Other threats. Any other immediate threat to public welfare as
determined by the Town Manager or the BZA, based upon the advice and
recommendation of the Administrator.
      (3)   Seizure of materials. Any sign, structure, landscaping, or other
material constituting an immediate public risk violation may be seized by the
Administrator in a manner resulting in the least damage to the material or the
property on which it is located. The town is not required to retain seized
landscaping or other materials that are damaged, deteriorated, or in a
condition preventing use for the purpose the product was intended or
manufactured.
      (4)   Notice of violation. The Administrator provides notice to the owner
of the property, as listed in the records of the Johnson County Auditor, where
the violation was located, or any discernible appropriate owner of materials
placed within a public way in violation of this chapter, by placing a notice in
a conspicuous place on the property and mailing a letter to that property
owner. All notice letters are sent to the property owner via certified mail
within 24 hours of the seizure. Any notice posted on the property must be
posted at the time the material is seized. The letter and posted notice must
include:
         (a)   A description of the materials seized;
         (b)   A citation of the sections of this chapter that were violated
and the characteristics of the violation that posed an immediate threat to
public welfare;
         (c)   The address and phone number of the Administrator and the name
of the person to be contacted by the property owner to discuss the violation
and request the return of the seized items; and
         (d)   Instructions describing how, where, and when the seized items
may be claimed.
      (5)   Storage and retrieval of seized materials. The Administrator stores
any sign, structure, landscape materials or other items seized in a secure
location for a period of no less than 30 days from the date notice was mailed
to the property owner. The property owner may claim the seized property
following its seizure upon the payment of the fine specified in division (D)(2)
and the establishment of a memorandum of agreement between the property owner
and Administrator regarding the future use of the item in a manner consistent
with this chapter.
      (6)   Liability. Neither the Administrator, the town, nor any other
official or entity involved in the seizure is liable for any damage to the
seized materials or the property from which they were taken.
   (H)   Administrative enforcement.
      (1)   Provisions that restrict or prohibit actions harmful to the land,
air, or water. According to I.C. 36-1-6-9, the town may opt to enforce any
provision of this chapter that restricts or prohibits actions harmful to the
land, air, or water, through an administrative proceeding before the BZA. The
BZA must find that the violation has been proved by a preponderance of the
evidence. Upon finding a violation, the BZA may assess a civil penalty within
the limits set forth in division (D).
      (2)   Appeal to court. According to I.C. 36-1-6-9(e), a person who is
assessed a civil penalty under this section may appeal the BZA's order imposing
the penalty to the Johnson Circuit or Superior Court. An appeal under this
section must be filed not more than 60 days after the date on which the BZA
enters the order.
      (3)   Payment of civil penalty. Unless a person who is assessed a civil
penalty under this section files an appeal, the person must pay the penalty to
the town in a manner authorized by the Clerk-Treasurer. Whenever a person
liable for a civil penalty under this section fails to deliver payment to the
town within 75 days after the date on which the administrative body enters the
order imposing the penalty, the Clerk-Treasurer reports the circumstances to
the Administrator for the initiation of appropriate judicial proceedings
against the person.
      (4)   Effect of administrative process. An ordinance violation processed
under this section does not constitute a judgment for the purposes of I.C. 33-
37. An ordinance violation costs fee may not be collected from the defendant
under I.C. 33-37-4.
