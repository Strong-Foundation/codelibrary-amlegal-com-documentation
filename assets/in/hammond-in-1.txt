3(4) in ordinance violations cases.
   (C)   The ordinances subject to administration by the Ordinance Violations

throughout the Code of Ordinances. The schedule may be amended from time to
time by action of the City Council to add or delete qualified ordinances or to

Payments of civil penalties may be made in person or by mail.

Department, be resolved by proof of compliance with the cited ordinance rather
than the assessment of a civil penalty. Those ordinances shall be designated by
proper schedule and may be otherwise identified throughout the Code of
Ordinances. Upon receipt of notification of compliance by the Law Department or
any person authorized by the Law Department to determine compliance, the
Violations Clerk shall consider such violations resolved and dismiss same.

shall assess and collect from the violator the amount prescribed by the
Schedule of Civil Penalties established under this section. Payment of the
civil penalty shall be made within 30 days from the date of the citation unless
an extension is allowed by the Law Department or its designee. However, payment
of the civil penalty for scheduled parking violations under Chapter 72 and
Chapter 73 shall be made within 60 days from the date of the citation unless an
extension is allowed by the Law Department or its designee.
   (I)   Any person paying a civil penalty at the Ordinance Violations Bureau
shall execute a waiver of right to trial and admission of the violation.
   (J)   Except as otherwise provided, an ordinance violation admitted in the
Ordinance Violation Bureau and resolved by payment of a civil penalty or
compliance does not constitute a judgment for the purposes of I.C. 33-37, and

under penalty of perjury. The Clerk and other city departments shall promote
the cards.
   (E)   Fees. The Clerk shall charge an application fee of $15 per card.
   (F)   Acceptance by city departments and affiliated entities. When requiring
members of the public to provide identification or proof of residency in the
city, each city department and any affiliated entity such as the Water
Department, Sanitary District, or Port Authority shall accept a municipal
identification card as valid identification and as valid proof of residency in
the city, unless such city department or entity has reasonable grounds for
determining that the card is counterfeit, altered, or improperly issued to the
card holder, or that the individual presenting the card is not the individual
to whom it was issued.
   (G)   Non-application of ID card. Other than requiring the city and entities
to accept the card as proof of identification and city residency, this section
is not intended to replace any other existing requirements for issuance of
other forms of identification in connection with the administration of city
services. The requirements of this section do not apply under circumstances
where (1) a federal or state statute, administrative regulation or directive,
or court decision requires the city or entity to obtain different
identification or proof of residence, (2) a federal or state statute or
administrative regulation or directive preempts local regulation of
identification or residency requirements, (3) the city would be unable to
comply with a condition imposed by a funding source, which would cause the city
or such entity to lose funds from that source. Further, the municipal
identification card shall not be used for driving, voting, or any other purpose
that would violate state or federal law.

§ 37.028 SICK LEAVE.
   The city adopts for full-time civil city and city utilities employees (not
including police officers and firefighters) the following sick leave policy.
   (A)   All full-time employees are allowed leave with pay due to personal
illness. Each employee shall earn sick leave at the rate of 1 day for each
calendar month of full employment. Sick leave credit may be accumulated to a
maximum of 60 days. For each 6 days earned in excess of the allowable
accumulation of 60 days, the excess days shall be automatically converted to
equal 1 extra regular vacation day.
   (B)   Sick leave benefits shall be used only for legitimate illness.
Employees returning to work after using 3 or more days of sick leave
consecutively shall be required to furnish a doctor’s statement.
   (C)   An employee who, due to illness, has used up all of his or her earned
sick days and his or her earned vacation days may be granted a leave of absence
without pay to protect his or her seniority. He or she must submit a written
request to his or her department head for 30 days leave of absence without pay
and must accompany this request with a written statement from his or her
doctor. The written request must state the reason for the requested leave of
absence and the date on which the employee intends to return to work. Failure
to return and report for work on the specified return date may result in
termination, unless an extension of the leave of absence is requested (again,
in writing) and granted. For a requested extension beyond the initial 30-day
leave of absence, the employee must submit an updated doctor’s statement.
   (D)   Extended maternity leave, as a leave of absence without pay, shall be
available in 6-week increments for the period during which the attending
physician’s statement indicates that the employee is disabled and cannot
perform the normal physical requirements of her job. Extended maternity leave
may be granted for 1 additional 6-week increment upon submission of appropriate
physician’s statement. The employee shall exhaust all accrued sick and vacation
days before applying for extended maternity leave. Any further extension of
maternity leave other than sick leave shall be regarded as a general leave of
absence and will only protect the employee’s accrued service record.
   (E)   An employee using sick days and vacation days to recuperate from
illness or injury will continue to participate in the Public Employee
Retirement Fund (PERF) and insurance programs. However, additional sick days
will not accrue while on sick leave. Employees taking extended leaves of
absence without pay do not earn sick days, nor vacation days, but employees
shall be covered under the city insurance plans for up to 6 months. If an
employee elects to extend the insurance coverage beyond the 6-month limitation,
he or she may do so by paying the premium.
   (F)   No cash settlement will be made for sick leave accrued, but not taken
upon any termination from employment.
   (G)   Sick leave accruals may be transferred if the employee changes to
another department within the city.
   (H)   If an employee becomes ill or is injured while on vacation, the
scheduled vacation time shall be counted as vacation. If the disability
continues beyond the scheduled time of vacation, the sick leave allowances, if
any, shall begin on the first scheduled working day after the end of the
scheduled vacation.
   (I)   Regarding time off for injuries occurring on the job, Worker’s
Compensation laws control.
      (1)   An employee who is injured or disabled while working (at his or her
city job) and must, due to that injury or disability, miss work, shall receive
his or her normal rate of pay for the first 5 days of work missed; provided
that, a physician acceptable to the city certified that the employee is unable
to work. These 5 days shall not be counted against the employee’s accrued sick
time. Thereafter, the employee is entitled to receive the difference between
his or her regular compensation and the amount paid by Worker’s Compensation,
via his or her accrued sick days, until his or her earned sick days (and
vacation days) are exhausted. After that, no further payments will be made to
the employee by the city.
      (2)   An employee injured on the job is not entitled to receive both full
pay from the city (by the use of sick/vacation days) and benefits from Worker’s
Compensation for the same periods of time.
      (3)   When an employee returns to work after sick leave (or leave of
absence) from an on-the-job injury, he or she shall again begin to earn sick
days.
      (4)   When an employee misses work for an on-the-job injury for which
Worker’s Compensation pays benefits to the employee, the city shall continue
the employee’s insurance benefits in effect (as they were when he was working)
for a period not to exceed 1 year. Thereafter, the employee must obtain and
maintain his or her own insurance program.
      (5)   When an employee misses work due to an on-the-job injury, he or she
must submit a statement from the doctor estimating how long it will be before
the employee may return to work. If the employee is not able to return to work
pursuant to the doctor’s estimate, he or she must obtain and submit an
additional statement from the doctor.
      (6)   When an employee does return to work, he must bring with him or her
a doctor’s release to return to work. The city does not provide “light duty”
functions, so an employee must be completely released by the doctor to return
to his or her regular job before he or she may return to work.
      (7)   If the Worker’s Compensation Board determines that an employee’s
Worker’s Compensation claim is fully compensable, then any sick days/vacation
days used by the employee (and for which the city is reimbursed by its Worker’s
Compensation insurer) shall be restored to the credit of the employee.
   (J)   This section shall not affect sick time already earned.
   (K)   Each department director shall have a complete record-keeping system
of employees’ sick days earned and taken.

   (B)   Program benefits. Eligible employees as defined above who voluntarily
elect to retire, and register for this program by September 30, 2022, and
actually complete the retirement process before December 30, 2022. Eligible
employees will have until September 30, 2022 to decide to accept the program,
and rejection of the program shall not entitle the eligible employee to these
offered benefits at any future time. Once an employee retires under this
program, such employee shall not be eligible for employment as a full- time
employee of the city, but may work in a contract capacity if necessary. Funding
for the 2022 voluntary retirement program will come from the department budget
funds. Participating eligible employees shall be entitled to receive:

of employment completed prior to retirement with the city. (For example, 10
years of service would equal $10,000).

currently covered under the city’s plan. Such retiree status would require the
city insurance to be secondary insurance subordinate to Medicare, spousal
coverage or subordinate to other employers if and when the eligible employee
finds other employment that provides health insurance. Employee classes covered
under third party plans are not eligible for retiree health insurance coverage
from the city.
      (3)   Eligible employees electing to participate in this program will be
required to sign a Release, Waiver and Voluntary Retirement Program Agreement.

will do so immediately. The following provisions apply to all tests that the
city sends the employee for under the directive of the MRO:
      (1)   The employee is given the minimum possible advance notice that he
or she must go to the collection site;
      (2)   The result of the retest taken is accepted as the test result of
record;
      (3)   If the result of the retest taken is also negative and dilute, the

(Ord. 9248, passed 4-14-2014)
§ 37.115 ALCOHOL TESTING PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Alcohol testing will be conducted at an approved city facility or by
an approved testing service. The testing will be performed in a private
setting. Only authorized personnel will have access, and are the only
individuals who can see or hear the test results.
   (B)   When the employee arrives at the testing site, the BAT or STT will ask
the employee for identification.
   (C)   The BAT or STT will then explain the testing procedure to the
employee. The BAT or STT may only supervise 1 test at a time, and may not leave
the testing site while the test is in progress.
   (D)   A screening test is performed first. When a breath testing device is
used, the mouthpiece of the breath testing device must be sealed before use,
and opened in the employee's presence. Then the mouthpiece is inserted into the
breath testing device.
   (E)   The employee must blow forcefully into the mouthpiece of the testing
device for at least 6 seconds or until an adequate amount of breath has been
obtained.
   (F)   Once the test is completed, the BAT must show the employee the
results. The results may be printed on a form generated by the breath testing
device or may be displayed on the breath testing device. If the breath testing
device does not print results and test information, the BAT is to record the
displayed result, test number, testing device, serial number of the testing
device, and time on the alcohol testing form. If the breath testing device
prints results, but not directly onto the form, the BAT must affix the printout
to the alcohol testing form in the designated space.
   (G)   When an alcohol screening device (ASD) is used, the screening test
technician (STT) must check the device's expiration date and show it to the
employee. A device may not be used after its expiration date.
   (H)   The STT will open an individually wrapped or sealed package containing
the device in front of the employee and he/she will be asked to place the
device in his/her mouth and use it in the manner described by the device's
manufacturer.
   (I)   If the employee declines to use the device, or in a case where the
device doesn't activate, the STT must insert the device in the employee's mouth
and use it in the manner described by the device's manufacturer. The STT must
wear single-use examination gloves and must change the gloves following each
test.
   (J)   When the device is removed from the employee's mouth, the STT must
follow the manufacturer's instructions to ensure the device is activated.
   (K)   If the procedures listed above can't be successfully completed, the
device must be discarded and new test must be conducted using a new device.
Again, the employee will be offered the choice of using the new device or
having the STT use the device for the test.
   (L)   If the new test can't be successfully completed, the employee will be
directed to immediately take a screening test using an evidential breath
testing device (EBT).
   (M)   The result displayed on the device must be read within 15 minutes of
the test. The STT must show the employee the device and its reading and enter
the result on the ATF.
   (N)   If the reading on the EBT or ASD is less than 0.02, both the employee
and the BAT or STT must sign and date the result form. The form will then be
confidentially forwarded to the city's Safety Coordinator or Human Resources
Consultant.
   (O)   If the reading on the EBT or ASD is 0.02 or more, a confirmation test
must be performed. An EBT must be used for all confirmation tests.
   (P)   The test must be performed after 15 minutes have elapsed, but within
30 minutes of the first test. The BAT will ask the employee not to eat, drink,
belch, or put anything into his/her mouth. These steps are intended to prevent
the buildup of mouth alcohol, which could lead to an artificially high result.
   (Q)   A new, sealed mouthpiece must be used for the new test. The
calibration of the EBT must be checked.
   (R)   If the results of the confirmation test and screening test are not the
same the confirmation test will be used.
   (S)   Refusal to complete and sign the alcohol testing form or refusal to
provide breath or saliva will be considered a failed test, and the employee
suspended until the matter is resolved. Such refusal may also result in the
employee's termination.
(Ord. 9248, passed 4-14-2014)
§ 37.116 DRUG TESTING PROCEDURES.
   (A)   All drug testing procedures will be conducted at an approved city
facility or by an approved testing service. A drug testing custody and control
form (CCF) will be used to document the chain of custody from the time the
specimen is collected at the testing facility until it is tested at the
laboratory.
   (B)   When the employee arrives at the collection site, the collection site
will ask the employee for identification.
   (C)   The employee will be asked to remove all unnecessary outer garments
(coat, jacket) and secure all personal belongings. The employee may keep his/
her wallet.
   (D)   The employee will wash and dry his/her hands. After washing hands, the
employee must remain in the presence of the collection site person and may not
have access to fountains, faucets, soap dispensers, or other materials that
could adulterate the specimen.
   (E)   Collection site personnel will select an individually wrapped or
sealed container from the collection kit materials. Either collection site
personnel or the employee, with both individuals present, must unwrap or break
the seal of the collection container. The seal on the specimen bottle may not
be broken at this time. Only the collection container may be taken into the
room used for urination.
   (F)   The employee is then instructed to provide his/her specimen in a room
that allows for privacy.
   (G)   The specimen must consist of at least 45 ml of urine. Within four
minutes after obtaining the specimen, the collection site person will measure
its temperature. The acceptable temperature range is 90 to 100 degrees
Fahrenheit. If the specimen temperature is outside the acceptable range, the
collector must note this on the CCF and must immediately conduct a new
collection using direct observation procedures. Both specimens must be sent to
the lab for testing. The collector must notify both the DER and collection site
supervisor that the collection took place under direct observation and the
reason for doing so.
   (H)   Collection site personnel will also inspect the specimen for color and
look for signs of contamination or tampering. If there are signs of
contamination or tampering, the collector must immediately conduct a new
collection using direct observation procedures. Both specimens must be sent to
the lab for testing. The collector must notify both the DER and collection site
supervisor that the collection took place under direct observation and the
reason for doing so.
   (I)   The 45 ml sample provided must be split into a primary specimen of 30
ml and a second specimen (used as the split) of 15 ml. The collection site
person must place and secure the lids on the bottles, place tamper-evident
bottle seals over the lids and down the sides of the bottles, and write the
date on the tamper-evident seals. The employee then initials the tamper-evident

§ 51.079 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMITTEE.
   (A)   Compliance schedule reports (non-categorical industries). Any non-
categorical industry which is not in compliance with the city’s Sanitary
District ordinance limitations may be required to develop a compliance schedule
after which time the industry must meet the city’s Sanitary District standards.
The schedule should contain increments of progress (hiring engineers, starting
construction and the like), which correspond to specific dates for their
completion. These represent major events leading to the operation of
pretreatment equipment to meet the city’s Sanitary District pretreatment
standards. All industrial users subject to these conditions must submit a
progress report to the city’s Sanitary District no later than 14 days following
each date in the compliance schedule. This report must include whether it
complied with the increment of progress to be met on that date, the reason for
delay if the date was not met and the steps being taken to return to
compliance. In no event can more than 9 months lapse between progress reports.
   (B)   Self-monitoring reports.
      (1)   All industrial users shall submit self- monitoring reports to the
District on the report forms supplied by the District to assess and assure
compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements. These reports will contain a description of the nature,
concentration and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the user’s
permit. Reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period
covered by the report, and, performed in accordance with the techniques
described in Title 40 C.F.R. part 136. Reports will normally be required on a
monthly basis, unless specified otherwise in the user’s permit conditions. The
District should receive these reports no later than 30 days after the end of
the monitoring period.
      (2)   In accordance with Title 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(g)(2), if sampling by
an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user, upon becoming
aware of the violation, must notify the District within 24 hours, then repeat
sampling and analysis and submit the results within 30 days except under
certain conditions (listed below).
      (3)   An industrial user is not required to resample if:
         (a)   The District performs sampling at the industrial user at a
frequency of at least once per month; or,
         (b)   The District performs sampling at the industrial user between
the time when the industrial user performs its initial sampling and the time
when the industrial user receives the results of this sampling.
   (C)   Baseline monitoring report, Title 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b).
      (1)   Existing sources. Within 180 days after the effective date of a
Categorical Pretreatment Standard, or 180 days after the final administrative
decision made on a category, whichever is later, existing industrial users
subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to
or scheduled to discharge to a POTW shall submit to the District Baseline
Report containing the information listed in Title 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)(1)
through (7).
      (2)   New sources. At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge,
new sources, the sources that became industrial users subsequent to the
promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit
to the District a report which contains the information listed in Title 40
C.F.R. § 403.12(b)(1) through (5). New sources shall also be required to
include in this report information on the method of pretreatment the source
intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall
give estimates of the information requested in Title 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)(4)
and (5).
      (3)   Provision. Upon promulgation of a Categorical Pretreatment
Standard, the Control Authority (either state or POTW) will provide the
appropriate 12(b) form for distribution to the industrial users who are
affected by the promulgation standard. The industrial users shall then be
required to submit the completed report to the state and POTW.
   (D) Compliance schedule reports (categorical industries).  
      (1)   Industrial users shall comply with the compliance schedule
reporting conditions required in Title 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)(7). This schedule
shall be submitted whenever an industrial user is not meeting categorical
pretreatment standards at the time of promulgation of that standard.
      (2)   The schedule contains increments of progress (i.e., hiring an
engineer, completing plans, commencing construction and the like) which
correspond to specific dates for their completion. These represent major events
leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required
for the industrial user to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment
standard. A compliance schedule can not extend beyond statutory deadlines
established by a categorical standard. Failure to meet these deadlines will be
dealt with through the enforcement process.
      (3)   All industrial users subject to these conditions must submit a
progress report to the District no later than 14 days following each date in
the compliance schedule, including the final date for compliance. This report
must include, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of
progress to be set on that date and, if not, the date on which it expects to
comply, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user
to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event can more
than 9 months elapse between the progress reports.
   (E)   Compliance data report, Title 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(d). Within 90 days
following the date for final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards,
whether local, state or federal standards or, in the case of a new source,
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall be required to
submit to the pretreatment coordinator a report indicating the nature and
concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process
which are limited by pretreatment standards and requirements are being met on a
consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment, if any,
is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the industrial user.
   (F)   Periodic compliance reports, Title 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(e).
      (1)   (a)   Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the
compliance date of the pretreatment standard, or, in the case of new source,
and any non-major contributors, after the commencement of the discharge into
the POTW shall be required to submit to the pretreatment coordinator during the
months of June and December, unless required more frequently by the
pretreatment coordinator, a report indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in the effluents which are limited. In addition, this report shall
include a record of all daily flows which during the reporting period exceeded
any maximum daily flow required under paragraph 503.
         (b)   Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement;
provided, however, where cost or feasibility constraints justify, the
Pretreatment Coordinator may accept reports of average and maximum flows
estimated by verifiable techniques.
         (c)   At the discretion of the pretreatment coordinator and in
consideration of the factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget
cycles and the like, the pretreatment coordinator may agree to alter the months
during which the above reports are to be submitted.
      (2)   (a)   Reports of permittees shall contain the results of sampling
and analysis of discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration
or production and mass where requested by the pretreatment coordinator of
pollutants contained therein which are limited. The pretreatment coordinator
may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements if necessary to meet the
objective of this chapter. In such cases, the report required by division (F)
(1) of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants in the effluent of
the user.
         (b)   All analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures
established by the Administrator pursuant to § 304 (g) of the Act and contained
in Title 40 C.F.R. part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test
procedures approved by the Administrator. Sampling shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques approved by the Administrator.
   (G)   Certification requirements for industrial user reports. All
applications, reports or information required by this chapter shall include the
following certification statement: “I have personally examined and am familiar

non-discount period average daily charge.
      (3)   In the event the billed average water consumption for the preceding
non-discount period is greater than the actual average water consumption during
the discount period, then the billing for sewage service shall be based on the
actual water usage during the discount period.
      (4)   The foregoing discount shall not apply to any premises which are
partially or wholly used for industrial or commercial purposes. In the event a
portion of the premises shall be used for commercial or industrial purposes,
the owner shall have the privilege of separating the water service so that the
domestic portion of the premises is served through a separate meter, and in
that case, the water usage as registered by the water meter serving that
portion of the premises used for domestic purposes would qualify for treatment
under the discount rate.

INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY
§ 51.155 PURPOSE OF SUBCHAPTER.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this subchapter to recover that share of the
federal grant amount awarded under Pub. Law No. 92-500 used to construct
facilities for the treatment of industrial wastes.
   (B)   The industrial cost recovery charges provided for in this section are
levied against all industrial users, herein defined, of the sewage works.
   (C)   On or before August 15, the district shall annually determine and fix
the unit costs for recovery of that portion of the federal grant attributable
to industry on the basis of flow. The district shall compute the amount due the
district for industrial cost recovery and render a statement thereof, at
periodic intervals, to each industry within the district using the sewage
works. All amounts due shall be payable at the office of the district and will
be limited to the particular use in compliance with applicable state or federal
rules of regulations.
(Prior Code, § 51.135) (Ord. 4288, passed 12-27-1976)
§ 51.156 BYLAWS AND REGULATIONS SET BY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS.
   The unit charges for establishing the industrial cost recovery of the
federal grant to be collected by the district from the industrial users of the
sewage works within the district boundaries shall be upon the conditions, and
in the amounts set forth in this subchapter. The Board of Commissioners of the
district shall make and enforce whatever bylaws, rules and regulations it may
deem necessary for the regulation, collection and refunding of industrial cost
recovery charges imposed by this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 51.136) (Ord. 4288, passed 12-27-1976)
§ 51.157 FORMULAS USED FOR DETERMINING COSTS.
   (A)   That portion of the federal grant to be recovered from industrial
users shall be determined by calculating that portion of the design flow being
contributed by industrial users and multiplying that portion by the federal
grant amount (75% of the total grant eligible capital costs). The annual
federal grant amount to be recovered will be the total amount to be recovered
divided by 30 years. The formulas for these calculations are as follows.
      (1)   % industrial flow = industrial flow MGD design flow MGD x 100
      (2)   Federal grant amount = grant eligible cost x 0.75 = $
      (3)   Cost recovered from industrial users = federal grant amount x %
industrial flow 100 = $
      (4)   Annual cost recovered from industrial users = cost 30 years = $ /
per year
   (B)   To calculate industrial unit cost recovery charges, divide the annual
recoverable amount calculated above by the total industrial flow, for the
billing period. The formula for this calculation is as follows.
   Unit cost flow: ($/billing period/industrial flow 1,000 gal. ) = $/1,000
gal.
   (C)   The cost recovery charges to the individual industries (as defined and
not excluded by provisions of this subchapter) shall be calculated by
multiplying the unit cost as determined above by the industrial users actual
flow. The formula for this calculation is as follows.
   ($/1,000 gal.) x  (actual flow 1,000 gals. /billing period) =  $
   (D)   In addition to the charges provided for herein, the city may impose a
surcharge on any industrial user based on some other pollutant loading factor
which requires special treatment at the sewage works.

suitable measuring device. Each industrial user required by the district to
install and maintain sewage monitoring facilities, shall submit to the city a
monthly report of daily flow on a form approved by the district. This report
shall be used for billing purposes and shall be submitted prior to the
fifteenth day of the subsequent month.
   (B)   The district shall have the right to periodically or continuously
inspect the monitoring facilities to measure the industrial user’s flow. In the
event of any discrepancy between the flows determined by the district and the
industrial user, the values determined by the district shall be used for
billing purposes.

annual basis.
   (B)   A minimum of 80% of the funds retained in trust by the City
Controller, as provided in division (A) above, together with any interest
earned thereon, shall be used solely for defraying the cost of expansion and
reconstruction of the sewage works. However, the expenditures qualify as
eligible costs pursuant to paragraph Title 40 C.F.R. § 35.940 of construction
grants regulations. Prior to the commitment or disbursement or the use of any
retained funds for expansion and reconstruction of the sewage works, the City
Controller shall obtain in writing the approval for the commitment or
expenditure from the regional administrator of the United States Environmental
Protection Agency. The remaining 20% of the retained funds not used for
expansion and reconstruction of the sewage works together with any interest
earned thereon shall be transferred to the sanitary district under provisions
of Title 40 C.F.R. § 35.928-2(b).

persons, or to the environment, has caused interference to the POTW or has
caused violation of any condition of the POTW NPDES permit. There is an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, only

discharge.
   (B)   Any person given written notice of a suspension of the wastewater
treatment service and/or the industrial wastewater contribution permit, shall
immediately cease and desist, to eliminate the contribution. In the event of a
failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the POTW
shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance or the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or
endangerment to any individuals. The POTW may reinstate the wastewater
contribution permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the
elimination of the discharge. A detailed written statement shall be submitted
by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measure
taken to prevent any further occurrence and shall be submitted to the POTW
within 7 days of the date of occurrence.

hearing shall be conducted so as to confirm whether or not the determination of
the city’s Sanitary District, as to the severity of the discharge or
endangerment that led to the termination of service and/or suspension of
permit, is proper and to identify requirements necessary to reestablish service

guidelines should be used:
   (A)   Off-site construction activities that provide services (for example,
road extensions, sewer, water, and other utilities) to a land disturbing
project site, must be considered as a part of the total land disturbance
calculation for the project site, when the activity is under the control of the
project site owner.
   (B)   Strip developments will be considered as 1 project site and must
comply with this chapter unless the total combined disturbance on all
individual lots is less than 1 acre and is not part of a larger common plan of
development or sale.
   (C)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by this rule,
the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the total area of
land disturbance for improvements, such as, roads, utilities, or common areas,
and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as determined by the
following:
      (1)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are 0.5
acre or more, 0.5 acre of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot
disturbance.
      (2)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
less than 0.5 acre in size, the total lot must be calculated as being
disturbed.
      (3)   To calculate lot disturbance on all other types of projects sites,
such as industrial and commercial projects project sites, a minimum of 1 acre
of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance, unless the
lots are less than 1 acre in size, in which case the total lot must be
calculated as being disturbed.
   (D)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction sites shall meet
the design criteria and the technical standards and specifications approved by
the Board of Stormwater Management.

stormwater pollution prevention plan and comply with the technical standards
adopted by the Board of Stormwater Management. All water quality measures must
be sufficient to satisfy the following conditions.
   (A)   Minimize the potential for soil erosion by designing a development
that fits the topography and soils of the site. Deep cuts and fill in areas
with steep slopes should be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours
should be followed as closely as possible.
   (B)   Existing natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever
possible. Areas immediately adjacent to watercourses and lakes also should be
left undisturbed wherever possible. Non-vegetated or vegetated areas with less
than 70% cover that are scheduled or likely to be left inactive for 15 days or
more must be temporarily or permanently stabilized with measures appropriate
for the season to reduce erosion potential. Alternative measures to site
stabilization may be acceptable if the project site owner or their
representative can demonstrate they have implemented and maintained erosion and
sediment control measures adequate to prevent sediment discharge from the
inactive area.
   (C)   All activities on a site should be conducted in a logical sequence so
that the smallest practical area of land will be exposed for the shortest
practical period of time during development.
   (D)   The length and steepness of designed slopes should be minimized to
reduce erosion potential. Drainage channels and swales must be designed and
adequately protected so that their final gradients and resultant velocities
will not cause erosion in the receiving channel or at the outlet.
   (E)   Sediment-laden water which otherwise would flow from the project site
shall be treated by erosion and sediment control measures appropriate to
minimize sedimentation. A stable construction site access shall be provided at
all points of construction traffic ingress and egress to the project site.
   (F)   Appropriate measures shall be implemented to prevent wastes or unused
building materials, including, garbage, debris, packaging material, fuels and
petroleum products, hazardous materials or wastes, cleaning wastes, wastewater,
concrete truck washout, and other substances from being carried from a project
site by runoff or wind. Identification of areas where concrete truck washout is
permissible must be clearly posted at appropriate areas of the site. Wastes and
unused building materials shall be managed and disposed of in accordance with
all applicable state statutes and regulations. Proper storage and handling of
materials such as fuels or hazardous wastes, and spill prevention and cleanup
measures (including having spill response equipment on site) shall be
implemented to minimize the potential for pollutants to contaminate surface or
ground water or degrade soil quality.
   (G)   Public or private roadways shall be kept cleared of accumulated
sediment that is a result of runoff or tracking. Bulk clearing of accumulated
sediment shall not include flushing the area with water. Cleared sediment shall
be redistributed or disposed of in a manner that is in accordance with all
applicable statutes and regulations.
   (H)   Collected runoff leaving a project site must be either discharged
directly into a well-defined, stable receiving channel, or diffused and
released to adjacent property without causing an erosion or pollutant problem
to the adjacent property owner.
   (I)   Natural features, including wetlands, shall be protected from
pollutants associated with stormwater runoff. All erosion and sediment control
measures necessary to comply with this chapter and with other provisions as
outlined in 327 I.A.C. 15-5-7 must be implemented in accordance with the
submitted plans.

up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of
the Department or an authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or
sampling of the facility’s stormwater discharge.
      (4)   The Stormwater Management Division shall have the right to require
the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All
devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction or condition that would
obstruct the safe and easy access to the facility to be sampled or monitored
shall be promptly removed by the operator upon the oral or written request of
the Stormwater Management Division and such obstruction shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access, if any, shall be borne by the facility.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Department of Stormwater
Management access to a facility regulated under this chapter is a violation of
this chapter of the Hammond Municipal Code. A person who is the operator of a
facility with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with
industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies reasonable access
by the Stormwater Management Division or an authorized enforcement agency to
the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this chapter.
      (7)   If the Stormwater Management Division has been refused access to
any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and it can
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter or the code, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part
of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with
this chapter of the code or any order issued hereunder or to protect the
overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the authorized
enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of
competent jurisdiction.

storm drainage system or the waters of the United States.
   (B)   The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal separate
storm sewer system or watercourses, using the city’s approved BMPs. Further,
any person responsible for a property or premise that is or may be the source
of an illicit discharge may be required to implement additional BMPs as
required by the Stormwater Management Division to prevent further discharge of
pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all
terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of
stormwater associated with industrial activity to the extent practicable shall
be deemed to be compliance with the provisions of this section.

   (A)   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or
such person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse
located within their property boundaries free of trash, debris, excessive
vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or
significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition,
the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within
or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard
to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
   (B)   Easements intended for periodic or occasional use as conductors for
the flow of surface water runoff shall be maintained in an unobstructed
condition by the owners of the properties they cross. The utility shall have
the right to determine if any obstruction exists and to repair or maintain, or
require such repair and maintenance by the property owner, as shall be
reasonably necessary to keep the conductors unobstructed.
   (C)   No property owner or occupant shall change the stormwater runoff
pattern of his property in such a way that neighboring properties or city
property is adversely affected. Consideration and provisions must be made for
drainage to and from neighboring properties when land use or development is

measures proposed to be taken to prevent any recurrence; and
      (4)   The name and telephone number of the person making the report, and
the name and telephone number of a person who may be contacted for additional
information on the matter.
   (E)   A properly reported accidental discharge shall be an affirmative
defense to a civil proceeding brought under this chapter against a discharger
for the discharge. The report itself shall not, however, be a defense to a
legal action brought to obtain an injunction, to obtain recovery of costs or to
obtain other relief because of or arising out of the discharge. A discharge
shall be considered properly reported only if the discharger complies with all
the requirements of this section. This requirement does not relieve the
discharger from notifying other entities as required by state or federal
regulations.

   (A)   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting
different colored lights or colored lighted arrows successively, 1 at a time or
in combination, only the colors green, red or yellow may be used, except for
special pedestrian signals under I.C. 9-21-18. The lights indicate and apply to
drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
      (1)   “Green indication” means the following:
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left, unless a sign at the place prohibits
either turn.
         (b)   Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left,
shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully
within the intersection or an adjacent sidewalk at the time the signal is
exhibited.
         (c)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by the green arrow or other movement permitted
by other indications shown at the same time.
         (d)   Vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians
lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the
intersection.
         (e)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal,
pedestrians facing a green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn
arrow, may proceed across the roadway within a marked or unmarked crosswalk.
      (2)   “Steady yellow indication” means the following:
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow
arrow signal is warned that the related green movement is being terminated and
that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter.
         (b)   A pedestrian facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow
signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, is advised
that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is
shown, and a pedestrian may not start to cross the roadway at that time.
      (3)   “Steady red indication” means the following:
         (a)   Except as provided in divisions (A)(3)(b) and (A)(3)(d),
vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a
clearly marked stop line. However, if there is no clearly marked stop line,
vehicular traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection. If there is no crosswalk, vehicular traffic shall stop before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to
proceed is shown.
         (b)   Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn described in
this division, vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal, after coming to a
complete stop, may cautiously enter the intersection to make a right turn, or
make a left turn if turning from the left lane of a 1-way street into another
1-way street with the flow of traffic. Vehicular traffic making a turn
described in this division shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully
within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic using the intersection.
         (c)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal
pedestrians facing a steady circular red signal alone may not enter the
roadway.
         (d)   If the operator of a motorcycle, motorized bicycle, motor
scooter, or bicycle approaches an intersection that is controlled by a traffic
control signal, the operator may proceed through the intersection on a steady
red signal only if the operator:
            1.   Comes to a complete stop at the intersection for at least 120
seconds; and
            2.   Exercises due caution as provided by law, otherwise treats the
traffic control signal as a stop sign, and determines that it is safe to
proceed.
      (4)   No indication or conflicting indications means the following:
         (a)   Except as provided in (4)(c), vehicular traffic facing an
intersection having a signal that displays no indication or conflicting
indications, where no other control is present, shall stop before entering the
intersection.
         (b)   After stopping, vehicular traffic may proceed with caution
through the intersection and shall yield the right-of-way to traffic within the
intersection or approaching so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard.
         (c)   Vehicular traffic entering an intersection or crosswalk facing a
pedestrian hybrid beacon may proceed without stopping if no indication is
displayed on the pedestrian hybrid beacon.
      (5)   This section applies to traffic control signals located at a place
other than an intersection. A stop required under this division must be made at
the signal, except when the signal is supplemented by a sign or pavement
marking indicating where the stop must be made.
(I.C. 9-21-3-7)
   (B)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk” are in place, the signals must indicate as follows:
      (1)   Flashing or steady “walk” means a pedestrian facing the signal may
proceed across the roadway in the direction of the signal and a person who
drives a vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to the pedestrian.
      (2)   (a)   Flashing or steady “don’t walk” means a pedestrian may not
start to cross the roadway in the direction of the signal.
         (b)   A pedestrian who has partially completed crossing on the “walk”
signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while the “don’t walk”
signal is showing.
(Prior Code, § 70.19)
§ 70.25 FLASHING SIGNAL LEGEND.
   (A)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
   (B)   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow light is used in a
traffic signal or with a traffic sign, vehicular traffic shall obey the signal
in the following manner:
      (1)   Flashing red (stop signal) means the following:
         (a)   When a red lens is illuminated by rapid intermittent flashes, a
person who drives a vehicle shall stop at a clearly marked stop line before
entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection.
         (b)   If no line exists, the person shall stop at the point nearest
the intersecting roadway where the person has a view of approaching traffic on
the intersecting roadway before entering the roadway.
         (c)   The right to proceed is subject to the rules applicable after
making a stop at a stop sign.
      (2)   Except as provided in (B)(3), flashing yellow (caution signal)
means that when a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, a
person who drives a vehicle may proceed through the intersection or past the
signal only with caution.
      (3)   When a yellow lens with an arrow is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, a person who operates a vehicle may turn only after
yielding to oncoming traffic.
(I.C. 9-21-3-8) (Prior Code, § 70.21)
§ 70.26 DISPLAY OF UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS, SIGNALS OR MARKINGS.

control device or any railroad sign or signal.
   (B)   No person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority

DANGEROUS ANIMALS
§ 91.105 DANGEROUS ANIMALS.
   (A)   Determination. The city’s Animal Control shall have the authority to
make a determination that an animal is a dangerous animal as defined in §
91.001, and to order the owner to comply with any of the measures set forth in
this section for the protection of public health, safety and welfare.
   (B)   Procedures.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a citizen complaint, police report or other report
of an animal bite, attack, threatening behavior or other reason to believe an
animal may be a dangerous animal, an Animal Control Officer shall evaluate the
seriousness of the complaint or report and if the circumstances warrant, may
conduct an investigation of the facts. Where practicable and readily located,
the investigation shall include interviewing the complainant, the victim, if
any, the animal’s owner and any witnesses, and observation of the animal and
the scene. The investigator then shall make a written finding of whether an
animal is a dangerous animal and the basis for that finding. In addition, if
during the course of the investigation, the investigator uncovers evidence of
inhumane treatment of any animal in violation of §
91.015, he or she shall make a written finding of the specific violation and
issue the appropriate citations. For purposes of this section, a police report
may constitute an investigation and may include a finding of dangerousness.
Based upon the investigator’s finding of a dangerous animal, the city’s Animal
Control may declare in writing that the animal is a dangerous animal. All bites
will be subject to the quarantine procedures of §§
91.092 and
91.093.
      (2)   Where an animal is declared to be a dangerous animal, and the
animal has caused severe injury or death to any person, or domesticated animal,
then the city’s Animal Control may order the humane destruction of the animal,
where appropriate, taking into consideration the severity and the circumstances
of the injury.
      (3)   In all cases where an animal is declared to be a dangerous animal
and the animal is not humanely destroyed, the city’s Animal Control shall order
the owner to comply with the following requirements:
         (a)   While on the owner’s property, the owner must securely confine
the dangerous animal indoors or within a securely enclosed and locked pen,
structure or fence, suitable to prevent the entry of young children and
designed to prevent the animal from escaping. The pen, structure or fence must
be a minimum of 6 feet in height and must have secure sides. If it has no
bottom secured to the sides, the sides must be embedded into the ground no less
than 2 feet deep. The enclosure also must be humane and provide some protection
from the elements for the animal.
         (b)   While off of the owner’s property, a dangerous animal must be
muzzled securely to prevent the possibility of biting, restrained by a
substantial chain or leash not exceeding 6 feet in length, and under the
control of a responsible person at all times. The muzzle must be made in a
manner that will not cause injury to the animal or impair its vision or
respiration but must prevent it from biting any person or animal.
         (c)   The owner must display, in a conspicuous manner, a sign on the
owner’s premises warning that a dangerous animal is on the premises by stating
in capital letters: “WARNING - DANGEROUS ANIMAL - KEEP AWAY.” The sign must be
visible and legible from the public way and from 50 feet away from the special
enclosure required herein.
      (4)   In addition, the Animal Control Director may order the owner to
comply with any of the following requirements, in any combination:
         (a)   The owner must confine the dangerous animal to the secure
enclosure described above at all times and only allow the animal out under the
condition set forth where it is necessary to obtain veterinary care for the
animal or to comply with a court order.
         (b)   The owner must present written proof from an insurance company
and/or agent that he or she has procured liability insurance in the amount of
$300,000 or such other amount as is determined by the city’s Animal Control,
covering all damage or injury which may be caused by the dangerous animal.
         (c)   The owner and the animal must complete a course of animal
obedience training approved by the city’s Animal Control.
         (d)   As an alternative to destruction of the animal, the city’s
Animal Control may order that the dangerous animal shall be permanently barred
from the city limits dependent upon the circumstances.
   (C)   Notice and right to appeal.
      (1)   Where the owner’s address can be reasonably ascertained, the city’s
Animal Control shall send written notice to the owner by certified mail stating
that his or her animal has been declared a dangerous animal, describing the
basis for such declaration by specific behavior and date(s) of occurrence,
setting forth all applicable orders and restrictions imposed by reason of the
declaration, and informing the owner of his or her right to appeal the
determination by filing a written request for a hearing within 7 days of
receipt of the notice. A copy of the notice shall be sent to the complainant,
if any. Where the animal has been impounded pursuant to division (F) below, the
notice shall be sent within 15 days after the impoundment.
      (2)   If the owner requests a hearing, the Board of Public Works and
Safety shall hold a hearing, at which all interested parties may present
testimony and any other relevant evidence, within 15 days of the request. The
hearing shall be taped. If the Board upholds Animal Control’s determination
that the animal is dangerous, the owner shall have 30 days to satisfy all
requirements set out in division (C)(1) above and the notice. In those cases
where the city’s Animal Control has ordered humane destruction of the dangerous
animal, that order shall not be carried out until 7 days after the hearing; if
the owner appeals to the city during that time period, that order shall be
stayed until resolution of the appeal.
      (3)   Where there is probable cause to believe that an animal is a
dangerous animal, the city’s Animal Control is authorized to impound and hold
the animal, at the owner’s expense, pending the investigation and final
resolution of any appeals. Where the animal has caused severe injury or death
to any person, the city’s Animal Control is required to impound and hold the
animal, at the owner’s expense, pending the investigation and final resolution
of any appeals. Moreover, in no event shall a dangerous animal be released to
its owner before the city’s Animal Control approves the enclosure required by
division (B)(3)(a) above.
   (D)   Guard dogs. Guard dogs and dogs which have been found to be “vicious
dogs,” both of which are defined above as dangerous animals, automatically are
required to comply with the requirements without the need for any
individualized declaration or the right to any hearing, except that, to the
extent an owner disputes the fact that his or her animal is used as a guard dog
by a commercial venture, in the instances the protection set forth above shall
apply.
   (E)   Miscellaneous provisions.
      (1)   Every owner of a dangerous animal shall allow inspection of the
required enclosure by the city’s Animal Control.
      (2)   All dangerous animals as defined in this chapter are hereby
declared to be a public nuisance; provided that they are lawful if maintained
in strict compliance with the requirements set out above.
      (3)   Where an animal has caused severe injury or death to any person,
but it is not found to be a dangerous animal on the grounds that the attack was
provoked, the city’s Animal Control shall advise the owner to comply with the
safety measures set forth herein in order to protect the public health, safety
and welfare.
   (F)   Impoundment. Any animal which has been declared a dangerous animal and
which is seen outside and not confined within the enclosure required herein,
and not muzzled and under control as required herein, or thereafter attacks or
injures a person or domestic animal, may be impounded by an animal control
officer or a police officer, at the owner’s expense, and the city’s Animal
Control may order the owner to comply with any of the alternatives set forth
herein, including humane destruction of the animal. The owner shall be entitled
to notice and an opportunity for a hearing in the same manner as provided in
division (C) above.

independent facilities for the exclusive use and enjoyment of a family,
including permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking and

out in United Sates Department of Housing and Urban Development General Counsel
Frank G. Keating’s memorandum dated 3-20-1991, (Title 63 C.F.R. part 243, 12-
18-1998).

(Prior Code, § 96.91) (Ord. 8327, passed 1-15-2001)
§ 96.152 REGISTRATION.
   (A)   Any owner of real property in the city, which real property is used as
rental housing, for all or part of any year, shall be required to register all
such properties on an annual basis by April 15, of each year.
   (B)   The annual registration forms shall be available at the Inspections
Department (and available on-line) and no registration or renewal will be
accepted by that office without a showing of full liability, fire or other
insurance equal to the value of the property insured, including the cost of
demolition of the property. Personal information provided for this purpose will
be kept confidential by the Department. Alternatively, a bond or letter of
credit from a federally insured financial institution may be filed with the
Inspections Department in an amount equal to the value of the property insured
or $25,000, whichever is greater, which will be used to cover the cost of
demolition should the property be damaged by fire, accident, natural disaster
or lack of maintenance by the owner.
   (C)   There shall be an $80 annual fee assessed for each apartment, rental
dwelling or rental unit, due with the registration form which must be completed
each year. An owner occupied building, as demonstrated by a current and
accurate homestead exemption, in that homeowner’s individual name and not in
the name of a trust, limited liability company or corporation, which contains
multiple rental units in addition to the owner’s primary full-time residence,
shall pay $20 per unit, per year for those additional units. Additionally, a
rental dwelling, rental unit or apartment, owned by a city homeowner, as
demonstrated by a current and accurate homestead exemption, on that homeowner’s
full time city permanent residence, in that homeowner’s individual name, shall
pay $20 per year, per unit, with a limit of discounted 20 units, units over 20
shall be registered at the regular $80 rate. Falsification of this information
invalidates the registration and it is the property owner’s duty to notify the
city should this information change. Nothing in this section explicitly or by
implication permits any landlord to rent an uninhabitable, unsafe or otherwise
dangerous unit and no rental registration refund shall be made for such units.
   (D)   Failure to register any or all real property or unit as rental housing
with the city shall constitute a violation of this subchapter and shall subject
the owner to a fine up to $2,500 per unit, per day of violation, with second
and subsequent violations punishable by up to $7,500 per unit, per day. A
finding of violation by the court shall be punishable by no less than $300 for
a first offense and $500 for every second and subsequent offense.
   (E)   Each day of the violation shall constitute a separate and actionable
offense. Fraud in the application process or intentionally failing to provide
correct information will invalidate the registration for that year, and the
property owner will have the rental registration for that unit revoked. Initial
registration is required within 30 days of the effective date of purchase or
obtaining title to the real property which will be used as a rental. Any owner
that removes the property from rental use, sells or otherwise transfers the
property must contact the Inspections Department within 30 days of the transfer
or will be found to be in violation of this section.
   (F)   There shall be a $500 per unit late fee assessed for each dwelling or
rental unit/apartment not registered by April 15, of every year.
   (G)   No landlord or property owner shall allow, permit, aid, or consent to,
ignore obvious, or assist in illegal activity or conduct occurring on his or
her property in the city. The use of rental property in the city for illegal
activity is grounds for revocation of the landlord license for that location.
No landlord shall permit a nuisance to occur at the property once notified of
said nuisance, and shall inform the tenant that he or she is responsible for
following all city ordinance and state laws while residing at that location. A
landlord, whose rental registration is up for revocation, may request a hearing
before the Board of Public Works, should the city commence a revocation action
and the decision of the Board of Works may be appealed to the Superior Court as
provided by law.
   (H)   Landlords who rent to non-related students must obtain the proper
variances from the Zoning Administrator, and may not rent to a single student
with the understanding that the student will sublease to other students and
become a defacto landlord under the ordinance.
   (I)   The city intends to create an enforceable ordinance which is compliant
with all federal and local laws, in the event that this section, or any part of
it, or any provision, discount, amendment or any classification contained
herein, is found to be unconstitutional, the remaining portion will remain in
effect and will be found to be valid, and a single uniform rental registration
fee will be imposed for all rental units in the city, and the discount will not
be permitted under this section.

location set out on the application.
   (B)   Each application for rental registration shall, in addition to all
other information required by the Chief of Inspections or this code section,
contain the name of the primary tenant for each rental unit, and an emergency
contact number for each listed tenant. Each application shall be updated, at no
additional cost, annually or upon a change in tenant. Falsification of an
application or rental registration shall be grounds for revocation or denial of

Department and each day constitutes a separate and continuing offense and shall
subject the owner to a fine of not more than $2,500 for a first offense and

city shall issue a sticker stating the unit's certification, date of expiration
and permitted occupancy. The property owner and/or manager must prominently and
continuously display the sticker on the inside of the door to the main entrance
for each dwelling or rooming unit.
   (C)   It shall be a violation of this chapter for any party to remove the
sticker or for the owner and/or manager to fail to continuously display the
sticker, as provided in division (B) above, in each dwelling or rooming unit
and shall subject the owner or tenant to a fine not to exceed $100 per dwelling
or rooming unit. Each day of the violation shall constitute a separate and
actionable offense.
   (D)   It shall be a violation of this chapter to permit occupancy by more
than the maximum allowed, and shall subject the owner or tenant to a fine not
to exceed $100 per dwelling or rooming unit. Each day of the violation shall
constitute a separate and actionable offense.

maximum concentration of 10% by weight in a hazardous waste shipment.
      (2)   Those P-code listed hazardous wastes that are normally liquids or
gases at a pressure of one atmosphere and a temperature of 90°F shall each be
restricted according to the following methodology, as appropriate.
      (3)   P-code hazardous wastes which can be modeled on ALOHA.
         (a)   For P-code listed hazardous wastes having a published IDLH
concentration, and all of the physical property data required to competently
model a release of the compound utilizing the ALOHA program or an alternate
recognized modeling program mutually acceptable to both the owner and operator
and HDEM, the owner or operator of the facility shall, at its expense, model a
release and set the maximum allowable concentration of each of the
aforementioned P-code listed hazardous wastes in a hazardous waste shipment
using the following formula:
Max. Concentration   =   (Allowable IDLH/20)   x   (100%)
            (Predicted ALOHA concentration)
where:
The ALOHA concentration shall be modeled using the following methodology:
            1.   Wind speed shall be 15 miles per hour from the east.
            2.   The point of accidental release shall be the facility’s
hazardous waste unloading rack.
            3.   The volume of the spill shall be the entire 5,000-gallon
contents of a tank truck containing a 100% concentration of the respective P-
code listed hazardous waste.
            4.   Ambient air temperature shall be 90°F.
            5.   The receptor shall be located 1,125 feet due west from the
source of the spill; for Rhone-Poulenc Basic Chemicals Co.’s facility it shall
be the intersection of Michigan Avenue and Indianapolis Boulevard.
            6.   The surface area of the spill shall be the entire surface area
of the containment dike enclosing the hazardous waste tank truck unloading
spot.
         (b)   However, in no event shall the allowable concentration of any
individual liquid or gaseous P-code listed hazardous waste as calculated under
the provisions of division (B)(3)(a) of this section exceed 10% by weight of
the hazardous waste shipment.
         (c)   The owner or operator of the facility shall provide copies of
all data used for, and results of, the modeling to HDEM within 10 calendar days
after receipt of a written request for same.
            1.   HDEM shall have the right to perform the modeling according to
the methodology set forth in this section for the purpose of verifying the
accuracy of the information provided by the owner or operator of the facility.
            2.   In the event that HDEM’s modelling results differ from those
reported by the owner or operator, the results which predict the higher ALOHA
concentration will be used to establish the maximum allowable concentration of
the P-code listed hazardous waste in the hazardous waste shipment.
            3.   In the event that the owner or operator disagrees with the
modelling results obtained by HDEM, it shall have the right to request that the
modelling be verified by an independent third party consultant or contractor
qualified to perform such modelling and acceptable to both HDEM and the owner
or operator.
            4.   The modelling shall be performed in accordance with the
methodology set forth in this section, shall be performed at the sole expense
of the owner or operator, and the results of same shall be the basis for
establishing the maximum allowable concentration of the P-code listed hazardous
waste in the hazardous waste shipment.
      (4)   P-code hazardous wastes which can not be modeled on ALOHA.
         (a)   For P-code listed hazardous wastes having no published IDLH
concentration and/or incomplete physical property data required to competently
model a release of the compound on the ALOHA program, the maximum allowable
concentration of any given P-code listed hazardous waste in the hazardous waste
shipment shall be established by the following table:
 
Physical State of the P- Vapor Pressure of the P-code Maximum Allowable
code Waste at 90°F      Waste (mm Hg)                Concentration in Waste

hazardous waste that can be received by the facility based on the application
of the methodology described in divisions (B)(1), (B)(2), (B)(3)(a), (B)(3)(b),
and (B)(4)(a) of this section. In the event that the U.S. EPA shall establish
additional P-code listed hazardous wastes in the future, they shall be analyzed
in a timely manner according to the methodology set forth in this division (B),
an appropriate concentration limit shall be established consistent with this
division (B), and the P-code listed hazardous waste will added to Table I, II
or III as appropriate.
      (6)   Any restructuring of the U.S. EPA’s hazardous waste classification
system, which results in the assignment of a different waste code to any of the
P-code listed hazardous wastes that are restricted under this ordinance, shall
have no effect upon the limits contained in this subchapter for the affected P-
code listed hazardous waste. In such event, the limit contained in this
ordinance for the reclassified P-code hazardous waste shall be applied to the
new hazardous waste code as if no change had occurred.
   (C)   The facility shall not accept or burn hazardous wastes that meet any
of the following criteria or definitions as same are defmed by the U.S. EPA:
      (1)   Poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) as defined in Title 40 C.F.R.
part 761.1;

titration or GCMS.
   (D)   In the event that U.S. EPA adds or modifies its hazardous waste
classification system resulting in the creation of new hazardous waste codes
that were not in existence as of the effective date of this ordinance, any new
compound specific hazardous waste codes will be reviewed by HDEM and the owner
or operator to determine whether there is a need to restrict the quantities or
concentrations of the new hazardous waste codes that can be safely handled at
the facility under this chapter. In making this determination, the owner or
operator of the facility shall assess the need for a concentration limit by
applying the methodology outlined in division (B) of this section to any new
compound specific hazardous waste code having a published IDLH concentration
less than 500 ppm.
   (E)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subchapter,
the owner or operator of the facility shall have the right to handle greater
concentrations or quantities of any restricted hazardous waste for the purpose
of conducting reasonable performance tests, or demonstrating compliance with
any applicable federal or state regulation, or demonstrating that a higher
limit than that contained in this ordinance is justifiable. However, the owner
or operator of the facility must notify the Director of HDFM of its intentions
at least 10 business days prior to any such deviation, and obtain the written
approval of HDEM prior to conducting any such tests, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld. In no event shall HDEM deny approval of any test
required to demonstrate compliance with any applicable federal, state or local
ordinance, regulation or directive.
   (F)   Restrictions on certain U-code hazardous wastes.
      (1)   The industrial furnace or boiler shall be subject to limitations on
the receipt of certain hazardous wastes carrying U-code designations as that
term may be defined by the U.S. EPA. Those U-code listed hazardous wastes that
are liquids or gases at a pressure of one atmosphere and a temperature of 90°F.
and have a published IDLH concentration of 200 ppm or less, shall each be
restricted according to the following methodology:
      (2)   For those U-code listed hazardous wastes having all of the physical
property data required to competently model a release of the compound utilizing
the ALOHA program, the owner or operator shall, at its expense, model a release
and set the maximum allowable concentration of each of the aforementioned U-
code listed hazardous wastes using the formula designated in §
102.119(B)(3)(a).
      (3)   For those U-code listed hazardous wastes not having all of the
physical property data required to competently model a release of the compound
utilizing the ALOHA program, the maximum allowable concentration of each of the
aforementioned U-code listed hazardous wastes shall be established using the
following table:

covered under the provisions of this division (G), the matter may be brought
before the American Arbitration Association for resolution of the dispute, with
the losing party paying the cost of the arbitration.
      (4)   Any limit established under the provisions of this division (G)
will be established with sufficient notice to the owner or operator to allow
the owner or operator to develop the necessary analytical and procedural
capabilities to comply with the new limit. Upon the adoption of any new limit
under the provisions of this division (G), the limited compound shall be added
to Tables I or II, as appropriate, of §
102.118 under the provisions of §
102.118(D).
      (5)   For those compounds that are limited pursuant to this division (G),
the limit shall be determined by the following methods as appropriate:
         (a)   For those compounds having all of the physical property data
required to competently model a release of the compound utilizing the ALOHA
program, the owner or operator shall, at its expense, model a release and set
the maximum allowable concentration of the compound using the formula and
methodology designated in §
102.119(B)(3)(a).
         (B)   For those compounds not having all of the physical property data
required to competently model a release of the compound utilizing the ALOHA

successful bidder, who shall then submit said information to the city prior to
the subcontractor's first day of work on the public works project.

not disqualify the successful bidder from performing work on the project and
shall not constitute a contractual default or breach by the successful bidder.
However, payment shall be withheld from any subcontractor who fails to timely

bidder and all subcontractors working on a public works project shall submit a
certified payroll report utilizing federal form WH-347 or its successor form,
which must be prepared on a weekly basis and submitted to the city upon its
request but no later than the date of substantial completion. The city may
request the certified payroll within 10 calendar days after the end of each
week in which the successful bidder or subcontractor performed on the public
works project. Certified payroll reports shall identify the job title and craft
of each employee on the project, e.g. journeyman, electrician, or apprentice

independent contractors to perform work on the project, such individual must be
identified on the federal form WH-347 or successor form with the same
information as is required for employees.
   (B)   The city may withhold payment due for work performed by a successful
bidder or subcontractor for failure to timely submit their respective certified
payroll reports until such time as the reports are submitted. The city shall
not withhold payment to a successful bidder or subcontractor for failure of the

   (A)   The grantee shall make 1 aerial connection for the community

For aerial connections in excess of 150 feet or for underground installations,
the grantee shall charge its actual cost. This cost will be submitted to the
resident, in writing, for his or her approval, before installation is begun.
   (B)   The grantee shall, without charge for installation or monthly service,
make 1 aerial connection for regular subscriber service, as provided below,
into the internal distribution system of each city office building, police
station, fire station, library and school within the city (hereinafter referred

regular subscriber service. Where the premises consist of more than 1 building,
only 1 tie-in and connection shall be made.
      (1)   The grantee shall make a tie-in and connection at the location
designated by the appropriate official as the location of the “head-end” of the
internal distribution system of the premises. The responsibility of the grantee
shall terminate who the tie-in and connection to the internal distribution
system is completed, and the responsibility for performance of the internal
distribution system, and for distribution of the transmissions throughout the
system shall be solely that of the premises. The grantee makes no
representation or warranty as to the ability of the distribution system to
carry the programs transmitted over its cable system; however, the grantee will
offer, without charge, technical consulting services to the premises in order
to make the internal system work effectively for the purposes intended herein.
      (2)   The procedure for making the connections shall be as follows.
         (a)   Connections will be made at the time when the grantee is serving
the area within which the premises are located. At this time, the grantee shall
send written notification of the provisions of this section to the premises.
Thereafter, upon written request from the recipient official, the grantee will
make the above-described tie-in and connection to the internal distribution
system of the premises.
         (b)   When the grantee is serving the area but the building on the
premises to be connected with an aerial installation is located more than 500
feet from the nearest CATV cable, the cost of the aerial cable installation
beyond 500 feet will be paid by the premises. For underground installations,
the grantee shall charge the recipient its actual cost. This cost will be
submitted to the premises, in writing, before installation is begun. All
premises will be connected according to the orderly progress and construction
of the system.

building, code, health, and fire safety codes.
      (2)   Any junk yard operating within the City of Hammond for any length
of time must first procure from the City Controller a permit/license for the
operation of the junk yard. Operating without a permit/license is a violation
of ordinance, and each day of operation is a continuing violation.
      (3)   The permit/license shall be $100 a year, beginning on January 1 and
expiring on December 31 of each year.
      (4)   Any junk yard not obtaining a license by January 31 of each year

nonrenewal of the annual license/permit.

orderly condition and shall be operated in a manner that does not create a
hazard to the health and welfare of the citizens of Hammond.
      (3)   Salvage yard prohibited. No junk yard operating within the City of
Hammond may operate as a salvage yard.
      (4)   New/used car dealership. A junk yard license/permit does not
authorize, permit or allow a junk yard to act as, operate as, or allow the junk
yard to sell new or used cards. No junk yard may operate as a new/used car
dealership, or car wholesaler.
      (5)   Titles required. Any vehicle received by a junk yard must have a
title that corresponds to/belongs with the vehicle being junked. A junk yard
which accepts a vehicle without a title violates this section and may forfeit
its license/permit to operate in the City of Hammond.
      (6)   Junk yard not a tow yard. A junk yard is not a tow yard. A towing
license is not a junk yard license and a junk yard license is not a towing
license. Junk yards and tow yards must remain physically separate.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 123.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS AND SAFETY. Those individuals, severally and jointly,
who comprise and constitute the BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS AND SAFETY of the city.
However, in the event the Board is divided by ordinance into a Board of Public
Works and a Board of Public Safety, then the function of the Board shall be
assumed and carried on by the Board of Public Works for the purposes of this
chapter unless provided otherwise by law.
   CHIEF OF POLICE. The CHIEF OF POLICE of the Police Department of the city
includes any police officer of the city designated or delegated by him or her
to perform any duty, function or responsibility under this chapter, or any
police officer who may otherwise be empowered or authorized to act in his or
her stead or absence.
   CITY CONTROLLER. The official designated or appointed as the Controller of
the city or his or her delegate or representative.
   INVENTORY. Any motor vehicles kept, stored, maintained or upon the premises
of a public garage at any point in time.
   MOTOR VEHICLE. Automobiles of every kind and description; motorcycles of
every kind and description; trucks of every kind and description; and tractors
which are designed for or are capable of drawing or propelling trailers; and
shall also include, but not be limited to any part, accessory, component or
sub-assembly, whether combined, united, or joined together as or part of an
operable vehicle or not, of the automobiles, motorcycles, trucks or tractors;
which by way of example includes, but is not limited to motors and parts
thereof, transmissions and parts thereof, frames, hubcaps, upholstery, wheels,
tires, radios and parts thereof and the like.
   OPERATE. All forms of exertion of control, management, ownership or
administration, and/or activities, actions, functions, services, work or labor,
and/or effects and results of this control, management, ownership,
administration, activities, actions, functions, services, work or labor as
related to the definition of a PUBLIC GARAGE. OPERATE may also be used
synonymously with the phrase “conducting or carrying on the business of a
public garage” in the appropriate context.
   POSSESSION. Includes ACTUAL POSSESSION and CONSTRUCTIVE POSSESSION. ACTUAL
POSSESSION means that a person knowingly has personal manual or physical
possession of the thing in question. CONSTRUCTIVE POSSESSION means that
although the thing is in the physical possession of another person, the person
having constructive possession knowingly had the power of exercising control
over it. POSSESSION under this chapter is not limited to manual touch or
personal custody. If a person has knowledge of the presence of the thing plus
control over it, this is sufficient to constitute POSSESSION under this
chapter. Power to produce or to dispose of the thing is evidence of control.
Proof of POSSESSION may be either by circumstantial or direct evidence. It is
not necessary that POSSESSION be immediate or exclusive. POSSESSION may be SOLE
POSSESSION, as where 1 person alone has actual or constructive possession, or
POSSESSION may be JOINT POSSESSION, as where 2 or more persons share actual or
constructive possession.
   PREMISES. All lands, structures of whatever kind and description, places and
also the equipment and appurtenances connected or used therewith, and also any
personal property which is either affixed to, or is otherwise used in
connection with any actions, activities, acts or conduct carried on thereupon
or for any purpose connected therewith.
   PUBLIC GARAGE. Any premises used or operated, or allowed to be used or
operated, by any person to buy, sell, barter, trade, auction, repair, store,
paint, rebuild, reassemble, repaint, build, install, partially or entirely
dismantle or partially or entirely assemble or disassemble any motor vehicle
whether for profit or hire or not.
      (1)   Leasing companies; manufacturing plants which are engaged primarily
in the manufacture or assembly of new parts or the processing of raw materials
or both; gas service stations which are engaged only in the business of selling
petroleum and chemical products and which do not sell automobiles, trucks, or
motorcycles, or act as an agent or intermediary for a sale or allow the
premises to be used for a sale; and wholesalers, dealers, distributors and
supply houses which buy, sell and use only new parts or components or factory
rebuilds; and public or private parking lots used only for the temporary
parking of automobiles, are specifically excluded and exempted from the
provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   PUBLIC GARAGE. Shall not apply to any person who does any of the
acts mentioned in division (1) above exclusively with regard to a motor vehicle
lawfully owned by the person, provided, that the motor vehicle is for personal
use only or is used only in connection with the owner’s established business,
such as delivery or service vehicles or common carriers, and that any acts are
not done for purposes of immediate resale. Any purchase and sale or other
transfer by any person of a motor vehicle occurring within 3 months shall be
prima facie evidence of the operation of a public garage, unless otherwise
excepted or exempted by this chapter.

of any person discovered by the police officer to be engaged in, or who
reasonably appears to be engaged in, the operation of a public garage to
ascertain whether the public garage is licensed, or whether or not any other
provision of this chapter is being violated. Failure to display or produce a
license for a public garage or failure to display or produce a proper document
showing legal ownership of the motor vehicle involved shall be prima facie
evidence of a violation committed in the officer’s presence.

§ 123.17 REVIEW OF APPLICATION.
   (A)   Upon the application and the fee required being filed with the City
Controller, it is thereby the duty of the City Controller to present the
application to the Board of Public Works and Safety for its approval or
disapproval, as the case may be. The City Controller shall submit a copy of the
application to the Chief of Police. The City Controller shall also make a
record of the date the application and fee are received and the date the
application and fee are presented to the Board of Public Works and Safety and
the date of a copy is submitted to the Chief of Police.
   (B)   The Board of Public Works and Safety upon receipt of the application
shall notify the applicant of a date, in writing, within a reasonable time upon
which he or she is to appear before the Board together with all books and
records, if any, of the public garage for which he or she seeks a license, and
evidence of required insurance coverage, as provided in this chapter, for
example, a valid insurance policy showing the necessary coverage. A copy of
this notice shall be given to the Chief of Police.
   (C)   The Board of Public Works and Safety shall also make or cause to be
made an inspection of the premises for which a license is applied for, and a
written report shall be made of the inspection. The Chief of Police may conduct
an investigation, as he or she deems appropriate, with regard to the
application and may submit a written report of his or her findings, if any, or
appear personally on the date the applicant is interviewed by the Board of
Public Works and Safety. The Board of Public Works and Safety may request the
aid and assistance of any department head in conducting an inspection of the
premises.
   (D)   If it shall reasonably appear to the Board of Public Works and Safety,
after review of the application, the inspection, the interview, and any
information received from the Chief of Police, that the applicant or any person
associated with him or her have been arrested 2 or more times within the past 3
years or have been convicted of any crime within the past 5 years, which would
bear a reasonable relationship to create lack of public trust and confidence in
carrying on or operating the businesses; or that any provision of this chapter
shall or may be violated by the issuance of a license: or for any other valid
and lawful reason, such as, but not limited to, health, fire, safety, building
or zoning code violations, then the Board of Public Works and Safety shall
refuse the application and return the fee.
      (1)   The Board of Public Works and Safety shall make its decision within
60 days of the date of filing of the application and fee. No application,
however, shall be considered unless it conforms with the requirements of this
chapter.
      (2)   An application which is incomplete or does not otherwise conform on
its face will be returned to the applicant, together with the entire fee, by
either the City Controller or Board of Public Works and Safety with a written
explanation. The application shall be considered as not having been filed until
the requirements of this chapter are met.
   (E)   No license shall be issued without the approval and signature of the
Mayor, as provided by law.

   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate adult
entertainment businesses and related activities, to promote the health, safety,
morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish
reasonable and uniform provisions to prevent the deleterious effects of adult
entertainment businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter have
neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny
access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to
their intended market. Further, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter
to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials. It is not the
intent nor effect of this chapter to limit or restrict the lawful activities
permitted under I.C. 7.1.

F.2d 797 (7th Cir. 1989), Shultz v. Cumberland, 228 F.3d 831 (7th Cir. 2000),
as well as studies conducted in other communities including, but not limited
to: Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis,
Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California;
Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; findings reported in the Final
Report of the Attorney General’s Commission on Pornography (1986), the Report
of the Attorney General’s Working Group On the Regulation of Sexually Oriented
Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota); and statistics of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the Common Council finds:
      (1)   Adult entertainment businesses lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently insufficiently controlled
by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no
sufficient mechanism to make owners and/or operators of these establishments
responsible for the activities that occur on the premises;
      (2)   Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex-
related crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where adult
entertainment businesses are located;
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral sex and anal sex, occur
at adult entertainment businesses, especially those which provide booths or
cubicles for viewing films, videos or live sex shows;
      (4)   Acts of prostitution commonly occur at adult entertainment
businesses;
      (5)   The availability of booths and/or cubicles facilitates such
activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
      (6)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters and other adult
entertainment businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises;
      (7)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities that
occur in adult entertainment businesses, including, but not limited to
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, salmonella infections and shigella infections;
      (8)   For the period 1985 through 1995, the total number of reported
cases of AIDS in the United States caused by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
was 523,056 (Statistics of the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.);
      (9)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of persons testing positive for HIV antibody test in the
State of Indiana;
      (10)   The total number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis
in the United States reported during the period 1985 through 1995 was 367,796
(Statistics of the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.);
      (11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with a total of 1,250,581 cases reported
during the period 1993 through 1995 (Statistics of the U. S. Department of
Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention);
      (12)   The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986 advised the public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted
through sexual contact;
      (13)   According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and HIV
infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by
sexual acts (Findings of the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.);
      (14)   Sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities;
      (15)   Prostitution, sexual assaults and other criminal activity occur at
adult entertainment businesses;
      (16)   Prostitution and other criminal activities have occurred at adult
entertainment businesses in Hammond and other communities in Lake County and
elsewhere in Indiana;
      (17)   Prostitution is connected to the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases;
      (18)   Adult entertainment businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns;
      (19)   Reasonable licensing procedures are an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of the reasonable regulation on the owners, operators and
employees of adult entertainment businesses. Further, a licensing procedure
will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the owners and operators to
ensure that the adult entertainment business is operated in a manner consistent
with the health, safety and welfare of its customers and employees, as well as
the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances
that the licensee is the actual operator of the adult entertainment businesses,
fully in possession and control of the premises and activities;
      (20)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the daily operation and maintenance of an adult entertainment
business, where the information is substantially related to the significant
governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the
spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity;
      (21)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in conduct this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely
to be witnesses to such activity;
      (22)   Education and testing are effective in reducing the spread of
sexually transmitted diseases;
      (23)   Compiling information about incidents of sexually transmitted
diseases will assist the city in its future drafting of ordinances such as this
one and other public health ordinances; and
      (24)   The general welfare, health, morals and safety, of the citizens of
the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT; PURPOSE; METHODS OF
REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-1-4-11
granted the power to local government units to control land use within their
jurisdictions. Therefore, the Common Council of the City of Hammond does hereby
adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
   (B)   Findings of fact. The flood hazard areas of the City of Hammond are
subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
area;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP).
   (D)   Methods of reducing flood loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters, or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 9588, passed 12-27-2022)
§ 153.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them meaning they have in common
usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A ZONES,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below.
      ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood event.
Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood
elevation or depths are shown.
      ZONE AE. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood event
determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown within these
zones.
      ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow flooding
(usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between 1 and
3 feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown
within this zone.
      ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow flooding
(usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between 1 and 3 feet.
Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within
this zone.
      ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown on the FIRM.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A structure with a floor area of 400 square feet or
less that is on the same parcel of property as a principal structure and the
use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure; an ACCESSORY
STRUCTURE specifically excludes structures used for human habitation.
      (1)   ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are considered walled and roofed where the
structure includes at least 2 outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof.
      (2)   Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES include but are not necessarily
limited to 2-car detached garages (or smaller), carports, storage and tool
sheds, and small boathouses.
      (3)   The following may have uses that are incidental or accessory to the
principal structure on a parcel but are generally not considered to be
ACCESSORY STRUCTURES by the NFIP:
         (a)   Structures in which any portion is used for human habitation,
whether as a permanent residence or as temporary or seasonal living quarters,
such as a detached garage or carriage house that includes an apartment or guest
quarters, or a detached guest house on the same parcel as a principal
residence;
         (b)   Structures used by the public, such as a place of employment or
entertainment; and
         (c)   Development that does not meet the NFIP definition of a
structure for floodplain management purposes. Examples includes, but are not
necessarily limited to, a gazebo, pavilion, picnic shelter, or carport that is
open on all sides (roofed but not walled).
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common
loadbearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which
is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-
bearing walls, is new construction.
   ALTERATION OF A WATERCOURSE. A dam, impoundment, channel relocation, change
in channel alignment, channelization, or change in cross-sectional area of the
channel or the channel capacity, or any other modification which may alter,
impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water
during conditions of the base flood.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter, a request for a variance, or a
challenge of a Board decision.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO, or AH Zone on the community’s
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from 1 to 3 feet where a
clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The land within a community subject to a 1% or
greater chance of being flooded in any given year.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any

FLOOD or 100-YEAR FLOOD.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The water surface elevation of the base flood in
relation to a specified datum, usually the North American Vertical Datum of
1988.
   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BEST AVAILABLE FLOOD LAYER (BAFL). Floodplain studies and any corresponding
floodplain maps prepared and/or approved by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources which provide base flood elevation information floodplain limits,
and/or floodway delineations for flood hazards identified by approximate
studies on the currently effective FIRM (Zone A) and/or for waterways where the
flood hazard is not identified on available floodplain mapping.
   BREAKAWAY WALL. A wall that is not part of the structural support of the
building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under
specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion
of the structure.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COASTAL HIGH HAZARD AREA. An area of special flood hazard extending from
offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and
any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic
sources. The area is designated on a FIRM as Zone V1-30, VE, VO, or V.

   FLOOD or FLOODING.
      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from:
         (a)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
         (b)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
         (c)   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by
flooding and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of
normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and
deposited along the path of the current.
      (2)   FLOOD or FLOODING also includes the collapse or subsidence of land
along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion or
undermining caused by waves or current of water exceeding anticipated cyclical
levels that result in a flood as defined above.
   FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Areas subject to the 1% annual chance flood. (See SPECIAL
FLOOD HAZARD AREA.)
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available
digitally is called a DIGITAL FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (DFIRM).
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM and
the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOODPLAIN.)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The BFE plus 2 feet at any given location in
the SFHA. For sites within a SFHA designated as “Zone AO” the BFE is equivalent
to the flood depth specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, measured from the
highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth is specified, 2 feet is used as the
minimum depth. (See FREEBOARD.)
   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by water from any source. (See FLOOD.)
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. Zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances
(such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control
ordinance), and other applications of police power which control development in
flood prone areas. The term describes such state or local regulations in any
combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage
prevention and reduction.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulative increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE or FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the floodplain lying outside the
floodway.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   HARDSHIP (as related to variances of this chapter). The exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City of
Hammond Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional,
unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial
hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations,
physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors
likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these
problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even
if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior;
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by (a)
an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of Interior, or (b)
directly by the Secretary of Interior in states without approved programs.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. Analyses performed by a
professional engineer licensed by the State of Indiana, in accordance with
standard engineering practices that are accepted by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and FEMA, used to determine the base flood, other frequency
floods, flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries, and flood
profiles.
   INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL EVALUATION SERVICE (ICC-ES) REPORT. A document
that presents the findings, conclusions, and recommendations from a particular
evaluation. ICC-ES REPORTS provide information about what code requirements or
acceptance criteria were used to evaluate a product, and how the product should
be identified, installed.
   LATTICE WORK. See BREAKAWAY WALL.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the 6-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this 6-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). FEMA’s comment on a
proposed project that would, upon construction, result In modification of the
SFHA through the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
      (2)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (CLOMR-F). A
letter from FEMA stating that a proposed structure that will be elevated by
fill would not be inundated by the base flood.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a building or land is not
located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A
LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
      (4)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT OUT AS SHOWN (LOMA-OAS). An official
determination by FEMA that states the property or building is correctly shown
outside the SFHA as shown on an effective NFIP map. Therefore, the mandatory
flood insurance requirement does not apply. An out-as-shown determination does
not require elevations.
      (5)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (6)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). FEMA’s modification
of the SFHA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill outside the
existing regulatory floodway.

either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet
or exceed the following criteria:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
         (b)   At least 2 openings are designed and maintained for the entry
and exit of floodwater; and these openings provide a total net area of at least
1 square inch for every 1 square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than 1 foot above the exterior grade or the

153.99
§ 153.29 MAP MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.
   To meet NFIP minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved
by FEMA, and to ensure that the City of Hammond’s flood maps, studies and other
data identified in §
153.04 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
   (A)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
      (1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within 6 months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include
         (a)   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         (b)   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
         (c)   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and subdivision or large-scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations.
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have required
technical data for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map
Revision and submitted to FEMA. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources
will review the submittals as part of a partnership with FEMA. The submittal
should be mailed to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources at the address
provided on the FEMA form (MT-2) or submitted through the online Letter of Map
Change website. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall be
the responsibility of the applicant.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter of
Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain improvement location permit
for proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood elevation.
      (4)   Floodplain improvement location permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to this section.
   (B)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator may
request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does
not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such
as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City of Hammond
and may be submitted to FEMA at any time.
   (C)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain Administrator
shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City of Hammond
have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an
area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management
regulations for a particular area. In order that the Lake County, Indiana and
Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Hammond boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
City of Hammond suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the City of Hammond has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.

153.99
§ 153.30 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The Board of Zoning Appeals (the Board) as established by the Common
Council of the City of Hammond shall hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances from requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in
any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Floodplain
Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter, in
accordance with I.C. 36-7-4-919 and I.C. 39-7-4-920. Any person aggrieved by
the decision of the Board may appeal such decision to the appropriate court, in
accordance with I.C. 36-7-4-1600 et seq.
   (C)   In considering such applications, the Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (2)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (6)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (7)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (8)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (9)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters at the site; and
      (10)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance.
   (E)   Variances from the provisions of this chapter shall only be granted
when the Board can make positive findings of fact based on evidence submitted
at the hearing for the following:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship as defined in §
153.02.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
   (F)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §§
153.40(A), (C)(1) or (D) may be granted.
   (G)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §§
153.40(A), (C)(1) or (D) will require a permit from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources. Variances shall not be issued within any designated
regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
   (H)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §§
153.40 through
153.44 may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of 1/
2 acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
   (I)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic
structures” upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation
will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an “historic
structure” and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character
and design of the structure.
   (J)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use.
   (K)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (L)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
   (M)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (N)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request.
(Ord. 9588, passed 12-27-2022) Penalty, see §
153.99
PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 153.40 FLOODPLAIN STATUS STANDARDS.
   (A)   Floodways (riverine). Located within SFHAs, established in §
153.04 are areas designated as floodways (either identified on the FIRM or
identified by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources through detailed or
approximate studies and not identified on a FIRM). The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. Under the provisions of the
Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1) a permit for construction in a floodway from
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance
of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or
obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation
activities such as filling, grading, clearing, and paving undertaken before the
actual start of construction of the structure. General licenses and exemptions
to the requirements of the Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1 and 312 IAC 10) may
apply to qualified additions/improvements to existing lawful residential
structures, rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland restoration, utility line
crossings, outfall projects, creek rock removal, and prospecting.
      (1)   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in §
153.04, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources and apply for approval for construction in a
floodway, provided the activity does not qualify for a general license or
exemption (I.C. 14-28-1 or 312 IAC 10).
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. The floodplain
improvement location permit shall meet the provisions contained in this
subchapter.
      (3)   The floodplain improvement location permit cannot be less
restrictive than an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to
qualify for a general license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a
specific site/project. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if
any) shall take precedence.
      (4)   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development shall cause
no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge
without first obtaining a Conditional Letter of Map Revision and meeting
requirements of §
153.29(A). A Conditional Letter of Map Revision cannot be issued for
development that would cause an increase in flood levels affecting a structure
and such development should not be permitted.
      (5)   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet identified on the
effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity
of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation
of the regulatory flood of at least 0.15 feet as determined by comparing the
regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that under the
natural or pre- floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
      (6)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 C.F.R. 65.12.
   (B)   Fringe (riverine). If the site is in the fringe (either identified on
the FIRM or identified by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources through
detailed or approximate studies and not identified on a FIRM), the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain improvement location permit
provided the provisions contained in this subchapter have been met.
   (C)   SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/
fringes (riverine).
      (1)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than 1 square mile:
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than 1 square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade
has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain improvement location
permit may be issued, provided the conditions of the floodplain improvement
location permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this
section have been met.
      (2)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than 1 square mile:
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than 1 square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
         (b)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain improvement location permit, provided the provisions contained in
this subchapter have been met.
   (D)   SFHAs not identified on a map.
      (1)   If a proposed development site is near a waterway with no SFHA
identified on a map, the Floodplain Administrator shall verify the drainage
area upstream of the site. If the drainage area upstream of the site is
verified as being greater than 1 square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade
has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper written
approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain analysis/
regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain improvement location permit may
be issued, provided the conditions of the floodplain improvement location
permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this subchapter
have been met.
   (E)   Coastal high hazard areas. Areas in/around Lake Michigan are
designated as coastal high hazard areas as established in §
153.04. These areas have special flood hazards associated with wave wash. A
person, other than a public or municipal water utility, may not place, fill, or
erect a permanent structure in; remove water from; or remove material from a
navigable waterway without a permit from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources (I.C. 14-19-1). Once a permit or approval has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue
the local floodplain improvement location permit provided the applicable
provisions in this subchapter have been met.
(Ord. 9588, passed 12-27-2022) Penalty, see §
153.99
§ 153.41 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure;
   (B)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage below the FPG;

requirements of “new construction” as contained in this chapter;
   (I)   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or 5 acres;
   (J)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development;
   (K)   Drainage paths must be provided to guide floodwaters around and away
from proposed structures to be constructed on slopes in areas of shallow
flooding, designated as Zone AO or Zone AH on the FIRM;
   (L)   Fill projects that do not involve a structure must be protected
against erosion and scour during flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulk
heading, if vegetative cover is used, the slopes shall be no steeper than 3
foot horizontal to 1 foot vertical.
   (M)   Non-conversion agreements shall be required for all new or
substantially improved elevated structures with an enclosure beneath the
elevated floor, accessory structures, and open-sided shelters; and
   (N)   Construction of new solid waste disposal facilities, hazard waste
management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall not
be permitted in areas of special flood hazard.
(Ord. 9588, passed 12-27-2022) Penalty, see §
153.99
§ 153.42 SPECIFIC STANDARDS (NOT APPLICABLE TO COASTAL HIGH HAZARD AREAS).
   In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data or
flood depths have been provided (other than coastal high hazard areas), as set
forth in §
153.04, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Building protection requirement. In addition to the general standards

are prohibited unless an engineering report documents that the alterations will
not increase potential flood damage by reducing the wave and flow dissipation
characteristics of the sand dunes.
   (B)   The use of fill for structural support of buildings is prohibited.
   (C)   Non-structural fill within a coastal high hazard area shall be
permitted only if an engineering report demonstrates that the fill will not
cause runup, ramping, or deflection of floodwaters that cause damage to
buildings.
   (D)   Within a coastal high hazard area, bulkheads, seawalls, revetments,
and other erosion control measures shall not be connected to the foundation or
superstructure of a building and shall be designed and constructed so as not to
direct floodwaters or increase flood forces or erosion impacts on the
foundation or superstructure of any building.

below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or be constructed with non-
supporting breakaway walls, open wood latticework, or insect screening intended
to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement,
or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or
supporting foundation system.
      (5)   For purposes of this section, a breakaway wall must have a design
safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20 pounds per
square foot.
      (6)   Use of breakaway walls that exceed a design safe loading resistance
of 20 pounds per square foot, either by design or where so required by local or
state codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or
architect certifies that the design proposed meets the following conditions:
         (a)   Breakaway wall collapse must result from a water load less than
that which would occur during the base flood; and
         (b)   The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation
system must not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural
damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all
building components, structural and nonstructural.
            1.   Water loading values used must be those associated with the
base flood.
            2.   Wind loading values used must be those required by applicable
state or local building standards; or in the absence of applicable state or
local building standards, those determined according to American Society of
Civil Engineers 7-16, Minimum design loads and associated criteria for
buildings and other structures, or equivalent standard.
      (7)   Any enclosed space below the lowest floor shall be used solely for
parking of vehicles, building access, or storage.

buildings and structures within each historic district described on the map.
Buildings and structures shall be classified as historic or non-historic, in
the following manner:

or architectural merit of a degree warranting their preservation. They may be
further classified as:
         (a)   Outstanding;
         (b)   Notable;
         (c)   Contributing; or

§ 159.06 APPROVAL BY COMMON COUNCIL REQUIRED.
   The map setting forth the historic district boundaries and building
classifications must be submitted to, and approved in an ordinance by, the

§ 159.08 RELATIONSHIP TO ZONING DISTRICTS.
   The historic landmark/district regulation provided in this chapter is
intended to preserve and protect the historic or architecturally worthy
buildings, structures, sites, monuments, streetscapes, squares and
neighborhoods of the historic districts. Zoning districts lying within the
boundaries of the historic landmark/district are subject to the regulations for
both the zoning district and the historic landmark/district. If there is a
conflict between the requirements of the historic district, the more
restrictive requirements shall apply.
(Prior Code, § 160.08) (Ord. 7099, passed 12-12-1988)
§ 159.09 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS REQUIRED.
   A certificate of appropriateness or letter of authorization must be issued

or structure subject to view from a public way.
   (B)   Within a primary area of the historic district:
      (1)   A change in walls and fences or construction of walls and fences,
if along public ways; or
      (2)   A conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of non-historic

(Prior Code, § 160.09) (Ord. 7099, passed 12-12-1988)
§ 159.10 APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   An application for certificates of appropriateness may be made in the office
of the Department of Planning on forms provided by that office and shall be
subject to the following requirements:
   (A)   The Historic Preservation Commission may adopt, as a part of its
rules, filing requirements which it finds reasonable and necessary to expedite
the business of the Commission. These rules may include, but are not limited
to, filing deadlines and application requirements such as sketches, drawings,
photographs, descriptions or other information showing the proposed exterior
alterations, additions, changes or new construction which the Commission
requires to make a decision.
   (B)   Applications are to be received by the fifteenth of the month in order
to be presented at the Commission’s regularly scheduled meeting of the
following month.
(Prior Code, § 160.10) (Ord. 7099, passed 12-12-1988)
§ 159.11 ACTION ON APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (A)   The Historic Preservation Commission or the City Planner, acting on
the Commission’s behalf, may advise and make recommendations to the applicant
before acting on an application for a certificate of appropriateness.
   (B)   When directed by the Commission, the City Planner shall issue
certificates of appropriateness or letters of authorization on the Commission’s
behalf for normal or routine maintenance and repair work items, which may
include, but are not limited to painting (including approval of colors) and
reroofing.
   (C)   If an application for a certificate of appropriateness: is approved by
the Commission, or is not acted on by the Commission; within 30 days after it
is filed, a certificate of appropriateness shall be issued. If the certificate
is issued, the application shall be processed in the same manner as
applications for building or demolition permits required by the city, if any,
are processed. If no building or demolition permits are required by the city,
the applicant may proceed with the work authorized by the certificate.
   (D)   If the Commission denies an application for a certificate of
appropriateness within 30 days after if is filed, the certificate may not be
issued. The Commission must state its reasons for the denial in writing, and
must advise the applicant. An application that has been denied may not be
processed as an application for a building or demolition permit and does not
authorize any work by the applicant. However, the Commission may issue a
“letter of authorization.” (See division (F) below).
   (E)   The Commission may grant an extension of the 30-day limit prescribed
by divisions (C) and (D) above if the applicant agrees to.
   (F)   In those circumstances where the applicant refuses to comply with the
Commission’s recommendations or it becomes an economic or personal hardship for
the applicant to comply with the Commission’s recommendations, the Commission
or City Planner may issue a letter of authorization in lieu of a certificate of
appropriateness. The purpose of a letter of authorization is to note that the
proposed improvements are not in strict compliance with the Secretary of
Interior’s Guidelines or the guidelines and standards which have been adopted
for the specific landmark or district, but the improvements are such that the
historical and architectural character of the structure would not be destroyed
or lost forever and the structure would be in a better condition with the
proposed improvements than it would be without them, and that a building permit
may be issued for the proposed improvements.
   (G)   When the Commission is reviewing certificate of appropriateness
applications, it must follow the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation or those guidelines and standards which have been adopted for
the specific landmark or district. The Commission will also consider the
following in reviewing certificate of appropriateness applications:
      (1)   Appropriateness of the proposed construction, reconstruction,
alteration, demolition, or moving to the Historic landmark, specifically, and/
or the Historic District, generally;
      (2)   The detriment to the public welfare if the proposed construction,
reconstruction, alteration, demolition or moving is permitted even though it is
not deemed appropriate; and
      (3)   The potential hardship that the denial of a certificate of
appropriateness would cause the applicant.
   (H)   Prior to the approval or denial of those certificate of
appropriateness applications which come before the Commission, site visits
shall have been made by at least a majority of the voting Commission members.
   (I)   The City Planner, if so directed by the Commission, shall issue
written recommendations for certificate of appropriateness applications prior
to the Commission meeting at which the applications will be considered.
   (J)   The City Planner, if so directed by the Commission, shall prepare a
written determination for specific certificate of appropriateness applications,
which written determination shall include the opinion of the Commission,
including any dissent, the appropriateness of the work proposed in regard to
preserving or destroying the historic aspect and nature of the building, site
or area and any changes in plans or specifications recommended by the
Commission. However, the Commission’s opinion may be incorporated into and
written on the actual certificate of appropriateness form.
(Prior Code, § 160.11) (Ord. 7099, passed 12-12-1988)
§ 159.12 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   An historic building or structure or any part of or appurtenance to
such a building or structure, including stone walls, fences, light fixtures,
steps, paving and signs may be moved, reconstructed, altered or maintained only
in a manner that will preserve the historical and architectural character of
the building, structure or appurtenance.
   (B)   An historic building may be relocated to another site only if it is
shown that preservation on its current site is inconsistent with division (A)
above.
(Prior Code, § 160.12) (Ord. 7099, passed 12-12-1988)
§ 159.13 DEMOLITION.
   (A)   The purpose of this section is to preserve historic districts that are
important to the education, culture, traditions and economic values of the city
and to afford the city historical organizations, and other interested persons
the opportunity to acquire or to arrange for the preservation of these
buildings.
   (B)   A certificate of appropriateness must be issued by the Historic
Preservation Commission before a demolition permit is issued by other agencies
of the city and work is begun on the demolition of any building or structure in
any area of an historic district.
   (C)   Before or while the certificate of appropriateness application for
demolition is considered by the Commission, the Commission may request the City
Engineer or Building Commissioner or any other appropriate city official to
prepare a report on the state of repair and structural stability of the
structure and that report is to become part of the administrative record for
the application.
   (D)   Criteria for the Commission to consider in the case of a proposed
demolition include the following:
      (1)   Effect, detrimental or not, of the demolition to the character of
the historic district;
      (2)   State of deterioration, disrepair and structural stability of the
structure;
      (3)   Balance of the public interest in preserving the structure or the
integrity of the district with the interest of the owner of the building or
structure in the use and utilization of the property; and
      (4)   Possible alternatives to demolition.
   (E)   If the Commission denies the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness for the demolition of a building or structure, a demolition
permit may be issued by other agencies and a building may be demolished, but
only after establishing all of the following:
      (1)   The property owner must demonstrate to the Commission that an
historic building or structure is incapable of earning an economic return on
its value, as appraised by a licensed real estate appraiser. The property owner
may demonstrate that his or her building is incapable of earning an economic
return on its value by showing that it is impractical or impossible to sell or
lease the building or that no reasonable market price may be established for
the building.
      (2)   The property owner shall file with the City Planner documented
evidence that a good faith effort is being made to sell or otherwise dispose of
such property at fair market value to any public or private person or agency
which gives a reasonable assurance of its willingness to preserve and restore
such property. Such documented evidence shall be provided at the property
owner’s expense and shall include:
         (a)   Offering price;
         (b)   Date the offer of sale is to begin;
         (c)   Name and address of listing real estate agent, if any;
         (d)   A copy of an advertisement to run in the same manner as the
notice in division (F) below which offers the property for sale; and
         (e)   An appraisal of the property’s fair market value by a licensed
real estate appraiser.
   (F)   Before a demolition permit is issued or demolition proceeds, notice of
the proposed demolition must be given for a period fixed by the Commission,
based on the Commission’s classification on the approved map, but not less that
60 days nor more than one year. Notice must be posted on the premises of the
building or structure proposed for demolition in a location clearly visible
from the street. In addition, notice must be published in a newspaper of
general local circulation at least 3 times before demolition, with the first
publication not more than 15 days after the application for a permit to
demolish is filed, and the final publication at least 15 days before the date
of the permit.
   (G)   The Commission may approve a certificate of appropriateness at any
time during the notice period under division (F) above. If the certificate is
approved, a demolition permit shall be issued without further delay, and
demolition may proceed.
   (H)   Prior to the issuance of a demolition permit, the Commission may
require the applicant to provide documentation of the resource proposed for
demolition. Such documentation may include photographs, floor plans, measured
drawings, archeological survey and any other comparable form of documentation
stipulated by the Commission.
(Prior Code, § 160.13) (Ord. 7099, passed 12-12-1988)
§ 159.14 PUBLIC SAFETY.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the construction,
reconstruction, alteration or demolition of a historic landmark or structure,
building or any part thereof within an historic district when so ordered by an
agency of government having jurisdiction thereof provided that the following
actions occur first:
   (A)   The agency having jurisdiction shall determine that a structure or
building or any part thereof is immediately hazardous or dangerous to the
health and safety of persons or to property as per city ordinances regulating
such buildings.
   (B)   The agency issuing such an order shall so notify the City Planner, the
Historic Preservation Commission’s administrator, who in turn shall notify the
Commission; and
   (C)   If demolition is ordered, the agency issuing such an order shall make
every effort possible to secure the property or otherwise delay demolition
until the Commission can act as designated in this section. Demolition so
ordered may occur prior to Commission action only when an immediate hazard or
danger to the health and safety of persons or property exists and no reasonable
steps can be taken to afford protection to persons or property affected.
(Prior Code, § 160.14) (Ord. 7099, passed 12-12-1988)
§ 159.15 CONFORMANCE TO STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS FOR BUILDINGS.
   Historic buildings shall be maintained to meet the applicable requirements
established under state and local laws for buildings generally. The Historic
Preservation Commission may petition the Building Commissioner to use the legal
means available to him or her to cause the maintenance and/or repair of any
historic landmark or structure in a local historic district in accordance with
the intent to this chapter.

§ 161.01 FINDINGS; PURPOSE.
   The City Council finds that adult entertainment establishments may be
associated with prostitution, disruptive conduct and other criminal activity
which may threaten the quality of life in the city’s commercial and residential
neighborhoods and may generally constitute a threat to the public health,
safety and welfare. These conditions necessitate enactment of a moratorium on
the acceptance or issuance of licenses or use permits or building permits for
such businesses, while the City Council considers the feasibility and
advisability of “time, manner, place” restrictions.
(Prior Code, § 162.15) (Ord. 7811, passed 8-14-1995)
§ 161.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this subchapter, ADULT ENTERTAINMENT USE OR
ESTABLISHMENT shall include the following:
   (A)   Adult bookstore;
   (B)   Adult videostore;
   (C)   Adult cabaret;
   (D)   Adult mini theatre; and
   (E)   Adult theatre or similar use.
(Prior Code, § 162.16) (Ord. 7811, passed 8-14-1995)
§ 161.03 MORATORIUM PERIOD.
   For a period of 180 days (“moratorium period”) from the effective date of
this chapter or until new land use regulations governing the location of adult
entertainment uses take effect, whichever is sooner, no required city license
or use permit or building permit applied for during the moratorium period shall
be accepted or issued for any adult entertainment establishment.
(Prior Code, § 162.17) (Ord. 7811, passed 8-14-1995)
§ 161.99 PENALTY.
   Any adult entertainment establishment which was not in existence or which
was not properly licensed as of the enactment of this chapter and which
operates in violation of any provision contained in this chapter shall be
subject to a fine not to exceed $2,500. Each day such violation continues shall
be considered an additional and separate offense.
