CHAPTER 11: DEBT SERVICE RESERVE ACCOUNT
Section
   
11.01   Debt service reserve account
§ 11.01 DEBT SERVICE RESERVE ACCOUNT.
   There is hereby continued, within the Sinking Fund, the Debt Service Reserve
Account (“Debt Service Reserve Account”). On the date of delivery of the Bonds,
the town may deposit funds on hand, Bond proceeds, unless the Bonds are sold to
the SRF Program, or a combination thereof, into the Debt Service Reserve
Account up to an amount which shall cause the balance therein to equal but not
exceed the hereinafter defined Reserve Requirement. The Reserve Requirement
means a balance which shall equal but not exceed an amount equal to the maximum
annual debt service on the 1991 Bonds and the Bonds, which is herein defined as
the initial reserve requirement, and which amount will be decreased on the
second day of each October to the maximum annual debt service on the then
outstanding 1991 Bonds and Bonds in the then present or any succeeding year
(“Reserve Requirement”); provided, if the Bonds are sold to the SRF Program,
that the town shall give 15-days written notice to the State before
transferring funds out of the Reserve Account. Further, in the event any
revenue bonds are hereafter issued which are payable from the Net Revenues of
the waterworks on a parity with the 1991 Bonds and Bonds (“Parity Bonds”), such
Reserve Requirement shall be equal to the combined maximum annual debt service
on the 1991 Bonds, Bonds and such Parity Bonds; provided, however, that in the
event at the time of issuance of any Parity Bonds it is determined by
nationally recognized bond counsel that maintenance of a reserve at an amount
equal to combined maximum annual debt service would preclude the interest on
such Parity Bonds from being excludable from gross income for federal income
tax purposes, then the town may issue such Parity Bonds by an authorizing
ordinance which shall provide that in lieu of being secured by or payable from
the Reserve Account herein continued, such Parity Bonds will be secured by and
payable from a separate reserve account therein created with a reserve
requirement fixed at the maximum amount then determined as not precluding the
interest on such Parity Bonds from being excludable from gross income for
federal income tax purposes. The Reserve Requirement under this ordinance is in
addition to any amounts to be maintained in the Debt Service Reserve Account
under the ordinances authorizing the Outstanding Bonds. If no initial deposit
is made or if the balance in the Debt Service Reserve Account does not equal
the Reserve Requirement, a sum of Net Revenues of the waterworks shall be
deposited into the Debt Service Reserve Account on the last day of each
calendar month until the balance in the Debt Service Reserve Account equals but
does not exceed the Reserve Requirement. The monthly deposits of Net Revenues
shall be equal in amount and sufficient to accumulate the Reserve Requirement
within five years of the date of delivery of the Bonds. The Debt Service
Reserve Account shall constitute the margin for safety and protection against
default in the payment of principal of and interest on the 1991 Bonds, the
Bonds and any Parity Bonds, and the monies in the Debt Service Reserve Account
shall be used to pay current principal and interest on the 1991 Bonds, the
Bonds and any Parity Bonds to the extent that monies in the Bond and Interest
Account are insufficient for that purpose. Any deficiency in the balance
maintained in the Debt Service Reserve Account shall be made up from the next
available Net Revenues remaining after credits into the Bond and Interest
Account. Any monies in the Debt Service Reserve Account in excess of the
Reserve Requirement shall either be transferred to the Waterworks Improvement
Fund or be used for the redemption or purchase of outstanding bonds or
installments of principal of fully registered bonds at a price not exceeding
par and accrued interest.

in writing that the member is being reprimanded or suspended, or will not
receive a permanent appointment. If a member is notified that he or she will
not receive a permanent appointment, the member's employment immediately
ceases. Otherwise, at the expiration of the probationary period the member is
considered regularly employed.
   (J)   Police Department Chief and Deputy Chief. To be appointed Police

eligibility list for a position consists of members who have been placed on the
list in order of their cumulative score on all rating factors. The eligibility
list shall be maintained for two years from the date of certification, after
which time the list shall be retired and a new list established. The retired
list shall be kept for five years and then destroyed.
      (4)   Written competitive examinations shall be conducted, and appeals

      (5)   The Commission shall adopt rules for determining a performance
rating for Department members, pursuant to I.C. 36-8-3.5-15. Ratings shall be
submitted to the Chief and kept on file, and the Chief shall notify each member
in writing of his or her rating. Appeals may be filed pursuant to I.C. 36-8-
3.5-15.
      (6)   When a vacancy in rank occurs, the Commission shall certify to the
Chief the three members with the highest scores on the eligibility list for
that particular rank. Within six months the Commission, upon the recommendation
of the Chief, shall promote one of those Department members to fill the vacant
position.
      (7)   All promotions are probationary for a period not to exceed one
year. At the end of the period, a probationary member's superior shall review
the member's performance and recommend to the Commission that the promotion be
made permanent, or revoked. The Commission shall review the report and decide
what action should be taken. The probationary member is entitled to counsel, to
be heard, and to appeal a decision not to make the promotion permanent,
pursuant to I.C. 36-8-3.5-16.

promotion that gives that person an advantage over another applicant.
      (3)   If the Chief, after an investigation, prefers charges against a
Department member for an alleged breach of discipline, a hearing shall be
conducted upon request of the member. The hearing shall be conducted, and
required notices shall be drafted and served, pursuant to the requirements set
forth in I.C. 36-8-3.5-17. A decision to discipline a member may be made only
if the preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing indicates such a
course of action.
      (4)   A member who is aggrieved by the decision of a person or board
designated to conduct a disciplinary hearing may appeal to the Commission
within ten days of the decision. The Commission shall on appeal review the
record and either affirm, modify, or reverse the decision on the basis of the
record and such oral or written testimony that the Commission determines,

provide the member's allowances for any other fringe benefits to which the
member was entitled before the suspension.

reverse hiring order, until the desired level is achieved.
      (2)   If the Department is increased in number again, the Department
members who have been granted leaves of absence under this section shall be

Department. The reinstatements begin with the last member granted a leave.
      (3)   A Department member on leave of absence shall keep the Commission
advised of the Department member's current address. A Department member shall
be informed of the Department member's reinstatement by written notice. Within
ten calendar days after a Department member receives notice of reinstatement,
the Department member must advise the Commission that the Department member

member terminate upon the Department member's failure to accept reinstatement
within that period.

§ 35.03 IMPACT FEE FOR FINANCING PARK AND RECREATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE.
   (A)   Limitation on imposition of Impact Fee. This section shall expire and
become void five years after its effective date (November 19, 2021) as required
by I.C. 36-7-4-1340, unless action is undertaken to extend this section
consistent with Indiana law.
   (B)   Establishment of Impact Zone. There is hereby established one
Recreation Infrastructure Impact Zone (the "Impact Zone"), the boundaries of
which are co-terminus with the existing corporate boundaries of the town, as
such boundaries may be extended from time to time through annexation, and over
which boundaries the town exercises planning and zoning jurisdiction. In this
regard, the Town Council specifically finds that there is a functional
relationship between the components of the Recreation Zone Improvement Plan for
Parks and Recreation Facilities (the "Plan") and that the Plan provides a
reasonably uniform benefit to all citizens throughout the Impact Zone as of the
adoption of this section. The Town Council further finds that all areas within
the Impact Zone are contiguous as required by I.C. 36-7-4-1316. Except as
provided herein, this section shall apply uniformly to all residential
developments within the Impact Zone. This section shall not apply to:
      (1)   Development meeting the requirements set forth in I.C. 36-7-4-1322
(g);
      (2)   Improvements which do not require a building permit;
      (3)   Improvements which do not create a need for new and additional
infrastructure, including the erection of a sign, construction of accessory
buildings, structures or fences, or the alteration, renovation or expansion of
an improvement where the use, or intensity thereof, has not changed;
      (4)   The replacement of a destroyed or partially destroyed improvement
provided that the replacement improvement does not create a need for new and
additional infrastructure over and above the infrastructure needed by the
original improvement prior to the destruction or partial destruction thereof;
and
      (5)   Non-residential development.
   (C)   Zone Improvement Plan. As a precondition to the adoption of this
section, the Town Council undertook a comprehensive and detailed park and
recreational impact analysis through the employment for that purpose of Lehman
& Lehman, Inc. The Town Council now finds that the resulting study and data
base constitute a sufficient study to constitute a "Zone Improvement Plan" as
contemplated by I.C. 36-7-4-1318. The Town Council does hereby adopt the Plan
prepared by Lehman & Lehman, Inc., dated May 2021, as its Zone Improvement Plan
and specifically finds that the Zone Improvement Plan contains the following
elements:
      (1)   A description of the nature and location of existing infrastructure
in the Impact Zone;
      (2)   A reasonable determination of the current level of service provided
within the Impact Zone;
      (3)   A reasonable determination of the community level of service for
the Impact Zone;
      (4)   Reasonable estimates relating to the nature and location of
development that is expected to occur within the Impact Zone during the
following ten-year period;
      (5)   A reasonable estimate of the nature, location, costs, sequencing,
and timing of the park and recreational infrastructure necessary to provide the
community level of service for the developments contemplated in division (C)(4)
above;
      (6)   A general description of the sources and amounts of money used to
pay for infrastructure during the previous five years;
      (7)   Reasonable provisions for the completion of the infrastructure
necessary to raise the current level of service to the community level of
service within the following ten-year period;
      (8)   Reasonable provisions for the nature, location, and cost of
infrastructure that is necessary to raise the current level of service to the
community level of service;
      (9)   Reasonable provisions concerning the revenue sources and estimated
amounts of revenue that the town intends to use to raise the current level of
service to the community level of service for existing development;
      (10)   A reasonable estimate of the share of the park and recreational
costs identified in division (C)(5) above that will he used to raise the
current level of service for existing development or provide service to
existing development, or to provide service to new development; and
      (11)   A reasonable estimate of revenues that are from sources other than
impact fees and will be used to finance the cost of raising the current level
of service for existing development or providing service to existing
development.
      (12)   Additionally, Town Council is considering adopting the Zone
Improvement Plan as an official part of the Comprehensive Plan of the town,
pursuant to I.C. § 36-7-4-500 et seq.
   (D)   Establishment of Park and Recreation Impact Fees.
      (1)   Based on the Plan, it is determined that each dwelling unit
hereafter constructed in the town, not specifically excepted hereunder, shall
pay a recreational Impact Fee in the amount of $1,117. This fee will have a
growth rate of 3% annually, calculated on January 1 of the fiscal year. This
will be in affect until the expiration of this study.
      (2)   The Town Council hereby makes as part of the record of these
proceedings all the data collected, calculations made, and conclusions reached
by the town's consultant, Lehman & Lehman, Inc., in the process of developing
the Zone improvement Plan, and specifically instructs the employees of the town
to make such data available to the public for review during regular business
hours, along with any other information that is part of the public record
created as a result of the process involved in enacting this section.
      (3)   In the event any parcel of real estate subject to the Plan
undergoes a change in use from a use for which the Impact Fee does not pertain
to a dwelling unit, an Impact Fee will be assessed against said real estate.
      (4)   Any person or entity otherwise obligated to pay the fee established
by this section whose property was totally or partially destroyed by fire,
storm, or other casualty beyond his/her/its control, shall be exempt from said
fee if he/she/it repairs or replaces the destroyed structure without creating a
burden on infrastructure greater than the burden imposed by the destroyed
infrastructure. In the event of such additional burden, the fee shall be
calculated based only on the increased burden created by the structure.
   (E)   Credit in lieu of payment.
      (1)   A fee payer is entitled to a credit against an Impact Fee if the
owners or developer of the development constructs or provides infrastructure
that is an infrastructure type for which the town imposed an Impact Fee in the
Impact Zone or constructs or provides an improvement as defined by I.C. 36-7-4-
1335(a). Such infrastructure or improvement will be public property or
furnished or constructed under the requirements of the town (including but not
limited to the Plan) and available for use by other development in the area.
The amount of a credit will be determined at the date the Impact Fee is
assessed. If an assessment is not requested, the amount of the credit will be
determined at the time the structural building permit is issued. The amount of
the credit shall be determined by the person constructing or providing the
infrastructure or improvement and the Town Council. The amount of the credit
will be equal to the sum of the cost of constructing or providing the
infrastructure or improvement and the fair market value of land, real property
interests, and site improvements provided.
      (2)   The amount of the credit may be increased or decreased after the
date the Impact Fee is assessed if, between the date the Impact Fee is assessed
and the date the structural building permit is issued, there is a substantial
and material change in the cost or value of the infrastructure or improvement
that is constructed or furnished from the cost or value determined on the date
the Impact Fee is assessed. Provided however, at the time the amount of the
credit is determined on the date the impact fee is assessed, the person
providing the infrastructure or improvement and the Town Council may agree that
the amount of the credit may not be subsequently increased or decreased.
      (3)   The person providing the infrastructure or improvement may waive
the person's right to a credit against an Impact Fee by executing a written
waiver and filing such waiver with the Town Council.
      (4)   If the actual cost of constructing or providing the infrastructure
or improvement and the fair market value of land, real property interests, and
site improvements provided is less than the amount of the Impact Fee assessed,
the difference shall be due as otherwise provided. If the amount of the credit
exceeds the Impact Fee provided for by this section, no fee will be due to the
town and no refund will be due to the fee payer.
      (5)   If the parties cannot agree on the cost or fair market value used
in calculating the credit, the fee payer or the person constructing or
providing the infrastructure or improvement may file with the town's Impact
Review Board a petition for determination of the amount of the credit. This
petition must be filed not later than 30 days after the structural building
permit is issued for the development on which the Impact Fee is imposed.
Immediately after receiving a timely filed petition for determination of a
credit amount, the Review Board shall provide a copy of the petition to the
Town Council. Not later than 30 days after receiving a copy of the petition,
the Town Council shall provide to the Board a response on the form prescribed
by the Board. The Board shall immediately provide the petitioner a copy of the
Town Council's response. The Review Board shall review the petition and the
response and hold a public hearing to determine the amount of the credit not
later than 30 days after the response is provided to the Board. At the hearing,
each party may appear and present evidence in person, by agent, or by attorney.
A person may not communicate with a member of the Board before the hearing with
intent to influence the member's action regarding the appeal. The Board may
reverse, affirm, modify or otherwise establish the amount of the credit. Within
five days after making its decision, the Board shall provide to the petitioner
and the Town Council a copy of its written findings and decision. A fee payer
aggrieved by the Board's final determination of the amount of the credit may
appeal the determination to the Circuit or Superior Courts of Hendricks County.
This appeal shall be determined by a trial denovo.
      (6)   In addition, a fee payer or other person or entity responsible for
installing infrastructure or improvements may designate in writing a method of
allocating its credits to future fee payers who may be successors in interest
to the credits earned by the fee payer or others, as part of the certification
provided for above.
   (F)   Impact Fee due upon issuance of a building permit.
      (1)   The fee imposed pursuant to the terms of this section shall be due
and payable upon the issuance of a building permit by the town. It is
understood that the term BUILDING PERMIT is synonymous with the term STRUCTURAL
BUILDING PERMIT as that term is used in I.C. 36-7-4-1323, in that the issuance
of a building permit authorizes the applicant to commence construction
activities, structural or otherwise. The fee which is calculated pursuant to
the terms of this section, which is a per dwelling unit fee, shall be due at
said time unless the amount of the fee upon calculation is greater than $5,000
in which case an installment plan may be requested by the applicant in
accordance with the terms set forth in I.C. 36-7-4-1324.
      (2)   In an installment plan, a maximum of $5,000 or 5% of the Impact
Fee, whichever is greater, shall become due and payable on the date the
building permit is issued for the development on which the fee is imposed. The
first installment may not become due and payable less than one year after the
building permit is issued, and the last installment may not be due and payable
less than two years after the building permit is issued. When an Impact Fee is
paid through an installment plan, interest shall accrue at the rate of 5% per
annum on the portion of the Impact Fee that is outstanding and does not begin
to accrue until the date the structural building permit is issued for the
development or part of the development on which the Impact Fee is imposed. If
all or part of an Impact Fee is not paid when due and payable, the amount of
the installment shall be increased on the first day after the installment is
due and payable by a penalty equal to 10% of the installment amount that is
overdue. Interest, as identified above, shall also be charged on the penalty
amount.
      (3)   If a fee payer requests, the amount of the fee shall be assessed
upon the voluntary submission of a development plan and evidence that the
property is properly zoned for the proposed development or upon the issuance of
the building permit whichever is earlier. For purposes of this section,
ASSESSMENT means the act of calculating the amount of the fee which shall be
due. The town shall make such assessment within 30 days of the date of such
voluntary request or at the issuance of the building permit with or without the
request.
   (G)   Lien rights established. Pursuant to I.C. 36-7-4-1325, the town
acquires a lien against the real estate which is the subject of the fee on the
date a building permit is issued. Upon adoption, this section shall be
recorded, and thereafter, it shall constitute constructive notice of the lien
rights of the town with respect to a parcel of real estate which is the subject
of an installment payment of the fee. The town may, in its discretion, file a
specific instrument setting forth its lien rights with respect to a parcel of
real estate which is the subject of an installment payment of the fee, and such
instrument shall constitute actual notice in addition to the constructive
notice provided for by the recording of this section.
   (H)   Form of receipt. The Clerk- Treasurer shall issue a receipt for all
fees collected, in substantially the following form.
      Received of (fee payer) this           day of                         the
sum of $  in (full) (partial) satisfaction of Recreational Impact Fees due
pursuant to the Town of Danville Ordinance No. 14-2021, relating to
improvements to be constructed on the real estate located at
                                                                 and described
on Exhibit A attached hereto and made part hereof and subject to lien rights in
favor of the Town of Danville in the event of partial payment with payments
remaining due. The remaining balance due (if any) is in the following amount: $
.
 
                                 
         Danville Clerk-Treasurer
   (I)   Impact Fee Review Board. In Ord. No. 22-2016, the Town Council
established, pursuant to I.C. 36-7-4-1338, a Danville Impact Fee Review Board.
Such Impact Fee Review Board shall continue in existence in accordance with the
terms of Ord. No. 22-2016, I.C. 36-7-4-1338, and all other applicable
provisions of the Impact Fee Statute.
   (J)   Appeal of fee assessment.
      (1)   Any fee payer who believes itself to be aggrieved by the
calculation of the fee may appeal the fee assessment to the Impact Fee Review
Board, and the Review Board shall conduct a hearing with regard thereto. At
such hearing, the fee payer shall bear the burden of going forward with the
evidence and shall present evidence in person, by agent, or by attorney
addressing either of the following propositions:
         (a)   A fact assumption used in determining the amount of the fee is
incorrect; or
         (b)   The amount of the fee is greater than the amount allowed under
I.C. 36-7-4-1320, 1321 and 1322.
      (2)   Upon conclusion of the hearing at which the matter is first
presented, or at the conclusion of the hearing if the matter is continued, the
Impact Fee Review Board shall determine the appropriate amount of the fee based
upon the facts presented and may reverse, affirm, modify, or make such
adjustments in the fee, as it believes are appropriate under the circumstances,
if any, including establishing the amount of an Impact Fee, a credit, a refund,
or any combination of fees, credit, or refunds.
      (3)   The Impact Fee Review Board shall make written findings of fact
supporting its decision and shall provide a copy of its decision to the Town
Council and the fee payer involved in the appeal within five days after making
its decision.
      (4)   An appeal under this division must be filed no later than 30 days
after the issuance of the building permit. The appeal shall be initiated with
the filing of a petition for review with the Clerk-Treasurer together with a
filing fee in the amount of $100. The filing fee shall be refunded in full if:
         (a)   The petition for review is granted and the fee is eliminated,
reduced or adjusted by the Impact Fee Review Board, by independent action of
the town, or by a court having jurisdiction; and
         (b)   The reviewing body determines that the amount of the fee,
reductions, or credits were arbitrary or capricious.
      (5)   The petition for review shall be in a form calculated to inform the
Impact Fee Review Board of the nature of complaint, the parties to the action,
and the relief requested. In addition, the petition shall describe the new
development on which the fee has been assessed, all facts related to the
assessment of the fee, and the reasons the petitioner believes that the amount
of the fee assessed is erroneous or is greater than the amount allowed by the
fee limitation set forth in this section and the enabling statute.
      (6)   A fee payer aggrieved by a final determination of the Review Board
regarding the assessment of an Impact Fee may appeal the Board's determination
to the Circuit or Superior Courts of Hendricks County and is entitled to a
trial de novo. If the assessment of the fee is vacated by the Court, the
assessment of the Impact Fee shall be corrected by the Board.
      (7)   If a petition for review or an appeal of an Impact Fee assessment
is pending, the Impact Fee is not due and payable until after the petition or
appeal is finally adjudicated and the amount of the fee is determined. The town
shall not deny the issuance of a building permit on the basis that the fee has
not been paid or condition issuance of the permit on the payment of the fee
unless the fee totals $1,000 or less. If the fee is $1,000 or less, the town
may require the fee payer to pay the Fee or initiate an appeal before the
building permit is issued.
   (K)   Refunds.
      (1)   A fee payer is entitled to a refund of an Impact Fee if the
conditions provided for in I.C. 36-7-4-1332(a) exist. An application for a
refund must be filed with the Clerk-Treasurer not later than two years after
the right to a refund accrues. The town shall issue a refund in part or in full
or shall reject the application not later than 30 days after receiving an
application for a refund. If the town approves a refund in whole or in part,
the town shall pay the amount approved, plus interest from the date on which
the Impact Fee was paid to the date the refund is issued. The interest rate for
refunds shall be 5% per year. The Town Manager is responsible for accepting,
rejecting, and paying a refund and interest. The town shall issue a refund in
part or in full or reject the application for refund not later than 30 days
after receiving an application for a refund.
      (2)   If the town rejects the application for a refund or approves a
partial refund, the fee payer may appeal that rejection to the Review Board not
later than 60 days after the rejection or partial approval. The appeal shall be
on a form prescribed by the Board. Upon receipt of an application for appeal,
the Review Board shall immediately provide to the Town Council notice of the
appeal. The Review Board shall hold a hearing on all appeals for a refund. This
hearing shall be held not later than 45 days after the application for appeal
is filed with the Board. After the hearing, the Review Board shall determine
the amount of refund that shall be made to the fee payer from the account
established herein. A refund ordered by the Board must include interest from
the date the Impact Fee was paid to the date the refund is issued, at the rate
of 5% per annum. A party aggrieved by a final decision of the Review Board
regarding a refund may appeal the decision to the Circuit or Superior Courts of
Hendricks County and is entitled to a trial denovo.
   (L)   Park and Recreation Infrastructure Improvement Fund.
      (1)   Ord. No. 22-2016 created the Danville Park and Recreation
Infrastructure Improvement Fund (“Fund”) of the town. The Fund shall continue
in existence in accordance with the terms of Ord. No. 22-2016 and the Impact
Fee Statute.
      (2)   Pursuant to I.C. 36-7-4-1332, the Clerk-Treasurer is designated as
the town official responsible for acting on refund requests. In order to
facilitate refunds when they may be due, the Clerk-Treasurer is directed to
identify the purpose of any fee paid in order that a refund, if any, may be
paid from the Fund or account into which the fee was originally deposited.
   (M)   Use of Impact Fees collected pursuant to this section. Any and all
fees collected pursuant to the provisions of this section may be utilized only
for the following purposes by the town, acting by and through its Town Council,
which for the purposes of this section is identified as the infrastructure
agency contemplated by I.C. 36-7-4-1317:
      (1)   Providing funds to be utilized by the town for the purpose of
paying the capital costs of new park and recreational infrastructure that is
needed to serve the new development within the corporate limits of the town as
the same may be amended from time to time and any area over which the town may
exercise any of its authority;
      (2)   An amount not to exceed 5% of the annual collections of the fee to
be utilized for expenses incurred by the town for the consulting services used
to establish this section;
      (3)   To pay any refund due pursuant to the terms of this section; and
      (4)   To pay the debt service cost of an obligation issued to provide new
park and recreational infrastructure described in division (M)(1) above.
   (N)   Indiana Impact Fee Law. The Town Council specifically acknowledges the
existence of I.C. 36-7-4-1300 et seq. (“the 1300 Series - Impact Fees”) which
regulates the imposition of impact fees by municipal corporations within the
State of Indiana. The substantive and procedural requirements of I.C. 36-7-4-
1300 et seq. shall control in the events of conflicts with this section which
are unintended by the Council.
   (O)   Amendment and review. The fee provided for herein is based upon data
which, in large part, is subject to inflation and other economic and market
forces over which the town has no control. The Council may cause a review to be
made by town staff or consultants as may be required to determine the
continuing validity of the Impact Fee, the Impact Zone, and the Plan. The
Council shall consider and adopt such amendments as are necessary to cause a
substantive compliance with all constitutional and statutory requirements. To
the extent required by the facts and circumstances, this process shall include
the steps necessary to update the Plan and the Comprehensive Plan.

§ 50.083 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   (1)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR 261. The notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set
forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number and the type of discharge
(continuous, batch or other).
      (2)   If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of the waste per
calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following
information to the extent the information is known and readily available to the
user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes,
an estimation of the mass and concentration of constituents in the waste stream
discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following
12 months.
      (3)   All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the
discharge commences. Any notification under this division (A) need be submitted
only once for each hazardous waste discharged.
      (4)   However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted
under §
50.079. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
50.075,
50.077 and 50.088.
   (B)   (1)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A)
above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes, as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes, as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a one-time notification.
      (2)   Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than these
quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA, being 42 USC
6921, identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Town
Manager, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director and IDEM of
the discharge of the substance within 90 days of the effective date of the
regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

§ 50.085 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (A)   Except as indicated in division (B) below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In
the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the Town Manager may
authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of three grab
samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative
sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease (O&G), temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.

§ 50.087 RECORD KEEPING.
   (A)   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall
retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of requirements.
Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling, and
the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were
performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods
used; and the results of the analyses.
   (B)   (1)   These records shall remain available for a period of at least
three years.
      (2)   This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any
litigation concerning the user or the town, or where the user has been
specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Town Manager.

§ 52.04 SEWAGE BILL ALLOWANCES.
   (A)   The quantity of water discharged into the sewage system and obtained
from sources other than the utility that serves the town shall be determined by
the town in such manner as the town shall reasonably elect, and the sewage
service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates; except, as is
hereinafter provided in this section, the town may make proper allowances in
determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be
consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the town that such
quantities do not enter the sewage system.
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the town’s
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied
by the water utility serving the town and the water used thereon or therein is
not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not acceptable
to the town then the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or
determined by the town. In order to ascertain the rate or charge provided in
this chapter, the owner or other interested party shall at his or her expense,
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the town for the
determining of sewage discharge.
   (C)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or their liquids into the town’s
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water supplied by
the water utility serving the town, and in addition, is a user of water from
another resource which is not measured by a water meter or is measured by a
meter not acceptable to the town, then the amount of water used shall be
otherwise measured or determined by the town. In order to ascertain the rates
or charges, the owner or other interested parties shall, at his or her expense,
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the town for the
determination of sewage discharge.
   (D)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the town’s
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and the
quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each such case,
for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for each
user and the base charge and the flow rates and charges shall apply to each of
the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate or buildings served
through the single water meter.
   (E)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the town’s
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess of
10,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the town
that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not and
cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other interested
party shall, at his or her expense, install and maintain meters, weirs,
volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the town for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (F)   Where a metered water supply is used for fire protection as well as
for other uses not entering the sewer system, the town may, in its discretion,
make adjustments in the user charge as may be equitable.
(Ord. 16-1986, passed 11-3-86)
§ 52.05 CHARGES BASED ON STRENGTH AND CHARACTER.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered to users, the town shall base its charges not
only on the volume, but also on strength and character of the stronger-than-
normal domestic sewage and shall require the user to determine the strength and
content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly into
the sewage system, in such manner and by such method as the town may deem
practicable in the light of the conditions and attending circumstances of the
case, in order to determine the proper charge. The user shall furnish a
sampling point, as defined in the Sewer Use Ordinance, available to the town at
all times.
   (B)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a biochemical
oxygen demand of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid or suspended solids in
excess of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid. Additional charges for treating
stronger-than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis:
      (1)   Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids. There shall be an
additional charge of $.22 per pound of suspended solids for suspended solids
received in excess of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid.
      (2)   Rate surcharge based upon BOD. There shall be an additional charge
of $.15 per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for BOD received in excess of
250 milligrams per liter of fluid.
      (3)   Rate surcharge based upon ammonia. There shall be an additional
charge of $.68 per pound of ammonia for ammonia received in excess of 45
milligrams per liter of fluid.
   (C)   The determination of suspended solids and five-day Biochemical Oxygen
Demand contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the current addition
of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage and Industrial Wastes,
as written by the American Public Health Association, the American Water Works
Association and the Water Pollution Control Federation.

monthly. At the end of each year, each user shall be given a notice of the
rates charged and the basis for the charges for operation, maintenance and
replacement.
   (C)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying
the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but
such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in the event
payment is not made as herein required. The owners of properties served, which
are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to examine the
collection records of the town for the purpose of determining whether bills
have been paid by such tenant or tenants, provided that such examination shall
be made at the office at which the records are kept and during the hours that
such office is open for business.
   (D)   As in provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when due are
hereby declared to be delinquent and a penalty of 10% of the amount of the
rates or charges shall thereupon attach thereto. The time at which such rates
or charges shall be paid is now fixed at 15 days after the date of mailing of
the bill.
(Ord. 16-1986, passed 11-3-86)
§ 52.07 OPERATIONAL STUDIES.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain
proportional to the cost of providing services to the various uses of user
classes and that the charges may remain sufficient to adequately fund the
necessary replacement costs and other revenue and reserve requirements, the
town shall cause a study to be made annually for the first five years of
operation, following the date on which this chapter goes into effect. Such
study shall include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the costs associated
with the treatment of excessive strength effluents from industrial users,
volume and delivery flow rate characteristics attributed to the various users
or user classes, the financial position of the sewage works and the adequacy of
its revenue to provide adequate funds, for the operation and maintenance,
replacements, debt service requirements and capital improvements to the waste
treatment systems. Thereafter, on a biennial basis, within a reasonable period
of time following the normal accounting period, the town shall cause a study to
be made for the purpose of (a) reviewing the sufficiency of the revenues to
properly operate the wastewater treatment facility and all appurtenances
attached thereto; and (b) maintaining proportionality among the user classes of
the rates and charges for sewage services.
   (B)   The studies shall be conducted by officers or employees of the town,
or by a firm of certified public accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers
which firms shall have experience in such studies, or by such combination of
officers, employees, certified public accountants or engineers as the town
shall determine to be best under the circumstances.

town’s sewage system, pumping stations and sewage treatment works, for the
construction and use of house sewers and connections to the sewage treatment
works, for the construction and use of house sewers and connection to the
sewerage system, and for the regulation, collection, rebating and refunding of
such rates and charges. No free service shall be provided to any user of the
waste water treatment facility.
   (B)   The town is hereby authorized to prohibit dumping of wastes into the
town’s sewage system which, in its discretion, are deemed harmful to the

§ 53.13 STORMWATER UTILITY USER FEE.
   (A)   There is hereby established a monthly stormwater utility fee for the
use of and services provided by the Stormwater Utility of the town. The
stormwater utility fee shall be charged either the owner or tenant of each
property in the town with impervious surface area depending on which is being
billed by the town for water or sanitary sewer service (i.e., the responsible
person or entity shall be the same). In addition to a fixed fee, each bill
shall include a variable fee based on the town’s determination of the
Equivalent Residential Units (“ERUs”) for the property. An ERU equals 3,700
square feet of impervious surface area. One ERU shall be attributed to each and
every property with impervious surface area and a charge will be imposed for
that ERU. Each non-residential property with greater than 3,700 square feet of
impervious surface area shall be charged for one ERU plus additional ERUs in
increments of one- tenth of an ERU for every 370 square feet of impervious
surface area beyond 3,700 square feet. Government, not-for-profit and tax-
exempt organizations shall not be exempt from this fee.
   (B)   The monthly user fee shall consist of two charges: a fixed fee that is
the same for all properties with an impervious surface area and a variable fee
that is multiplied by the number of ERUs attributed to a property. The monthly
charge for each property shall be the sum of the variable fee times the number
of ERUs attributed to the property plus the fixed fee. The fees shall be as
follows:
 
Fixed monthly fee - all users  $4.50
Variable monthly fee - per ERU $3.50

arrival of the owner’s or operator’s chosen wrecker, or if the owner or
operator does not care to select a wrecker of his or her own choice, the police
officer may declare the vehicle a traffic hazard, and it shall become subject
to the police officer’s order to the contractor or other authorized wrecker to
remove it from the scene. However, the vehicle shall not be subject to
impoundment, but shall be towed to the destination selected by the owner or
operator. If the owner or operator is under a disability by reason of injury or
arrest, the vehicle shall be subject to impoundment upon order of the police
officer on the scene.
   (B)   Vehicles recovered as stolen or which come into the custody of the
Danville Police Department for other reasons shall be subject to impoundment
upon order of the police officer having control of the vehicle.
   (C)   All other vehicles subject to removal under this subchapter, including
those in violation of parking ordinances, may be towed by the on-call wrecker,
upon notification and order by an police officer, and may be impounded and
stored pursuant to the provisions of §
71.23.

and employees, from any loss, claim, judgment or damages arising from the
removal and storage of vehicles pursuant to this subchapter. The wrecker shall

charges authorized herein but shall be returned by him or her or his or her
agents to the owner thereof upon sufficient identification and proof of
ownership. The police officer directing the removal of a vehicle shall cause an

such notice at the scene of the tow;

violation of law; and

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 and I.C. 14-23-4 granted the
power to local government units to control land use within their jurisdictions.
Therefore, the Town Council of the Town of Danville does hereby adopt the
following floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 1-1993, passed 1-18-93; Am. Ord. 15-2009, passed 8-17-09)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the Town of Danville are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 15-2009, passed 8-17-09)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
   (F)   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and
their contents in the Town of Danville by fulfilling the requirements of the
National Flood Insurance Program.
(Ord. 1-1993, passed 1-18-93; Am. Ord. 15-2009, passed 8-17-09)
§ 151.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are;
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains;
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas; and
   (G)   To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a
flood area.
(Ord. 1-1993, passed 1-18-93; Am. Ord. 15-2009, passed 8-17-09)
§ 151.05 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A ZONES,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM or FHBM. The definitions are
presented below:
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply.
      (2)   ZONE AE and A1-A30. Areas subject, to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements
apply. (ZONE AE is on new and revised maps in place of ZONES A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance
purchase requirements apply.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are one to three feet.
Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within
this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.
      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection. Mandatory food insurance
purchase requirements apply.
      (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements
apply.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure that is located on
the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay
sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community’s
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
Basement means that portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular
program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.

carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management, it is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.

   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT FACILITY. A facility which cannot be used for its
intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to
water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and
unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood
processing facilities. The term does not include long-term storage,
manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   HARDSHIP. As related to variances of this chapter, means the exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional unusual, and
peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is
not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment to the currently effective FEMA
map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA. A LOMA is only
issued by FEMA.
   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the currently
effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations,
and elevations.
   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision by
letter to an effective NFlP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA’s determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.,
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.

      (1)   The top of the lowest level of the structure;
      (2)   The top of the basement floor;
      (3)   The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of
the structure;

the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred “substantial
damage” or repetitive loss regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any
alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structures continued designation as a “historic structure.”

specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in VIOLATION until such time as that
documentation is provided.

   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
SHADED X ZONES shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). UNSHADED X ZONES (C zones on older FiRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FHBM or FIRM that reflects the severity
or type of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. See definition for A ZONE.
   ZONE B, C, AND X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(ZONE X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)

Danville.
(Ord. 15-2009, passed 8-17-09)
§ 151.07 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING REGULATORY FLOOD DATA.
   This chapter’s protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best
available regulatory flood data is listed below. Whenever a party disagrees
with the best available data, the party submitting the detailed engineering
study needs to replace existing data with better data and submit it to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and approval.
   (A)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs of the Town of Danville shall be as delineated on the 100-year
flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Hendricks County and
Incorporated Areas and the corresponding FIRM prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and dated September 25, 2009.
   (B)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each
of the unstudied SFHAs of the Town of Danville delineated as an “A Zone” on the
FIRM of Hendricks County and Incorporated Areas shall be according to the best
data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.

§ 151.08 ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   A floodplain development permit shall be required in conformance with the
provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development
activities in areas of special flood hazard.

151.99
§ 151.09 COMPLIANCE.
   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally
altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. No land or stream within the SFHA shall
hereafter be altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and
other applicable regulations.

§ 151.10 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another ordinance conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail.

§ 151.11 DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND ELEVATIONS.
   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles shall govern.
   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
   (C)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the
base flood elevation, that site shall be considered outside the SFHA and the
floodplain regulations will not be applied. The property owner should be
advised to apply for a LOMA.

§ 151.12 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall
be:
   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
(Ord. 15-2009, passed 8-17-09)
§ 151.13 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this chapter does not create any
liability on the part of the Town of Danville, the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that, results
from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully
thereunder.

§ 151.14 INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).
   In order for buildings to qualify for a claim payment under ICC coverage as
a “repetitive loss structure,” the National Reform Act of 1994 requires that
the building be covered by a contract for flood insurance and incur flood-
related damages on two occasions during a ten-year period ending on the date of
the event for which the second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing
the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of the market value
of the building at the time of each such flood event.

before compacting to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with the Standard
Proctor Test method.
      (2)   The fill should extend at least ten feet beyond the foundation of
the structure before sloping below the FPG.
      (3)   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during
flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulkheading. If vegetative cover is
used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
      (4)   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties.
      (5)   The top of the lowest floor including basements shall be at or
above the FPG.
   (F)   Standards for structures constructed with a crawlspace. A residential
or nonresidential structure may be constructed with a crawlspace located below
the flood protection grade provided that the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; and
      (2)   Any enclosed area below the flood protection grade shall have
openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the automatic
entry and exit of floodwaters. Provide a minimum of two openings having a total
net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed
area. The bottom of the openings shall be no more than one foot above grade;
and
      (3)   The interior height of the crawlspace measured from the interior
grade of the crawlspace to the top of the foundation wall must not exceed four
feet at any point; and
      (4)   Utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated above the
flood protection grade.
      (5)   An adequate drainage system must be installed to remove floodwaters
from the interior area of the crawlspace within a reasonable period of time
after a flood event; and
      (6)   Portions of the building below the flood protection grade must be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.
      (7)   The interior grade of the crawlspace must be at or above the base
flood elevation.
   (G)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially
improved on a site for more than 180 days must meet one of the following
requirements:
      (1)   The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent foundation
such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and securely anchored
to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement. This requirement applies to all manufactured homes to be

151.99
§ 151.42 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
   (A)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to

§ 151.43 CRITICAL FACILITY.
   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities
shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and
sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be
displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above
the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. 15-2009, passed 8-17-09) Penalty, see § 151.99
§ 151.44 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
151.07, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing,
paving, and the like, undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of non-substantial additions/ improvements to residences in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in a
floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if
fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval
(construction in a floodway permit) for the fill is required from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit (when applicable) has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources granting approval for construction in a floodway. Once a permit for
construction in a floodway has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain
development permit, provided the provisions contained in this subchapter have
been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than the
permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any)
shall take precedence;
   (C)   No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, will increase the regulatory flood more
than 0.14 of one foot; and
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data.

151.99
§ 151.45 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in this subchapter have been met. The key provision is
that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure
shall be at or above the FPG.

§ 151.46 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway or a floodplain analysis/
regulatory assessment citing the 100-year flood elevation and the recommended
flood protection grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment
approving the proposed development, a floodplain development permit may be
issued provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this subchapter have been
met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodway, fringe and 100-year flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this
subchapter have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with ail other existing and anticipated development, wiil not increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and will not increase flood damages
or potential flood damages.

or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
   (B)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §
151.44 or
151.46(A) may be granted.
   (C)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §
151.44 or
151.46(A) will require a permit from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
   (D)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §
151.41 may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
   (E)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (F)   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of any
structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
   (G)   Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation. (See §
151.44.)
