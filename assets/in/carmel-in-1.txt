A BRIEF HISTORY
OF
CARMEL, INDIANA
In 1822 pioneer families moved into the area.
In 1823 Hamilton County was established, and in 1832 the first settlement was
in Home Place.
In 1833 the first community school and in 1835 the first community store were
established.
On April 13, 1837, John Felps (Phelps), Alexander Mills, Seth Green, and Daniel
Warren, laid out the Town of Bethlehem. The plat contained a total of fourteen
lots. The area, previously inhabited by Delaware (Miami) Indians, soon became
inhabited by Quakers.
As a wilderness it was known for its fur trading. The first General Store was
constructed in 1837. In 1845, a framed school house building was constructed
near the Town's crossroads. In 1846, a Post Office was established. At this
time, the town residents were notified that the United States Post Office
already had another Indiana town registered by the name of Bethlehem.
Consequently, in 1874, by a referendum vote of 33 in favor and 12 against, the
town was officially incorporated and adopted the name “Carmel”, population 250.
In 1874, Carmel was incorporated as a Town.
In 1882, rails of the Monon Railroad were laid through Carmel, and a depot was
opened. The railroad depot remained open until 1974. The Carmel-Clay Historical
Society was in charge of the restoration of the original depot.
The first Carmel high school was built in 1887.
In 1889 "The Carmel Signal" was the first town newspaper.
A shoot-out in 1890 at the Jeffries Livery Barn took the life of Officer
William Frank Carey. Officer Carey is the only law enforcement officer killed
in the line of duty.
The Citizens State Bank opened in 1901 on the northwest corner of Main Street
and Range Line Road.
In 1903 the interurban railway connected Carmel to Indianapolis and electricity
was installed throughout Carmel in 1904.
In 1914 the first Carmel Public Library was dedicated. It was built with a
grant from the Carnegie Corporation for a total of $11,000.00. It was used
until 1972 when it was purchased by the Town of Carmel for use as city offices
and later as a Courthouse. A state of the art facility was opened in 1999.
The Carmel Volunteer Fire Department purchased its first fire truck in 1921.
In 1923 Leslie Haines invented one of the country's first automatic stop-and-go
traffic signals. It was located at the intersection of Main Street and Range
Line Road.
In 1930 a water system was installed, and in 1933 a gas pipeline was installed.
In 1937 a Centennial Celebration took place in Carmel (population 632).
In 1949 the Carmel Theatre opened. Ticket prices were 40 cents for adults and
20 cents for children. Candy bars were sold for a nickel each. The theatre was
closed and razed by the City in 1984. In 1985, the “Downtown Park” was
dedicated on the original site of the Carmel Theatre.
In 1958 a new high school was built on East Main Street, for a total cost of
$1,600,000.00. Additions to the high school were added in 1963, 1969, 1977 and
1998. In 2006 the Freshman Center was added to the high school complex. The
Carmel Elementary School was opened in 1961 and in 1964 the Carmel Junior High
School was opened.
In 1962 Carmel celebrated its 125th Anniversary.
In 1965 Keystone Avenue (Route 431) was opened. That same year the areas of
Woodland Springs, Cool Creek, and Keystone Square were annexed to Carmel which
doubled the population.
The Carmel Court was established in 1971. The Plan Commission was also expanded
to include fourteen members from Clay Township and seven members from the City
of Carmel.
In November of 1974, a referendum took place as to whether Carmel should become
a Fourth Class City. The residents voted in the affirmative.
In 1975 the first City primary election was held and in 1976 Carmel became a
city (population 13,500).
In December 1976, the Carmel Symphony Orchestra presented its first concert.
The Science and Technology Park opened at Meridian and 116th Streets in 1985.
That same year, St. Vincent Carmel Hospital opened on North Meridian.
In 1986, the ground breaking took place for the Carmel Civic Square with city
offices being relocated soon thereafter.
April 13, 1987 marked the 150th anniversary of the founding of Carmel.
The following is an illustration of the continuous growth in the City of

§ 2-13 Capital Asset Policy.
   (a)   Definition of Capital Assets.
      (1)   Capital Assets are assets that are used in operations and have an
initial useful life in excess of one year. The term includes both tangible
assets (land, construction in progress, buildings, building improvements,
vehicles, machinery, equipment, works of art, historical treasures,
infrastructure) and intangible assets (easements, software, water rights).
Assets acquired for the purpose of sale or investment do not qualify as capital
assets, regardless of their form, because they are not used in operations.
      (2)   The City has a minimum capitalization threshold of $5,000. The
capitalization threshold is applied to individual items in a group of items,
rather than to the group as a whole, unless the effect of doing so would be to
eliminate a significant portion of total capital assets. Assets that are not
capitalized (items less than $5,000 and greater than $1,000) are expensed in
the year of acquisition. An inventory is kept of all assets greater than
$1,000.
   (b)   Major Capital Asset Classes and. In order to ensure that governmental
entities have an accurate, complete, and current record of capital assets, it
is important that asset categories are appropriately determined. This section
further clarifies the asset definition by major category.
      (1)   Land. Land is defined as specified land, lots, parcels or acreage
including rights of way owned by the City of Carmel, its various departments,
boards or commissions, regardless of the method or date of acquisition.
Easements are not included, as the City does not own them, but as an interest
in land owned by another (i.e. property owner) that entitles its holder to a
specified limited use. The City Utility, however, does capitalize easements.
      (2)   Buildings.
         a)   Buildings are defined as permanent (non-moveable) structures. Any
structures designed and erected to house equipment services or functions are
included. This includes systems, services, and fixtures within the buildings,
as well as attachments such as porches, stairs, fire escapes, canopies,
areaways, lighting fixtures, flagpoles, sound equipment, security cameras,
lifts and riggings, curtains and staging and all other such units that serve
the building.
         b)   Plumbing systems, lighting systems, sound systems, surveillance
systems, passenger and freight elevators, escalators, built-in casework, walk-
in coolers and freezers, fixed shelving and other fixed equipment are included
as part of the building if it is owned. Communications antennas and/or towers
are not included because they are treated as part of the equipment unit.
      (3)   Improvements Other Than Buildings. Improvements other than
buildings have a limited useful life. Examples of the Civil City assets in this
category are parking areas, drives, fencing, pools, fountains, underground
sprinkler systems, decorative street lighting and other similar items. Examples
of the City Utilities assets are water supply mains, collection sewers, wells,
fences, intake pipes, manholes, and fire hydrants.
      (4)   Furnishings and Equipment. The furnishings and equipment asset
class is used to account for moveable items. Included within this category are
office equipment, office furniture, appliances, furnishings, machinery items,
maintenance equipment, communication equipment, police, fire, laboratory
equipment, vehicles, road equipment, aircraft, emergency equipment, earth
moving equipment, text equipment, civil defense equipment, law enforcement
equipment, and data processing equipment. Supplies are excluded.
      (5)   Infrastructure. Infrastructure assets are long-lived capital assets
that normally are stationary in nature and can be preserved for a significantly
greater number of years than most capital assets and that are normally
stationary in nature. Examples include roads, streetlights, traffic signals,
drainage systems, and water lines. Infrastructure assets do not include
buildings, drives, parking lots or any other examples given above that are
incidental to property or access to the property described above.
      (6)   Construction in Progress. Construction, or development, in progress
is a special class of capital assets that are still in the process of
construction (tangible) or development (intangible). Depreciation does not
begin until the capital assets are substantially ready to be placed in service.
      (7)   Other Capital Assets. This is a separate category for capital
assets that do not fit into any of the major asset classes listed above.
   (c)   Threshold Levels for Capital Assets. The following schedule will be
used for capitalization and depreciation of the City's capital assets. Amounts
are based on governmental entities with revenues exceeding $100 million.
Capitalize/Depreciate
Capitalize/Depreciate
Land                     Capitalize only
Land Improvements        $50,000
Buildings                $100,000
Building Improvements    $100,000
Construction in Progress Capitalize only
Machinery and Equipment  $5,000
Vehicles                 $5,000
City Utility Assets      $5,000
Computer Software        $5,000
Infrastructure           $3,000,000
 
   (d)   Valuation of Capital Assets.
      (1)   Capital assets should be recorded at historical cost and should
include the cost of freight, site preparation, architect and engineering fees
and other costs as applicable. If a method other than cash is used to pay for
the asset, then the fair-market value of the non-cash payment or consideration
determines the asset's cost or acquisition value. When the value of the
consideration paid cannot be determined, the asset's fair market value
determines its cost.
      (2)   With a few exceptions, an asset's cost should also include
necessary costs incurred to place the asset in service. Costs include the
invoice price plus incidental costs (insurance during transit, freight,
capitalized interest, duties, title search, registration fees and installation
costs). Exceptions to the rule include interest expenses associated with
deferred payments and real estate taxes paid, if any, in the acquisition of
property.
   (e)   Depreciation Method and Salvage Value.
      (1)   Depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of tangible
property over a period of time, rather than deducting the cost as an expense in
the year of acquisition. Generally, at the end of the asset's life, the sum of
the amounts charged for depreciation in each accounting period (accumulated
depreciation) will equal original cost less salvage value. The City depreciates
its capital assets by using the Straight-line Method. Under this method, the
basis of the asset is written off evenly over the useful life of the asset. The
same amount of the depreciation is taken each year. Depreciation is calculated
at the end of each fiscal year.
      (2)   The salvage value of an asset is the value it is expected to have
when it is no longer useful for its intended purpose. In other words, the
salvage value is the amount for which the asset could be sold at the end of its
useful life. The City determines salvage value on an asset-by-asset basis.
   (f)   Estimated Useful Lives of City Assets. The following assets accounted
for under the Capital Asset Policy will be depreciated using the straight-line
method of depreciation. A gain or loss on disposal will be reported. The most
common useful lives are as follows:

            Subsystems: Traffic Signals -35 years.
            Street lights - 25 years.
         c)   Drainage Systems Network - 50 years.
   (g)   Capital Leases.
      (1)   Leased equipment should be capitalized if the lease agreement meets

the end of the lease term.
         b)   The lease contains a bargain purchase option.
         c)   The lease term is equal to 75% of the estimated economic life of
the leased property (and the lease is non-cancellable during that time).
         d)   The present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception
of the lease (excluding executory costs) equals at least 90% of the fair-value
of the leased property.
      (2)   Leases that do not meet any of the above criteria are considered
operating leases.
   (h)   Assets not Capitalized.
      (1)   Assets less than $5,000 are expensed in the year of acquisition.
Assets greater than $1,000 are recorded in the General Ledger.
      (2)   Exceptions are:
         a)   Items costing less than the above limits which are permanently
installed as a part of the cost of original construction or installation of a
larger building or equipment unit will be included in the cost of the larger
unit;
         b)   Modular equipment added subsequent to original equipment
construction of a larger building or equipment unit which may be put together
to form larger units costing more than the prescribed limits will be charged to
capital assets even though the cost of individual items is less than such
units; and
         c)   Cabinets, shelving, bookcases, and similar items, added
subsequent to original construction, which are custom made for a specific place
and adaptable elsewhere, will be capitalized.
   (i)   Capital Assets Purchased with Grant Funds. When Federal Grant Funds
are used to purchase capital assets, compliance with the applicable Subparts of
Part 200 - Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit
Requirements for Federal Awards in the Code of Federal Regulations is required.
All grant types typically have requirements specified in the Grant Award Letter
with which the City must comply.
   (j)   Asset Acquisition, Transfer and Disposal. City assets may be acquired

time off departmental employees are allowed to accrue. In no instance except an
emergency, however, may an employee accrue more than 100 hours of compensatory
time off.

department head, subject to the availability of funds.

weekly salary.
         d)   The total hours worked in a regular work period shall include all
paid vacation days, paid sick leave, paid holidays, compensatory time off and
other paid absences for the purpose of calculating overtime pay.

holiday, compensatory time off, etc.) may be combined in one shift, in no case
shall an employee be paid for more than his regularly scheduled shift unless
the employee has actually worked longer than his scheduled shift with the

         d)   The total hours worked in a regular work period shall include all
paid vacation days, paid sick days, paid holidays, compensatory time off and
other paid absences for the purpose of calculating overtime pay.
         e)   Although various types of pay (time worked, vacation, sick leave,
holiday, compensatory time off, etc.) may be combined in one shift, in no case
shall an employee be paid for more than his regularly scheduled shift unless
the employee has actually worked longer than his scheduled shift with the
approval of his supervisor, or such payment is for time the employee works
before and/or after his scheduled shift.
      (6)   Exempt employees; compensatory time.
         a)   Exempt employees are expected to work the hours necessary to
fulfill their responsibilities, and are not entitled to overtime pay.

hours if the pay is being reimbursed by another federal, state or local
government agency.
      (7)   Salaries and pay deductions for exempt employees.
         a)   The FLSA requires that all exempt employees be paid on a salary
basis as defined by the Department of Labor in 19 CFR 541.602 and 19 CFR
541.710, which strictly limit deductions from pay. It is the City’s policy to
comply at all times with the salary basis requirements of the FLSA. Therefore,
the City of Carmel, its employees and agents are prohibited from making
improper deductions from the salaries of exempt employees.
         b)   An exempt employee who believe that an improper deduction has
been made to his salary shall immediately report this information to his direct
supervisor or the Director of Human Resources.
         c)   All reports of improper deductions will be promptly investigated.
If it is determined that an improper deduction has occurred, the employee shall
be promptly reimbursed for the full amount of such improper deduction and the
City will take whatever action it deems necessary to ensure future compliance
with the salary basis test.

§ 2-41 Longevity. 
   (a)   Subject to the conditions listed in subsections (b) through (d) below,
each full-time employee of the City shall receive longevity pay as stipulated
in the annual salary ordinance.
   (b)   An eligible employee must begin full-time employment on or before June

returning employee shall be treated as a new employee for purposes of
calculating longevity pay and shall not receive credit for prior service.
   (e)   The Common Council shall review the amount and the terms of longevity

§ 2-42 Health Insurance.
   (a)   Self-insurance. There is established a self- insurance program for the
City for the purpose of establishing comprehensive medical insurance for
qualified City employees and Carmel-Clay Park Board employees.
(`91 Code, § 2-57) (Ord. D-1040, 12-20-93; Ord. D-1900, 8-4-08)
   (b)   Employee insurance. The City will offer one or more plans of medical,
dental and/or vision insurance to its eligible employees. All full-time
employees, including conditional and probationary employees, and elected
officials shall be eligible for such insurance coverage after 30 days of
employment with the City. For the purposes of health insurance eligibility
only, full time shall mean an employee who is regularly scheduled to work
thirty (30) or more hours per week. Details regarding medical insurance are set
forth in the City of Carmel Employee Health Benefit Plan, as amended from time
to time.
   (c)   Insurance premiums. The City shall contribute no less than 75% of the
premiums for single and family coverage, the actual amount to be determined
annually during the budget process, depending on the plan selected by an
employee. For members of the Common Council, the City shall contribute exactly
75% of the total premium. Employees will be informed of the City's contribution
level no later than November 15 of each year, to be effective the following
January 1.
   (d)   Parks employees. Full-time employees of the Carmel-Clay Parks Board
shall also be eligible for coverage under the City’s medical, dental and vision
plans, on the same terms and conditions as City employees. The insurance
provider, or third party administrator in the event the City is self-insured,
shall agree in writing on all new plan inception dates and plan renewal dates
that Parks employees are included in such coverage. The Parks Board shall make
the employer contribution for its employees.
   (e)   Retiree insurance. For full-time employees hired before October 3,
2016: The City shall contribute 50% of the monthly employee-spouse premium for
retirees who have 20 years of active service with the City, plus an additional
1% for each additional six months of service, up to a maximum of 75% of the
employee only or employee-spouse premium, as applicable, provided that the
City’s insurance premium contribution shall not exceed $900 per month or
$10,800 per year. If the retiree is not married but has dependent children, an
equivalent dollar amount will be applied to the employee-child(ren) premium. If
the retiree has a spouse, whether or not the spouse is on the City’s plan,
coverage for other eligible dependents may be continued at the retiree’s
expense. Coverage will end when the retiree and/or spouse and dependent(s) age
out of the Plan, or, in the case of a qualified disabled dependent child, when
both parents have aged out of the plan. Employees hired on or after October 3,
2016 will not be eligible for this benefit.
   (f)   Insurance for individuals who die in the line of duty. For an employee
who dies in the line of duty, the City will contribute 100% of the monthly
spouse and dependent (if applicable) medical and dental premiums as long as the
wife and dependents are in the plan. The surviving spouse may remain in the
plan for the remainder of his or her lifetime, or, when the spouse becomes
eligible for Medicare the City may, in its sole discretion, elect to pay for a
supplemental insurance plan that offers coverage equal to or better than the
City plan. Coverage for other dependents will end when they age out of the
plan, or in the case of a qualified disabled dependent child, when the spouse
is no longer in the plan.
   A death must be clearly, directly, substantially and causally related to the
employee’s official job duties to be deemed “in the line of duty.” For a sworn
police officer or firefighter, this determination shall be made by the Indiana
Public Retirement System (“INPRS”). For civilian employees, this determination
shall be made at the sole discretion of the City.
   (g)   Insurance for individuals who suffer from a catastrophic physical
personal injury. For a police officer or firefighter who suffers from a
catastrophic physical personal injury, the City will contribute 100% of the
monthly employee medical and dental premiums until the employee becomes
eligible for Medicare. The City will contribute 100% of the spouse and
dependent (if applicable) medical and dental premiums until those individuals
age out of the plan, or, in the case of a qualified disabled dependent child,
when both parents have aged out of the plan.
   A catastrophic physical personal injury is a permanent and total impairment
that is the direct result of a physical injury that:
      (1)   occurs in the line of duty; and
      (2)   permanently prevents the police officer or firefighter from
performing any gainful work.
   The determination that a police officer or firefighter suffers from a
catastrophic physical personal injury will be made solely by INPRS.
   (h)   Insurance for other disabled individuals. A disabled individual (a
“Medical Retiree”) must qualify for an INPRS disability benefit based on a
line-of-duty or duty-based illness or injury before he or she becomes eligible
for a City benefit under this section. For qualifying Medical Retirees, the
City will contribute to monthly premium payments according to the following
schedule:
      (1)   For an initial period of two (2) years from the date of disability
the City will pay one hundred percent (100%) of the Medical Retiree’s medical
and dental premiums. All percentages in this section include premiums for the
Medical Retiree and eligible family members, including spouses and dependents
acquired after the disability date.
      (2)   No less than two (2) months prior to the two (2) year anniversary
of the disability date, the Medical Retiree will meet with a Medical Review
Committee (the “Committee”), in person or virtually, to determine the need for
additional premium assistance. The Review Committee may end premium
contributions after two (2) years or continue them at a fifty percent (50%) or
one hundred percent (100%) level for an additional two (2) years. The 50% level
will be subject to the same monthly maximum imposed on retirees with twenty
(20) or more years of service.
      (3)   No less than two (2) months prior to the four (4) year anniversary
of the disability date, the Medical Retiree will again meet with the Committee,
in person or virtually, for a final determination. The Review Committee may end
premium contributions after four (4) years or continue them at a fifty percent
(50%) or one hundred percent (100%) level, which decision will remain valid
until the Medical Retiree and his or her family members age out of the Plan, or
until INPRS determines the Medical Retiree is no longer disabled. An eligible
disabled dependent may remain on the plan as long as at least one parent is on
the plan. The 50% level will be subject to the same monthly maximum imposed on
retirees with twenty (20) or more years of service.
      (4)   The Committee shall be comprised of nine (9) members and one
alternate, as follows:
         a.   two (2) police officers elected from within their ranks, who may
not also serve on the Department’s Pension Committee;
         b.   two (2) firefighters elected from within their ranks, who may not
also serve on the Department’s Pension Committee;
         c.   one (1) upper level management employee selected by the police
and fire chiefs;
         d.   two (2) civilian employees nominated by their directors and
selected by the Director of Human Resources;
         e.   one (1) civilian management employee nominated by his or her
director and selected by the Director of Human Resources; and
         f.   the Director of Human Resources, who shall chair the Committee.
         g.   An alternate shall be named by the Corporation Counsel, but shall
not be a member of the Corporation Counsel’s staff. The alternate shall sit in
on all fact-finding meetings and deliberations, but shall not vote unless
another committee member is absent, recuses himself or herself or is recused at
the Medical Retiree’s request.
      (5)   The Medical Retiree shall be entitled to request any one (1) member
of the committee be recused, with or without cause.
      (6)   Deliberations may be held in-person or virtually. The committee’s
decisions shall be made by a vote requiring a simple majority of members
present. In case of a tie, the Director of Human Resources shall make the final
determination.
      (7)   The committee’s decisions are final, unless a petition for
reconsideration is granted (see (8) below). The committee’s decision shall be
communicated to the Medical Retiree in writing by the Director of Human
Resources within two (2) weeks after the meeting with the Medical Retiree.
      (8)   Each Committee member shall sign a confidentiality agreement,
pledging not to reveal medical, financial or other personal information of the
Medical Retiree. Members will be subject to disciplinary action for breaching
the agreement.
      (9)   The Committee shall be authorized to consider the Medical Retiree’s
medical condition, preparation for different careers, employment status, family
status and other relevant factors in reaching a decision. The Committee may end
premium contributions without further consideration for a Medical Retiree who
refuses to provide information as requested.
      (10)   The Committee’s decision may be invalidated, and premium
contributions terminated, at any time it can be shown the Medical Retiree has
withheld relevant information or provided incomplete or false information.
      (11)   If benefits are reduced or terminated, the Medical Retiree can
petition for reconsideration of the decision if his or her circumstances
materially change. The petition shall be made in writing to the Director of
Human Resources and shall include a description of the changes that the Medical
Retiree believes merit further review. The Director of Human Resources will
decide whether to grant a petition for reconsideration and inform the Medical
Retiree of the decision in writing.
      (12)   This section (h) applies to Medical Retirees whose final
determination is made after July 31, 2020. Those Medical Retirees whose
determinations were made on or before July 31, 2020, will continue to receive
benefits provided under previous guidelines.
   (i)   Summary only. The benefits described in sections (e) through (h) are a
summary only. Complete details regarding insurance benefits for employees who
retire or who die or are disabled in the line of duty are set forth in the City
of Carmel Guidelines For Payment Of Retiree Insurance Premiums and Guidelines
for Payment of Premiums For Individuals Who Die Or Who Are Disabled In The Line
Of Duty, as amended from time to time.
   (j)   Coordination of benefits. An employee or family member who qualifies
for an employer contribution based on years of service and death or disability
shall receive the greater of the benefits described in sections (e) through (h)
above for which he or she is eligible.
   (k)   Eligibility. Eligibility for the Plan is determined solely by the
provisions of the Plan. Sections (e) through (h) above pertain only to premium
contributions and not to Plan eligibility.
   (l)   City as sole beneficiary. Benefits under this section will be paid
only to the City of Carmel Employee Health Benefit Plan or its successor plan.

for a survivor who is eligible for Medicare benefits, as described in section
(f) above.

employees.
   (b)   Civilian long-term disability.
      (1)   The City will make available to eligible City employees, on an
optional basis, long-term disability coverage. Availability of the plan is
contingent upon a specified level of employee participation. All full-time
civilian employees shall be eligible for coverage the first of the month

§ 2-46 Worker's Compensation.
   (a)   All City of Carmel employees are covered by the provisions of the
state's worker's compensation laws. Civilian employees are eligible for medical
and income replacement benefits. Sworn police officers and firefighters are
eligible for medical benefits only. Sections (b) through (e) below apply to
income replacement benefits.
   (b)   For a full-time employee who must be off work more than seven calendar
days but fewer than 43 calendar days due to a compensable illness or injury,
the City will pay the difference between the employee's gross weekly worker's
compensation benefit and his or her normal gross weekly wages from the City.
Benefits will be paid bi-weekly. Supplemental payments will continue after 42
calendar days only if approved on a case-by-case basis by the Board of Public
Works and Safety. All payments shall cease when the employee returns to full-
time work, when the worker's compensation carrier offers settlement for a
permanent partial impairment or a permanent total disability or when the
employment relationship with the City is terminated by either party.
   (c)   All applicable taxes shall be withheld from each supplemental check
issued by the City. The employee may elect to continue or discontinue voluntary
payroll deductions for the duration of the leave. However, employee insurance
premiums must be made on or before the due date, regardless of how payment is
made, in order for coverage to be continuous. Garnishments, child support and
other court-ordered payments shall be deducted to the extent that funds are
available. It is the employee's responsibility to make all court-ordered
payments that cannot be deducted in full from the employee's supplemental
check.

worker's compensation benefits are paid for the first week and the employee was
already paid by the City for that same time period, the employee shall sign
over the worker's compensation benefit check for that week to the City, or
reimburse an equivalent amount to the City. When the City receives payment from
the employee, all paid time off used by the employee during the first week of
leave shall be credited back to the employee. If the employee fails to
reimburse the City as required herein, the City reserves the right to recover
through payroll deduction the amount of the worker's compensation benefit paid
for the first week of leave.
   (e)   An employee receiving worker's compensation income replacement
benefits shall be deemed on paid leave for purposes of accruing PTO.

distinct contributions are made to PERF on behalf of civilian employees.
      (1)   Employer contribution. A percentage of each eligible employee's
gross wages, such percentage to be designated annually by PERF, is deposited
into the PERF pension fund. These payments are not credited to an individual
employee's account. Employees must meet service and/or age requirements to be
eligible for a PERF pension.
      (2)   Employee contribution. An amount equal to 3% of each eligible
employee's gross wages shall be deposited into an annuity account for that
particular employee. PERF shall produce periodic statements for each annuity
account.
         a)   Effective through December 31, 1997, 3% of the gross wages of
each such employee shall be deducted from that employee's salary as that
employee's PERF contribution.
         b)   Effective on and after January 1, 1998, an amount equal to 3% of
the gross wages of each such employee shall be contributed to PERF by the City
in lieu of such employee's own contribution.
         c)   Deposits made to an annuity account by an employee, or by the
City on behalf of an employee, may be refunded to the employee upon termination
of employment with the City and application to PERF.
   (b)   Police and Fire Pension Fund. All full-time sworn employees of the
City must join the Police Officers' and Firefighters' Pension and Disability
Fund (or a successor fund) on the first day of hire. Two separate and distinct
contributions are made to PERF on behalf of sworn employees.
      (1)   Employer contribution. A percentage of a first class officer's base
pay (including 20 years of longevity pay), such percentage to be designated
annually by PERF, is deposited into the pension fund on behalf of each
employee. These payments are not credited to an individual employee's account.
Employees must meet service and/or age requirements to be eligible for a PERF
pension.
      (2)   Employee contribution. An amount equal to 6% of a first class
officer's base pay (including 20 years of longevity pay) shall be deposited
into an annuity account for each eligible employee. The City may elect to pay
any or all of the employee contribution. PERF shall produce periodic statements
for each annuity account.
         a)   Effective through November 29, 2001, the employee contribution
shall be deducted from the employee's salary on an after-tax basis.
         b)   Effective on and after November 30, 2001, the portion of the
employee contribution paid by the employee shall be deducted from the

portion of the employee contribution equal to 21% less the employer
contribution; the remaining portion of the employee contribution shall be
deducted from the employee's salary. If the employer contribution equals or
exceeds 21%, the City shall pay no portion of the employee contribution.
         e)   Deposits made to an annuity account by an employee may be
refunded to the employee upon termination of employment with the City and
application to PERF, if the employee's plan allows for refunds.

§ 2-48 Deferred Compensation Plan.
   (a)   Definitions. For purposes of this section the following words shall
have the meanings herein stated:
      Deferred Compensation shall mean the amount of compensation reduced and
deferred pursuant to a deferred compensation agreement.
      Deferred Compensation Account shall mean the account established for each
employee who has entered into a deferred compensation agreement and into which
the compensation he has deferred shall be credited.
      Deferred Compensation Plan shall mean any defined contribution retirement
plan established pursuant to section 457(b) or 401(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code, or any other allowable plan the City deems appropriate for the purpose of
helping employees prepare financially for their retirement.
      Employee shall mean any person actively employed by the City of Carmel.
      Employer shall mean the City of Carmel.
   (b)   Elective deferred compensation plan authorized. The employer is hereby
authorized to establish and administer one deferred compensation plan for
eligible employees as provided in this section or pursuant to I.C., 5-10-1.1-7.
Such deferred compensation plan may be amended from time to time. Any amendment
to an existing plan or the adoption of a new plan shall not invalidate any
employee's previous deferral of compensation and/or any income or loss
attributable to the amounts deferred.
   (c)   Employee eligibility. Any full-time or part- time employee, including
elected or appointed officials, shall be eligible to participate in the
deferred compensation plan, provided the employee has entered into a properly
executed deferred compensation agreement.
   (d)   Terms of agreement. A deferred compensation agreement shall be
executed by each participating employee and by the employer or any party
authorized to execute such agreements on behalf of the employer, and shall
contain the following provisions:
      (1)   The eligible employee shall agree in writing that the salary of
such employee shall be reduced by no less than $20 per month and the same
amount shall be credited to the employee's deferred compensation account. The
employee may begin, end or revise his deferral amount within the limitations
established by the City.
      (2)   All deferrals shall be invested in accordance with the written
instructions of the employee, who may select among the options offered by the
deferred compensation plan. If the employee fails to designate his investment
preferences, the money will be invested as outlined in the default provision of
the plan.
      (3)   The employee shall agree that the assets of any 457(b) account are
the absolute property of the employer, and the employee shall have no rights to
that account except as set forth in the deferred compensation plan.
      (4)   Monies deposited into a deferred compensation account cannot be
withdrawn until the participant leaves the City's employment, unless the
employee qualifies for an unforeseeable emergency withdrawal, as defined by the
Internal Revenue Code.
   (e)   Non-elective deferred compensation plan. The City shall make a non-
elective contribution to the deferred compensation plan on behalf of each sworn
officer of the Carmel Police Department in an amount equal to what would have
been paid into the Social Security system if the Carmel Police Department
participated in that system. Such non-elective contributions shall be referred
to as the "Police Retirement Benefit Program." Non-elective contributions to
the Police Retirement Benefit Program shall be held separately from elective
contributions but shall be administered under the same guidelines as the
elective plan.
   (f)   Administration. The deferred compensation plan shall be administered
as provided for in the deferred compensation plan document and any amendments
thereto. The employer may enter into an agreement with one or more third
parties to provide consulting, administrative and/or financial planning
services in relation to the deferred compensation plan.
   (g)   Matching contributions. The City shall match certain elective
contributions of full-time and part-time employees to the deferred compensation
plan to the extent such contributions are allowed by law. Contributions made to
the non-elective Police Retirement Benefit Program are not eligible for
matching.
      (1)   The City shall match employee contributions to deferred
compensation accounts (excluding catch-up contributions) at the levels stated
below. The City’s matching contribution will not exceed 50% of the employee
contribution or 50% of the maximum allowed by federal tax law, whichever is
lower, regardless of the employee's length of service or the amount of his
deferral.
         a)   No match in the first calendar year of employment with the City;
         b)   Ten percent match after one full calendar year of employment with
the City;
         c)   Twenty percent match after two full calendar years of employment
with the City;
         d)   Thirty percent match after three full calendar years of
employment with the City;
         e)   Forty percent match after four full calendar years of employment
with the City;
         f)   Fifty percent match after five full calendar years of employment
with the City.
      (2)   The City reserves the right, in its sole discretion and with prior
approval of the Common Council, to change the level of or cease providing
matching contributions at any time. If the level of matching contributions is
changed, the City will promptly notify its employees in writing of such change.
      (3)   All matching contributions made by the City are 100% vested at the
time of the contribution. However, an employee may not withdraw any monies, for
any reason, from a matching account until his employment with the City is
terminated.
      (4)   An employee will be eligible for each stated level of matching on
the first payroll date following his employment anniversary date on which the
required years of service are attained, regardless of length of time the
employee has participated in the deferred compensation plan.
      (5)   Should an employee have an interruption of employment of 100 or
fewer calendar days, the employee shall be entitled to full credit for service
prior to the interruption. After an interruption of more than 100 calendar
days, a returning employee shall be treated as a new employee for purposes of
the deferred compensation matching program and shall not receive credit for
prior service.
   (h)   Neither the existence of a deferred compensation agreement nor any of
its provisions shall be construed to confer upon the employee any right to
continue his employment for any specific period or at any particular rate of
compensation.

§ 2-49 Reserved for Future Use.
§ 2-50 Reserved for Future Use.
§ 2-51 Paid Time Off (PTO).
(a)   Definitions.
      An employee’s Benefit Year shall mean the anniversary of the employee’s
full-time hire date in any given year to the day preceding the anniversary date
in the following year. Benefit Years shall thus vary from employee to employee,
depending on hire date.
      Paid Time Off (PTO) replaces vacation time, sick time and holidays. PTO
shall mean time off with pay that shall be used for holidays and can otherwise
be used at an employee's discretion and with the approval of the employee's
supervisor.
   (b)   PTO bank.
      (1)   Accruals. 
         a)   PTO shall accrue according to the following schedule:
Years 0-5
(date of hire through end of year 5)          9.50 hours per pay period
Years 6-12
(beginning of year 6 through end of year 12)      11.25 hours per pay period
Years 13-20
(beginning of year 13 through end of year 20)      12.00 hours per pay period
Years 21+
(beginning of year 21 through date of separation)   13.00 hours per pay period
         b)   The City may, in its sole discretion, elect to accrue PTO at time
intervals other than bi-weekly (e.g., monthly, quarterly, biannually or
annually). The conversion to a different accrual interval shall result in
accruals essentially equivalent (with allowance for rounding), on a prorated
basis, to the bi-weekly amounts stated above.
         c)   An employee must work and/or be on paid leave an entire pay
period in order to accrue PTO for that pay period. Any employee who is paid for
fewer than 75 hours in a pay period (80 hours for golf course employees) shall
not accrue PTO for that period. An exception shall be made for a new employee
within the first two full pay periods of his or her employment. If one or more
holidays are the only reason the employee is not paid 75 hours for the first
two full pay periods, the employee shall accrue PTO for those pay periods.
      (3)   New employees.  
         a)   A new employee shall accrue PTO beginning with his or her first
full pay period, but shall not be entitled to use discretionary accrued leave
until he or she has completed three months of full-time employment. During this
period the employee is required to use non-discretionary PTO for holidays
unless he or she works the holiday.
         b)   Should an employee separate from the City and then be re-employed
within 100 or fewer calendar days, the employee shall be entitled to full
credit for service prior to the separation. After a separation of more than 100
calendar days, a returning employee shall be treated as a new employee for
purposes of calculating PTO accruals and shall not receive credit for prior
service.
      (4)   Transfer/termination.  
         a)   The balance in an employee's PTO bank is transferable between any
City departments. The employee's new department is responsible for all PTO time
the employee brings with him.
         b)   An employee is eligible to be paid for unused PTO upon leaving
the City's employment. However, an employee's termination date may not be
extended to use up the PTO bank balance. The employee's termination date shall
always be the last day worked.
      (5)   Use of PTO bank.
         a)   Non-discretio nary: Employees shall be required to use PTO time
for holidays they would be scheduled to work but for the holiday. An employee
does not have discretion to work the holiday rather than take PTO. Any employee
who does not have sufficient time accrued for a holiday shall take the time off
without pay. Discretionary: For all discretionary time off, supervisors shall
make every effort to honor the paid time off requests of employees, consistent
with the needs of the department.
         b)   An employee will be allowed to use only that paid leave that has
been credited to his PTO bank. PTO cannot be taken in advance of, or during,
the pay period in which it is accrued.
         c)   PTO may be used in increments of 15 minutes.
         d)   Employees are expected to meet the minimum notification standards
established by the City. All PTO requests and/or notifications must be made in
a manner consistent with each department's documented reporting procedures.
         e)   Use of PTO with less than 24 hours notice is referred to herein
as unscheduled PTO. A supervisor may require proof of illness, injury or other
emergency when an employee uses unscheduled PTO. An employee using unscheduled
PTO shall not be paid for the absence unless he or she has provided
notification before the commencement of each work day (unless an emergency
makes notification impossible).
         f)   An employee using PTO for his own illness, injury or health
condition shall not engage in outside employment during the period of leave.
         g)    Subject to the minimum requirements of this ordinance, each
department head may establish additional guidelines for administration
of the PTO program. Such guidelines must be in writing, distributed to each
employee and posted in the workplace. Failure to follow established procedures
may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
      (6)   Minimum staffing. 
         a)   Every department shall establish minimum staffing requirements
for each of its operations. PTO shall not be granted, except in case of illness
or approved FMLA leave, when it will cause the staffing to fall below minimum
requirements.
         b)   Unless the department has established a different policy, time
off requests shall be granted on a first come, first served basis.
      (7)   Employee responsibilities. The City's goal in creating a PTO policy
is to allow employees maximum flexibility in the scheduling and use of paid
time off, while at the same time ensuring that City operations are not
adversely affected by the use of the privilege. Thus, the entitlement to paid
time off under this policy carries a corresponding duty on the part of each
employee to use his time responsibly. Using PTO in a manner that is detrimental
to department operations will be considered a breach of the employee's duty and
will be subject to disciplinary action.
      (8)   Carryover. An employee will be allowed to carry over a maximum of
150 hours from one benefit year to the next. Any excess time left in the PTO
bank at the end of any benefit year will be transferred to the employee's sick
leave bank, subject to the 300 hour maximum accumulation in the sick leave
bank. Hours that exceed the sick leave bank maximum shall be forfeited.
   (c)   Sick leave bank.
      (1)   Initial funding. Sick leave accrued by an employee prior to June
27, 2009, will be maintained in a sick leave bank and may only be used for the
employee's own medical needs, or as otherwise allowed under the City's family
and medical leave policy.
      (2)   Annual deposits. 
         a)   Any time in excess of 150 hours remaining in an employee's PTO
bank at the end of any benefit year will be transferred to the sick leave bank,
up to the maximum stated below.
         b)   An employee who has 150 or fewer hours in his PTO bank at the end
of any benefit year will not have a deposit into his sick leave bank for that
year.
      (3)   Use of sick leave bank. 
         a)   The sick leave bank is intended for use when:
            i.   An employee is medically unable to work due to an illness,
injury or health condition, and is not otherwise compensated by the City or by
worker's compensation or disability benefits; or
            ii.   An employee qualifies for family and medical leave to care
for a spouse, child or parent with a serious medical condition.
         b)   The sick leave bank cannot be used:
            i.   Until the balance in the employee's PTO bank is 75 hours or
less (although an employee may choose to deplete his PTO bank before using time
from his sick leave bank); and/or
            ii.   For illnesses of family members, unless such illnesses
qualify for leave under the City's family and medical leave policy.
         c)   The sick leave bank may be used in increments of 15 minutes.
         d)   An employee using time from his sick leave bank for his own
illness, injury or health condition shall not engage in outside employment
during the period of leave.
         e)   A supervisor may require a doctor's statement or other proof of
illness if the employee's use of the sick leave bank indicates misuse, or any
time after an absence of three or more work days.
         f)   Use of the sick leave bank contrary to the guidelines listed in
this section may result in disciplinary action, up to and including
termination.
      (4)   Maximum accumulation. No employee can carry over more than 300
hours in his sick leave bank from one benefit year to the next. Any time in
excess of 300 hours will be forfeited.
      (5)   Transfer/termination. 
         a)   The balance in an employee's sick leave bank is transferable
between any City departments. The employee's new department is responsible for
all sick time the employee brings with him.
         b)   An employee's sick leave bank balance will not be paid out upon
termination of employment. An employee's termination date may not be extended
to use up the sick leave bank balance. The employee's termination date shall
always be the last day worked.
   (d)   Coordination with disability benefits. An employee is required to use
all but 75 hours in his PTO bank and all time in his sick leave bank before
receiving disability benefits. An employee may elect to use any remaining PTO
balance before receiving disability benefits.
   (e)   Additional leave.
      (1)   An employee who uses all the accrued time in his PTO bank and sick
leave bank is not eligible for additional paid time off, unless the absence
falls into another category of paid leave for which the employee is eligible.
Even if additional unpaid leave is granted, the employee may be subject to
disciplinary action for misuse of the PTO program.
      (2)   An employee who is in need of additional extended leave may apply
for unpaid leave as provided by the City's leaves of absence policy.

§ 2-52 Holidays.
   (a)   Definitions.
      Holiday shall mean the 24-hour period from midnight to midnight of a day
on the annual holiday schedule, unless otherwise specified.
      Premium Pay shall mean the hourly amount, as stated in the Salary
Ordinance, a full-time, part-time or temporary employee earns in addition to
his regular hourly rate, for each hour (or portion thereof) worked on a
holiday.
   (b)   Each year the Mayor shall set a City holiday schedule. Pay for such
holidays shall be included in an employee's bi-weekly PTO accrual. Employees
are required to use PTO time for holidays they would be scheduled to work but
for the holiday. An employee may be required to work on a holiday or may be
given the option to work; however, this decision is at the discretion of
management. An employee may not choose to work on a holiday because he does not
have sufficient PTO accrued or in order to save PTO for another time.
Notwithstanding the requirements of §2-40(d)(l)(f-g), a department that is
operated and/or may be staffed on a 24/7 basis may allow or require PTO to be
used for holidays that fall on an employee's scheduled day off and/or for
holidays on which the employee is required to work, in order to ensure adequate
staffing at all times.
   (c)   In addition to their regular pay, full-time, part-time and temporary
employees required to work on a holiday shall be eligible for premium pay for
each hour (or portion thereof) actually worked, as specified in the annual
Salary Ordinance. Regardless of the City's holiday schedule, each employee who
works January 1, July 4 or December 25 of any year shall be eligible for
premium pay. Employees who are given the option to work, but are not required
to work, on a holiday shall not be entitled to premium pay. Department heads
and golf course employees are not eligible for premium pay.
   (d)   Part-time golf course employees shall receive time-and-one-half their
regular hourly rate for each hour (or portion thereof) worked on a holiday.
Full-time golf course employees shall receive their regular pay only for
working on a holiday—they are not eligible for either premium pay or for time-
and-one-half.

undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy for a serious injury or

occurred any time during the five years preceding the date of treatment, even
if it did not manifest itself until after active duty, is also a covered

department head.
         c)   An employee on intermittent or reduced schedule leave may be

member with a serious injury or illness incurred in the line of duty if the
employee is the covered service member's spouse, son, daughter, parent or next
of kin.
         b)   The leave entitlement to care for a covered service member is
applied on a per-covered service member, per-injury basis. An eligible employee
may be entitled to more than one 26-week period of leave if the leave is to
care for different covered service members or to care for the same covered
service member with a subsequent serious injury or illness, except that no more
than 26 weeks may be taken within a single 12-month period.

leave entitlement during the single 12-month period, the remaining part of the
26 weeks is forfeited.
         d)   Leave to care for a covered service member may be taken
continuously, or, if medically necessary, intermittently or through a reduced
work schedule.

employee's son or daughter, and to care for the newborn child; placement with
the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care; to care for the
employee's spouse, son, daughter or parent with a serious health condition;
because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform
the functions of his position; and/or a qualifying exigency.
      (5)   Requesting and scheduling leave.
         a)   Employees have certain notification obligations under FMLA. While
an employee need not specifically assert his rights under FMLA or even mention
the FMLA in requesting leave, the employee must provide information sufficient
to enable the City to determine whether the leave may be FMLA-qualifying and
the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. If the leave is for a
condition for which the City has previously approved FMLA leave, the employee
must specifically reference that qualifying reason for the leave.
            If the employee provides at least verbal notice sufficient to make
a supervisor aware that the employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave, it is the
responsibility of the supervisor to ensure that the employee is notified of his
potential rights to FMLA- covered leave.
         b)   Whenever foreseeable (e.g., birth or placement of child, planned
medical care), the employee shall provide the department head with not less
than 30 days advance notice of intended FMLA leave. If circumstances prevent
providing 30 days advance notice, the employee shall provide as much notice as
is reasonable and practicable. In an emergency, notice may be given by the
employee's adult family member or other responsible party. If the employee
fails to provide required notice of foreseeable leave with no reasonable
excuse, the City may delay the FMLA leave to the extent permitted by law.
         c)   The City reserves the right to designate any qualifying leave as
FMLA leave regardless of whether the employee has specifically requested FMLA
leave. An employee who uses or plans to use more than three consecutive paid or
unpaid days or shifts off due to an injury, illness or health condition shall
apply for, or be deemed to have applied for, FMLA leave.
         d)   An employee is required to comply with all of his department's
usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave,
absent extenuating circumstances. The employee is also expected to make a
reasonable effort to schedule medical treatment and other eligible appointments
and events so as not to unduly disrupt the ongoing operations of his
department.
      (6)   Documentation.
         a)   Any employee requiring FMLA leave must complete and submit an
FMLA Request Form to his department head, who shall sign the form and forward
it to Human Resources. If an employee is unable to complete the form, the
employee's department head may do so on the employee's behalf.
         b)   If FMLA leave is for the employee's own serious health condition,
for the care of a family member with a serious health condition or for the care
for a covered service member, a written medical certification must be obtained
from the patient's health care provider (or in the case of a covered service
member, an authorized DOD provider). Upon receipt of an employee's properly
completed FMLA Request Form, Human Resources will provide, within five working
days (absent extenuating circumstances), a Notice of Eligibility and Rights and
Responsibilities along with the appropriate certification form for the health
care provider.
         c)   The City may, at its own expense, require a second and third
medical opinion (except with respect to leave to care for a covered service
member) if there is a question as to the necessity for leave relating to a
serious health condition. The City will designate the health care provider to
furnish the second opinion. A third health care provider, whose decision is
final and binding, must be designated or approved jointly by the City and the
employee. Pending the receipt of the second or third medical opinion, the
employee is provisionally entitled to the benefits of the FMLA.
         d)   If FMLA leave is for a qualifying exigency, the employee must
also submit a copy of the covered military member's active duty orders and a
certification form. Upon receipt of an employee's properly completed FMLA
Request Form, Human Resources will provide, within five working days (absent
extenuating circumstances), a Notice of Eligibility and Rights and
Responsibilities along with the appropriate certification form for the
employee.
         e)   The Notice of Eligibility and Rights and Responsibilities will
indicate, among other things:
            i.   Whether the employee is eligible for FMLA leave, and, if not,
why not; and
            ii.   The employee's specific obligations with respect to FMLA
leave, and the consequences of a failure to meet these obligations.
Any certification forms required to complete the leave application will be
included with the Notice.
         f)   After all required documentation is provided by the employee and/
or his health care provider, Human Resources will send a Designation Notice,
informing the employee whether or not his leave will be designated FMLA-
qualifying.
         g)   All certification forms will be supplied by Human Resources and
will comply with U.S. Department of Labor guidelines. If an employee fails to
provide the required certification in a timely manner, the employee may be
denied FMLA leave until such certification is provided.
         h)   When an employee's need for intermittent leave due to the
employee's own serious health condition or that of a family member lasts beyond
a single rolling 12-month period, the City may require the employee to provide
a new medical certification in each subsequent 12-month period in compliance
with applicable law and regulation.
         i)   An employee may also be required to periodically provide a
recertification. The City may require such recertification no more frequently
than every 30 days, and only in connection with an absence by the employee,
except in the following circumstances:
            i.   More than 30 days: If the medical certification indicates that
the minimum duration of a condition is more than 30 days, the City will wait
until the minimum duration passes before requesting recertification. However,
in no case is the City required to wait more than six months before requesting
recertification.
            ii.   Less than 30 days: The City may request recertification in
less than 30 days if the employee requests an extension of the leave, the
circumstances described by the previous certification have changed
significantly, or the City receives information that casts doubt upon the
employee's stated reason for the absence or the continuing validity of the
certification.
         j)   If an employee is requesting leave to care for a family member
with a serious health condition, for a qualifying exigency, or to care for a
covered service member, the City may require the employee to provide reasonable
documentation of the requisite family relationship.
         k)   To facilitate the communication required by FMLA absences, an
employee may be required to make periodic contact with his supervisor or
another designated member of management throughout his absence. Any employee on
FMLA leave who is away from the address on file with the City's payroll office
for a period of more than three days shall notify the contact person of the
phone number and address at which he can be reached.
      (7)   Compensation and benefits under the Family and Medical Leave
Policy.
         a)    Leave taken under the FMLA is unpaid. It is, however, the policy
of the City to require employees to substitute other applicable earned or
accrued paid time, as set forth below, for all or part of the unpaid leave.
Such paid leave shall run concurrently with FMLA leave and shall count against
the employee's leave entitlement under the FMLA.
            i.   For the birth or placement of a son or daughter (not including
the actual childbirth, which is treated as a serious health condition) or for a
qualifying exigency, a civilian employee is required to exhaust all PTO in lieu
of unpaid leave under the FMLA; a sworn police officer or firefighter is
required to exhaust all vacation time. Any employee may elect, but is not
required, to use the other paid leave, such as compensatory time off and/or
floating holidays prior to beginning unpaid FMLA leave. The employee may not
use sick leave for the birth or placement of a child.
            ii.   For a serious health condition that makes the employee unable
to perform the essential functions of his job, to care for the employee's
spouse, son , daughter or parent with a serious health condition, or to care
for a covered service member, a civilian employee is required to use PTO until
his PTO balance is under 75 hours or less and then to exhaust all his sick
leave in lieu of unpaid leave under FLMA; a sworn police officer or firefighter
is required to exhaust his sick leave. Any employee may elect, but is not
required, to use his remaining PTO/vacation time and/or other paid leave, such
as compensatory time off and floating holidays, prior to beginning unpaid FMLA
leave.
         b)   Exceptions to the compensation policy stated section (a) above:
            i.   An employee who refuses a suitable light duty assignment will
not be allowed to use sick leave for his own serious health condition. Other
paid leave, including PTO/vacation, compensatory time off and floating
holidays, may be used with the written permission of the employee's department
head.
            ii.   Sworn police officers and firefighters whose sick leave for
the entire year would otherwise be exhausted by using FMLA leave may choose to
reserve five hours of sick leave for each full or partial month remaining in
the calendar year at the time of the return from leave. Reserved hours are
subject to all restrictions normally placed upon sick leave.
         c)   Taking FMLA leave shall not result in the loss of any employment
benefit accrued prior to the date on which the leave commences.
         d)   The following benefits are not affected during unpaid FMLA leave:
            i.   Group health insurance coverage will continue on the same
basis as coverage would have been provided had the employee been actively
employed during the leave period, as long as the employee pays his regular
portion of the premium on a timely basis. Failure to pay or timely pay such
premiums during leave may result in loss of health insurance coverage.
               An employee who does not return to full-time work for a period
of at least 30 calendar days at the end of the leave, unless the reason the
employee does not return is beyond his control, will be expected to reimburse
the City for health insurance premiums paid by the City during the leave
period. The City shall take action to collect such payments to the extent
permitted by law. An employee who chooses not to retain the City's health
coverage during FMLA leave will be entitled, upon return from leave, to
reinstatement on the same terms as prior to taking the leave.
            ii.   Group term life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment
insurance and short-term disability insurance (civilian employees only) will
remain in force at the City's expense.
            iii.   Long-term disability insurance will continue on the same
basis as coverage would have been provided had the employee been actively
employed during the leave period, as long as the employee pays his premium on a
timely basis. Failure to pay or timely pay such premiums during leave may
result in loss of long-term disability insurance coverage, and the employee may
be required to provide proof of insurability before coverage is reinstated.
            iv.   Although the employee and employer contributions to the
Public Employees Retirement Fund will be interrupted during an unpaid leave of
absence, no break shall be reflected in the employee's service credits.
            v.   An employee will continue to accrue longevity service credit
from the City while on eligible leave. However, the employee will not receive
longevity pay during the leave of absence.
         e)   The following benefits are affected during an unpaid FMLA leave:
            i.   A civilian employee shall not accrue PTO for any bi-weekly pay
period during which the employee is paid for fewer than 75 hours (80 hours for
golf course employees).
            ii.    An employee shall not receive holiday pay for any holiday
that falls during a period of unpaid leave.
      (8)   Returning from FMLA leave.
         a)   The City may require an employee on FMLA leave to report
periodically on his status and intent to return to work. If the circumstances
change and it becomes necessary for an employee to take either more or less
leave than originally anticipated, the employee is required to provide notice
of the changed circumstances within two business days. If an extension is
requested a recertification may be required. In no case may the employee be
required to take more leave than necessary to resolve the circumstances that
precipitated the need to take leave.
         b)   In general, upon return from FMLA leave an employee is entitled
to be reinstated to the same position he held when leave commenced or to an
equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits, working conditions and other
terms and conditions of employment. In addition, the position in which the
employee is placed will have substantially similar duties, skill, effort,
responsibility and authority. The right to reinstatement is not absolute -
reinstatement may be denied if:
            i.   The employee would not have been employed by the City at the
time reinstatement is requested even if he had not taken leave; or
            ii.   The reinstatement of a key employee will cause substantial
and grievous economic injury to the operations of the City; or
            iii.   The employee is unable to perform an essential function of
his position or an equivalent position, with or without reasonable
accommodation, because of a physical or mental condition; or
            iv.   FMLA leave has been fraudulently obtained.
         c)   An employee who has taken leave for his own serious health
condition is required to provide a medical certification from the health care
provider stating that the employee is able to resume work. The City may require
that the certification specifically address the employee's ability to perform
the essential functions of his job, in which case the City will provide the
employee with a list of essential job functions to facilitate this requirement.
If the employee fails to provide a fitness-for-duty certification, return from
leave shall be denied until the certificate is submitted. At the City's
discretion, an employee who fails to provide either a fitness-for- duty
certification or a new medical certification for a serious health condition may
be terminated.
         d)   If the City questions an employee's ability to resume work, it
may, at its own expense, require a medical examination that is job related and
consistent with medical necessity.
         e)   If an employee gives unequivocal notice of intent not to return
to work, the City's obligations under FMLA to maintain health benefits and to
restore the employee to his position cease.
      (9)   Limitations on FMLA leave.
         a)   An employee who is taking FMLA leave for his own serious health
condition shall not engage in outside employment during the period of leave.
         b)   In the case of spouses who are both eligible City employees, FMLA
leave taken by such spouses in any rolling 12-month period shall be limited to
a combined total of 12 weeks if the leave is taken for the birth or placement
of a son or daughter, to care for a parent with a serious health condition or
due to a qualifying exigency. If the leave is taken to care for a covered
service member, or for a combination of caring for a covered service member and
for any other qualifying reason, such spouses are limited to a total of 26
weeks of leave in a single 12-month period.
         c)   Entitlement to FMLA leave for the birth or placement of a child
into an employee's family shall expire at the end of the 12-month period
beginning on the date of birth or placement.
         d)   Any period of leave that extends beyond 12 weeks in a rolling 12-
month period (or 26 weeks in a single 12-month period to care for a covered
service member) is not FMLA eligible. After the 12 week (or 26 week) is
exhausted, an employee is no longer entitled to the protections of the FMLA.
      (10)   Non-discrimination/retaliation.
         a)   The City will not interfere with, restrain or deny the exercise
of any right provided under the FMLA; discharge or discriminate against any
person for opposing any practice made unlawful by the FMLA; or discharge or
discriminate against any person for his involvement in any proceeding under or
related to the FMLA.
         b)   Any employee who believes that the City has violated the
foregoing may file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor or may bring a
private lawsuit against the City. The City requests, however, that employees
bring any such complaints first to the attention of their department head or to
Human Resources to allow for resolution. The FMLA does not affect any federal
or state law prohibiting discrimination, or supersede any state or local law or
collective bargaining agreement that provides greater family or medical leave
rights.
   (b)   Military Family Leave.
      (1)   Purpose. An employee who has a family member ordered to active
military duty, but who does not meet the FMLA criteria for a qualifying
exigency, may be eligible for leave under the Indiana Military Family Leave Act
(IMFLA), which provides eligible employees with an unpaid leave of absence to
spend time with certain family members who are engaged in or called to active
military service.
      (2)   Eligibility. An eligible employee under IMFLA is an employee who:
(i) has been employed by the City for at least 12 months; (ii) has worked at
least 1,500 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave;
and (iii) is the spouse, parent, grandparent, sibling, court-appointed guardian
or custodian (as construed according to the statute) of an individual who is
ordered to active military duty in the Armed Forces of the United States or the
National Guard for a period that exceeds 89 consecutive calendar days.
      (3)   Qualifying leave.  An eligible employee may take up to ten
cumulative working days of unpaid leave per calendar year during one or more of
the following periods:
         a)   The 30 days before active duty orders are in effect;
         b)   A period in which the person ordered to active duty is on leave
while active duty orders are in effect; and/or
         c)   The 30 days after the active duty orders are terminated.
         An employee who is eligible for ten or more days of FMLA leave for a
qualifying exigency that also qualifies as covered leave under the IMFLA shall
not also be eligible for IMFLA leave in the same calendar year.
      (4)   Documentation. An employee requesting leave under this policy must
submit a Military Family Leave Request Form, with a copy of the active duty
orders attached, at least 30 days prior to the beginning date of the leave
(unless the orders are issued less than 30 days before the requested leave
date). The City may require verification of eligibility for the leave. If the
employee does not provide verification of eligibility on a timely basis, the
absence shall be considered unexcused and may lead to disciplinary action.
      (5)   Compensation. Although leave taken under IMFLA is unpaid, the City
requires an employee to substitute paid leave, including PTO/vacation,
compensatory time off and/or floating holidays, for unpaid military leave. Such
leave shall run concurrently with IMFLA leave and shall be counted against the
employee's leave entitlement under the IMFLA. Sick leave may not be substituted
for unpaid leave under the IMFLA.
      (6)   Reinstatement. An eligible employee who takes leave under the IMFLA
and who returns to work before his IMFLA leave entitlement has expired will be
restored to the position the employee held when the leave commenced or to an
otherwise equivalent position with respect to seniority, pay, benefits and
other terms and conditions of employment. The City will maintain health
insurance coverage for an employee who takes IMFLA for the period of such
leave.
      (7)   Non-discrimination. The City will not interfere with, restrain or
deny an employee's exercise of rights under the IMFLA.
   (c)   Other employee-initiated leaves.
      (1)   Leave requests.
         a)   Unpaid leaves of absence may be granted for reasons other than
health, for health reasons that do not meet FMLA criteria, or for individuals
who do not qualify for FMLA leave. Such leave shall not exceed six months in
any 24-month period. All leave requests must be in writing.
         b)   Leave requests of two consecutive calendar weeks or less may be
approved by the department head, who may require that all applicable accrued
paid leave be exhausted by an employee before unpaid leave commences.
         c)   Requests for leave of longer than two weeks must be submitted to
the department head. The department head will put the request on the Board of
Public Works and Safety agenda and will make a recommendation to the Board. The
employee may also speak on his own behalf at the Board meeting. All applicable
accrued paid leave must be exhausted prior to requesting unpaid leave of more
than two consecutive weeks in length.
         d)   Every leave not mandated by state or federal law is contingent
upon the ability of the City to maintain adequate staffing during an employee's
absence.
      (2)   Benefits while on leave.
         a)   If an employee is on unpaid leave less than two full pay periods
(four weeks) under this policy, the City will continue to pay its designated
portion of the employee (and family, if applicable) health insurance premium.
The remaining portion will be paid by the employee. Beginning with the third
consecutive pay period of unpaid leave, the employee will be required to pay
100% of required employee and employer insurance premiums. (An employee will
not be allowed to circumvent the requirement of paying his entire health
insurance premium by returning to work in the middle of a leave period.) All
bi-weekly premiums are due on payday unless alternate arrangements are made
with the Controller’s office.
         b)   The City will continue to pay premiums for group term life
insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance and short-term
disability insurance (civilian employees only) during the leave of absence.
         c)   Optional long- term disability payments (civilian employees only)
must be paid by the employee on a bi-weekly basis. All bi-weekly premiums are
due on payday unless alternate arrangements are made with the Controller’s
office.
         d)   A civilian employee shall not accrue PTO for any bi-weekly pay
period during which the employee is paid for fewer than 75 hours (80 hours for
golf course employees).
         e)   An employee will not receive holiday pay while he is on unpaid
leave.
         f)   PERF service credit during a leave of absence is calculated
according to PERF regulations.
      (3)   Returning from leave. Provided an employee returns to work by his
scheduled return date, no further documentation or notification is necessary,
unless the leave is for medical reasons. In that case, the employee's physician
must release the employee to return to work. Leave extensions must be granted
by the department head or the Board of Public Works and Safety, as outlined
above, based upon the total length of the leave requested and/or taken.
   (d)   Disciplinary leave. An employee who is placed on unpaid leave for
disciplinary reasons, or pending resolution of criminal charges shall accrue
and/or receive benefits as outlined above for employee-initiated leave. Except,
however, that benefits for sworn police officers and firefighters shall be
consistent with all requirements of Indiana Code.
(`91 Code, § 2-47) (Ord. D-398, § (j), 3-5-84; Ord. D-1490-00, 11-20-00; Ord.

§ 2-54 Military Leave.
   (a)   It is the City's intent to comply at all times with applicable Federal
and State law as it pertains to military leave, including, but not limited to,
the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).
   (b)   Any City employee who is a member, as that term is defined in I.C.,
10-16-7-2, of the Indiana National Guard or a reserve component of the U.S.
Armed Forces, is entitled to receive up to 15 consecutive or nonconsecutive
eight-hour days of military leave annually, without loss of time or pay, for
such time as the employee is on Indiana National Guard or reserve component
training or duty pursuant to appropriate and authorized military orders. Such
time away from the job shall not be charged against the employee’s PTO/vacation
allowance.
   (c)   Any City employee who is a member, as that term is defined in I.C.,
10-16-7-2, of the Indiana National Guard shall also be entitled to receive an
unpaid leave of absence for the total number of days that he is on state active
duty pursuant to I.C., 10-16-7-7. Such an employee may elect to substitute paid
leave (excluding sick and/or catastrophic leave) for any portion of this unpaid
leave time.
   (d)   USERRA may provide an employee with additional rights as regards
unpaid military leave and job reinstatement. In general, USERRA covers all
categories of military training and service, including duty performed on a
voluntary or involuntary basis, in time of peace or war. A complete list of
current employee rights and obligations under USERRA is available from Human
Resources. An employee who exercises rights provided by USERRA shall not be
discriminated or retaliated against in any matter of employment.
   (e)   The City shall pay 100% of the employer and employee contributions for
dependent (spouse and child(ren)) health insurance coverage during a period of
active duty, other than active duty for training, if the dependents are covered
under the City plan.
   (f)   The City may, in its sole discretion, elect to pay the difference
between an employee's active duty pay and the employee's regular City salary or
wages, whether the employee's military leave is taken pursuant to Indiana law
and/or USERRA, whenever the employee is ordered to active duty other than
active duty for training. Supplemental pay, if provided, shall be subject to
the following conditions:
      (1)   Supplemental pay will be determined by comparing gross military pay
to gross City pay (excluding overtime). If the City's pay is greater, the
supplement shall be the difference between the two. If the City's pay is less
than or equal to military pay, there shall be no supplement.
      (2)   Hardship Duty/Imminent Danger Pay and Family Separation Allowance
shall not be included in military gross pay for purposes of calculating
supplemental pay.
      (3)   To determine gross military pay, the employee is required to submit
a military Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) at the time he reports for active
duty, at the time he is released from active duty and at any time between if
military pay changes. If military pay increases during the period of active
duty and a new LES is not submitted to the City, the employee shall, upon
return from active duty, be required to repay the City for any overpayment of
supplemental pay.

§ 2-55 Bereavement Leave.
   (a)   Up to three days (22.5 hours) of paid leave may, at the department
head's discretion, be granted per calendar year for a death that occurs in a
full-time employee's immediate family. This leave cannot be accumulated or
carried forward to the following year.
An employee in need of more than three days for bereavement must use PTO or
compensatory time, or seek approval for additional unpaid leave through his
department head, who shall review each request on a case-by-case basis.
   (b)   Immediate family is defined as father, mother, husband, wife, brother,
sister, child, grandchild or grandparent. Immediate family also includes a
mother or father-in-law, son or daughter-in-law, sister or brother-in-law,
grandparent-in-law, as well as step-mother or father, children, brother or
sister, grandparents or grandchildren. In addition, a maximum of one of the
three bereavement days (7.5 hours) each year can be used for an aunt, uncle or
cousin (including step- or in-law relationships).
   (c)   An eligible employee must notify his supervisor of the death and
request bereavement leave. The City reserves the right to require
documentation.

§ 2-56 Jury Duty/Court Appearances.  
   (a)   Jury duty.
      (1)   Time off shall be granted to any full-time employee who is required
to serve on a petit jury or a grand jury during his or her scheduled work day.
The employee shall be paid his regular salary or wage for such court time.
      (2)   The employee shall present a copy of the summons for jury duty to
his supervisor immediately upon receipt. If the employee is required to report
for jury selection or is selected for jury duty, the employee shall provide an
attendance slip from the court. The attendance slip shall be submitted to the
Payroll Department with the employee's time sheet.
      (3)   An employee shall not waive his right to compensation from any
court. An employee who receives compensation for jury duty shall remit such
payment to the Controller’s office. Any payments made to the employee by the
court for expenses (e.g., mileage or meals) may be retained by the employee.
      (4)   An employee released from jury service during normal working hours
shall report to his work site whenever practical.
   (b)   Other court appearances.
      (1)   Paid time off shall be granted to any full-time employee who is
required to appear in court under subpoena (as a witness), to a maximum of one
day per calendar year, as long as the employee is not acting as an employee
and/or representative of another organization at the time of the appearance.
      (2)   An employee who is scheduled to appear in court for personal
business must use his PTO unless the employee is the victim in a criminal
proceeding in which case paid time off shall be granted to a maximum of three
days per calendar year.
      (3)   For all court appearances, the employee shall provide his
supervisor with a copy of the subpoena or notice of proceedings as soon as
possible. After each appearance, the employee must provide documentation from
the court as to the actual dates and times of attendance, which documentation
shall be submitted to the Payroll Department with the employee's time sheet.
      (4)   Court time will also be paid if the employee is participating in a
proceeding pertaining to his employment with the City. Time off under these
circumstances shall be limited only by the legal requirements of the City.

§ 2-57 Limited Operations Days.
   (a)   The Mayor may declare the City to be in limited operations mode for
general business purposes due to weather, special events, or the general
health, safety and welfare of City employees. When the City is in limited
operations mode, essential public safety services will continue uninterrupted,
but some non-essential services may be curtailed.
   (b)   All City employees shall be designated by their department heads as
either "essential" or "non-essential" based on their job position. Such
designations may change from time to time, depending upon the particular
circumstances of each situation. The designation of a job position as
"essential" or "non-essential" bears no relationship to the value to the City
of that job position or of the individual who holds it. It is strictly a
function of whether the job position involves tasks that directly or
substantially impact public health or safety, which tasks must be performed
regardless of circumstances.
   (c)   Whenever the Mayor declares the City to be in limited operations mode
for general business purposes due to weather, special events or the general
health, safety and welfare of City employees, "essential" employees are
expected to report for duty at their regularly scheduled time, or as requested
by their supervisors. Failure to do so mayresult in disciplinary action. They
will receive their regular rate of pay, including overtime, if applicable.
   (d)   A "non-essential" civilian employee who is not specifically called in
to work is expected to use his or her best judgment as to whether it is safe to
report to work on a day the City is in limited operations mode. An employee who
elects not to report to work shall not be penalized in any way, but shall be
charged PTO time for the day, or for any part of the day not worked as
scheduled. If the employee has no time in his PTO bank, the day shall be
unpaid.

§ 2-58 Tuition Reimbursement.
   (a)   A tuition reimbursement program is established for full-time City
employees who:
      (1)   Are employed by the City both one year prior to the beginning of
the course for which tuition reimbursement is requested and at the time the
final request for reimbursement is made.
      (2)   Have been subject to no disciplinary probation, demotion or
suspension within the 90 days prior to the beginning date of the course for
which tuition reimbursement is requested.
   (b)   The City offers tuition reimbursement for:
      (1)   Courses offered through a degree-granting institution that is
accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association
of Colleges and Schools or an equivalent regional accreditor, as recognized by
the United States Department of Education and the Council on Higher Education
Accreditation.
      (2)   No more than two courses in progress at any given time.
      (3)   Courses that will maintain or improve job related skills, and are
related to an employee's current position or potential career path within the
City of Carmel. The employee's director shall initially determine whether an
employee is eligible for tuition reimbursement and whether a particular course
is job-related, subject to final approval by the Director of Human Resources.
Even if a particular course is required for a job-related major, the course
itself may not be job-related (i.e., may not eligible for reimbursement).
   (c)   The City will not provide reimbursement for courses that:
      (1)   Offer no academic subject matter (e.g., courses whose purpose is to
help students prepare for an exam); or
      (2)   Are provided by an intermediary institution that does not grant
degrees; or
      (3)   Enable students to receive credit for life experience without
providing subject matter content or requiring a competency-based assessment; or
      (4)   Are audited; or
      (5)   Will be paid or reimbursed by any other source, including, but not
limited to, scholarships, grants or tuition assistance programs offered by
other civilian or military employers.
   (d)   Terms of tuition reimbursement are as follows:
      (1)   The employee must submit a separate application form for each
course for which reimbursement is requested, which application must be approved
by the City before the course commences.
      (2)   Tuition reimbursement will be made after the course is completed
and a grade received.
      (3)   Reimbursement amounts shall be:
         a)   Eighty percent of the eligible cost of the course for a final
grade no lower than "B-";
         b)   Fifty percent of the eligible cost of the course for a final
grade of no higher than a "C+" and no lower than "C-" or "Pass" in a Pass/Fail
course;
         c)   No reimbursement for a final grade lower than "C-" or a "Fail",
regardless of circumstances;
         d)   No reimbursement for an Incomplete (until the coursework is
complete) or for a Withdrawal, regardless of circumstances,
      (4)   Tuition reimbursement applies only to course tuition, books,
distance education fees and content-specific fees (e.g., lab fees, program
fees, technology fees, fees for required supplies and materials, etc.).
      (5)   Enrollment and admission fees, orientation fees, campus fees,
student activity fees, library fees, parking fees, student health fees, student
union fees, athletic fees, graduation fees and other fees not directly related
to a particular course do not qualify for reimbursement.
      (6)   Combined tuition reimbursement payments for courses ending in any
given year shall not exceed $6,500 per employee.
   (e)   The following additional guidelines will apply to eligible schools
that charge a flat rate for all courses taken during a specified term.
      (1)   The City will not make reimbursement until the end of the term,
regardless of when a specific course is completed.
      (2)   An employee is expected to take the minimum number of hours
specified by the school for the term, including both reimbursable courses and
non-job-related courses that are not eligible for reimbursement. If the
employee takes fewer than the minimum number of hours, reimbursement
calculations will nonetheless be based on the minimum. If the employee takes
the minimum number of hours or more, reimbursement calculations will be based
on actual hours.
      (3)   The employee must submit documentation of enrollment and completion
for all courses taken during the term, regardless of whether they are
reimbursable.
   (f)   Other program requirements include:
      (1)   No provision of the program authorizes an employee to enroll in a
course that meets or that will require travel time during the employee's
regular scheduled work hours. Employees are expected to schedule courses that
meet outside of work hours.
      (2)   Any employee who is reimbursed for tuition under this policy is
expected to remain with the City as a full-time employee for a minimum of one
year after final reimbursement is made. To the extent permitted by law, an
employee who fails to do so shall be required to refund the money paid by the
City for each course completed less than a year before full-time employment
terminates. The repayment requirement will be waived if the employee is unable
to work for health reasons or if the City terminates employment for reasons
unrelated to performance.
      (3)   The employee is responsible for paying all taxes due on tuition
reimbursement benefits. Any reimbursement in excess of the maximum amount
established by federal law ($5,250 as of 2019) shall be reported on the
employee's W-2 form as taxable income.

the start of PLDL. If the employee meets FMLA eligibility during PLDL, they
will be placed on FMLA at that time.
   (f)   If the employee requires additional recovery time after the PLDL has

characteristics of the items (e.g. land, buildings, improvements other than
buildings, machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures.
   Tangible Assets. An asset that can be observed by one or more of the
physical senses is referred to as a tangible asset.

and retained by the City’s Department of Law. These statements shall be made
available to the public only as required by Indiana’s Access to Public Records
Act (I.C., 5-14-3), or final court order.
   (h)   Complaints, investigations, hearings and enforcement.
      (1)   Any elected official, officer, employee, or Carmel citizen may file
a complaint alleging a violation of this section. If such complaint is filed by
or against a member of the Board, that member is disqualified from
participating in any proceedings that may arise from the complaint. If the
complainant is a City employee, he or she shall follow all applicable
department rules, regulations and chain-of-command in filing his/her complaint,
unless it is not reasonably possible or appropriate to do so.
      (2)   The complaint shall be in writing and signed by the complainant
under oath and the penalties of perjury. The complaint shall state the nature
of the alleged violation(s), the date(s), time and place of each occurrence,
and the person(s) charged with the violation(s). The complaint shall be filed
with the Secretary, who shall provide a copy to the person charged with the
violation within seven days. The complainant shall provide the Secretary with
all available documentation and other evidence supporting the allegations set
forth in the complaint. A copy of all such documentation shall be provided to
the person charged with the violation within seven days. All complaints and all
records pertaining thereto shall be subject to disclosure only as required by
Indiana's Access to Public Records Act (I.C., 5-14-3) or final court order.
      (3)   Within 45 days after the date of his/her receipt of a complaint,
but no less than 15 days after such date, the Secretary shall conduct an
investigation into the allegations contained therein. The Secretary
may request that the board extend the time for the completion of such
investigation. If the Board determines that such an extension is necessary or
desirable and would not be prejudicial to the person charged with the
violation, the Board shall grant the extension. If the Board determines that
the investigation must be completed in a shorter period of time in order to
avoid prejudice or irreparable harm to the person charged with the violation,
the Board shall order the Secretary to complete the investigation in a shorter
period of time, and the Secretary shall comply.
      (4)   If the Secretary determines, after reasonable investigation, that
there are no reasonable grounds to believe that an alleged violation of this
section has occurred, or that the complaint or a portion thereof is otherwise
frivolous, the Secretary shall dismiss the complaint or that portion thereof.
If the Secretary dismisses all or part of the complaint, he/she shall do so in
writing, setting forth the facts and the provisions of law upon which the
dismissal is based, and provide copies of the written dismissal to the
complainant, to the person charged with the violation and to the Board. The
complainant shall have the right to appeal the decision of the Secretary to the
Board, who may uphold, modify or reject the Secretary's decision. To the extent
the Secretary's decision is not upheld by the Board, a hearing will be held
before the Board on the remaining allegations contained in the complaint. If
the complaint or any portion thereof is so dismissed, the record pertaining to
the dismissed charge(s) shall remain confidential unless the person against
whom the complaint was made requests disclosure, or as otherwise required by
applicable law or final court order.
      (5)   A hearing shall then be held thereon unless the complaint is
resolved at a prehearing conference. A prehearing conference may be held at the
request of the Secretary, the complainant or the person accused. Any proposed
prehearing resolution of the complaint or of any portion thereof must be
approved by the Board, the complainant and the person accused, and must conform
to the Board's rules and applicable law. Absent such approval and conformance,
the proposed prehearing resolution shall be null and void.
      (6)   Subject to the above, within 30 days from the date the Secretary
refers a complaint to the Board for hearing, the Board shall conduct a public
hearing on the remaining allegation(s) set forth in the complaint. Upon the
request of the person accused, or with his/her consent, this hearing may be
continued for an additional period or periods of time not to exceed a total of
45 additional days.
      (7)   At the hearing, the person accused and the complainant shall each
be entitled to be represented by counsel to present exhibits and other
evidence, to cross-examine witnesses, and to argue the law and the facts to the
Board. The accused shall not be required to present any evidence at this
hearing, and the entire burden of proof and persuasion shall remain on the
complainant at all times to prove the truth of the allegations contained in the
complaint by a preponderance of the evidence. The hearing shall be tape-
recorded, and all witnesses shall be sworn. The Board is authorized to utilize
the investigative powers set forth in I.C., 36-4-6-21(b) in furtherance of its
obligations hereunder.
      (8)   After the hearing is closed, the Board shall issue a written
decision stating its opinion as to whether the ordinance has been violated, and
setting forth its specific findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which
its decision is based. A copy of such determination shall be delivered to the
complainant, to the person accused and to the Mayor within 15 business days
from the date the hearing is closed. This written determination shall
constitute a public record.
      (9)   If the Board determines that an elected official, officer or
employee has violated this section, the Board shall provide a copy of its
written decision, as well as its written recommendations as to the proper
resolution of the matter, to the Mayor for his/her consideration. The Board's
written recommendations shall be advisory or deliberative expressions of
opinion communicated only for the purpose of decision-making, and not subject
to mandatory disclosure under Indiana's Access To Public Records Act.
      (10)   Any violation of this section by an officer or employee shall be
cause for such disciplinary action as may be deemed necessary and proper by the
Mayor, consistent with the City's personnel ordinances and rules. The Mayor is
not bound by the Board's determination and may conduct his/her own
investigation prior to imposing discipline on any officer or employee under his
authority and/or control. A written response outlining any action taken by the
Mayor as a result of the recommendation of the Board shall be provided to the
Board by the Mayor within 30 calendar days after receipt of the Board's written
decision and recommendations. Notwithstanding the above, this section shall not
derogate from employee rights under any City or agency labor agreements or
personnel ordinances or rules. Any final adverse employment action taken or
monetary fine imposed on any officer or employee pursuant to this section shall
be subject to judicial review as provided by applicable law.
   (i)   False complaint. Any person who files a complaint or testifies against
any elected official, officer or employee pursuant to this section in bad
faith, with reckless disregard for the truth and/or by knowingly providing
false information shall be subject to discipline, up to and including
termination, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the City, the
agency and applicable law. Such discipline does not foreclose the elected
official, officer or employee from also pursuing private civil remedies against
such person.
   (j)   Harassment. No elected official, officer or employee shall harass or
otherwise take any adverse action against any person merely because such person
filed a good faith complaint pursuant to this section.
   (k)   Enforcement. Any elected official, officer or employee who is found by
the Carmel City Court to have failed to timely file a Statement of Economic
Interests as required by this section shall be subject to a fine of not less
than $50 nor more than $500 for each month or portion thereof, beginning with
the month of March in the applicable calendar year, during which the Statement
is delinquent, in addition to the other provisions of this section.
   (l)   Record retention. All Statements of Economic Interests, complaints,
hearing documents, and other public records of the Board shall be retained for
the greater of five years or the minimum period of time required by applicable
law.

in acquiring and disposing of property.
   (d)   Historic districts, conservation districts and guidelines.
      (1)   Historic districts. All recommendations for the establishment of a
historic district shall be in the form of a written report and must be based on
the criteria outlined in this section. A recommendation for establishing a
historic district may be initiated from either of the following two sources:
         a)   Based on its survey, the Commission may draw and submit historic
district maps for City Council approval; or
         b)   Owners of property in fee simple, wishing to establish a historic
district which includes their property, may petition the Commission to consider
drawing and submitting a map or maps of said property to the City Council for
its approval. The Commission may establish in its rules criteria to be met
before it considers a petition.
      (2)   Conservation districts.
         a)   The Commission may recommend, and the City Council may provide,
that the establishment of a historic district shall occur in two phases. The
first phase, which continues for a period of three years from the date the
ordinance is adopted, shall be a Certificate of Appropriateness required for
the following activities:
            i.   The demolition of any building;
            ii.   The moving of any building; or
            iii.   Any new construction of a principal building or accessory
building or structure subject to view from a public way.
         b)   At the expiration of the initial three year period, the first
phase of a conservation district continues and the second phase does not become
effective if a majority of the property owners in the district object to the
Commission, in writing, to the requirement that certificates of appropriateness
be issued for the following activities:
            i.   A conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of historic
buildings by additions, construction, alteration, or maintenance involving
exterior color changes;
            ii.   A change in walls and fences or construction of walls and
fences, if along public ways;
            iii.   A conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of non-
historic buildings subject to view from a public way by additions
reconstruction, alteration, or maintenance involving exterior color change.
         c)   The objections of a majority of the property owners must be
received by the Commission not earlier than 180 days, or later than 60 days
before the third anniversary of the adoption of the ordinance.
      (3)   Historic district maps. In order to establish a historic district,
the Commission shall first prepare a map describing the district in accordance
with the following:
         a)   The map shall be based on a survey conducted by the Commission
which identifies historic buildings, structures, and sites located within the
City;
         b)   A district may be limited to the boundaries of a property
containing a single building, structure, or site;
         c)   The map may divide the district into primary and secondary areas
as follows:
            i.   Primary area: The principal area of historic and architectural
significance; and
            ii.   Secondary area: An area adjacent to a primary area which has
a visual relationship to the primary area and could affect the preservation of
the primary area. The purpose of designating a secondary area is to assure its
compatibility and harmony with an adjacent primary area.
      (4)   Classification and designation. The Commission shall classify and
designate on the map all buildings, structures and sites within each historic
district described on the map. Buildings, structures, and sites shall be
classified as historic or non-historic. Historic buildings, structures, and
sites shall possess identified historic or architectural merit of a degree
warranting their preservation. The Commission shall further classify and
designate all buildings and structures within a proposed historic district as
follows:
         a)   Outstanding;
         b)   Notable; or
         c)   Contributing.
      (5)   Non-classified sites. Non-historic buildings, structures, and sites
are those not classified on the map as historic. In lieu of other
classifications, the Commission may devise its own system of further
classification of historic buildings, structures, and sites.
      (6)   Proposed standards. Along with the proposed historic district map,
the Commission shall adopt proposed design and architectural standards for the
areas and sites within the proposed historic district map.
      (7)   Council approval. Before a historic district is established and the
building classifications take effect, the map setting forth the district's
boundaries, proposed standards, and building classifications shall be submitted
to and approved in an ordinance by the Carmel City Council.
      (8)   Notice. The Commission shall provide notice to the general public
of the public meeting where the presentation of a proposed historic district
map to the Carmel City Council (the "Presentation Meeting") will take place.
         a)   A legal notice of the Presentation Meeting shall be prepared by
the Commission and advertised in a daily newspaper of general circulation in
Hamilton County, not less than 25 days prior to the meeting, not including the
date of the meeting itself. For purposes of this section, a daily newspaper of
general circulation in the county would include the Indianapolis Star. The
Commission shall provide a copy of an affidavit from the publisher attesting to
the publication of the Notice to the President of the Carmel City Council prior
to the Presentation Meeting.
         b)   The Commission shall also serve notice of the Presentation
Meeting to owners of property within, adjoining and abutting the proposed
historic district, including property across a public right-of-way. Such
notification shall be by certified mail with return receipts requested, to the
address listed on tax rolls for the owner(s) of the property. Notification must
be sent not less than 25 days prior to the Presentation Meeting, and must
include the location, date, time, and place for the Presentation Meeting, and
include a description of purpose of the presentation. The Commission shall be
responsible for obtaining a certified list of the names and current addresses
of property owners within, adjoining and abutting the proposed historic
district from the records on file in the office of the Hamilton County Auditor
in Noblesville, Indiana. Whenever any adjoining or abutting property lies
across the county line, then the Commission shall be responsible for obtaining
a certified list of the names and current addresses of such adjoining and
abutting property owners from the records on file in the office of the Boone
County Auditor or Marion County Auditor, as the case may be.
         c)   The Commission shall also serve notice to the general public of
the Presentation Meeting by placing signs within and along the perimeter of the
proposed historic district. At least four signs shall be placed for every
square mile of area contained within the proposed historic district. The signs
shall be placed in locations at the discretion of the Commission Administrator,
but such locations should be chosen to maximize the opportunities for viewing
by the general public. The signs shall be placed no less than 25 days prior to
the Presentation Meeting and removed no more than three days after such
meeting.
      (9)   Recording. The map establishing boundaries of a historic district
shall be recorded in the Office of the Hamilton County Recorder.
   (e)   Interim protection.
      (1)   Designation. When submitting a map to the Carmel City Council under
division (d) above, the Commission may declare one or more buildings or
structures that are classified and designated as historic on the map to be
under interim protection.
      (2)   Written notice. Not more than two working days after declaring a
building, structure, or site to be under interim protection under this section,
the Commission shall, by personal delivery or first class mail, provide the

under subsection (1) remains under interim protection until the map is:
         a)   Submitted to; and
         b)   Approved in an ordinance by the Carmel City Council.
      (4)   Limitations. While a building, structure, or site is under interim
protection under this section:
         a)   The building, structure, or site shall not be demolished or
moved; and
         b)   The exterior appearance of the building, structure, or site shall
not be conspicuously changed by:
            i.   Addition;
            ii.   Reconstruction; or
            iii.   Alteration.
      (5)   Pending approval of Certificate of Appropriateness. The Commission
may approve a Certificate of Appropriateness at any time during the period of
interim protection, provided the proposed change meets the criteria for
considering effect of actions on historic buildings in division (f)(4) below
and any proposed preservation guidelines prepared for the building, structure,
or site. The Certificate of Appropriateness shall have no effect, and no action
may be taken pursuant thereto, unless the map including the building, structure
or site is approved by the City Council.
   (f)   Certificate of Appropriateness.
      (1)   Requirement. A Certificate of Appropriateness ("COA") must be
issued by the Commission before a permit is issued for, or work has begun on
any of the following:
         a)   Within all areas of a historic district:
            i.   The demolition of any building or structure;
            ii.   The moving of any building or structure; or
            iii.   The conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of any

         c)   Within a conservation district:
            i.   The moving of any building;
            ii.   The demolition of any building; or
            iii.   The new construction of a principal building or accessory
building or structure subject to view from a public way.
      (2)   Application for Certificates of Appropriateness. An application for
a COA shall be made in the office of the Commission or its designee on forms
provided by that office. All applications shall be subject to the rules and
requirements established by the Commission. Rules may include, but are not
limited to, filing deadlines and application requirements such as sketches,
drawings, photographs, descriptions, or other information which the Commission
requires to make a decision.
      (3)   Approval or denial of Certificates of Appropriateness. The
Commission may approve or deny COAs for any actions covered by this title. If
an application for a COA is approved by the Commission, or is not acted on by
the Commission within 30 days after it is filed, a COA shall be issued. The
Commission may grant an extension of the 30-day limit if the applicant agrees
to it. The Commission shall report its findings and the reasons for its
decision in written form, and supply the applicant with a copy of its report,
and of the right to appeal within seven days of the adoption of the report. A
copy of the COA shall be submitted with the application for a building or
demolition permit. No building or demolition permit shall be issued unless a
copy of the COA is provided by the applicant with the application.
      (4)   Criteria. The Commission, in considering the appropriateness of any
reconstruction, alteration, maintenance, or moving of a historic building,
structure, site or any part of or appurtenance to such building or structure,
including walls, fences, light fixtures, steps, paving, and signs shall require
that such work be done in a manner that will preserve the historical and
architectural character of the building, structure, or appurtenance. In
considering historic and architectural character, the Commission shall
consider, among other things, the following:
         a)   Purposes of this title;
         b)   Historical and architectural value and significance of the
building, structure, site or appurtenance;
         c)   Compatibility and significance of additions, alterations,
details, materials, or other non-original elements which may be of a different
style and construction date than the original;
         d)   The texture, material, color, style, and detailing of the
building, structure, site or appurtenance;
         e)   The continued preservation and protection of original or
otherwise significant structure, material, and ornamentation;
         f)   The relationship of buildings, structures, appurtenances, or
architectural features similar to one within the same historic district
including for primary areas, visual compatibility as defined in division (h)(2)
below; and
         g)   The position of the building or structure in relation to the
street, public right-of-way and to other buildings and structures.
      (5)   Procedure for demolition upon denial of a Certificate of
Appropriateness.
         a)   The purpose of this section is to preserve historic buildings
that are important to the education, culture, traditions, and economic values
of the City and to afford the City, historical organizations, property owners,
and other interested persons the opportunity to acquire or to arrange for the
preservation of these buildings;
         b)   If the Commission denies the issuance of a Certificate of
Appropriateness for the demolition of a building, structure, or site, a
demolition permit may be issued by other agencies and a building, structure, or
site may be demolished, but only after the property owner has demonstrated to
the Commission that the historic building, structure, or site is incapable of
earning any economic return on its value, as appraised by a licensed real
estate appraiser.
         c)   Notice of the proposed demolition must be given for a period
fixed by the Commission, based on the Commission's classification on the
approved map, but not less than 60 days nor more than one year. Notice must be
posted on the premises of the building or structure proposed for demolition in
a location clearly visible from the street. In addition, notice must be
published in a newspaper of general local circulation at least three times
before demolition, with the first publication not more than 15 days after the
application for a permit to demolish is filed, and the final publication at
least 15 days before the date of the permit.
         d)   The Commission may approve a Certificate of Appropriateness at
any time during the notice period under subsection (f)(3) above. If the
Certificate of Appropriateness is approved, a demolition permit shall be issued
without further delay and demolition may proceed.
   (g)   Staff approvals.
      (1)   Authority. The Commission may authorize the staff of the
Commission, on behalf of the Commission, to grant or deny an application for a
COA.
      (2)   Rules. The Commission shall specify by rule the types of
applications for COA that the staff of the Commission is authorized to grant or
deny. The staff may not be authorized to grant or deny an application for a COA
for the following:
         a)   The demolition of a building, structure, or site;
         b)   The moving of a building or structure;
         c)   The construction of an addition to a building or structure; or
         d)   The construction of a new building or structure.
   (h)   Visual compatibility.
      (1)   New construction, contemporary design, and non-historic buildings.
Such buildings shall preserve and encourage the integrity of historic
buildings, structures, sites, monuments, streetscapes, and neighborhoods and
ensure their compatibility with any new work. The construction of a new
building or structure, and the moving, reconstruction, alteration, color
change, major maintenance, or repair conspicuously affecting the external
appearance of any non-historic building, structure, or appurtenance within the
primary area shall be generally of a design, form, proportion, mass,
configuration, building material, texture, color, and location on a lot
compatible with other buildings in the historic district and with places to
which it is visually related.
      (2)   Criteria for considering visual compatibility within historic
primary areas.  Within the primary area of a historic district, new buildings,
structures, as well as buildings, structures, and appurtenances that are moved,
reconstructed, materially altered, repaired, or changed in color, shall be
visually compatible with buildings and places to which they are visually
related generally in terms of the following visual compatibility factors:
         a)   Height. The height of proposed buildings must be visually
compatible with adjacent buildings;
         b)   Proportion of building's front facade. The relationship of the
width of a building to the height of the front elevation must be visually
compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related;
         c)   Proportion of openings within the facility. The relationship of
the width of the windows to the height of windows in a building must be
visually compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually
related;
         d)   Relationship of solids to voids in front facades. The
relationship of solids to voids in the front facade of a building must be
visually compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually
related;
         e)   Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The relationship of a
building to the open space between it and adjoining buildings must be visually
compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related;
         f)   Rhythm of entrances and porch projections. The relationship of
entrances and porch projections of a building to sidewalks must be visually
compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related;
         g)   Relationship of materials, texture, and color. The relationship
of the materials, texture, and color of the facade of a building must be
visually compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually
related;
         h)   Roof shapes. The roof shape of a building must be visually
compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related;
         i)   Wall of continuity.  Appurtenances of a building or site, such as
walls, wrought iron fences, evergreen landscape masses, and building facades,
must form cohesive walls of enclosure along the street if necessary to ensure
visual compatibility for the buildings and places to which it is visually
related;
         j)   Scale of the building. The size of a building, and the building
mass of a building in relation to open spaces, windows, door openings, porches,
and balconies must be visually compatible with the buildings and places to
which it is visually related;
         k)   Directional expression of front elevation. A building must be
visually compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually
related in its directional character, including vertical character, horizontal
character, or non-directional character.
   (i)   Preservation of historical and architectural character upon alteration
or relocation mandated.
      (1)   Preservation. A historic building or structure or any part of or
appurtenance to such a building or structure, including stone walls, fences,
light fixtures, steps, paving, and signs may be moved, reconstructed, altered,
or maintained only in a manner that will preserve the historical and
architectural character of the building, structure, or appurtenance.
      (2)   Relocation. A historic building may be relocated to another site
only if it is shown that preservation on its current site is inconsistent with
subsection (1).
   (j)   Maintenance.
      (1)   Application of requirements. Historic buildings, structures, and
sites shall be maintained to meet the applicable requirements established under
I.C. 36-7-11-1, et seq., for buildings generally so as to prevent the loss of
historic material and the deterioration of important character defining details
and features.
      (2)   Ordinary repairs and maintenance. Nothing in this section shall be

prior to the beginning of the meeting at which the citizen wishes to speak. The
Request shall include the person’s name, address, city, state, zip code,

will be held as a separate agenda item at that meeting of the Common Council.
Each speaker shall be limited to three (3) minutes. No speaker shall be
permitted to cede their three (3) minute allotment to another speaker. Each
speaker shall speak from the podium and shall state his or her name for the
record. At the request of a Council Member or the Mayor, the Council may
suspend the three minute time limit for an entire meeting, or, in the
alternative, grant an individual speaker an additional three (3) minutes of
speaking time by a simple majority vote. If more than one Request is made, the

resident in violation of this Section.

in writing, shall state thereon the effective date of the denial/revocation and
the reason for same, and shall be served by U.S. certified mail or by personal
service on vendor at vendor's address as contained in the application.
   (3)   Any vendor, within 20 days from the date on which notice of such
license and/or identification card denial or revocation notice is served
thereon, may by written request made and delivered to the Chief of Police

and Safety ("Board"). If a timely appeal is not made, the decision of the Chief
of Police is final. If a timely appeal is made, the Board shall hear the appeal
at a public hearing which shall begin no more than 20 days from the date of the
receipt of the appeal request by the Chief of Police. The Board shall issue its
written decision on the appeal no more than 10 days from the ending date of the
hearing thereon, which Board decision shall be final. (Ord. D-480, § 4.01, 5-5-
86; Ord. D-1034, 12-6-93; Ord. D-1753-05, 8-15-05)
      (4)   No application, license or identification card fees shall be
returned or refunded upon the revocation of a license and/or identification
card issued pursuant to this Section, all such monies being deemed forfeited.

   (e)   Penalties.
      (1)   Any person who engages in door-to-door solicitation in violation of
this Section shall be subject to a fine of $400 for each such violation, each
day in which said violation occurs constituting a new offense.

against any vendor and/or any employee or agent thereof in any court of
competent jurisdiction.

one remedy shall not preclude the pursuit of others under this section or
otherwise.

extent permitted by law, entitle the City to collect from the violator the
City's attorney fees, court costs, litigation expenses, and all other
reasonable costs and expenses incurred in obtaining a restraining order and/or
any other enforcement remedies against same. (Ord. D-480, § 5.01, 5-5-86; Ord.
D-1034, 12-6-93; Ord. D-1753-05, 8-15-05)
   (f)   Severability clause. If any paragraph, sentence or other part of this
Section shall, for any reason, be adjudged invalid by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the
remainder of this section, but shall be confined in its operation to the
paragraph, sentence or other part thereof which is directly involved in the
controversy in which such judgment is rendered. (Ord. D-1034, § 8, 12-6-93;
Ord. D-1753-05, 8-15-05)
   (g)   Effect and scope. The adoption of this Section by the City, and the
licensing of any vendor hereunder, shall not constitute an endorsement or
approval of the cause, goods, property and/or services represented or provided
by, nor the product of any person while engaged in door-to-door solicitation
within the City’s corporate limits or otherwise. (Ord. D-1206, 5-6-96; Ord. D-

deemed to have ended.
   (r)   In addition to the permit/location permit suspension and/or revocation
provisions contained elsewhere in this section, the Board may suspend or revoke
any permit/location permit on account of the permit holder's serious or
repeated violations of law, for his/her violation of the civil rights of any
person, if the City becomes aware of circumstances which indicate that the use
of a private traffic control officer at a location has created one or more of
the permit non-approval factors set forth in subsection (f)(2) above, or for
any violation of this section. No such permit/location permit revocation shall
take place hereunder without first affording the permit holder an opportunity
to contest such revocation at a public hearing before the Board and the

the Committee shall proceed to hear from all interested persons or entities, in
addition to any applicants or potential applicants.
   (n)   Factors governing the evaluation of the application.  In making a
determination hereunder on any Franchise application, the Franchise
Coordinators shall base such determination on the following factors:
      (1)   The quality of the service which the applicant promises and of
which the applicant is capable.
      (2)   Whether the applicant has the financial, technical and legal
qualifications to provide cable service.

interest, considering its immediate and future effect on the public ways and
private property that would be used by the cable system, including the extent
to which the proposed system installation or maintenance would require the
replacement or disruption of property, public services, or the use of the
public ways; the effect of granting a Franchise on the availability of
sufficient cable service to meet the cable-related needs and interests of the
community; and the comparative superiority or inferiority of competing
applications, if any.
      (11)   The effect on the ability of existing franchisees to perform their
obligations under their Franchise contracts.
      (12)   The technical and performance quality of facilities and equipment
related to the establishment or operation of the proposed cable system.

controls any other cable system in the City, or whether the grant of the
application may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable
service in and to the City.
      (14)   The demonstrated willingness and ability of the applicant to meet
construction and physical requirements and to abide by policies and limitations
imposed by law or Franchise agreements.

identifying any person or entity who will be responsible, through any
arrangement, for managing or controlling the system if the proposed transfer is
approved; (e) documents showing that the proposed transferee has the financial,
technical and legal ability to operate the system after the transfer, so as to
satisfy all of its obligations under the Franchise contract without adversely
affecting subscribers; and (f) such other information as may be required in any

      (3)   The City shall render a final written decision on a request to
transfer a Franchise within 120 days from the date it receives all of the
information specified above and/or such other additional information as is
required by law. The City may seek additional information from the Operator
and/or the proposed transferee, and both the Operator and the proposed
transferee shall cooperate by timely providing such information to the City.
The City shall be under no obligation to transfer any Franchise if the
Operator's acts or omissions make the Franchise subject to revocation, nor
shall the City be required to transfer same until it is fully satisfied that
all past Franchise nonperformance will be corrected, that claims that could be
considered as part of any Franchise renewal proceeding are fully preserved to
the extent permitted by law, and that the proposed transferee has the ability
and is likely to comply with the Franchise contract in the future. By way of
illustration and not limitation, under no circumstances will a Franchise be
transferred unless the proposed transferee agrees in writing to accept all of
the terms and conditions of the Franchise contract, except to the extent, if
any, the City is willing to modify such terms and conditions as part of the
approval of the Franchise transfer; agrees that the Franchise transfer does not
constitute a waiver of any right of or by the City; or indicate that the
Operator is or has been in compliance with the Franchise contract and/or all
applicable law. The City may conduct such public hearings as it deems
appropriate to consider any Franchise transfer request. Any transfer of a
Franchise must be approved by the Council before it is effective.
      (4)   The Operator, upon transfer of its Franchise, shall, within 60 days

of a Franchise shall include any sale of system assets, any transfer of the
Franchise itself, and/or any change of control or ownership of the Operator.
The term “control,” as used herein, includes actual working control in whatever
manner exercised, and there shall be a rebuttable presumption that a Franchise
transfer has occurred upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person or
entity of 5% or more of the shares or interest in the Operator or any entity
which owns or controls the Operator.
   (w)   Schedule of filing fees.
      (1)   To be acceptable for filing, an application submitted under or
pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by a filing fee in the following
amount, which fee will be used to cover the costs incidental to the awarding

and/or expenses incurred by the City as referenced herein, and that any fee
balance thereof not so used shall be returned to the Operator upon the
conclusion of the application process.

other provision of this section, the City may require a Franchise applicant to
reimburse the City for the City's reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
in excess of the filing fee that are incurred in considering a Franchise
application, including consultants' fees. A Franchise contract may provide that
any payment made by a franchisee hereunder does not constitute a Franchise fee
and falls within one or more of the exceptions set forth in paragraph 622 (g)
(2) of the Act, and that such payments may not be passed through to subscribers
in any form.
   (y)   Repeal of inconsistent ordinances. All prior ordinances or parts
thereof inconsistent with any provision of this section are hereby repealed as
of the effective date of this section.
   (z)   Severability. If any portion of this section is for any reason
declared to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the remaining portions of this section as long as enforcement of
same can be given the same effect.

      (6)   If, based upon subscriber complaints or based upon its own
investigation, the City believes that the system may not be operating in
compliance with this section, the City may require the Operator to perform
tests and to prepare a report to the City on the results of those tests,
including a report identifying any problem found and steps taken to correct the
problem.
   (h)   Safety requirements.
      (1)   The Operator shall at all times comply with all safety requirements
of the City ordinances.
      (2)   The Operator shall at all times employ reasonable care and shall
install and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices for
preventing failures and accidents which are likely to cause damage, injury, or
nuisance to the public.
      (3)   All cables and other equipment within the public ways of the City
shall at all times be kept and maintained in as safe condition as can be
reasonably accomplished using proven technology generally used by the cable
industry for comparable systems.
      (4)   Operation of the system shall not cause any interference to
television and radio reception, telephone communication, or other similar
operations within the City.
   (i)   Inspections. The City shall have the right at any time upon reasonable
notice to make such inspections of the system and the Operator's equipment used
in the construction, operation, or maintenance of the system as it shall find
necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of this section, the Franchise
agreement, and other pertinent provisions of law.
   (j)   Requirements and notices which apply to subcontracts. The Operator
shall require any person performing contractual construction or maintenance of
the cable system or subscribers' premises to have picture identification on
their person identifying them as authorized by Operator. Upon the request of
the Committee, the Operator shall provide to the Franchise Coordinators the
following information: the name of each subcontractor, the subcontractor's
headquarters or main office address, names of subcontractor's officers or
owner, a telephone number for handling questions concerning the subcontractor's
work, and evidence of both worker's compensation and general liability
insurance. The Operator agrees to assume responsibility for any act or omission
of its subcontractors and to hold its subcontractors to the applicable
standards in this section and the Franchise agreement. The City shall not be
liable to any such subcontractor of the Operator. Any City review of the
Operator's subcontractors or failure to review the Operator's subcontractors
does not in any way relieve the Operator of its obligations under this section.
   (k)   Public service systems. The Operator shall provide upon request of the
City facility or school one connection to its cable system free of installation
charge to all designated City facilities, including the public library, and to
all public and accredited private schools within the City and shall provide
without charge those services specified in the Franchise agreement. If the
connection requires the extension of the Operator's cable system by more than
150 feet from the Operator's existing system, the Operator may charge that
portion of the extension costs required in excess of the cost to extend the
existing system 150 feet.
   (l)   Signal quality requirements.
      (1)   The Operator shall install and maintain its cable system (including
cable, equipment and devices) so that the signal transmitted to each subscriber
at all outlets and on all channels, including educational and governmental
channels, shall be of adequate strength and quality to produce, without causing
cross modulation in the cable or interfering with other electrical or
electronic systems, pictures and sound as good as can be reasonably
accomplished using proven technology generally used by the cable industry for
comparable systems.
      (2)   Except as preempted by Federal or State law from doing so, the City
reserves the right to enforce Federal Communications Commission technical
standards regarding cable systems. Compliance with the regulations of the
Federal Communications Commission regarding signals transmitted, including at a
minimum the technical standards set forth in 47 CFR Section 76.601, as amended
from time to time, shall constitute compliance with subsection (l)(1)
hereinabove so long as such regulations exist.
      (3)   The Operator shall provide educational and governmental access
channels using headend and system processing hardware and techniques which will
result in no significant deterioration in signal quality in terms of carrier to
noise (C/N), chroma delay, depth of modulation, frequency stability, or other
system distortions as compared to the processing quality utilized on Operator's
own entertainment channels.
   (m)   Educational or governmental access channels, facilities, and
equipment.
      (1)   The Operator shall provide at least two channels to be allocated in
accordance with the Franchise agreement for educational or governmental access.
      (2)   The Operator shall interconnect its system with all other systems
operating under a Franchise granted by the City so that the channels designated
for educational or governmental access shall be transmitted on all systems
simultaneously and on the same channels. This obligation includes the provision
of all devices required to accomplish such interconnection.
      (3)   To the extent that an Operator is providing programming for
educational or governmental access channels which another Operator is required
to carry by interconnection, the interconnecting Operator shall reimburse such
Operator for a portion of its costs on a per subscriber basis in accordance
with rules and regulations adopted by the Committee or on such terms as the
affected Operators may agree.
      (4)   The Committee may promulgate rules and procedures for the use of
channels, facilities, equipment, and other support designated for educational
or governmental access.
      (5)   In the case of any Franchise under which channel capacity is
designated for educational or governmental use, the Committee may promulgate
rules and procedures under which the Operator is permitted to use such channel
capacity for the provision of other services if such channel capacity is not
being used for such designated purposes and rules and procedures under which
such permitted uses will cease.
      (6)   The Operator shall not exercise any editorial control over any
educational or governmental use of channel capacity except as federal law
expressly provides otherwise and shall have no legal liability for obscenity in
accordance with the Act. The Operator shall provide to the City copies of any
written and published policies concerning indecent programming on leased access
channels.
   (n)   Parental control devices. The Operator shall provide to subscribers on
request and at a reasonable cost parental control devices to permit subscribers
to block out the audio and video of any channel. In addition, the Operator
shall install devices (i) so that access to pay-per-view programming can be
changed by the subscriber through the use of a confidential “personal
identification number” or other confidential validating information that can be
assigned at the local business office or through the mail upon subscriber
request; and (ii) so that the sound and video portion of any scrambled channel
that carries programming can be blocked out on subscriber request. The Operator
must notify all subscribers that this option is available, when it first begins
providing cable services to a subscriber and at least annually thereafter.
   (o)   Interconnection of institutional networks. If an Operator's Franchise
agreement requires the provision of an institutional network, the Operator
shall design the network so that it may be interconnected to institutional
networks provided by any other Operator granted a Franchise by the City and
shall be constructed to include all equipment, including active and passive
electronic and optical devices needed to achieve compatibility so as to
transmit video, sound, and data between users of such networks without
modification of user's equipment and without significant deterioration in
signal quality between networks.
   (p)   Emergency use of facilities.
      (1)   In the case of any disaster duly declared by the Mayor or other
official legally able to declare a disaster, the Operator shall, upon request
of the Mayor, make available to the City for emergency use during the disaster
period all facilities, as are necessary, for the term of such disaster.
      (2)   a)   The system shall incorporate an emergency alert system that
permits the City to override the audio portions of all signals on all channels
which the Operator may lawfully override. The Operator shall design the
emergency alert system to permit the City to do the following:
            i.   Access and activate the emergency alert system using a touch
tone telephone and a special security code.
            ii.   Replace audio on all channels with an emergency message that
may be originated from a single location to be designated by the City using a
telephone and character generator or computer.
            iii.   Play back a prerecorded message over the emergency alert
system.
         b)   The Operator's obligations under this section include the
obligation to provide equipment for the system required to ensure the system
works and compliance with applicable Federal Communications Commission
regulations shall constitute compliance with this subsection. The Operator
shall work with the City to develop a plan for the regular testing of the
emergency alert system. However, it is the sole responsibility of the City to
determine whether and under what circumstances the emergency alert system shall
be used for Citywide alerts. City shall indemnify and hold Operator harmless
for any claim arising from the City's use of the emergency alert system.
   (q)   Technological advances. The Operator, at its expense, shall, upon City
request, but not more often than annually, report to the Committee on
technological advances in the industry and how such advances are being applied
or could be applied in the City.
   (r)   Complaint and service-procedure.
      (1)   The City has adopted the Federal Communications Commission customer
service standards, and the Operator shall comply with these standards and any
modifications to the standards adopted by the Federal Communications Commission
during the term of its Franchise.
      (2)   The Operator shall maintain a local office within the City or
within Clay Township, Indiana, or within three miles of the City or Clay
Township, Indiana, limits staffed with at least one customer service
representative and open at least 20 hours per week, including evening hours at
least one day a week. In addition, the Operator shall have a listed telephone,
and be so operated that complaints and requests for repairs or adjustments may
be received at any time, whether the office is open or closed.
      (3)   Maintenance service shall be immediately available to correct major
outages from 8:00 a.m. until 12:30 a.m. every day, including Saturdays,
Sundays, and holidays.
      (4)   Investigative action shall be initiated in response to all service
calls, other than major outages, not later than the next business day after the
call is received. Corrective action shall be completed as promptly as
practicable.
      (5)   The Operator shall maintain records of customer complaints, of
responses to customer complaints, and of service calls in a form adequate for
the Committee to determine compliance with this section.
      (6)   Operator shall provide consumer billing information at the time of
installation, at least annually to all subscribers, and at anytime upon
request. This information shall include written instructions that clearly set
forth procedures for placing a service call or requesting an adjustment. These
instructions shall also include names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the
Franchise Coordinators and a reminder that the subscriber can call or write for
information regarding terms and conditions of the Operator's Franchise if the
Operator fails to respond to the subscriber's request for installation,
service, or adjustment within a reasonable period of time.
      (7)   In the event a subscriber does not obtain a satisfactory response
or resolution to his request for service or an adjustment within a reasonable
period of time, the subscriber may advise the Franchise Coordinators of his
dissatisfaction in writing and the Franchise Coordinators shall advise the
Committee of all such complaints. The Committee shall record and track all
complaints that are received.
      (8)   Whenever it is necessary to intentionally interrupt service for
more than one hour for the purpose of making system repairs, adjustments, or
installations, the Operator shall do so at such time as will cause the least
inconvenience to the subscribers, and except in emergency situations, after
giving at least 24 hours advance notice of the interruption to subscribers.
      (9)   The Operator shall bill subscribers no more frequently than once a
month not to exceed 12 times per calendar year and shall not bill for services
not being provided to subscribers.
      (10)   The Operator shall have authority to promulgate such written
rules, regulations, policies, prices, and subscriber practices as are
reasonably necessary for its business, including installation and disconnection
policies, delinquent account collection procedures and late payment penalties,
but subscribers may not be required to waive rights they would otherwise have
under applicable law in order to obtain service. The Operator shall provide the
City with a copy of all such rules, regulations, policies, prices, and
subscriber practices promulgated by the Operator for the administration of its
business as it relates to its Franchise and maintained by the Operator in
writing, whether now existing or hereafter promulgated. Nothing in this section
shall allow the Operator to promulgate rules which are inconsistent with its
Franchise agreement with the City or applicable law, and the City shall have
the right to negotiate or prohibit any practice or charge which the City may
regulate or prohibit under applicable law.
   (s)   Termination of service. Upon termination of service to any subscriber,
the Operator shall promptly remove all its facilities and equipment from the
premises of the subscriber upon request.
   (t)   Preferential or discriminatory practices prohibited. Except to the
extent permitted by federal, state, or local law, the Operator shall not, as to
rates, charges, service facilities, rules, regulations, or in any respect, make
or grant any undue advantage; provided, however, connection and service charges
may be waived or modified during the Operator's promotional campaigns which
shall be offered on an equal basis to all similarly situated customers.
   (u)   Subscriber privacy. The privacy of subscribers shall be protected in
accordance with the provisions of Section 631 of the Act (47 USC Section 551).
   (v)   Franchise fee.
      (1)   Unless otherwise provided by its Franchise agreement or this
article, the Operator of a cable system for which a Franchise is required under
this article shall pay to the City as compensation for use of the public
rights-of-way, Franchise fees in aggregate amounts equal to 5% of its Gross
Revenues derived annually from its operations of the cable system to provide
cable services to the City. Payments shall be due in accordance with the terms
of the Operator's Franchise agreement.
      (2)   As to Franchises granted prior to August 1, 2000, the Operator
shall pay the Franchise fee specified in the Franchise agreement, as amended.
      (3)   If the Franchise agreement requires the Operator to pay other
amounts which are deemed Franchise fees under federal law and the sum of those
payments and those required under subsection (v)(1) exceeds the maximum
Franchise fee permitted by federal law, the payments under subsection (v)(1)
shall be reduced by such amount so that the total Franchise fee shall not
exceed the maximum permitted by federal law.
      (4)   The City reserves the right to conduct periodic audits of the
Operator's records to determine compliance with this section. The City's
acceptance of the Operator's Franchise fee payments does not constitute an
accord and satisfaction nor are such payments in lieu of any other fees, taxes,
or payments owed by the Operator.
      (5)   The Operator shall pay simple interest at the rate of 10% per annum
on all Franchise fees that remain unpaid after the date they are due until the
fees are paid.
   (w)   Security fund.
      (1)   Within 30 days after the execution of the Franchise agreement, the
Operator shall deposit with the City monies, a bond, a letter of credit, or a
combination of these instruments made payable to the City in amounts specified
in the Franchise agreement (the security fund) as security for the faithful
performance of all the provisions of the Franchise agreement, for payment of
administrative fines described in subsection (z) below, and for payments by the
Operator of any claims, liens, and taxes due the City which arise by reason of
the construction, operation, or maintenance of the system. Any monies deposited
pursuant to this subsection shall be placed by the Controller in an interest-
bearing account at a bank or local savings institution agreeable to both
parties. Interest on this account will accrue to the benefit of the Operator
upon completion and activation of the system as required by the Franchise
agreement.
      (2)   If the Franchise Coordinators determine that City taxes are due
from the Operator and are unpaid, that the City has been compelled to pay
damage, cost, or expenses by reason of any act or default of the Operator in
connection with the Franchise agreement, or that any other claims against the
Operator have arisen by reason of the construction, operation, or maintenance
of the system, such that the City may withdraw monies from the security fund,
the Franchise Coordinators shall make a written report to the Committee
outlining both the circumstances which the Franchise Coordinators believe
entitles the City to withdraw monies from the security fund and the amount
proposed to be withdrawn. The Franchise Coordinators shall provide a copy of
the report to the Operator. The Committee shall hold a hearing on the proposed
withdrawal during which the Operator may respond to the Franchise Coordinators'
report. Following the hearing, the Committee shall recommend to the Common
Council whether a withdrawal should occur and the amount of any withdrawal. The
Common Council shall act on the Committee's recommendation. If the Common
Council confirms the Committee's recommendation, the Franchise Coordinators may
immediately withdraw the amount, and, upon such withdrawal, the Franchise
Coordinators shall notify the Operator of the amount and the withdrawal date.
Within ten days after notice to Operator that any amount has been withdrawn
from the security fund, the Operator shall pay to, or deposit with, the City a
sum of money or securities sufficient to restore such security fund to the full
amount required by subsection (w)(1) hereinabove. If the Operator fails to
restore the security fund within the specified ten-day period, the City may
withdraw the entire security fund deposit remaining which shall be forfeited.
      (3)   With respect to violations of this article for which administrative
fines are specified in subsection (z) below, the Franchise Coordinators or
other authorized City official shall provide written notice of the alleged
violation to the Operator and allow the Operator 30 days to comply. If the
Operator fails to comply or to notify the City that corrective action is being
actively and expeditiously pursued, the Franchise Coordinators or other
authorized City official may initiate a proceeding before the Committee, which
Committee is hereby designated pursuant to I.C., 36-1-6-9 as the administrative
board before which violations of this article may be enforced. Such proceeding
shall be initiated by filing a compliant with the Committee, which shall issue
a summons to the Operator setting a time and date at which the Committee will
hold a hearing on the violations alleged in the complaint. If after a hearing
conducted in compliance with I.C., 36-1-6-9 the Committee finds that the
Operator has violated the ordinance as alleged, the Committee shall enter an
order fixing the amount of the administrative fines. If the Operator fails to
appeal the order of the Committee within 60 days after the date of the order as
provided in I.C., 36-1-6-9(f), the City shall withdraw the amount of
administrative fines fixed in such order from the security fund.
      (4)   The security fund deposited pursuant to this section shall become
the property of the City in the event that the Franchise agreement is canceled
by reason of the default of the Operator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Operator shall have the right to contest the Common Council's or Committee's
decision to authorize a withdrawal from the security fund by filing an action
in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the Operator prevails in such an
action, the City shall repay to the Operator the amount so withdrawn together
with interest at the statutory rate which applies to judgments from the date of
such withdrawal.
      (5)   The Operator shall be entitled to the return of such security fund,
or portion thereof, and interest as remains on deposit with the City at the
expiration of the term of its Franchise, provided that there is then no
outstanding default on the part of the Operator.
      (6)   The right reserved to the City with respect to the security fund
are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved by this
article, the Franchise agreement, or authorized by law; and no action,
proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall
affect any other right the City may have.
   (x)   Liability, indemnification and insurance.
      (1)   The Operator shall indemnify the City and its officers, employees,
and agents for all expenses and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and
other out-of-pocket expenses, arising out of or resulting from the grant of a
Franchise to the Operator under this article, provided that the Operator shall
have the right to agree to the selection of counsel and the fees to be charged
for such defense and shall have the right together with the City, to give
direction to counsel in such defense.
      (2)   The Operator shall pay all damages and penalties which the City may
legally be required to pay as a result of the grant of its Franchise under this
article, including all damages arising out of the installation, operation, or
maintenance of the system, whether or not any act or omission complained of is
authorized, allowed, or prohibited by the ordinances of the City. The
Operator's payment shall include all amounts expended by the City in defending
itself in such action including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and out-
of-pocket expenses.
      (3)   In order for the City to assert its rights to be indemnified,
defended, and held harmless, the City shall:
         a)   Notify the Operator of any claim or legal proceeding which gives
rise to such right;
         b)   Afford the Operator the opportunity to participate in any
compromise, settlement, or other resolution or disposition of such claim or
proceeding and to fully control the financial terms of any payments to be made
in such final disposition;
         c)   Fully cooperate with the reasonable request of the Operator in
its participation in, and control, compromise, settlement, or resolution or
disposition of such claim or proceeding; and
         d)   The Operator and the City shall act reasonably under all
circumstances so as to mutually protect each other against liability and to
mutually refrain from compromising the rights of each other. The City shall
inform the Operator of any offers to compromise, settle, or otherwise resolve
or dispose on any such claim or proceeding. If the Operator is willing to
accept such an offer and make all payments required by its terms, but the City
refuses to agree to such offer within 15 days of notice from the Operator, the
Operator's obligation for indemnification shall be limited to the amount that
would have been due if the offer had been accepted.
      (4)   The Operator shall purchase and maintain throughout the term of the
Franchise agreement such commercial general liability and other insurance as is
appropriate and as will protect the Operator and the City, and their employees,
officers, or agents from (i) claims under workers' or workmen's compensation,
disability benefits and other similar employee benefit acts; (ii) claims for
damages because of bodily injury, occupational sickness or disease, or death of
the Operator's employees; (iii) claims for damages because of bodily injury,
sickness or disease, or death of any person other than the Operator's
employees; (iv) claims for damages insured by personal injury liability
coverage which are sustained by any person as a result of an offense directly
or indirectly related to the employment of such person by the Operator, or by
any other person or entity for any other reason; (v) claims for damages because
of physical injury to or destruction of tangible property wherever located,
including loss of use resulting therefrom; (vi) claims arising out of operation
of any laws or regulations for damages because of bodily injury or death of any
person or for damages to property; and (vii) claims for damages because of
bodily injury or death of any person or property damage arising out of the
ownership, maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle, which may arise out of or
result from the Operator's other obligations under the Franchise agreement
whether it is to be performed or furnished by the Operator, by any
subcontractor, by anyone directly or indirectly employed by any of them to
perform or furnish any of the work under the Franchise agreement, or by anyone
for whose acts any of them may be liable. Written evidence of payment of
premiums and copies of such insurance certificates shall be filed with the
Franchise Coordinators within 30 days of the date the Franchise agreement is
fully executed.
      (5)   The insurance required by this section shall be written for not
less than the limits of liability and coverages as provided herein or as
required by law, whichever is greater. The commercial general liability
insurance shall include coverage of (a) premises and operations; (b)
contractual liability as applicable to any indemnification or hold harmless
agreement in the Franchise agreement; (c) products and completed operations;
(d) broadform property damage, including completed operations; (e) fellow
employee claims under personal injury; and (f) independent contractors. Such
insurance shall specifically include coverage for property damage from
explosion, collapse of structures or structural injury due to grading of land,
excavation, filling, backfilling, tunneling, pile driving, caisson work,
moving, shoring, underpinning, raising of or demolition of any structure, or
removal or rebuilding of any structural support of a building or structure.
Such insurance shall further include coverage for damage to wires, conduits,
pipes, mains, sewers, or other similar apparatus encountered below the surface
of the ground when such damage is caused by any occurrence arising out of work
performed by the Operator or by any of the Operator's subcontractors or anyone
directly or indirectly employed by either.
      (6)   The Operator's insurance shall be written for not less than the
following limits of liability:
         a)   Worker's compensation and disability: Statutory limits;
         b)   Employer's liability:
            i.   Bodily injury by accident:    $100,000 each accident;

      (7)   The Operator shall be responsible for paying all deductible

      (8)   Before commencing work, the Operator shall submit a “certificate of
insurance” indicating the above necessary coverages as well as naming the City
and its employees and representatives as “additional named insureds” on all
policies except workers' compensation to the City for review and approval. Such
insurance shall be carried with financially responsible insurance companies
authorized to do business in the State of Indiana, have a general
policyholder's rating of A+, A, or A-, in the edition of Alfred M. Bests
Insurance Reports and be satisfactory in form and coverage to the City. Such
coverages shall be kept in force at all times during the term of the Franchise
agreement. The Operator's insurer(s) shall provide by certified mail to the
City 30 days prior written notice in the event of cancellation, nonrenewal or
material change in the policies. In the event the Committee determines that the
certificates do not clearly show that the Operator's coverages and liability
limits are those required by this section or litigation involving the scope or
amount of the Operator's coverage under this section is commenced, the
Committee reserves the right to request, and the Operator shall provide copies
of the underlying insurance policies for the certificates required above.
      (9)   The commercial general liability insurance required by this section
shall include contractual liability insurance applicable to the indemnity and
hold harmless obligations under the Franchise agreement.
      (10)   The right reserved to the City with respect to indemnification and
insurance are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved by
the ordinances of the City, the Franchise agreement, or authorized by law, and
no action, proceedings or exercise of a right with respect to such
indemnification and insurance shall affect any other right the City may have.
   (y)   Limits on operator's recourse against the City and its officials,
employees, and agents. Except for actions seeking equitable relief, the
Operator shall have no recourse whatsoever against the City or its officers,
employees, or agents, for any loss, cost, expense, or damage on account of
claims arising out of any provision or requirements of its Franchise because of
its enforcement or nonenforcement, and without regard to whether the act or
omission giving rise to the loss, cost, expense, or damage was required or not
required by the grant of the Franchise. Nothing in this section shall be read
to waive or limit any immunities granted by State or Federal law to the City.
   (z)   Administrative fines.
      (1)   For certain violations of the provisions of this section, the
following administrative fines shall be chargeable to the security fund in

be subject to an administrative fine of $750 each day or part thereof that the
failure continues.
         f)   Recovery of administrative fines shall not excuse nonperformance,
and the City may, in addition to recovering such damages, obtain any other
relief or apply any other remedy which it may seek under the ordinances of the
City, the Franchise agreement, or otherwise at law or equity.
      (2)   In addition, the City retains all other rights and powers it has by

war, riots, civil disturbance, loss of utility service or facilities, judicial
or governmental order, hurricanes, tornadoes, wind, floods, or other natural
catastrophes or other events beyond an Operator's control, and an Operator
shall not be penalized for such violation, provided the Operator takes
immediate and diligent steps to bring itself back into compliance and to comply
as soon as possible with this article under the circumstances without
endangering the health, safety, and integrity of the public, public streets,
public property, or private property.
      (4)   Termination and cancellation may be effected only as specified by
ordinance and in accordance with Federal, State, and local law, however, before
the Franchise may be terminated and canceled under this section, the Operator
must be provided with 30 days notice and an opportunity to be heard before the
Committee or the Common Council.
   (aa)   Operator noncollusion warranty. The Operator shall warrant that it
has neither paid nor agreed to pay any commission, fee, percentage, gift, or
any other consideration, including providing service without charge, contingent
upon, or resulting from the award, transfer, or renewal of its Franchise to any
officer (whether elected or appointed), employee, or agent of the City.
   (bb)   Compliance with other applicable laws.

suspension. In addition, a Board may remand an action for further review by the
Fire or Police Chief, as applicable.

record.

such Board decision. The petition for review shall be filed within 30 days of
the written decision of the Board, unless a different time period is set by
applicable law. The City of Carmel, Indiana shall be the sole defendant in any
such petition. Within 30 days after receipt of a summons pertaining to such a
petition, the City shall cause the applicable Board to file a complete
transcript of the Board's hearing with the court. The court, without jury,
shall review the record and render its decision as in other administrative
reviews. The clerk of the court shall send a copy of the court's decision to

party may then appeal the decision of the court as permitted by law.

§ 6-176 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   The Administrator may inspect any operation without prior notice or
consent within normal business hours. If any operator or operator refuses
access to the Administrator asking to make such an inspection, the
Administrator may suspend all operations until such time as the inspection has
occurred and the Administrator is satisfied that no imminent threat of
substantial harm to health, human safety, or the environment exists or that
such threat has been eliminated.
   (b)   The Administrator may also suspend or revoke a permit for repeated or
willful violation of any of the terms of the permit or the provisions of this
Article if the Administrator determines there is an imminent threat of
irreparable harm to the environment; or of serious hazard to the health,
safety, and general welfare of the public, including the City's water supply.
   (c)   The Administrator may refuse to renew a permit upon a finding,
supported by substantial evidence that the operator is in repeated or willful
violation of any of the terms of the permit or the provisions of this Article.
   (d)   Any person directly adversely aggrieved by an action taken or
determination made by the Administrator may appeal, by requesting a public
hearing within 30 days of the date of the Administrator's action, in accordance
with §
6-177 of this Article.
   (e)   It is unlawful to violate any of the provisions of this Article, or
fail to perform any duty imposed by this Article, any permit condition, or any
order issued by the Administrator. Any operator found to have committed such a
violation shall be liable for an immediate penalty not to exceed $2,500.
Additionally, any operator found to have committed a violation shall be liable
for a penalty not to exceed $2,500 for each day such violation continues.
   (f)   In determining the amount of the penalty under this Article, the
Administrator shall consider the operator's history of previous violations at
the mining operation, the seriousness of the violation, including any
irreparable harm to the environment and hazard to the health, safety, and
general welfare of the public, the operator's negligence, and the demonstrated
good faith of the operator to achieve rapid compliance after notification of
the violation.
   (g)   Upon the assessment of a penalty under this Article, the Administrator
shall, within 30 days of the assessment, inform the operator of the amount of
the penalty assessed and issue an order to the operator to pay the penalty. The
operator has 30 days from the receipt of the order to pay the penalty or
request a public hearing pursuant to §
6-177 of this Article to contest the imposition of the penalty or the amount of
the assessment. If the operator requests a public hearing, the operator shall
forward an amount equal to the assessed penalty to the Administrator, who shall
place the amount in an escrow account.
   (h)   An operator who desires to contest the violation or amount of penalty
assessed but fails to forward the amount to the Administrator waives all legal
rights to contest the violation or amount of penalty assessed. If, following a
public hearing addressing the violation or penalty assessed, it is determined
that a violation did not occur or the amount of the penalty is reduced, the
Administrator shall, within 30 days of the decision, remit the appropriate
amount to the operator with interest at a rate interest equal to the weekly
average one-year constant maturity Treasury yield, as published by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, for the calendar week preceding the
date of penalty was paid.
   (i)   If a permit is suspended or revoked, the Administrator may require the
operator to commence reclamation upon 30 days notice.

ARTICLE 7. STORMWATER MANAGEMENT.
§ 6-180 Purpose and Intent.
   The purpose of this Article is to provide for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the City of Carmel through the regulation of
non-stormwater discharges to the maximum extent practicable as required by
federal and state law. This Article establishes methods for controlling the
introduction of pollutants into the City of Carmel municipal separate storm
sewer system (MS4) in order to comply with requirements of the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program authorized by the 1972
amendments to the Clean Water Act, the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management's Rule 13 (327 IAC 15-13), and the Indiana Department of
Environmental Management's Rule 5 (327 IAC 15-5). The objectives of this
Article are:
   (a)   To prohibit the release of pollutants to the MS4 from construction
activity.
   (b)   To prohibit the release of pollutants to the MS4 from post
construction runoff.
   (c)   To prohibit illicit discharges into the MS4.
   (d)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, monitoring,
and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this Article.
(Ord. D-1794-06, 2-6-06)
§ 6-181 Definitions.
   For the purposes of this Article, the following shall mean:
   Best Management Practices (BMPs). Structural or nonstructural practices, or
a combination of practices, designed to act as effective, practicable means of
minimizing the impacts of development and human activities on water quality.
Traditional structural BMPs, including extended detention dry ponds, wet ponds,
infiltration trenches, and sand filtration systems, are now common elements of
most new development projects. Structural BMPs rely heavily on gravitational
settling and/or the infiltration of soluble nutrients through a porous medium
for pollutant removal. Nonstructural BMPs, which may be used independently or
in conjunction with structural BMPs, rely on a much wider breadth of mechanisms
to prevent or control non-point source pollution. Nonstructural BMPs range from
programs that increase public awareness to prevent pollution, to the
implementation of control-oriented techniques (such as bioretention and
stormwater wetlands) that utilize vegetation to enhance pollutant removal and
restore the infiltrative capacity of the landscape.
   Clean Water Act (CWA). The federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. §
1251 et seq.), and any subsequent amendments thereto.
   Construction Activity. Activities subject to a stormwater management permit.
These include construction projects resulting in land disturbance of ¼ acre or
more. Such activities include but are not limited to clearing and grubbing,
grading, excavating, and demolition. This term does not include routine ditch
or road maintenance, minor landscaping projects, agricultural land disturbing
activities, forest harvesting activities, or individual building lots within a
larger permitted project.
   Entity. An individual, association, organization, partnership, firm,
corporation, or other person or group of persons recognized by law and acting
as either the owner or as the owner's agent.
   Illicit Connections. Either of the following:
      (1)   A stormwater conveyance system, which allows an illicit discharge
to enter the storm drainage system or the MS4, including but not limited to any
conveyances which allow any non-stormwater discharge and any connections to the
storm drainage system, MS4, or receiving waters from indoor drains and sinks,
regardless of whether said drain or connection had been previously allowed,
permitted, or approved by the City of Carmel or,
      (2)   Any conveyance connected from a commercial or industrial land use
to the storm drainage system, MS4, or receiving water which has not been
documented in plans, maps, or equivalent records and approved by the City of
Carmel.
   Illicit Discharge. A direct or indirect non-stormwater or pollutant
discharge to the storm drainage system, MS4, or receiving waters except as
exempted in §
6-190.
   Industrial Activity. Activities subject to NPDES Industrial Permits as
defined by 327 IAC 15-6-1:12 (Rule 6).
   Inspecting Authority. A City of Carmel representative or any other person
authorized by the City of Carmel to perform inspections.
   Maximum Extent Practicable (MEP). The statutory standard that establishes
the level of pollutant reductions that operators of regulated MS4s must
achieve. The CWA requires that NPDES stormwater discharge permits for
discharges from MS4s "shall require controls to reduce the discharge of
pollutants to the maximum extent practicable, including management practices,
control techniques and system, design and engineering methods." This standard
applies to all MS4s regulated under the Phase I and Phase II (Rule 13)
stormwater rules. Compliance with the conditions of Rule 13 and the series of
steps associated with implementation of the required six minimum control
measures will satisfy the MEP standard. Compliance with the six minimum control
measures requires the development and implementation of BMPs. Implementation of
the BMPs includes not only the actions necessary to initiate and continue the
use of specific control measures, but also, the enforcement actions, as
applicable, to ensure that the implementation of the control measures occurs.
   Measurable Storm Event. A precipitation event that results in a total
measured precipitation accumulation equal to, or greater than, one-half inch of
rainfall.
   Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4).  A stormwater conveyance system
which is owned or operated by a state, city, town, county, tribe, district,
association, or other public body or a designated and approved management
agency under Section 208 of the Clean Water Act that discharges into waters of
the United States (40 CFR 122.26(b)(8)).
   National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Stormwater Discharge
Permit. A permit issued by EPA (or by a state under authority delegated
pursuant to 33 USC § 1342(b)) that authorizes the discharge of pollutants to
waters of the United States, whether the permit is applicable on an individual,
group, or general area-wide basis.
   Non-Stormwater Discharge. Any discharge to the stormwater conveyance system
that is not composed entirely of stormwater including, but not limited to:
sewage, process wastewater, washwater, water containing pollutants, or any
other liquid, other than uncontaminated stormwater, discharged from a facility.
   Notice of Intent (NOI). A written notification indicating an entity's
intention to comply with the terms of a specified general permit rule in lieu
of applying for an individual NPDES stormwater discharge permit and includes
information as required under 327 IAC 15-3 and the applicable general permit
rule.
   Pollutant. Anything that causes or contributes to pollution. Pollutants may
include, but are not limited to: paints, varnishes, and solvents; oil and other
automotive fluids; non-hazardous liquid and solid wastes; yard wastes,
including grass, brush, leaves, and limbs; refuse, rubbish, garbage, litter, or
other discarded or abandoned objects, ordinances, and accumulations, so that
same may cause or contribute to pollution; floatables, pesticides, herbicides,
and fertilizers; hazardous substances and wastes; sewage, fecal coliform and
pathogens; dissolved and particulate metals; animal wastes; wastes and residues
that result from constructing a building or structure; soil and sediments; and
noxious or offensive matter of any kind.
   Premises. Any building, lot, parcel of land, or portion of land whether
improved or unimproved including adjacent sidewalks and parking strips.
   Receiving Waters. Watercourses or waters of the United States, or any body
of water into which stormwater is discharged.
   Storm Drainage System. A non-MS4 stormwater conveyance system that
ultimately discharges to an MS4.
   Stormwater Conveyance Systems.  System of subsurface drainage systems, catch
basins, and other drainage structures including retention and detention
facilities, municipal streets, catch basins, curbs, gutters, roads with
subsurface drainage systems, reservoirs, pumped piping systems, other drainage
structures or watercourse.
   Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP). A document which describes the
best management practices and activities to be implemented by an entity to
identify sources of pollution or contamination at a site and the actions to
eliminate or reduce pollutant discharges to stormwater, stormwater conveyance
systems, and/or receiving waters to the maximum extent practicable.
   Technical Review and Comment Form. A form issued by the City of Carmel
stating the SWPPP is adequate or stating revisions needed in the SWPPP.
   Trained Individual. An individual who is trained and experienced in the
principles of stormwater quality, including erosion and sediment control as may
be demonstrated by state registration, professional certification, experience,

§ 6-198 Floodplain Management.
   Filling of the land in the floodplain of a regulated drain or any natural
stream or watercourse, that has a contributing drainage area of 25 acres or
more, located within the City of Carmel is prohibited. The use of the
floodplain area for detention/retention ponds or lakes is also prohibited.
Floodplain boundaries are to be determined by using the 100-year base flood
elevation (BFE) as shown on the flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Hamilton County one-foot topographic
data available on the Hamilton County GIS webpage.
   (a)   If during the process of using the BFE and the one-foot topographic
data it is determined that the FIRM is incorrect, then a letter of map revision
(LOMR) to correct the FIRM is to be filed with FEMA. No filling of the
floodplain, either the floodplain shown on the FIRM or the floodplain
determined by the floodplain study, whichever is more conservative, will be
allowed until an approved copy of the LOMR is provided to the City of Carmel.
   (b)   If a FIRM does not establish a 100-year BFE for a regulated drain,
natural stream, or natural watercourse, the 100-year BFE shall be established
through a site specific floodplain study performed by a professional engineer
registered in the State of Indiana in accordance with the IDNR Hydraulic
Modeling Guidelines.
      (1)   If the drainage area for the floodplain study is greater then one
square mile at the farthest downstream point of the study, then the floodplain
study must be submitted to IDNR - Division of Water for approval and to the
City of Carmel for review and comment. A copy of the final study, approved by
IDNR - Division of Water, must be submitted to the City of Carmel as part of
the project requiring the study to be completed.
      (2)   If the drainage area for the floodplain study is less then one
square mile at the farthest downstream point of the study, then the floodplain
study must be submitted to the City of Carmel for review and approval. The City
of Carmel will have the option to send the floodplain study to a consulting
engineering firm for review and comment, should the accuracy of the floodplain
study be in question. The cost of the consulting engineering firm's time will
be the responsibility of the owner of the project and will need to be consented
to in a written agreement prior to any review of the floodplain study by the
consulting engineer.

§ 6-203 Post Construction Stormwater Quality Management.
   (a)   The City of Carmel has established a minimum standard that the
measurement of the effectiveness of the control of stormwater quality will be
based on the management of total suspended solids (TSS). The project site owner
must submit to the City of Carmel, a post-construction SWPPP that would show
placement of appropriate BMP(s) from a pre-approved list of BMPs specified in
the City of Carmel Stormwater Technical Standards Manual and would demonstrate
that the expected TSS loadings in runoff associated with one inch of rainfall
will be reduced by a minimum of 80% at the outfall(s) exiting the site. The
noted BMPs must be designed, constructed, and maintained according to
guidelines provided or referenced in the City of Carmel Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual. Practices other than those specified in the pre-approved list
may be utilized. However, the burden of proof, as to whether the performance
(minimum 80% TSS removal) and ease of maintenance of such practices will be
according to guidelines provided in the City of Carmel Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual, would be placed with the applicant. Details regarding the
procedures and criteria for consideration of acceptance of such BMPs are
provided in the City of Carmel Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (b)   The following activities are exempt from the requirements of this
section:
      (1)   Agricultural land-disturbing activities; or

maintenance procedures and schedules listed in the Indiana Stormwater Quality
Manual or the City of Carmel Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and the
terms and conditions of an approved stormwater management permit, and shall not
be subsequently altered, revised, or replaced, except in accordance with the
provisions of an approved stormwater management permit (as amended or revised)
or as approved by the City of Carmel. The BMP owner is considered in violation
of this Article if the BMP is not maintained properly.
   (b)   Following the issuance of an NOT or the installation of an acceptable
BMP, inspection and maintenance of the BMP(s) shall be the long-term
responsibility of the HOA or entity as specified in restrictive covenants. The
HOA or entity is required to inspect the referenced BMP(s) at least once per
year. The inspections shall follow the operation and maintenance procedures
included in the City of Carmel Stormwater Technical Standards Manual and/or the
stormwater management permit for each specific BMP. The inspection shall cover
physical conditions, available water quality storage capacity, and the
operational condition of key facility elements. The HOA or entity is required
to submit a yearly inspection report form (City of Carmel Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual) demonstrating proof of inspection, with the first report to
be required one year after the HOA or entity gains ownership of the BMP(s), and
subsequent reports due each year within the month of the original transfer of
ownership. Noted deficiencies and corrective actions taken should be included
in the report.
   (c)   The City of Carmel has the authority to perform long-term inspection
of all public or privately owned BMPs. Such inspections will be in addition to
that required to be performed by the HOA or the entity on a regular basis. The
HOA or entity is in violation of this Article if an inspection report is not
submitted to the City of Carmel within one month of the date due, if the HOA or

residential properties located in the District, and the same shall be assigned
one equivalent residential unit (“ERU”).

properties located in the District shall be determined by using an ERU
multiplier, which shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the total square
feet of impervious surface area within a nonresidential property by a divisor

that arise, subject to the approval of the City.
      (3)   Right of entry. The Code Enforcement Official, pursuant to this
code and Carmel City Code §§
6-180 through
6-209, as amended, may make inspections of all buildings, structures and
premises located within the City's corporate limits to determine their
compliance with the provisions of this code. Such inspections shall be made
between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. on any day except Sunday. All
inspections shall be subject to the following standards and conditions:
         a.   An inspection may take place only if a complaint has been
received by the City and such complaint, in the opinion of the Code Enforcement
Official, provides reasonable grounds for the belief that a violation exists,
or if such inspection is undertaken as part of a regular inspection program
whereby certain areas of the City are being inspected in their entirety by the
direction of the City.
         b.   The Code Enforcement Official shall furnish to the owner, tenant,
or occupant of the building, structure, or premises sought to be inspected,
sufficient identification and information to enable the owner, tenant, or
occupant to determine the purpose of the inspection, and that the person is a
representative of the City.
         c.   The Code Enforcement Official may apply to any court of competent
jurisdiction for a search warrant or other legal process for the purpose of
securing entry to any premises if the owner, tenant, or occupant shall refuse
to grant entry.
      (4)   Notices and orders. The Code Enforcement Official shall issue any
required notices or orders pursuant to subsection (g) of this section to ensure
compliance with this code.
      (5)   Coordination of inspections.  Whenever in the enforcement of this
code or another code or ordinance, the responsibility of more than one official
of the City is involved, it shall be the duty of the Code Enforcement Official
to coordinate their inspections and administrative orders as fully as
practicable so that the owners and occupants of the structure shall not be
subjected to visits by numerous inspectors or multiple or conflicting orders.
Whenever an inspector from any City agency or department observes an apparent
or actual violation of some provision of some law, ordinance or code not within
the inspectors authority to enforce, the inspector shall report the findings to
the City department or official having jurisdiction.
   (e)   Approval of modifications. Whenever there are practical difficulties
involved in carrying out the provisions of this code, the Code Enforcement
Official shall have the authority to grant modifications for individual cases,
provided the Code Enforcement Official shall first find that the practical
difficulty makes the strict letter of this code impractical and the
modification is in compliance with the intent and purpose of this code and that
such modification does not lessen health, life and fire safety requirements.
The details of action granting modification shall be recorded and entered in
the department files.
   (f)   Violations.
      (1)   Unlawful acts. It shall be unlawful for a person, firm or
corporation to be in conflict with or in violation of any of the provisions of
this code.
      (2)   Notice of violation. The Code Enforcement Official shall serve a
notice of violation (correction order) in accordance with subsection (g) of
this section.
      (3)   Prosecution of violation. Any person failing to comply with a
notice of violation or correction order served in accordance with subsection
(g) of this section shall be deemed guilty of a violation of this code and the
violation shall be deemed a strict liability offense. If the correction order
is not complied with, the Code Enforcement Official shall institute the
appropriate proceeding at law or in equity to restrain, correct or abate such
violation, or to require the removal or termination of the unlawful occupancy
of the structure in violation of the provisions of this code or of the order or
direction made pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Violation penalties. In addition to any injunctive relief which may
be sought, any person who shall violate a provision of this code, or fail to
comply therewith, or with any of the requirements thereof, shall be fined on
the first offense of a violation of this code, a fine of $50. Each day that a
violation continues after due notice has been served shall be deemed a separate
offense subject to a daily fine of $50 per day.
      (5)   Repeat offenses. Any person who is found to have committed a
separate offense of this code after having been found to commit an earlier
offense no sooner than 30 days but within a two-year period shall be assessed a
fine of $100 per offense. The purpose of this provision is to double the fines
assessed against those persons.
      (6)   Abatement of violation. The imposition of the penalties herein
prescribed shall not preclude the City from instituting appropriate action to
restrain, correct or abate a violation or to prevent illegal occupancy of a
building, structure or premises, or to stop an illegal act, conduct, business
or utilization of a building, structure or premises.
      (7)   The City may direct the owner or responsible party to restore all
improvements to the original design condition, alter the improvement to remedy
the violation or remove the improvement if determined to be in violation or
represent the potential to be in violation of this code. For private drainage
systems, the City may request alterations to the improvement that may result in
an increase or reduction in capacity (collection, storage and conveyance
capacity). Violations shall be remedied to the satisfaction of the City.
      (8)   In the event that the owner or responsible party fails to remedy
the violation within the time frame stipulated in the notice, the City reserves
the right to remedy the violation and collect such costs together with
reasonable attorney fees, consultant fees and the collection fees by suing the
owner or responsible party in a court of competent jurisdiction or in the
alternate, by certifying said costs of correction as any other special
assessment upon the premises from which said remedy of said violation was made.
    (g)   Notice and orders.
      (1)   Warning citation.  It is the policy of the City of Carmel to use
fair and reasonable judgment in the administration of its enforcement actions.
To this end, a warning citation may be issued for a violation of this code. The
warning citation shall be worded so as to sufficiently identify the premises
and the nature of the violation. If the premises owner or person being cited
fails to correct the violation in the time allotted by a Code Enforcement
Official, then a notice of correction order shall be issued. In his discretion,
a Code Enforcement Official shall have the right to forego issuing a warning
citation and may proceed to issue a notice of correction order. The issuance of
a warning citation shall not be a prerequisite to the issuance of a notice of
correction order. There shall be no right of appeal from the issuance of a
warning citation.
      (2)   Notice to owner or to person or persons responsible. Whenever the
Code Enforcement Official determines that there has been a violation of this
code or has grounds to believe that a violation has occurred, a notice of
correction order (correction order) shall be given to the owner or the person
or persons responsible therefore in the manner prescribed in subsections (g)(2)
and (g)(3) of this section. The City will take enforcement action only with the
owner or responsible party at the time the violation is identified. Pre-
existing conditions shall be borne by the owner or responsible party at the
time the violation is identified.
      (3)   Notice of correction order. Such notice prescribed in subsection
(g)(1) of this section shall:
         a.   Be in writing;
         b.   Include a description of the real estate sufficient for
identification;

requested or agreed to a continuance during the review or hearing process, then
the period of time prescribed above shall be extended for a corresponding
amount of time.
   (e)   Written Determinations. A written determination shall state clearly

zoning approval) whether its application has been approved or denied, the
application shall be considered approved. If an applicant requested additional
time to amend its application, then the 90 day (or 120 day) review period
specified above shall be extended for a corresponding amount of time.
   (g)   Deadlines for Final Actions. For purposes of making a written
determination either approving or denying an application, a reasonable period
of time is not more than ninety (90) days from the date that the applicant is
notified that the application is complete, or not more than one hundred twenty
(120) days in any case in which the approval of a variance of use is necessary.
If a Use Variance is deemed necessary by the Permit Authority, the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall conduct a public hearing on the request and shall make a
decision on the request at the meeting at which it is first presented.
Decisions made by the Board of Zoning Appeals after a public hearing conducted
in accordance with this Section are considered zoning decisions for purposes of

§ 8-38 Speed Humps.
   (a)   A “Speed Hump” is defined as a raised area in the roadway pavement
surface extending across the roadway which creates a gentle vehicular rocking
motion that causes most vehicles to slow to approximately 15 m.p.h. or less at
each hump, and for applications of more than one speed hump, to approximately
25 m.p.h. to 30 m.p.h. between properly spaced humps.
   (b)   Speed Humps should only be installed in locations where all of the
following conditions are met: (i) there is a demonstrated traffic or speeding
problem and alternate measures have not sufficiently addressed the problem;
(ii) it is not anticipated that the installation of the Speed Hump will cause
the diversion of significant amounts of traffic to another local or residential
street; (iii) the road slope and curvature allow for safe installation; (iv)
the current posted speed limit on the street where the Speed Hump is to be
placed is no greater than 30 m.p.h.; (v) the average daily traffic (ADT) on the
street where the Speed Hump is to be placed is no greater than 3,000 vehicles
per day (VPD) and no less than 200 VPD; and, (vi) the installation of the Speed
Hump is deemed advisable by the City Engineer or his designee, based upon sound
engineering judgment. When more than one Speed Hump is to be installed on a
street, the Speed Humps should be spaced between 250 and 600 feet apart, and
should not be placed on City blocks or cul-de-sac streets that are less than
500 feet in length.
   (c)   In addition, Speed Humps should only be considered for installation in
neighborhoods or subdivisions where 75% or more of the homeowners in the
affected neighborhood or subdivision have indicated in writing that they are in
favor of Speed Hump installation, except in instances where the Common Council,
with the concurrence of the City Engineer, determines that a Speed Hump may
nevertheless be appropriate in an area where such homeowner support has not
been demonstrated. For purposes of this section, the requesting neighborhood's
Home Owners Association ("HOA") shall be responsible for circulating the
petition and obtaining the requisite signatures requesting the installation of
a Speed Hump. In neighborhoods that do not have an active HOA, the petition
requesting the installation of a Speed Hump may be circulated by any property
owner located within 2000 feet of the proposed Speed Hump. The petition in a
non-HOA neighborhood must be signed by 75% of property owners located within a
2000 foot radius from the proposed Speed Hump. Petitions containing less than
20 signatures of property owners will not be considered for approval. In any
neighborhood or subdivision where the installation of a Speed Hump is being
considered, the following Point System shall be used to determine whether the
installation of a Speed Hump is justified. In this regard, to be considered by
the Common Council, a proposed Speed Hump installation location must be awarded
a minimum cumulative total 25 points under the criteria listed below, and
otherwise meet the requirements contained herein for Speed Hump installation:
      (1)   Accident History: The number of reported vehicular accidents that
have occurred during the previous 36 calendar months within 2,000 feet of the
area being considered for a Speed Hump shall be tabulated. The proposed
location shall receive four points per reported accident per 1,000 feet of the
street segment being considered. Any accidents occurring at the intersection of
an exiting street and a major arterial or collector street shall not be
considered in this point assignment.
      •   Example: 2 accidents on the 1,500 foot street segment being
considered for a Speed Hump = 2 x 4 x 1000/1500 = 5.3 points.
      (2)   School Zones: The number of public and private schools located
within 2,000 feet of the area being considered for a Speed Hump shall be
tabulated. The proposed location shall receive three points for each such
school.
      •   Example: 3 schools located in the area being considered for a Speed
Hump = 9 points.
      (3)   Average Daily Traffic Volume: The number of vehicles traveling on a
given day (24-hour period) through the area being considered for a Speed Hump
shall be tabulated. The total number of such vehicles shall be divided by 100.
The resulting number shall be the points awarded for traffic volume.
      •   Example: 900 vehicles travel in the area being considered for a Speed
Hump. 900÷100 = 9 points.
      (4)   Vehicle Speed: The speed of each vehicle traveling on a given day
(24-hour period) through the area being considered for a Speed Hump
shall be tabulated. The posted speed limit at the proposed location shall be
subtracted from the 85th percentile speed of such vehicles. The resulting
number shall be the points awarded for vehicle speed.
      •   Example: 85th percentile of the speed of vehicles traveling in the
area being considered for a Speed Hump is 34 mph. Posted speed limit is 30 mph.
34-30 = 4 points.
      (5)   Pedestrian Served Facilities: If the area being considered for a
Speed Hump lies within a 1,000-foot radius of a pedestrian served facility,
such as, but not limited to, a park, church, shopping center, elderly or group
housing facility, the proposed location shall receive three points for each
such facility, up to a total of six points.
      •   Example: 2 churches and 1 park are located within 1,000 feet of the
area being considered for a Speed Hump. 3 x 3 = 9 points, reduced to a maximum
of six points.
   (d)   All Speed Humps installed in the City after the effective date of this
section shall be established by ordinance.
   (e)   All Speed Humps installed in the City after the effective date of this
section shall be designed and/or approved by the City Engineer, or his
designee, using current, locally- accepted standards.
   (f)   All Speed Humps installed in the City after the effective date of this
section shall be constructed and maintained by the City Street Department or
its designee, using current, locally accepted standards.
   (g)   The City Street Department, or its designee, shall post appropriate
signs and markings on all public streets on which Speed Humps have been
installed, clearly indicating thereon the existence of same.
   (h)   The cost of Speed Humps installed pursuant to this section shall be
the responsibility of the City. If 75% of the property owners in the
neighborhood request its removal within five years of installation, the
property owners who signed the petition requesting the Speed Hump shall bear
the costs of removal. By signing the petition requesting the Speed Hump,
property owners agree to be bound to share equally in the cost of removal of
the Speed Hump if it is removed within five years of its installation. The City
Engineer shall keep all petitions that result in the installation of a speed
hump on file for five years. The City shall bear the cost of removal of the
Speed Hump if it has been in place for longer than five years. Removal of Speed
Humps shall be performed by the City. The obligation of the requesting
neighborhood to pay for the removal of a Speed Hump shall only apply to Speed
Humps approved subsequent to the adoption of Ordinance D-2306-16. Unless the
Common Council directs otherwise, all approved Speed Hump installations shall
be constructed in the order which they are approved, contingent upon available
funding.
   (i)   The Common Council, after consultation with the City Engineer, may
cause to be removed an existing Speed Hump when it has been determined by the
Common Council that the Speed Hump: (i) has proven ineffective in resolving the
speeding or traffic problem in the area; (ii) has caused the diversion of
significant amounts of traffic to neighboring streets, thereby creating a
traffic or speeding problem thereon; (iii) has been requested to be removed by
the written petition of 75% or more of the homeowners in the affected
neighborhood or subdivision; and/or, (iv) has otherwise become an inappropriate
or unsafe means of calming traffic.

§ 9-1 Authority to Establish Water Service.
   The City may regulate the furnishing of water to the public. It may also
establish, maintain, and operate a waterworks system.
(`91 Code, § 9-1)
Statutory reference:
   City authorized to furnish water to the public, see I.C., 36-9-2-14
§ 9-2 Authority to Establish Sewage System.
   The City may erect, maintain, and operate a sewage works plant for the

Statutory reference:
   Right to operate a sewage plant, see I.C., 36-9-6-11
§ 9-3 Extension of Water and Sewer Mains to Developed Areas within the
Corporate Limits.
   (a)   This section will apply to territory within the corporate limits of
the City as the same may be changed from time to time.
   (b)   This section will apply to requests for water or sewer service to
acreage that has already been developed at the time of the request and which
will require a main extension to provide the service. To the extent the City
extends its mains pursuant to the terms of this section, the City shall extend
both water and sewer mains and the customers affected shall be responsible for
the pro rata share and the main extension surcharge for both water and sewer
service except to the extent the area already has service available from
another utility service provider.
   (c)   In the event that individual homeowner(s) residing in already-
developed acreage wish to be served by City water or sewer requiring
construction of main extensions, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   Upon written request for a main extension from the subdivision
president and/or board of directors, the City's Utilities Department shall
develop a preliminary design and construction cost estimate for the project
which shall include both water and sewer service (the "Project Costs").
      (2)   The Utilities Department shall provide each homeowner whose
property has frontage along the proposed main extensions with a project costs
estimate that includes availability and connection fees, construction costs,
engineering fees, project legal fees and easement right-of-way costs, all of
which comprise the total project costs. Such notice shall also provide each
homeowner with his/her pro rata share of the project costs, determined by
dividing project costs by the number of lots with frontage along the proposed
main extensions (the "Pro Rata Share").
      (3)   Each homeowner wishing the project to proceed shall then sign an
agreement stating the the homeowner has notice of and understands that project
costs and is agreeable to the main extensions pursuant to the terms of this
section. The homeowner shall agree that he/she desires the project to proceed
and, after the project is complete, he/she will pay the pro rata share as
calculated pursuant to this section. This agreement must be signed by greater
than 35% of the homeowners with frontage along the main extensions in the
affected subdivision, or by each homeowner on already-developed acreage that is
not part of a platted subdivision, prior to the final preparation of plans and
advertisement for project construction bids.
   (d)   Upon receipt of the requisite number of signed agreements, the City
will proceed to extend the water and sewer mains to provide the requested
service. All customers with frontage along the main extension will be obligated
to pay the pro rata share upon the placement in service of the main extensions.
This section does not require that any customer connect to the main extensions,
only that they pay the pro rata share as provided herein.
   (e)   The City will defer and recover over time each customer's pro rata
share with the implementation of a main extension surcharge as determined
pursuant to this paragraph. The main extension surcharge shall be calculated by
dividing the pro rata share over up to 360 months together with carrying cost
calculated at a reasonable interest rate at which it is estimated that City
would pay if it were to borrow the funds for the project. The main extension
surcharge shall be in addition to the general water and sewer rates and charges
imposed by the City. The customer shall commence paying the main extension
surcharge upon the first month following the placement in service of the main
extensions, regardless of whether the customer is actually connected. The
obligation to pay the main extension surcharge shall run with the land and be
binding on predecessors in title. The City shall cause to be recorded for any
property subject to a main extension surcharge appropriate documentation to
place future purchasers on notice.
   (f)   Any customer wishing to do so may prepay without penalty the pro rata
share then outstanding and thereby avoid future main extension surcharges and
carrying charges.

§ 9-10 Four Levels of Conservation.
   In order to implement a water conservation program appropriate to the needs
of the utility and its users, the following levels of conservation are
established:
   (a)   Level 1—Voluntary Conservation.
   (b)   Level 2—Restricted Water Use.
   (c)   Level 3—Prohibited Water Use.
   (d)   Level 4—Water Rationing.
(`91 Code, § 9-10) (Ord. A-60, § D, 7-6-88)
§ 9-11 Level 1—Voluntary Conservation.
   This Level shall consist of a request by the Mayor to the users to engage in
conscience efforts to reduce water consumption by practicing conservation
techniques and suggesting meaningful action to be taken until such time as the
existing water problem is resolved.
(`91 Code, § 9-11) (Ord. A-60, § D-1, 7-6-88)
§ 9-12 Level 2—Restricted Water Use.
   (a)   Level 2 shall be comprised of methods of restricting water usage by
users to such times, terms and conditions as the Mayor and/or Board shall
determine appropriate. Level 2 does not contemplate a severe water shortage in
the immediate future, but rather that mandatory conservation methods must be
imposed to insure adequate water and pressure for future needs.
   (b)   The users shall be requested to cease or reduce water use for such
items, including but not limited to: sprinkling, irrigating, or watering lawns,
ground cover, gardens and other landscaping, washing of automobiles, trucks,
homes or other non-essential equipment, the operation of ornamental fountains,
wading and swimming pools (which do not employ a filter and recirculating
systems) and such other non-essential uses as may, from time to time, be
determined by the Board.
   (c)   Special consideration shall be given regarding those persons whose
businesses or livelihoods require a constant supply of water on a regular
basis. These businesses include but are not limited to: Car Washes, Garden
Centers and Restaurants.

§ 9-13 Level 3—Prohibited Water Use.
   (a)   Level 3 prohibitions shall preclude the use of water as announced
under any preceding Level 2 restriction(s). Additionally, users shall be
subjected to additional prohibitions which will be determined by the Board as
conditions and needs dictate, but shall not include water rationing.
   (b)   Unless an emergency exists, the Mayor shall call a special joint
meeting of the Board and Common Council prior to the Utility adopting a Level 3
Water Conservation condition. In the event that an emergency exists or it is
impractical to call a special joint session of the Board and Common Council,
the Mayor may declare a Level 3 water condition but, shall convene the special
joint session as soon thereafter as possible.
(`91 Code, § 9-13) (Ord. A-60, § D-3, 7-6-88)
§ 9-14 Level 4—Water Rationing.
   (a)   Water rationing shall occur when the Utility can not reliably provide
water or pressure to its users by any practical means other than imposing
specific allocations of waters on the users, in such amounts that are
determined equitable by the City.
   (b)   Unless an emergency exists, the Mayor shall call a special joint
meeting of the Board and Common Council prior to the Utility adopting a Level 4
water condition. In the event that an emergency exists or it is impractical to
call a special joint session of the Board and Common Council, the Mayor may
declare a Level 4 water condition, but, shall convene the special joint session
as soon thereafter as possible.

extension to any City owned water supply transmission line or to any part of
the City-owned water distribution system shall be allowed until a permit is
obtained and payment or satisfactory surety for payment as a contribution to
aid in construction has been made into the City of Carmel "Water Main Extension
Fund," which is a depository for said contributions. These payments designated
as "availability contributions," shall be from time to time, updated and fixed
by the City of Carmel but shall be established as an acreage cost based on the
project cost of the transmission line(s), and/or existing system reinforcing,
and operations necessary to provide adequate service to a service area or sub-
area as defined by the Board of Public Works and Safety, with the total cost to
be divided by the total number of acres within the service area or sub-area.

service shall make payment to the City Engineer or provide surety for such
payment in accordance with costs set forth, by platted sections before they are
signed per Ordinance No. Z-160 and recorded, but in no event shall any
subdivision or final plats be signed per Ordinance No. Z-160 and recorded until
satisfactory proof or surety of full payment of the contribution is on file
with the Department of Community Development.

encumbered to repay any such funds advanced or contributed, nor will the City's
General Funds be used, committed or encumbered to repay any such funds advanced
or contributed, it being expressly declared that such repayment, if any, will
be made under the provisions of and will be repaid only from funds deposited in
the “Water Availability-Mains Fund,” on the basis of first in, first out, for
each service area or sub-area. No provision of this division shall be construed
as a guarantee by the City that the owners of real estate advancing funds will
be fully reimbursed therefore.

sufficient funds to extend and/or oversize the transmission line or to
reinforce the existing system, as needed, no construction permit will be issued
by the City unless the owners of real estate advance and pay the excess project
costs.

beginning on the date the project is completed for any home that is connected
to the City water system within one year of the project completion date.
Homeowners who subsequently connect to the City water system within the five-
year project connection period shall pay their prorata share of project costs
within ten years of the project completion date, and may do so in equal annual
installment payments in such amount as is necessary to pay such project costs
in full within such ten-year period. Interest shall be charged to each such
homeowner at a rate to be determined by the City prior to the start of project
construction.
   (c)   Individual homeowners that are not part of a platted subdivision shall
connect their home to the City transmission or local water line on the date on
which the project performed pursuant to §
9-38 above is completed. Payments by individual homeowners to the City for a
project may be made over ten years from the date of project completion, under
the same annual installment terms as are set forth above for residents of
platted subdivisions. Individual lots not in a platted subdivision shall be
charged the applicable availability and connection fees set forth hereinabove.
Project costs for such connections shall be determined on a case by case basis.

be collected from the person who owns each and every parcel of real estate that
is connected directly or indirectly to the City's sewerage system or otherwise
discharges wastewater either directly or indirectly into the sewerage system of
the City, which sewer charges shall be payable as provided in this article.
(Ord. S-74-18, Version A, §2, 6-18-18)
§ 9-159 Commencement of Charges Upon First Discharge and Extension to
Additional Property.
   The sewer charges fixed by this article shall become effective at the time
the User first discharges to the sewerage system. These sewer charges shall be
extended to and cover any additional premises thereafter served, without the
necessity of any hearing or notice.
(Ord. S-74-18, Version A, §2, 6-18-18)
§ 9-160 Rate Basis.
   The sewer flow charges shall be based on the quantity of water as measured
by the water meter used on or in the premises subject to such sewer charges,
except as otherwise provided in this article.
(Ord. S-74-18, Version A, § 2, 6-18-18)
§ 9-161 Monthly Reading of Meters.

§ 9-163 Procedure When Single Meter Serves More Than One User.
   In the event two or more premises including apartments and trailers
discharging wastewater into the City's sewerage system, either directly or
indirectly, are consumers of water, and the quantity of water is measured by a
single water meter, then in such case billing shall be for a single service in
the manner set out elsewhere herein, except that the minimum bill per month
shall not be less than the number of such units times $3.65. The Board may
require that separate water meters be installed in any such case.
(Ord. S-74-18, Version A, §2, 6-18-18)
§ 9-164 Portion of Water Not Entering Sewerage System.
   In the case of a User utilizing more than 1,000 gallons of water per average
workday, who can substantiate to the City that a portion of said water does not
and cannot enter the sewerage system, the Board shall either determine the
portion of the measured water to be used in determining the appropriate sewer
charges, or approve the manner and technique of flow measurement provided by
the User for determining wastewater discharged to the sewerage system.
Facilities utilized to accomplish this shall be installed and maintained in a
serviceable condition by the User at his expense, but shall be under the
exclusive control of the City.
(Ord. S-74-18, Version A, § 2, 6-18-18)
§ 9-165 Sewer Billing Procedure Generally.
   (a)   Sewer billings and invoices shall be rendered and collected

   (c)   The Board may, on proper cause being shown by the applicant that in a
singular occurrence, metered water did not reach the sewerage system, adjust
the User's sewer charge with respect to such occurrence.
   (d)   SIUs with a flow in excess of 50,000 gallons per average workday shall
have billing determined on the basis of wastewater discharged as monitored per
Section
9-140, except as described in (e) of this section.
   (e)   At its option, the Board may accept monitoring data and information
from such a SIUs to substantiate billing determination on a more frequent basis
than as established in Section
9-140. Such allowance, however, does not exempt the SIU from the surveillance
survey fee set by the Board to offset the costs of monitoring performed by the
City.
   (f)   In the event there is a difference in analytical results that is not
explainable by normal variation in the testing procedure, the User may, within
30 days of billing, appeal to the Board.
(Ord. S-74-18, Version A, §2, 6-18-18)
§ 9-166 Residential Users of Sewer Services—Summer Sewer Relief.
   (a)   In order that residential Users of sewer services shall not be
penalized for watering their lawns during the months of May, June, July,
August, September and October (the "Summer Sewer Relief period"), the billing
for such sewer charges shall be calculated as follows:
The consumption for the previous five months of November through March shall be
reviewed, and the lowest and highest consumption months during this period
shall be omitted. The User's residential water consumption during the remaining
three months shall be added together and the resulting sum divided by three.
The result of this calculation shall constitute the number of gallons of
consumption that will be charged to the residential User during the Summer
Sewer Relief period. These charges will generally appear, so far as normal
meter reading and monthly billing cycles allow, on the customer billings of
June, July, August, September, October and November.
   (b)   Any residential customer who does not have five months of applicable
water usage from which to calculate Summer Sewer Relief pursuant to this
section shall be billed as follows:
The City's Municipal Water Utility metering book water usage entries for the
months included in the Summer Sewer Relief period shall be averaged and that
usage averaged shall be the Summer Sewer Relief rate for customers lacking a
full five month history of water consumption at their own residence.
   (c)   Under either of the above billing procedures a residential customer
shall not be billed more than its actual residential metered usage.
   (d)   Residential sewage service, as applicable to the calculation of the
Summer Sewer Relief pursuant to this section, shall apply to each lot, parcel
of real estate or building which is, or intends to be, occupied and used as a
residence. Summer Sewer Relief shall not apply to any premises that are used
for industrial or commercial purposes. In the event a portion of such premises
shall be used for commercial or industrial purposes, the owner shall have the
privilege of separating its commercial, industrial and residential water
service so that the residential and commercial/industrial portions of the
owner's premises are served through separate meters. In such case, the water
usage as registered by the water meter used for the residential portion of the
premises shall qualify for Summer Sewer Relief so long as there actually is a
yard to be watered and the other terms and conditions of this section are met.
(Ord. S-74-18, Version A, §2, 6-18-18)
§ 9-167 Tenants May Be Billed; Right of Owners to Examine Records.
   The sewer charges may be billed to the tenants occupying the premises
served, unless otherwise instructed in writing by the person who owns the
premises. Such billings shall in no way relieve the owner of liability in the
event payment is not made as herein required. The owners of the premises
served, which are occupied by tenants, shall have the right to examine the
collection records of the City for the purposes of determining whether such
sewer charges have been paid by such tenants; provided that such examination
shall be made at the office at which the records are kept and during the hours
that such office is open for business.

be pursued as appropriate.
(Ord. S-74-18, Version A, § 2, 6-18-18)
§ 9-182 Cease and Desist Order.
   (a)   When the Board finds that a User has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this ordinance, IWP permit, other requirements or
standards, or an issued order, the Board may issue an order to the User
directing it to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements;
      (2)   Comply in accordance with a Compliance Schedule; or
      (3)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   (b)   The Utility Director may suspend the wastewater treatment service of a
User whenever it is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge that is
presenting or causing an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons, the POTW, or the environment.
   (c)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
(Ord. S-74-18, Version A, §2, 6-18-18)
§ 9-183 Termination of Service.
   (a)   Termination of service is a revocation of the User's privilege to
discharge wastewater into the sewer system. This may be accomplished by
physical separation of the User's connection to the collection system, through
the issuance of a cease and desist order as set forth in Section
9-182, or the Utility Director may have the User's incoming water service shut
off.
   (b)   Any User who violates or continues to violate conditions of this
ordinance, an SIU permit, a previously issued order, or any applicable state or
federal law, or the following conditions, is subject to termination of service.
      (1)   Repeated failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents
and characteristics of its discharge;
      (2)   Repeated failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics;
      (3)   Repeated refusal of reasonable access to the User's premises for
the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (4)   Violation of IWP permit conditions or Pretreatment Standards.
   (c)   Noncompliant Users shall be notified by the Utility Director of the
proposed termination of their SIU permit, or privilege to discharge to the
sewer system, and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section
9-181 of this ordinance.
   (d)   Citizens Wastewater of Westfield and CTRWD. The City provides service
to both Citizens Wastewater of Westfield and CTRWD pursuant to certain
agreements approved by the Board and this ordinance. Pursuant to those
agreements and this ordinance, Citizens Wastewater of Westfield and CTRWD are
responsible for monitoring, investigating, and reporting the flows of their
respective customer bases subject to the requirements of Division V of this
ordinance to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the Carmel
NPDES permit. If the Utility Director determines that either Citizens
Wastewater of Westfield and CTRWD has a customer connection introducing flow
which causes a violation of one of their respective agreements or this
ordinance, and Citizens Wastewater of Westfield and CTRWD, as the case may be,
has not terminated the customer connection, then the Utility Director has the
authority to pursue the remedies set forth the in the applicable agreement.
(Ord. S-74-18, Version A, § 2, 6-18-18)
§ 9-184 Administrative Fines.
   (a)   The City through the Board has the authority to issue and assess
administrative fines to Users in violation of this ordinance, IWP permit of
other state and federal regulations or standards.
   (b)   In accordance with Pretreatment Standards and the City's NPDES permit,
the City through the Board may impose a fine for noncompliance by an SIU issued
a IWP permit of not more than $2,500 per day, per violation for a first
violation; no more than $7,500 per day, per violation for subsequent
violations, in accordance with I.C., 36-1-3-8(a)(10)(B). The Board will follow
the developed Enforcement Response Plan to provide consistent enforcement
responses and fines for similar violations and circumstances for IWP permits.
   (c)   Notwithstanding any other section of this ordinance, any other User or
FOG facility who is found to have violated any provision of this ordinance or
orders issued hereunder shall be issued a NOV and may be fined by the City
through the Board in an amount not less than $100, and not to exceed $2,500 per
violation, per day for a first violation. The Board may impose a fine of no
more than $7,500 per day for each subsequent violation in accordance with I.C.,
36-1-3-8(a)(1)(B) and the Emergency Response Plan.
   (d)   Re-inspections will occur for incidences issued a NOV. Re-inspection
fees and reimbursement costs are considered in addition to administrative
fines. Reimbursement costs are developed on a case-by-case basis. A fee of $73
may be assessed to the User for each re-inspection.
   (e)   Each day on which a noncompliance occurs or continues shall be deemed
a separate and distinct violation. Such assessments may be added to the User's
next scheduled sewer service charge and the City shall have such other
collection remedies as it must collect other service charges.
   (f)   The City may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and
other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, remediation expenses, maintenance expenses, and the cost
of any actual damages incurred by the City.
   (g)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties may constitute a lien against the
individual User's property. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a
request for the Board to reconsider the fine within 30 days of being notified
of the fine. The Board shall convene a hearing on the matter within 30 days of
receiving the request from the User.
(Ord. S-74-18, Version A, § 2, 6-18-18)
§ 9-185 Judicial Remedies.
   If any User discharges pollutants into the wastewater disposal system
contrary to the provisions of this ordinance or any order or permit issued
hereunder, the City may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or
equitable relief.
   (a)   Injunctive relief. Whenever a User has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this ordinance, IWP permit, other requirements or
standards, or an issued order, the City may petition the court for the issuance
of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both (as may be appropriate) which
restrains or compels the activities on the part of the User. The City may also
seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief,
including a requirement for the User to conduct environmental remediation. A
petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against a User.
   (b)   Civil litigation.
      (1)   Any User who has violated or continues to violate this ordinance or
any order or permit issued hereunder, shall be liable to the City for actual
damages incurred by the City per violation per day for as long as the violation
continues.
      (2)   In addition to damages, the City may recover reasonable attorney's
fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with the enforcement
activities, including sampling, monitoring and analysis expenses.
(Ord. S-74-18, Version A, § 2, 6-18-18)
§ 9-186 Affirmative Defenses.
   (a)   An Upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with Pretreatment Standards.
      (1)   The User must demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous
operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
         i.   An Upset occurred and the User can identify the cause(s) of the
Upset;
         ii.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with the applicable operation and
maintenance procedures; and
         iii.   The User has submitted the following information to the Utility
Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the Upset [if this information is
provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days]:
            (A)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause(s) of
noncompliance;
            (B)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            (C)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (2)   In any enforcement proceeding, the User seeking to establish the
occurrence of an Upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (3)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on
any claim of Upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
Pretreatment Standards.
      (4)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with Pretreatment Standards upon reduction,
loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the
treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
   (b)   A User shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action
brought against it for noncompliance with the General Discharge Prohibitions
contained in Division III, above, if it can prove that it did not know, or have
reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges
from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the User was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during the pass through or
interference; or
      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the User's prior discharge when
the City was regularly in compliance with the City's NPDES permit, and in the
case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   (c)   Bypass.
      (1)   A User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
Pretreatment Standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3), below.
      (2)   Bypass notifications.
         i.   If a User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Utility Director at least 10 days before the date of
the bypass, if possible.
         ii.   A User shall submit oral notice to the Utility Director of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards within
twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the User becomes
aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain:
            (A)   A description of the bypass and its cause(s);
            (B)   The duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times;
            (C)   If the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it
is expected to continue; and
            (D)   Steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass.
         iii.   The Utility Director may waive the written report on a case-by-
case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
      (3)   Bypass is prohibited, and the City may take an enforcement action
against a User for a bypass, unless:
         i.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         ii.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         iii.   The User submitted notices as required in paragraph (2), above.
      (4)   The City may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the Utility Director determine that it will meet the three
conditions listed in paragraph (3), above.
(Ord. S-74-18, Version A, §2, 6-18-18)
§ 9-187 Administrative Appeals.
   (a)   Any User affected by any decision, action or determination including
cease and desist orders, made by the Utility Director interpreting or
implementing the provisions of this ordinance, any permit issued herein or any
action, decision, or regulation of the Board adopted pursuant hereto, may file
with the Board a written request for review and reconsideration within 10 days
of such a decision, action or determination setting forth in detail the facts
supporting the User's request for reconsideration.
   (b)   The appeal shall, if reasonably possible, be heard by the Board within
30 days from the date of filing. The Utility Director's decision, action, or
determination shall remain in effect during such period of reconsideration,

ARTICLE 4. INTERCEPTOR AND TRUNK SEWER CONNECTIONS.
§ 9-196 Availability Costs.
   (a)   No connection to any City owned trunk sanitary sewer shall be allowed
until a permit is obtained and payment, or satisfactory surety for payment as a
contribution to aid in construction has been made into the City of Carmel
"Interceptor Improvement and Betterment Fund," which is a depository for such
contributions and designated funds. These contributions shall be regarded as a
benefit as defined by the Board of Public Works and Safety. This is a benefit
cost intended to provide funds for sewage collection and improvements projects
by the City of Carmel or owners of real estate and provide owners of real
estate such protection as is afforded by the provisions of statutes of the
State of Indiana for sanitary sewerage facilities constructed by said owners of
real estate under contact with the City.
   (b)   These costs, designated as "availability costs" shall be fixed by the
City of Carmel as hereinafter provided. Such "availability costs" shall be and
are hereby established in the sum of $1,365 per acre of ground to be served and
shall be from time to time updated and fixed by the City of Carmel.
   (c)   Project costs, in all cases, shall expressly include construction
costs, legal costs, engineering costs, construction inspection costs, project
administrative costs, and easement acquisition costs as shall be administered
and defined by the Board of Public Works and Safety for the City of Carmel.
Easements in each case, as may be required by the Board of Public Works and
Safety, must be obtained by the owner of real estate prior to designing the
project. Projects which shall be funded from the Interceptor Improvement and
Betterment Fund shall include new trunk and interceptor sewers, improvements to
existing trunk or interceptor sewers and such sewage collection improvements
projects as determined by the Board of Public Works and Safety for the City of
Carmel.
   (d)   The "availability costs" of $1,365 per acre will be allocated to and
paid into the project costs of the specific interceptor extension (off-site
interceptor and on-site oversizing) for which it is paid. If the entire
"availability cost" is not needed for the specific interceptor extension, the
excess, if any, will remain in the fund.
   (e)   The application-owners of real estate applying for sewerage extensions
shall make payments to the City Wastewater Utility or provide surety for such a
payment in accordance with costs set forth, by platted sections before they are
signed per Ordinance Z-289, as amended, and recorded. However, in no event,
shall any subdivision or final plats be signed per Ordinance Z-289, as amended,
and recorded until satisfactory proof of surety of full payment is on file with
the Department of Community Development.
   (f)   Trunk sewerage extension projects, shall be developed by the City of
Carmel and designed by competent engineers retained or approved by said City of
Carmel. Plans and specifications for specific trunk sewerage extensions, and
for all local, lateral, and sub-trunk sewers, shall be submitted to, and
receive approval from the said City of Carmel and all applicable regulatory
agencies prior to actual start of construction.

§ 9-197 Additional Funds Contributed.
   The above "availability costs" shall be strictly non-refundable. If by prior
agreement, in order to extend the trunk sewerage system, additional funds are
necessary to extend the sewer to the owners of real estate, such additional
funds, advanced or contributed by said owners of real estate for the extensions
and/or oversizing to meet the requirements of the City of Carmel, are
refundable, without interest. However, such refunds may be made only from funds
deposited at a future date by owners of real estate benefited under such terms
and conditions as the City shall, from time to time, set forth. In no event
will any of the City sewage revenues be used, committed, or encumbered to repay
any such funds advanced or contributed. It is expressly declared that such
repayment, if any, will be made under the provisions of and will be repaid only
from funds deposited in the "Interceptor Fund" on the basis of first in, first
out. No provision of this section shall be construed as a guarantee by the City
of Carmel that the owners of real estate advancing funds will be fully
reimbursed therefor.

§ 9-198 Exclusion.
   Acreage used for the determination of "availability contributions or costs"
shall include the total property area except areas designated in and approved
plans such as cemeteries, golf courses, and flood prone areas, which may, at
the discretion of the Board of Public Works and Safety, be excluded. Any real
estate owner of the above designed areas may file with the Board of Public
Works and Safety a request to exclude acreage as set forth above, in the
determination of the "availability contributions or costs" for the affected
property.

§ 9-199 Oversizing.
   Refunding costs for oversizing to meeting City specification shall be made
only for the portion of the oversizing which lies within the real estate
owners' development as requested in writing by the Board of Public Works and
Safety. In the event the "availability costs" does not provide sufficient funds
to extend and/or oversize the trunk sewer, as needed, no such sewer extension
into the development, or oversizing, will be considered by the Board of Public
Works and Safety unless the owners of real estate desire to advance and pay the
excess costs of the project. In the event oversizing of sewerage lift stations
and other applicable appurtenance and/or oversizing and extensions of trunk
sewers constructed within their development of owners of real estate are
necessary to deliver sewage from other areas to the trunk sewer, or from one
trunk to another, such oversizing and/or extension costs may be deemed to be
part of the trunk sewer costs and not part of the on-site local sewer cost, and
as such, would be considered for refund under provisions of § 9-197.

   Where an individual connection is sought for acreage or developed areas
inside or outside the corporate limits of the City of Carmel, the following
sewer users, listed by type of occupancy, shall pay a Connection Charge based
on an "average user" factor (1). The average or "equivalent" user connection
cost for a single family residence is hereby initially fixed and established at
$1,600. The units listed below will presently pay for a connection cost based
on the multiplication of the listed decimal times $1,600. The equivalent user
cost of $1,600 as well as the connection costs listed below may, from time to
time, be updated and changed by the City. Funds collected, less inspection
costs, shall be deposited into the City of Carmel "Plant Expansion and
Improvement Fund". Funds collected shall be used for the expansion and

engineers retained or approved by the City of Carmel. All easements shall be
made out to the City of Carmel and shall be obtained by and, if necessary, paid
for by the owners of real estate, and shall be obtained prior to engineering
design of the project. Easements shall be in a form approved by the City.
   (b)   The owners of real estate applying for trunk sewer service shall
deposit, with the City of Carmel, adequate funds to pay for appurtenant non-
construction costs prior to the City proceeding with preparation of plans and
specifications. If the project does not proceed to completion after projected
costs are established, monies so deposited by the owners of real estate shall
be non-refundable and will be used to pay incurred expenses. If funds are in
excess of expenses, the excess will be returned to the owners of real estate
making the deposit or their successors. If the project progresses to
completion, the deposit will be credited to the total project cost.

§ 9-203 Inspection Costs and Approval of On- Site Sewers.
   The owners of real estate obtaining a permit for sewerage extensions shall
submit plans for on-site sewers, including trunk sewers to be constructed
within the development, to the City of Carmel for review and approval prior to
start of construction. The plans shall conform to the City's sewer master plan
where applicable. Deviations from the sewer master plan may be allowed by the
City when approved in writing. During construction of said on-site sewers, the
owners of real estate shall pay the expense of an inspector to assure that the
construction of the facilities are in compliance with current standards and
specifications established by the City of Carmel. Upon completion of
construction, the owners of real estate shall provide certified record
construction drawings to the City. If certified record construction drawings
are not provided, as above required, the City may prepare these at the expense
of the said owners of real estate. No potential reimbursable expenses for
oversizing and/or off-site interceptor construction will be allowed until
record drawings are provided and approved. The City will provide the inspector
or may approve, in writing, some person designated by the owners of real
estate. In any case, the owners of real estate will pay the cost thereof to the
City of Carmel who, in turn, will pay the inspector.

§ 9-204 Individual Connections in Developed Areas.
   If individual applicants for sewerage service in already-developed acreage
and/or platted subdivisions wish to be served requiring construction of a new
trunk sewer or local sewers, they shall obtain a permit and deposit adequate
funds, with the City, to pay engineering and appurtenant costs prior to
authorization of such design by the City and receipt of bids for construction.
If the project does not proceed to completion after project costs are
established, the money so deposited by individual applicants shall be non-
refundable and will be used to pay incurred expenses. If monies are in excess
of expenses, said expenses will be returned to the individual making the
deposit. If the project is completed, the deposits of individual applicants
shall be credited to said individuals' costs as outlined in §
9-205, hereinafter set forth. If a connection is made to any trunk or local
sewer without obtaining a permit and paying the required "availability

§ 9-218 Relocation of Public Utility Facilities.

upon, and/or across a City street, highway, or other public property to be
relocated because of a City road project, street project, sidewalk project,
trail project or other project, or any combination thereof (“Project”), the
owner of the public utility facility shall relocate that facility in accordance
with the following procedures:
      (1)   If a Project is subject to the oversight of the Indiana Department
of Transportation ("INDOT") (an "INDOT Project"), the facility shall be
relocated in accordance with INDOT regulations found at 105 IAC 13. Any
relocation work plan agreed to by the owner of a public utility facility for an
INDOT Project must, to the extent possible, comply with Chapter 6, Article 9, §
6-245 of the Carmel City Code, which establishes an Underground and Buried
Utilities District within the City in accordance with I.C., §§8-1-32.3-15 and
8-1-2101. The City may, in coordination with INDOT and the owner of a public
utility facility, recommend a place for the relocation of a public utility
facility. To the extent the owner of a public utility facility is not
reimbursed by INDOT for the costs of relocating a public utility facility for
an INDOT Project, the City shall not be liable for any relocation costs, unless
the City agrees otherwise.
      (2)   If a Project is not subject to the oversight of INDOT (a "City
Project"), the owner of the public utility facility shall relocate that
facility at a time, place and manner (including above or underground) as
determined by the City ("Relocation Determination"). The City, in making a
Relocation Determination, shall consider the following: safety requirements;
engineering and construction standards; the legality and feasibility of the new
location; less costly alternatives that comply with the City's laws, rules and
standards; and factors that may prevent utilities from relocating their
facilities such as weather and availability of materials. The cost for
relocation of a public utility facility due to a City Project shall be borne by
the owner of the public utility facility, unless the City agrees otherwise. An
owner of a public utility facility may seek a waiver of a Relocation
Determination by providing a written waiver request to the City's Board of
Public Works ("BPW") within thirty (30) calendar days of the Relocation
Determination. BPW shall respond to a waiver request within thirty (30)
calendar days of receipt of the waiver request. To the extent a City Project
involves relocation of a public utility facility within the City's Underground
and Buried Utilities District pursuant to Chapter 6, Article 9, §
6-245 ("§ 6-245"), such relocation shall comply with the requirements of §
6-245.
   (b)   If a public utility facility owner fails to relocate its facility as
directed by the City pursuant to subsection (a)(2) hereinabove, the City shall
have the right to relocate that facility. If the City exercises its right to
relocate the facility, the owner of the facility shall reimburse the City for
the cost of such relocation within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of
the owner's receipt of the City's notice of the cost of relocation. If the
owner fails to fully and timely reimburse the City for these relocation costs,
the City shall have the right to collect these costs by exercising any
available legal remedy, including, but not limited to, obtaining a money
judgment for the costs incurred by the City in relocating the facility.
   (c)   Any owner of a public utility facility that fails to relocate that
facility in accordance with a Relocation Determination made by the City
pursuant to subsection (a)(2) hereinabove shall be subject to a fine in the
amount of $100 per day starting on the first day after the time period
specified in a Relocation Determination or other time period agreed to by the
City if a waiver has been granted in addition to any amounts owed to the City
pursuant to subsection (b) hereinabove.

instructed in writing by the person who owns the residential unit. Such
billings shall in no way relieve the owner of the residential unit of liability
in the event payment is not made as herein required. The owners of the
residential unit served, which are occupied by tenants, shall have the right to
examine the collection records of the City for the purpose of determining
whether such charges have been paid by such tenants; provided that such
examination shall be made at the office at which the records are kept and
during the hours that such office is open for business.
   (c)   How delinquencies arise. Charges for solid waste removal and recycling
service levied pursuant to this Article shall be due and payable on or before
the due dates shown on the bills. Any service charge not paid by the due date
(approximately 18 days after the bill is rendered) shall be considered
delinquent. Delinquent solid waste charges together with costs and other
expenses of collection may be collected by any lawful remedy, including, where
applicable, the placing of and foreclosure of liens on real estate as provided

stated on the bill. Customers who are habitually late with their payments, more
than three times in any calendar year, may be required to make a $27 deposit,
to be applied for all or part payment of a bill not paid by said customer, or
have their water and/or solid waste service discontinued. If the total amount
of the deposit is not used, the remainder of the deposit will be refunded to
the customer after their service has been discontinued.
      (2)   Failure of a customer to make timely payment shall subject the user
to a late charge of 10%.
      (3)   Submission of any delinquent account to any attorney for collection
shall entitle the City to recover reasonable attorney's fees, expenses incurred
by the City in the collection process, and court costs, if any.
      (4)   Delinquent accounts may be collected through Carmel City Court and
the complaint filed by an attorney or a City appointed employee as allowed by
statute.
   (f)   Evidence of bill mailing. The printout sheet from the computer, so far
as the City is concerned, is proof of mailing of the utility bills, and if the
customer claims not to have received a bill then the late charge will stand as
a part of his bill if the printout sheet indicates a bill was mailed.
   (g)   Disconnection for non-payment; returned checks.
      (1)   Water service shall be disconnected from those water customers of
the Carmel City Utilities who fail to pay the accrued fees and late charges
within 60 days of billing. The service cannot be continued until all fees are
paid, including a $43 disconnect fee. The water service can only be reconnected
by a Carmel Water Utility employee.
      (2)   If the City receives a check for payment of water and/or solid
waste bill, and said check is returned for insufficient funds, the City may
assess a fee of $33 in addition to all other applicable charges, and water
service may be disconnected or new water service may be denied on other
properties until the account is brought current. Cash, cashier's check, or
money order will be required to pay all such charges.
   (h)   Deposits applied to delinquent charges.
      (1)   In the event rates and charges for solid waste service are not
paid, the deposit will be forfeited and applied toward such delinquent rates
and charges as occur, and the solid waste service will be discontinued.
   (i)   General penalties; continuing violations. The commission of any act
prohibited by this Article or by lawful order of the supervisor of the Division
of Solid Waste or lawful order or regulation of the Board, or the failure to
perform without lawful justification any lawful order of the supervisor of the
Division of Solid Waste or lawful order or regulation of the Board shall be a
punishable violation of this Article for which, unless there is another
specific penalty provided, the penalty shall be a fine of not less than $100 or
more than $500. In the case of disposal of hazardous discharges into the
sewerage system in violation of this Article or any valid order of regulation
of the Board each day of violation constitutes a separate offense.
   (j)   Payments by credit card or other authorized payment method.
      (1)   The Utilities Department is authorized to accept payments for its
water and sewer services by credit card or any other method authorized under

credit card or other authorized payment method to make such payments, the
Utilities Department may collect a sum equal to the amount of the charge from
the person using the credit card or other authorized payment method.

§ 9-232 Coordination of Solid Waste Connection and Disposal Services; Mandating
Recycling Services.
   (a)   Definitions. The definitions set forth in §
9-221 shall be incorporated herein by reference.
   (b)   Cooperation and coordination between providers. As a condition to
providing service within the City, all providers must cooperate and coordinate
with the City Utility Department and city contractor in an attempt to reduce
the days on which trash removal vehicles are operating on City streets.
Specifically, this coordination and cooperation shall result in an agreement
between all providers whereby the providers agree to perform trash collection
service within the City on the same days as the city contractor. The City has
final approval through the Department of Utilities Director or his/her designee
on how and when service will be provided within the City, and the City can
require that trash collection service be provided on certain days within
certain geographical regions of the City.
   (c)   Mandatory recycling. Any person or entity that offers weekly or bi-
weekly residential solid waste collection and waste disposal service within the
City's municipal limits shall also offer recycling as part of its regular
service. Such providers must offer the collection of recycling from each
qualifying residential unit at a minimum of once every two weeks. The
collection of recycling shall be curbside with the exception of those planned
unit developments (i.e., "PUD") and old town Carmel homes where alley facing
garages necessitate alley pickup. The providers shall supply all containers
required for recycling.
   (d)   Penalty for non-compliance. When the City finds that a provider has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this section, the City may
fine the provider in an amount not to exceed $2,500 as provided by I.C. 36-1-3-
8. Such fine shall be assessed on a per violation basis. Unpaid fines shall
after 60 calendar days be assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid
balance and interest shall accrue at a rate of 1.8% per month. The City may
recover any and all court costs, including but not limited to, reasonable
attorneys' fees that are incurred in recovering the fines assessed herein.
