chapters and sections, shall be known and designated as the "Huntingburg

ordinances" or "code" may be substituted. Code title, chapter and section
headings do not constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.

rules of construction, definition and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.

Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â This code is a codification of previously existing laws, amendments
thereto, and newly enacted laws. Any previously existing law or amendment
thereto reenacted by this code shall continue in operation and effect, as if it
had not been repealed by this code. All rules and regulations adopted under
laws reenacted in this code shall remain in full force and effect unless

Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters or sections of this code, as
originally enacted, or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered
by the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only, and do not affect the meaning,
application or construction of the law they precede.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only, and is not a part of the section.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent

or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.

the circumstances.
(`90 Code, Â§ 8.46.090)
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â In the event that a quorum of the Common Council cannot be assembled

disposal of the Council hereunder for emergency management purposes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The Council may order volunteer forces to the aid of the county,
state or political subdivisions thereof as soon as practicable. Those volunteer
forces will be under the direction of the Department of Civil Defense and
Emergency Management.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The Council may, to the extent permitted by I.C. 10-4-1-25 and
subject to its provisions, command services from and/or requisition the use of
equipment, facilities, supplies or other property belonging to other
organizations, corporations or private persons as necessary to control the
emergency and protect and provide for the public safety and welfare.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â The Council may order the evacuation of all or part of the
population from stricken areas of the city and prescribe routes, modes of
transportation and destinations for the evacuation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â The Council may make provision for availability and use of
temporary emergency housing, which housing need not necessarily comply with any
minimum housing standards, building or zoning regulations and the like, which
would govern the use and location of premises for housing purposes during
normal times.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â The Council may suspend, for the duration of the state of
emergency, or for a lesser period as they determine, any provisions of or
procedures prescribed by ordinances of the city if they would be impractical
during the emergency, would interfere with the implementation and carrying out
of emergency plans or would be inimical to actions necessary to protect the
public safety and welfare; provided, however, that except in accordance with
division (A)(10) below, the Council may not suspend any provisions of
ordinances or procedures which are managed by statute.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â In the event of a state of emergency has been proclaimed by the
Governor or County Commissioners, the Council may also in accordance with I.C.
10-4-1 waive any procedures or requirements of statute or of city ordinances
reflecting statutory requirements and mandates, and pertaining to the
appropriation and expenditure of public funds, the incurrence of obligations,
the performance of public works, the entering into contracts, the employment of
permanent or temporary workers or utilization of volunteer workers, the rental
of equipment or the purchase and distribution of supplies, materials and
facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â The Council may assign special emergency duties and functions to
any city offices, departments, agencies, irrespective of their usual duties and
functions, and any unexpended and unencumbered monies budgeted and appropriated
for the operation of the offices, departments and agencies and not otherwise
dedicated by law to different and specified purposes may, within the scope of
each major budget and appropriation category (major object classification), be
utilized and expended for the purpose of carrying out the special emergency
duties and functions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (12)Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The Council may make and promulgate emergency regulations as
may be deemed necessary to protect life and property, preserve order, conserve
critical resources or implement and carry out the provisions of the cityâ€™s,
county's or state's disaster plans, including, but not limited to the power to
order the roads closed, establish curfews, close business or any action that
they deem necessary to save lives and recover from a declared emergency.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â This power also includes the power to supplement, modify or
suspend any general contingency regulations which may have been incorporated as
part of the city's previously adopted emergency operations plan. Any emergency
regulations adopted under this division shall not be effective until
promulgated, which promulgation shall be by written filing in the office of the
Clerk-Treasurer of the city, as required by I.C. 10-4-1; provided, however,
that should the filing be impossible because of the emergency situation, the
regulations shall be effective and enforceable notwithstanding.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The regulation shall have the full force of law and shall be
enforceable by any police officer in accordance with I.C. 10-4-1.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (13)Â Â Â The Council may request the county, state or the United States or
their agencies and political subdivisions to send aid, including financing
assistance, if the situation is beyond the control of the regular and emergency
city forces and resources.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â All actions and regulations under this section may be by executive
order and need not be made or adopted hereby, but shall be consistent with and
subordinate to any actions, orders or regulations made by the Governor or a
state agency implementing state emergency operations plans.
(`90 Code, Â§ 8.46.110) (Ord. 90-38, passed - -)
Â§ 35.10 DIRECTOR; SPECIAL POWERS AND DUTIES.

advise the Common Council or the principal executive officer on any actions
which it would be necessary or desirable to take under
Â§ 35.09 in the event of an emergency.
(`90 Code, Â§ 8.46.120)
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â In the event that an emergency clearly exists or is imminent within
the city and a state of emergency has not been declared by the Governor or
County Commissioners, nor is any person having the powers of the principal
executive officer of the city present to declare an emergency, pursuant
Â§ 35.08(A), the Director may temporarily presume the existence of a state of
emergency even though not officially declared and may, as his or her own
judgment dictates, invoke, implement and carry out the provisions of the city's
adopted comprehensive emergency management and disaster control plan as are
necessary to cope with the emergency and protect the public safety and welfare,
and shall be construed to leave all powers necessary and dispensable to doing
so to the extent not specifically limited by statute or specifically limited
herein, until such time as a principal executive officer becomes available.
Assistance from the Department of Civil Defense and Emergency Management may be
rendered without a declaration of an emergency in order to assist local
emergency services in time of need.

management volunteers or other authorities from implementing, carrying out and

as of the sixteenth day after the date of mailing of the billing, notifying the

other hardship, the customer may be eligible to avoid disconnection of
utilities by entering into a written agreement for the payment of the
delinquent amounts in installments over a period not to exceed three months,
and agreeing to pay all undisputed future bills for utility service as they
come due, provided that the customer has not breached a similar agreement with
the city within the past 12 months. Application for a delinquent utility
account agreement must be made within 14 days after the date of the delinquency
and disconnection notice.

which the reconnection is applied, a cash deposit in the amount herein above
established, or in an amount sufficient to equal the meter deposit herein above
required in the event there exists a credit balance in favor of the customer on

Â§ 52.42 RESPONSIBILITY.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The city Water Superintendent (the â€œSuperintendentâ€) shall be
responsible for the protection of the public potable water distribution system
from contamination or pollution due to the backflow or backsiphonage of
contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. If, in the
judgment of said Superintendent, an approved backflow device is required at the
city's water service connection to any customer's premises, the Superintendent,
or its delegated agent, shall give notice in writing to said customer to
install an approved backflow prevention device at each service connection to
his or her premises. The customer shall install such approved device, or
devices, at his or her own expense, and failure or refusal, or inability on the
part of the customer to install said device or devices, shall constitute a
ground for discontinuing water service to the premises until such device or
devices have been properly installed.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The customer has the responsibility for protecting both the public
water supply and his or her internal potable water. After the Superintendent
has determined the type and location of backflow protection required, the
customer shall be responsible for procuring installing, testing, repair, and
maintenance of the required assembly to protect the public water supply. The
customer is also responsible for preventing the contamination and pollution of
his or her internal water system through a program of fixture outlet
protection. He or she may utilize public health officials, plumbing inspectors,
or other backflow specialists to assist him in the survey of his or her
facilities and to assist in the selection of proper fixture outlet devices and
the proper installation of these devices.
(Ord. 2009-23, passed 8-18-2009; Am. Ord. 2013-34, passed 10-24-2013)

Superintendent if a backflow prevention assembly required by this policy is not
installed, tested, and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow prevention
assembly has been removed or bypassed, or if an unprotected cross connection
exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or
defects are corrected.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The Board recognizes the threat to the public water system arising
from cross connections. All threats will be classified by degree of hazard and
will require the installation of approved reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention devices (RP) or double check valve assembly (DC).
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â An approved RP shall be installed on each commercial, industrial, and
certain other facilities' service lines at or near the property line or
immediately inside the building before the first branch leads off the service
line wherever the following conditions exist:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Any facility that is being constructed or remodeled or is
undergoing a change in ownership or occupancy.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any existing facility required to have backflow protection per 327
I.A.C. 8-10-4.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Any existing facility where multiple, potential or actual,
protected or unprotected cross connections exist.

tanker trucks, spraying trucks, and other containers.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â A customer may request to be exempt from the installation of an RP
device on the service line. The customer shall submit an application to the
Board requesting approval for the installation of an alternate device or a
waiver from installing a device. If an exemption is granted and a change in use
occurs at the facility, the exemption shall no longer be valid and the customer
shall install an RP device or reapply for an exemption. The following will
generally be exempt from the installation of an RP on the service line:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Fire protection systems that do not contain hazardous chemicals may
be protected by a properly installed double check detector check assembly.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Land irrigation systems that are not under back-pressure may be
protected by a properly installed pressure vacuum breaker.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Any backflow prevention device existing prior to implementation of
this policy and properly maintained shall be allowed by the Superintendent to
continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the
effectiveness of the present backflow preventer or result in an unreasonable
risk to the public health.

Â§ 55.093 CHARGES; VOLUME, STRENGTH AND CHARACTER OF INDUSTRIAL SEWAGE.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered to industrial users, the city shall base its
charges not only on volume, but also on the strength and character of
industrial sewage and wastes it is required to treat and dispose of. The city
shall require the owner or other industrial user to determine the strength and
content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly,
into the sanitary sewage system, in such a manner and by such a method as the
city may deem practicable in light of the conditions and attending
circumstances of the case, in order to determine the proper charge. The owner
or other industrial user shall furnish a central sampling point available to
the city at all times.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a biochemical
oxygen demand of 300 milligrams per liter of fluid, suspended solids in excess
of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid, and total ammonia nitrogen in excess of
30 milligrams per liter. Additional charges for treating industrial waste that
is stronger than normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Rate surcharge based upon BOD. There shall be an additional charge
of $0.20 per pound of biochemical oxygen demand in excess of 300 milligrams per
liter of fluid.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Rite surcharge based upon suspended solids. There shall be an
additional charge of $0.20 per pound of suspended solids in excess of 250
milligrams per liter of fluid.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Rate surcharge based upon ammonia nitrogen (NH3N). There shall be
an additional charge of $0.70 per pound of ammonia nitrogen (NH3N) received in
excess of 30 milligrams per liter of fluid.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Determination of strength by samplings and analysis. To determine
the strength of the sewage and wastes, samplings and analysis shall be made
from time to time, whenever it is deemed advisable by the city. After charges
have been established, based upon the strength of sewage and wastes, the owner
may request reconsideration of these charges by the city, by submitting
analysis of composite samples of the sewage and wastes subject to the charges,
certified by a registered engineer or qualified graduate chemist. The city may
then adjust the charges to the ordinance rates required by the analysis, or may
recheck the findings by additional samplings and analysis.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Guidelines and procedures to follow in the determination. The
determination of suspended solids, five-day biochemical oxygen demand and
ammonia nitrogen (NH3N) contained in the waste shall be made in accordance with
the latest copy of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage and
Industrial Wastes, as written by the American Public Health Association, the
American Water Works Association, and the Water Pollution Control Federation,
and in conformance with Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of
Pollutants, CFR pt. 136, published in the Federal Register on October 16, 1973.

Â Â Â In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain fair and
equitable, and be in proportion to the cost of providing services to the
various users or user classes, the city shall cause, on an annual basis, a
study to be made within a reasonable period of time following the normal
accounting period. The study shall include, but not be limited to, an analysis
of the costs associated with the treatment of excessive strength effluents from
industrial users, volume and delivery flow rate characteristics attributed to
the various users or user classes, the financial position of the sewage works
and the adequacy of its revenue to provide reasonable funds for operation and
maintenance, replacement, debt service requirements and capital improvements to
the waste treatment system. The studies shall be conducted by officers and/or
employees of the city, or by a firm of certified public accountants, and/or by
a firm of consulting engineers with experience in such studies.

and commercial users shall be determined on the basis of the EDUs served by the
connection, as based on the area ratio of the water service meter serving the
industrial or commercial user. An equivalent dwelling unit (EDU) shall be based
upon a three-quarter-inch water service meter.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Availability charge.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â There is hereby established a sewer availability charge for any
lot, parcel of real estate, or building connecting onto any local sewer, sewer
interceptor or sewer main hereafter constructed by the city. The amount of the
sewer availability charge shall be determined from time to time by the Board of
Public Works and Safety, and shall be based on the pro rata cost (per each
equivalent dwelling unit) of constructing the local sewer, sewer interceptor,
or sewer main sufficient to serve the lot, parcel of real estate, or building.
The owner of any lot, parcel of real estate, or building connecting to the
sewage works shall, prior to being permitted to make a connection, pay the
applicable sewer availability charge.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Public Works and Safety
may, from time to time, enter into contracts with the owners of real property
for the construction of sewer main extensions within the municipality, or
within four miles outside of its corporate boundaries, in order to provide
service to an area pursuant to the provisions of I.C. 36-9-22 et seq. In such
event, the Board of Public Works and Safety may establish and collect from any
owner of real property who did not contribute to the original cost of the
sanitary sewer main extension, and who subsequently taps onto, uses or deposits
sewage into the sewage main extension or any lateral sewers connected thereto,
a sewer availability charge, based upon a fair pro rata share of the cost of
the construction of the sewer main extension.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Installment payments. The Board of Public Works and Safety may
establish and place into effect, from time to time, as a matter of policy, a
method of payment and collection of the connection charges and availability
charges on an installment basis, with or without interest, subject to the
penalties and remedies for nonpayment and collection when due, all as provided
by this chapter or by law.

the installation of properly functioning smoke detectors.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Any person, firm, corporation or other entity violating the provisions

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
Â§ 154.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
Â Â Â The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Common Council of City of Huntingburg, Indiana does hereby adopt the following
floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 2021-24, passed 8-10-2021)
Â§ 154.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of City of Huntingburg, Indiana are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-proofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 2021-24, passed 8-10-2021)
Â§ 154.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
Â Â Â It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the City of Huntingburg, Indiana by fulfilling the requirements of
the National Flood Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2021-24, passed 8-10-2021)

DEFINITIONS
Â§ 154.015 DEFINITIONS.
Â Â Â Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
Â Â Â ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole bams, and hay sheds.
Â Â Â ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
Â Â Â APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
Â Â Â AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
Â Â Â A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A ZONES,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â ZONE AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones
A1-A30.)
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
Â Â Â BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
Â Â Â BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
Â Â Â BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
Â Â Â BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
Â Â Â BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
Â Â Â BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
Â Â Â COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
Â Â Â COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular
program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
Â Â Â CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.

preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
Â Â Â FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to
as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention
ordinance, and floodplain management requirements.
Â Â Â FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
Â Â Â FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.

floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
Â Â Â FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights

Â Â Â FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
Â Â Â HARDSHIP. As related to variances of this chapter:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant
the requested variance. The City of Huntingburg Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA)
requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the
property involved.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional.
Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal
preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule,
qualify as an exceptional HARDSHIP. All of these problems can be resolved
through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is
more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the
parcel to a different use than originally intended.
Â Â Â HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.

damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC coverage.
Â Â Â LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
Â Â Â LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include letter of map amendment (LOMA), letter of map revision
(LOMR), and letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in
a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is
only issued by FEMA.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision

pillars.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement,
below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square

will bear. MARKET VALUE can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or
adjusted assessed values.
Â Â Â MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of MITIGATION
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of

or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
Â Â Â ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the
letter A is subject to the 1% annual chance flood. See REGULATORY FLOOD.
Â Â Â PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community's FEMA
map to affect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain
boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These
changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements,
annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base
flood elevations or SFHAs.

intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood-prone areas.
Â Â Â SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdiction of the
City of Huntingburg subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of
City of Huntingburg, Indiana are generally identified as such on the Dubois

The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds

does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements.
Â Â Â SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
Â Â Â VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
Â Â Â VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.

Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
Â Â Â ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type
of flooding in the area.
Â Â Â ZONE A. See definition for A ZONE.

the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. 2021-24, passed 8-10-2021)
Â§ 154.069 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Located within SFHAs, established in Â§
154.026, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving and the like, undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.)
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in Â§Â§
154.065 et seq. of this chapter have been met. The floodplain development
permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit for construction in a
floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a
community's more restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse effect is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory
flood elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-
floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses. For all projects
involving channel modifications or fill (including levees) the City of
Huntingburg shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR Â§ 65.12.
(Ord. 2021-24, passed 8-10-2021)
Â§ 154.070 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
Â Â Â If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in Â§Â§
154.065 et seq. of this chapter have been met. The key provision is that the
top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be
at or above the FPG.
(Ord. 2021-24, passed 8-10-2021)
Â§ 154.071 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in Â§Â§
154.065 et seq. of this chapter have been met.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in Â§Â§
154.065 et seq. of this chapter have been met.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development shall not adversely affect
the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This
adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory
flood of at least fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by
comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that
under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A showing of good and sufficient cause.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to Â§
154.069 or Â§
154.071(A) of this chapter may be granted.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Any variance granted in a floodway subject to Â§
154.069 or Â§

Natural Resources.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of Â§
155.066, may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance

the reduced lowest floor elevation (see Â§
154.089).
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or

Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Any applicant to whom a variance is granted that allows the lowest
floor of a structure to be built below the flood protection grade shall be
given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the flood
protection grade will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Such construction below the flood protection grade increases risks
to life and property.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance.
(Ord. 2021-24, passed 8-10-2021)

the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of
the structure.
(Ord. 2021-24, passed 8-10-2021)
Â§ 154.091 SPECIAL CONDITIONS.
Â Â Â Upon the consideration of the factors listed in Â§Â§

continues to exist.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The City of Huntingburg Floodplain Administrator shall inform the
owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood
damages, and therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy
to be suspended.
