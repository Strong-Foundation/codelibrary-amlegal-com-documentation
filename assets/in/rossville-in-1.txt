titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the “Rossville

same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.

   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted, amending, or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.

   (A)   This code is a codification of previously existing laws, amendments

to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings are for
organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning, application, or
construction of the law they precede. Each note following a section of this
code is for reference purposes only and is not a part of the section.

amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.

§ 52.018  WATER DISCHARGE MEASUREMENTS; METERS.
   (A)   The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewage system and
obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the town shall be
determined by the town in such manner as the town shall reasonably elect, and
the sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates; except as
hereinafter provided in this section, the town may make proper allowances in
determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be
consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the town that such
quantities do not enter the sanitary sewage system.
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building other than a
single-family dwelling unit discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes,
water, or other liquids into the town’s sanitary sewage system, either directly
or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied by the water utility serving the
town, and the water used thereon or therein is not measured by a water meter,
or is measured by a water meter not acceptable to the town, then the amount of
water used shall be otherwise measured or determined by the town. In order to
ascertain the rate or charge provided in this subchapter, the owner or other
interested party shall, at his or her expense, install and maintain meters,
weirs, volumetric devices, or any adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the town for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (C)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the town, and in addition, is a user of
water from another source which is not measured by a water meter or is measured
by a water meter not acceptable to the town, then the amount of water used
shall be otherwise measured or determined by the town. In order to ascertain
the rates or charges, the owner or other interested parties shall, at his or
her expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices
or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the town for
the determination of sewage discharge.
   (D)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and
the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each such
case, for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for
each user and the base charge and the flow rates and charges shall apply to
each of the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate, or buildings
served through the single water meter.
   (E)   In the event two or more dwelling units such as mobile homes,
apartments, or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other
liquids into the town’s sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly,
are users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a single service in
the manner set out elsewhere herein, except that a minimum charge, in the
amount of $12 per month per dwelling unit served through the single water meter
shall apply. In the case of mobile home courts, the number of dwelling units
shall be computed and interpreted as the total number of mobile home spaces
available for rent plus any other dwelling units served through a meter. A
dwelling unit shall be interpreted as a room or rooms or any other space or
spaces in which cooking facilities are provided.
   (F)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess
of 20,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the
town that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not
and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other interested
party shall, at his or her expense, install and maintain meters, weirs,
volumetric measuring devices, or any adequate and approved method of
measurement acceptable to the town for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (G)   In order that domestic and residential users of sewage service shall
not be penalized for the sprinkling of lawns during the months of June, July,
and August, the billing for sewage service for residences and/or domestic users
for said months of June, July, and August shall be based upon the average water
usage for the previous months of January, February, March if it is greater than
the water usage of said months of June, July, and August, then the billing for
sewage service shall be computed on the actual water used in the month for
which the sewage bill is being rendered. Domestic and/or residential sewage
service, as applicable to the sprinkling rate, shall apply to each lot, parcel
of real estate, or building which is occupied and used as a residence. Said
sprinkling rate shall not apply to any premises which are partially or wholly
used for industrial or commercial purposes. In the event a portion of such
premises shall be used for commercial or industrial purposes, the owner shall
have the privilege of separating the water service so that the residential
portion of the premises is served through a separate meter, and in such case,
the usage as registered by the water meter serving such portion of the premises
used for residential purposes would qualify under the sprinkling rate.

   (A)   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered to users, the town shall base its charges not
only on the volume, but also on the strength and character of the stronger-
than-normal domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and
dispose of. The town shall require the user to determine the strength and
content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly,
into the sanitary sewage system in such manner, by such method, and at such
times as the town may deem practicable in light of the conditions and attending
circumstances of the case in order to determine the proper charge. The user
shall furnish a central sampling point available to the town at all times.
   (B)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed ammonia of 50
mg/l of fluid, suspended solids in excess of 250 mg/l of fluid or biochemical
oxygen demand in excess of 250 mg/l of fluid. Additional charges for treating
stronger-than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis:
      (1)   Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids. There shall be an
additional charge of $0.11 per pound of suspended solids for suspended solids
received in excess of 250 mg/l of fluid.
      (2)   Rate surcharge based upon BOD. There shall be an additional charge
of $0.11 per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for BOD received in excess of
250 mg/l of fluid.
      (3)   Rate surcharge based upon ammonia. There shall be an additional
charge of $0.71 per pound of ammonia for ammonia received in excess of 50 mg/
l of fluid.
   (C)   The determination of suspended solids, five day BOD, and ammonia
contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the latest copy of Standard
Methods for the Elimination of Water, Sewage, and Industrial Wastes as written
by the American Public Health Association, the American Water Works
Association, and the Water Pollution Control Federation, and in accordance with

the date on which this subchapter goes into effect. Such study shall include,
but not be limited to, an analysis of the cost associated with the treatment of
excessive strength effluents from industrial users, volume, and delivery flow
rate characteristics attributed to the various users or user classes, the
financial position of the sewage works and the adequacy of its revenue to
provide reasonable funds for the operation and maintenance, replacements, debt
service requirements, and capital improvements to the wastewater treatment
system.
   (B)   (1)   Thereafter, on a biennial basis, within a reasonable period of
time following the normal accounting period, the town shall cause a similar
study to be made for the purpose of reviewing the fairness, equity, and
proportionality of the rates and charges for sewage services on a continuing
basis.
      (2)   Said studies shall be conducted by officer or employees of the town
or by a firm of certified public accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers
which firms shall have experience in such studies, or by such combination of
officers, employees, certified public accountants, or engineers as the town
shall determine to be best under the circumstances.
      (3)   The town shall, upon completion of said study, revise and adjust
the rates and charges, as necessary, in accordance therewith, in order to
maintain the proportionality and sufficiency of the rates.

permits and report thereof such shall be conducted in accordance with rules and
regulations adopted by the U.S. EPA, 40 C.F.R. part 136 and any subsequent
revisions subject to approval by the town. In the event that no special manhole
has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer
is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analysis
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and S.S. analysis are obtained from 24-hour
composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab
samples.
   (H)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the town and any

conduct they have been made aware, or ought to have become aware, by the
exercise of reasonable care.

health, welfare, or safety, or materially devalues and interferes with the
peaceful enjoyment by owners on occupants of adjacent property;
      (5)   To erect, use, or maintain a dwelling which is unfit for human
habitation. A DWELLING shall include any part of any building or its premises
used as a place of residence or habitation or for sleeping by any person. A
dwelling is UNFIT FOR HUMAN HABITATION when it is dangerous or detrimental to

limited to, continual pounding, continual barking by one or more dogs,
unnecessary sounding of horns, racing the motor or causing the screeching or
squealing of tires on any vehicles, radios, or phonographs or televisions, and
sound trucks or public address systems. The temporary use of machinery for the
use of lawn maintenance, landscaping, bush trimming and removal, tree trimming
and removal, weed cutting, construction, and snow removal equipment shall be an
exception to the above prohibited noise as long as it is during normal waking
hours, or in the case of a recognized emergency;
      (10)   To cause or allow debris, junk, noxious weeds, such an
accumulation on any premises of filth, trash, garbage, or other waste materials

clearance over streets or less than eight feet over sidewalks, or the growing
and maintenance of shrubbery in excess of three feet in height within the
radius of 20 feet from the point where the curb line of any street intersects
the curb line of another street. No shrub shall be planted between the curb
line of any street within a radius of 20 feet from the point where the curb
line of any street intersects with the curb line of another street;
      (14)   It shall be required of, and made the duty of, each and every
person, firm, or corporation having the management or control or being the
owner, occupant, or agent of any lot, parcel of ground, or tract of land
located within the town, to destroy tall grass, weeds, or noxious or noisome
vegetation by mowing or killing them by flame or chemical as necessary so that
the grass, weeds, or vegetation do not attain a height of more than eight
inches from the ground, but said grass, weeds, or noxious, noisome, or
offensive vegetation shall be destroyed by mowing or killing, no less often
than four separate and distinct time each year, with each separate and distinct
time being at least one month subsequent to the last mowing or killing and
prior to May 1, June 15, August 1, and September 15 of each year hereafter. The
failure to do so, by any person, firm, or corporation, shall constitute a civil
violation of this subchapter;
      (15)   To allow, cause, or permit the parking or stopping of a vehicle of
any kind on a sidewalk, walkway, or path that would prohibit the use of said
sidewalk, walkway, or path in whole or in part by the pedestrian traffic.

Marshal and approved by the Town Council, to serve notice upon the owner of the
premises where such nuisance exists and upon any other person so causing such
nuisance to abate such nuisance within 15 days of said notice.

reasonable to abate said nuisance, and the Town Clerk shall make a certified
statement of the actual cost incurred by the town in such removal, which
statement shall be delivered to the owner of such real estate by the Town
Marshal, or by certified mail, or where appropriate, by publication, provided
such owner shall have been served with notice as provided in division (A) above
and such owner shall have not more than ten days within which to pay said
amount to the Clerk-Treasurer. If such owner failed to pay said sum within the
time prescribed, a certified copy of the statement of such costs shall be filed
in the Auditor’s office of the county wherein said real estate is located, and
the said Auditor shall place the amount so claimed on the tax duplicate against
the real estate of the owner affected by said work, and the same shall be
collected as taxes are collected or said costs may be collected by suit;
      (3)   The Town Council may cause such nuisance to be abated in any manner
authorized by law, including the institution in the name of the town against
the owner, occupant, or other person, of any action therefor and for the

name or names the real estate taxes on said real estate are shown on record in
the office of the Auditor of the county, wherein said real estate is located,
by registered or certified mail to the last known address of the person or
persons sought to be notified, or when the address of such person or persons is
unknown, by publication of said notice once each week for three consecutive
weeks in a newspaper of countywide circulation, published in the county.
      (2)   Once the initial notice has been provided, a continual abatement
notice may be posted at the property at the time of abatement instead of by
registered or certified mail.
      (3)   A continuous abatement notice shall serve as notice to the real
property owner or occupant that each subsequent violation during the same year
for which the initial notice of the violation was provided may be abated by the
municipality or its contractors.
