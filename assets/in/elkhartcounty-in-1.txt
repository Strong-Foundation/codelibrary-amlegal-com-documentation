   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the county, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered and consolidated into component codes, titles,
chapters, subchapters and sections, shall be known and designated as the
Elkhart County Code for which designation “code of ordinances,” “codified
ordinances,” or “code” may be substituted. Code title, chapter, subchapter and
section headings do not constitute any part of the law as contained in the
code.
(Prior Code, § 1-1-1-1)
§ 10.02 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition and application shall govern the

§ 10.03 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.04 CONSTRUCTION OF CODE.
   (A)   This code is a codification of previously existing ordinances, orders
and resolutions, amendments, and newly enacted ordinances. Any previously
existing ordinance, order or resolution or amendment thereto included in this
code shall continue in operation and effect, as if it had not been repealed by
this code. All rules and regulations adopted under any ordinance, order or
resolution in this code shall remain in full force and effect unless repealed
or amended subsequent to the adoption of this code.
   (B)   The numerical order and position of sections in this code does not
resolve a conflict between two or more sections.
   (C)   Any irreconcilable conflict between sections shall be resolved by
reference to the dates that the sections were originally adopted. The ordinance
most recently adopted supersedes any conflicting ordinance or section.
   (D)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the number in the original ordinance, order
or resolution.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of any
previously existing ordinance, order or resolution refer to the new code
numbers assigned to that ordinance, order or resolution.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical prefixes assigned to the various titles, chapters
and sections of this code, as originally adopted or as added by amendment, are
an integral part of this code and may be altered by only specific amendment.
      (2)   The descriptive headings assigned to the various titles, chapters,
subchapters and sections of this code, as originally adopted, or as added by
amendment, are not law, and may be altered by the compilers of this or any
subsequent codification, in any official publication, to more clearly indicate
its content. These descriptive headings are for organizational purposes only,
and do not affect the meaning, application or construction of the law they
precede.
      (3)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only, and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(Prior Code, § 1-1-1-5)

§ 10.06 SEVERABILITY.

not affect other provisions that can be given effect without the invalid
provision or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section containing a nonseverability
provision, each part and application of every section is severable. If any
provision or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with, and
so dependent upon, the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of when
the section was enacted.

or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OFFICES; NAME DESIGNATIONS.
   (A)   Reference to offices. Reference to a public office or officer shall be
deemed to apply to any office, officer or employee of this county exercising

any transfer of functions or change in the official title of the functionary.
   (B)   Name designations. Whenever any ordinance or resolution refers to any
board, bureau, commission, division, department, officer, agency, authority or
instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is incorrectly
stated, on the effective date of that ordinance or following the effective
date, the rights, powers, duties or liabilities placed with that entity are or
were transferred to a different entity, then the named board, bureau,
commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date
or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which the duties,
liabilities, powers and rights were transferred.
(I.C. 1-1-6-1) (Prior Code, § 1-1-6-1)
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
the error.
§ 10.10 REASONABLE TIME.
   (A)   In all cases where an ordinance requires an act to be done in a
reasonable time or requires reasonable notice to be given, reasonable time or
notice shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of the act or the giving of the notice.
   (B)   The time within which an act is to be done, as herein provided, shall
be computed by excluding the first day and including the last. If the last day
be a Saturday, Sunday or a state holiday, it shall be excluded.
§ 10.11 EFFECT OF REPEAL OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
an ordinance, resolution or order adopted prior to the adoption of this code,
the former section or law is not revived unless it so expressly provides. The
repeal of any section shall not extinguish or release any forfeiture, liability
or penalty incurred under the section, unless the repealing section so
expressly provides. That section shall remain in force for the purpose of
sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the
forfeiture, liability or penalty.

section either by indicating, with reference to the arrangement of this code,

a new ordinance, order, or resolution of a permanent and general nature without
specific reference to this code but which by its nature would be proper for

restricting home addresses on any county public property data base web site
will cause the following:
      (1)   The public property data base web site. Requests to restrict access
to home addresses affect either one or possibly multiple parcels that may
display the home address. A parcel's parcel identification number (PIN) will be
added to a suppression list if it would otherwise provide the covered person's
home address. The act of adding a parcel's PIN number to the suppression list
will redact the home address information for the affected parcel(s). Performing
a search on suppressed PINs will return no home address information.

information stored on internal county databases will still exist and may be
made available to the public, unless excepted, in accordance with the
provisions of the Indiana Access to Public Records Act at I.C. 5-14-3.
   (D)   Immunity and litigation proceedings. It is the intention of the county
to comply with the intent of the code to not make property information
associated with a home address accessible by means of removing the link between
home address and parcel information for a covered person who makes a request
under this policy. A unit may not be held liable for failure to timely restrict
disclosure of an address under I.C. 36-1-8.5, unless the unit's act or omission
constitutes gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct.
   (E)   Reversal of privacy settings. In accordance with I.C. 36-1-8.5-9, a
covered person may request reinstatement of his or her restricted address
information. To reinstate his or her restricted address information, a covered
person must provide appropriate identification to the county. The county will
determine whether a particular form of identification is appropriate under this
section.
   (F)   Confidentiality. A written request, notification of name change, or
any other information submitted to the county by a covered person under this
policy is confidential under I.C. 5-14-3-4(a).
   (G)   Amendments. The county reserves the right to amend or revise the
contents of this policy at any time. The revised policy will be available in
the Auditor's Office. This policy supersedes and replaces the prior Restricted
Addresses Policy dated March 9, 2020.

§ 30.038 COLLECTION FEE FOR RETURNED OR UNCOLLECTIBLE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS.
   (A)   Fee. All county agencies are herewith authorized and directed to
collect a fee of $20 from the person or entity who has issued to the county
agency a returned instrument which has been returned to the county agency, the
County Treasurer or any other department, office, agency, court or personnel of
the county government, as uncollectible (“return fee”). It is herewith
determined and established by the Board of Commissioners of the county that the
return fee is fair and reasonable, and reflects the time, expense,
inconvenience and loss to the county government of dealing with the returned
instrument.
   (B)   Time of collection. The return fee may be collected by a county agency
at any time, and shall be collected on or before the person or entity which
previously issued the returned instrument endeavors to pay or satisfy the
obligation previously intended to be satisfied by the returned instrument.
   (C)   Other costs or expenses. In addition to the return fee established by
this section, county agencies shall also be entitled and expected to recover
from the person or entity which has issued the returned instrument, on or
before the time of satisfaction of the amount intended to be paid by the
original negotiable instrument, any actual charge imposed upon the county
agency by the financial institution or other party upon which the returned
instrument was drawn but not honored.
   (D)   Other remedies unaffected. Nothing contained within this section is
intended to alter or diminish the other rights or remedies of the county
government to collect upon an otherwise uncollectible negotiable instrument, or
to interfere with the criminal law of the processing or criminal charges
against any person or entity which has issued an uncollectible negotiable
instrument in violation of state law. The purpose of this section is simply to
establish a return fee to be imposed by county agencies relative to returned
instruments consistent with standards and requirements of the State Board of
Accounts, and in a fashion similar to the imposition of fees by private
businesses that have received uncollectible negotiable instruments in payment
for goods or services.
   (E)   Effective date. This section shall become effective immediately upon
its adoption. Copies of this section shall be entered in the records of the
Board of Commissioners of the county and circulated among the various county
agencies to confirm the return fee herewith established.

is adopted as the intake fee payable to the county for each offender whose

by Community Corrections and does not affect fees charged by other third
parties, such as those for third-party monitoring of sex offenders’ computers.
   (L)   Offenders residing at certain third-party transitional or low-income
facilities. Offenders residing at certain third-party transitional or low-
income facilities qualify for a discount of 50% on fees Community Corrections
charges. The CCAB determines and maintains a list of qualifying facilities,
which list is subject to amendment by the CCAB from time to time. The discount

discount affects fees charged by Community Corrections and does not affect fees
charged by the qualifying facility or by other third parties, such as those for
third-party monitoring of sex offenders’ computers.

ELECTION PROVISIONS
§ 34.30 GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND COMPLIANCE WITH ELECTION LAWS AND POLITICAL
ACTIVITY RESTRICTIONS.
   (A)   All elected and appointed board members, commission members and office
holders of the governmental unit of the county (hereinafter referred to as
“officials of the county government”) are expected to comply with state and
federal election laws and the restrictions upon political activities applicable
to the county employees contained within the County Policy and Procedure Manual
in the same manner as all county employees. There shall thus be no distinction
between officials of the county government and county employees with respect to
compliance with state and federal election laws and with respect to
restrictions upon political activities as contained within the County Policy
and Procedure Manual. Officials of the county government are further expected
to cooperate with federal, state and county representatives with respect to
election law compliance and the proper administration of the County Policy and
Procedure Manual. Applicable state law shall determine whether an individual is
an official of the county government.
   (B)   Any complaints or reports of election law or political activity
violations by an official of the county government shall be immediately
reported the Human Resources Department for investigation and follow-up. The
county considers any allegation of an election law or political activity
violation to be a serious matter, and all officials of the county government
are expected to treat them seriously as well.
   (C)   The county recognizes and will honor its obligation to defend and
indemnify present or former public employees, including officials of the county
government, from non-criminal acts or omissions within the scope of their
employment which are alleged to violate state or federal election laws, and the
county desires to assure its officials of assistance and protection. Officials
of the county government need to be responsible and vigilant as well, however,
and recognize that election law violations will not be tolerated. Allegations
that an official of the county government has violated a state or federal
election law or a restriction upon political activity may result in any one or
more of the following actions being taken by the county:
      (1)   Referring the situation to the State Election Board, appropriate
prosecuting authority and/or the Attorney General;
      (2)   Referring the official of the county government to the employee
assistance program;
      (3)   Issuing a private or public reprimand of the official of the county
government;
      (4)   Seeking to recover some or all of the defense and indemnity costs
and obligations incurred on behalf of the official of the county government;
      (5)   Seeking to have an impeachment or removal proceeding initiated
against the official of the county government pursuant to state law; and/or
      (6)   Seeking to institute any other appropriate responsive action
available.
   (D)   The county fully intends to comply with state and federal election
laws, avoid violations thereof and consequent liability, and afford protection
to itself and all officials of the county government from meritless
allegations. The county requests and expects the sincere efforts and
cooperation of all officials of the county government involved in accomplishing
these goals.

   It shall be the duty of the Director—or the Deputy Director of Operations,
in the Director's absence—to make recommendations and advise the Board or the
principal executive officer on any actions which it would be necessary or
desirable to take under §
38.050 in the event of an emergency. The Director also may issue an "advisory"

§ 38.052 DESIGNATION OF LOCAL TRAVEL ADVISORY.
   (A)   (1)   If the principal executive officer of the county issues a local
travel advisory as part of an emergency declaration under §§

38.006,
38.020 through
38.030,
38.045 through
38.054 and
38.065, the principal executive officer shall designate the travel advisory as
falling into one of the following categories:
         (a)   Advisory. The lowest level of local travel advisory, means that
routine travel or activities may be restricted in areas because of a hazardous
situation, and individuals should use caution or avoid those areas. It is
assigned the color yellow.
         (b)   Watch. Means that conditions are threatening to the safety of
the public. During a "watch" local travel advisory, only essential travel, such
as to and from work or in emergency situations, is recommended, and emergency
action plans should be implemented by businesses, schools, government agencies,
and other organizations. It is assigned the color orange.
         (c)   Warning. The highest level of local travel advisory, means that
travel may be restricted to only emergency management workers, first response
broadcasters, and first response communications service providers. It is
assigned the color red. During a "warning" local travel advisory, individuals
are directed to:
            1.   Refrain from all travel;
            2.   Comply with necessary emergency measures;
            3.   Cooperate with public officials and disaster services forces
in executing emergency operations plans; and
            4.   Obey and comply with the lawful directions of properly
identified officers.
      (2)   Further and more specific restrictions, including parking
restrictions, may be included in a "warning" local travel advisory.
   (B)   If the Director or the principal executive officer of the county
determines that conditions within the county have created the need for travel
advisory restrictions without a local disaster emergency declaration under this
§§
38.001 through
38.006,
38.020 through
38.030,
38.045 through

or a "watch" level travel advisory.
   (C)   A "warning" level travel advisory may be issued only after a local
disaster emergency is declared under §§
38.001 through
38.006,
38.020 through
38.030,
38.045 through
38.054 and

   (D)   Employees shall remain assembled at a safe location until accounted
for and released to leave or return to their work place.
   (E)   Citizens present during an evacuation shall be instructed to follow

FEES FOR COPYING
§ 41.095 COPYING/REPRODUCTION FEE SCHEDULE.
   There is hereby established the following copying/duplication fee schedule
for all public agencies forming a part of the county government, except as

   (A)   Fees for paper copy. The copy fee for producing paper documents shall
be $0.10 for each page of any public record which is not a color copy and $0.25
for each page of any public record which is a color copy.
      (1)   Page definition. A PAGE shall be one side of a sheet of paper or

      (2)   Reassessment copying. All provisions hereof to the contrary
notwithstanding, no fee shall be charged a property owner or the agent thereof
requesting a copy of a property record card when the copy is requested and

reassessment on such property.
   (B)   Fees for electronic or digital copy.
      (1)   There will be no fee to provide an electronic copy of a public

notwithstanding, no fee shall be charged a property owner or the agent thereof
requesting an electronic or digital copy of a property record card when the
copy is requested and required as part of the appeals process pertaining to an
assessment or reassessment on the property.
      (3)   Media charges. Electronic or digital copies shall be provided via
email; the person requesting the electronic or digital copy shall provide an
accurate email address for sending the requested documents. If the person
requesting electronic or digital copies requests that the copies be provided on
a compact disc (CD) or other media, the person making the request shall either
supply the county government with the media to be used or pay to the county
government $1 for each compact disc utilized to provide the electronic or
digital copies.
   (C)   Packaging and shipping fees. Packaging and shipping fees shall be

§ 41.096 PROCEDURE FOR PROCESSING OF COPY REQUESTS.
   (A)   (1)   All requests for copying of public records must identify with
reasonable particularity the record being requested and, at the discretion of
each public agency serving the county government, be in writing or in a
standard form provided by the public agency.
      (2)   Thus, each public agency of the county government shall be entitled
to establish its own written request form or other means by which requests for
the inspection and/or copying of public records shall be processed; provided,
however, that each procedure so established by each public agency must be
uniformly applied, and be free of discrimination.
      (3)   Further, no request for inspection or copying of public records may
be denied because the person making the request refuses to state the purpose of
the request, unless that condition is required by operation of law. For a
public record that is in an electronic format, a public agency shall provide an
electronic or paper copy of the public record, at the option of the person
making the request for the public record.
   (B)   Each public agency shall be expected to provide copies of public
records, as herein requested, within a reasonable time period after the request
is properly made. A reasonable time period may vary from a few minutes to a few
weeks, depending upon the scope of the request, the time involved in honoring
it, the ability of the particular public agency to respond to the request given
its other duties and responsibilities, and the availability of copying or

ton; January 1, 2024, $38 per ton; January 1, 2025, $41 per ton; January 1,
2026, $45 per ton.
         (g)   The charges for haulers, including municipalities or other
governmental units, be they commercial, business, industrial, or otherwise, who
deliver 30,000 tons or more, but less than 40,000 tons annually, shall be set
beginning as follows: January 1, 2022, $32 per ton; January 1, 2023, $34 per

      (2)   Under no circumstances may haulers, including municipalities or
other governmental units, be they commercial, business, industrial, or
otherwise, who enter into an annual contract, be permitted to take advantage of
a rate not specifically selected and agreed to in advance in said annual
contract. Haulers, including municipalities or other governmental units, be
they commercial, business, industrial, or otherwise, who enter into an annual
contract and deliver less than the minimum tonnage agreed to in such annual
contract, remain liable for the full payment and value to the Elkhart County
Landfill of the minimum tonnage and corresponding rate agreed to and
established in such annual contract by such hauler(s). Thus by way of example,
if a hauler entered into an annual contract and committed to delivering more
than 30,000 tons but less than 40,000 tons to the Elkhart County Landfill over
a given 12 month period, as defined in the annual contract, and hence secured a
rate of $32 per ton in 2022, but only delivered 27,500 tons over such period,
such hauler would owe the Elkhart County Landfill $32 x 2,500 tons, or $80,000
above the amount owed by the hauler at $32/ton for the 27,500 tons actually
delivered.
   (C)   Rates for woodchip byproduct and crumb rubber. Effective January 1,
2022, there shall be a $13 charge for each ton of "woodchip byproduct" or
"crumb rubber," herein after defined, delivered to the Elkhart County Landfill,
for placement by any such delivery into designated areas established by the
Elkhart County Landfill, relative to the general disposal and reuse of woodchip
byproducts and crumb rubber. Said charge will increase on a yearly basis
thereafter beginning as follows: January 1, 2023, $16 per ton; January 1, 2024,
$19 per ton; January 1, 2025, $22 per ton; and January 1, 2026, $25 per ton.
Said charges shall be subject to increase or other adjustment by a specific
determination of the Board of Commissioners so as to meet economic or
competitive conditions and/or otherwise further the goals and interests of the
Elkhart County Landfill, and the proper disposition and use of woodchip
byproducts and crumb rubber at or through the facilities of the Elkhart County
Landfill. Any change from the fee per ton herewith set forth shall be
documented in the records of the Commissioners, and written notice of any such
change shall be submitted by the Commissioners to the Elkhart County Council
for placement in the records of the Elkhart County Council, and for merger of
such determination with public records and copies associated with this section.
   (D)   Private passenger vehicle rates. Effective January 1, 2022, except as
herein provided, no charge shall be imposed for loads delivered in private
passenger vehicles with Elkhart County license registration. Out of county or
out of state passenger vehicles shall be assessed a minimum charge of half the
rate as defined in division (A) above per delivery to the Elkhart County
Landfill irrespective of size of load, which shall include/cover the State of
Indiana solid waste management fees, Elkhart County solid waste management
fees, State of Indiana solid waste disposal fees, and/or any other mandatory
fees contemplated by division (O) below. The "no charge" standard for loads
delivered in private passenger vehicles with Elkhart County license
registration shall apply only to one trip per each calendar week to the Elkhart
County Landfill, made at such date and time as the Elkhart County Landfill may
direct, and made in such private passenger vehicle, and then only to the extent
that the load in such vehicle via such one free trip is no more than three bags
of trash or waste. For any load in excess of three bags, in such private
passenger vehicle with Elkhart County license registration, or for any second
trip to the Elkhart County Landfill in such vehicle during a calendar week, a
minimum fee of half the rate as defined in division (A) above per such second
or subsequent trip, and/or such load exceeding three bags, shall be imposed.
Should the load in any private passenger vehicle exceed three bags, and should
its actual load weight give rise to a higher charge per the standards of
division (A) above, the charge for such private passenger vehicle shall be
based upon the per ton rate of division (A) above, on a prorated basis, and not
on the minimum amount otherwise herein stated.
   (E)   Fees to be paid for each unit of e-waste.
      (1)   As has been the fee/rate since Ord. CC-2015-07, there shall be and
continue to be a $10 charge for each "unit" of "e-waste" delivered to the
Elkhart County Landfill, for placement by any such delivery:
         (a)   Into the bins, containers, or other devices established at the
Elkhart County Landfill to be used and made a part of the voluntary recycling
program, now in force and effect, or from time to time hereafter expanded,
modified, or otherwise re-determined; or
         (b)   Into the bins, containers, or other devices established by the
Elkhart County Landfill itself, relative to the general disposal of e-waste.
      (2)   Such $10 fee shall be subject to increase or other adjustment by a
specific determination of the Commissioners so as to meet economic or
competitive conditions, cover the costs of disposal of the e-waste, and/or
otherwise further the goals and interests of the Elkhart County Landfill, and
the proper disposition of solid waste at or through the facilities of the
Elkhart County Landfill. Any change from the $10 per delivery fee per unit
herewith set forth shall be documented in the records of the Commissioners, and
written notice of any such change shall be submitted by the Commissioners to
the Elkhart County Council for placement in the records of the Elkhart County
Council, and for merger of such determination with public records and copies
associated with this section.
   (F)   Rates for tires. Continuing since July 1, 2017, a $4 fee will be
charged for each passenger vehicle tire or bicycle tire delivered to the
Elkhart County Landfill. A $10 fee will be charged for each semi-tractor
trailer tire delivered to the Elkhart County Landfill. A $40 fee will be

   (G)   Rate for brush of governmental units. Effective January 1, 2022, a $30
fee will be charged for each load of brush ("brush rate"), hereinafter defined,
delivered to the Elkhart County Landfill by any formal governmental unit,
including municipalities, towns, and cities, which is located in Elkhart
County, Indiana. BRUSH is herewith defined as sticks, branches, limbs, grass
clippings, shrubs, and or bushes which are free of stumps, tree trunks,
excessive foreign debris, and/or renovation or demolition waste. Effective
January 1, 2025, the brush rate will increase to $40.
   (H)   Hauler loads not properly covered. Effective January 1, 2022, a $25
per vehicle admission fee, plus (in addition to) all fees or charges otherwise
imposed by this section, will be charged for all commercial, business, and
industrial haulers, including municipalities, and other governmental units
admitted to the Elkhart County Landfill using vehicles carrying uncovered or
inadequately covered loads. Such fees shall increase to $50 for the second time
any such vehicle so enters the Landfill and to $75 for the third such time. On
the fourth such attempted entry, use of the Landfill shall be denied. Said fee
shall not serve to alter or diminish the laws of this state or county which
pertain to littering, open dumping, or which otherwise restrict the disposal of
waste or trash proceeds.
   (I)   Service fee. Continuing since July 1, 2017, a $25 fee ("service fee")

any trash, waste, or refuse, from any vehicle, trailer, or container brought to
the Elkhart County Landfill by any persons, entities, commercial, business, and
industrial haulers, including municipalities, and other governmental units.
Said $25 service fee shall not serve to alter or diminish the laws of this
state or county which pertain to littering, open dumping, or which otherwise
restrict the disposal of waste or trash proceeds.
   (J)   Non-hauler loads not properly covered. Effective January 1, 2022, a
$20 per vehicle admission fee, plus (in addition to) all other fees or charges
otherwise imposed by this section, will be charged to all non-commercial and
non-business, non-industrial, and non-municipal or non-governmental haulers to
the Elkhart County Landfill using vehicles carrying uncovered or inadequately
covered loads. Such fees shall increase to $30 for the second time any such
vehicle so enters the Landfill and to $40 for the third such time. On the
fourth such attempted entry, use of the Landfill shall be denied. Said fee
shall not serve to alter or diminish the laws of this state or county which
pertain to littering, open dumping, or which otherwise restrict the disposal of
waste or trash proceeds.

Commissioners is authorized to deviate from the schedule of rates and charges
herein stated under the provisions of any inter-local agreement with any
municipality or other governmental unit, whether located within or without
Elkhart County, Indiana, as said Board of Commissioners shall, in its
discretion, determine to be in the best interests of the Elkhart County
Landfill operations. The "ability to compete" concept set forth at (b) above
shall provide to the Board of Commissioners the right and authority to modify
or amend, downward, rates and charges otherwise herein required for certain
loads or special hauling circumstances, for limited or extended periods of
time, to meet competition from competing landfills, to preserve account
relationships, to serve the public interests of the citizens of Elkhart County
relative to the proper disposal of solid waste, or for such other circumstances
as said Board shall, in its discretion, determine to be in the best interests
of Elkhart County Landfill operations and/or Elkhart County Government
generally. All provisions hereof to the contrary notwithstanding, the Board of
Commissioners shall be authorized to establish administrative guidelines
pursuant to which the Manager of the Elkhart County Landfill may allow certain
loads to be charged at "in county" rates rather than "out of county" rates
based upon the impracticality or limited importance of determining whether such
load originated, in part, from non-Elkhart County sources. The Board of
Commissioners shall be authorized to charge municipalities beginning as
follows: January 1, 2022, $20 per ton; January 1, 2023, $22 per ton; January 1,
2024, $23 per ton; January 1, 2025, $24 per ton; and January 1, 2026, $25 per
ton. Such guidelines are specifically contemplated for the benefit of haulers
serving geographic areas immediately adjacent to Elkhart County boundaries,
areas with Elkhart County mailing zip codes, or other geographic areas for
which haulers provide solid waste disposal services with a regular final
deposit of the solid waste into the Elkhart County Landfill. Such guidelines
shall be intended to save on administrative time and expense, as opposed to be
a method by which loads generating from non-Elkhart County sources shall
summarily receive the "in county" rate structure.
   (N)   False or misleading misstatements or representations with regard to
loads.
      (1)   Should any hauler, through its agents or employees, make what is
determined by the Manager of the Elkhart County Landfill to be a second
intentional misstatement or misrepresentation pertaining to the portion or
percentage of any load arising from Elkhart County sources, so as to seek or
attempt to secure a lower charge by the Elkhart County Landfill for said load,
the Manager of the Landfill shall notify said hauler in writing of such
determination on his part, shall impose or have imposed the full rate charge or
structure as and to said load, and shall continue to impose the full rate
structure as to any and all other or additional loads presented to the Elkhart
County Landfill, from said hauler, until such time as said hauler shall
petition to the Board of Commissioners for relief from such determination by
the Manager, which petition and/or ultimate presentation to the Commissioners
must explain the false or mistaken information given to the Elkhart County
Landfill, explain what remedial or other action has been taken to avoid such
mistakes or misrepresentations in the future, and otherwise provide assurance
to the Commissioners that such misrepresentation shall not in the future occur.
      (2)   Any hauler, through its agents or employees, twice determined to
have made false or misleading statements to the Elkhart County Landfill with
regard to percentage or portion of load arising from Elkhart County sources,
which should, at a subsequent time through its agents or employees, make such
false or misleading statements, may, at the discretion of the Manager of the
Elkhart County Landfill, be barred from entry to the Elkhart County Landfill,
for such period of time, or upon such terms and conditions, as said Manger,
with the advice and consent of the Board of Commissioners, shall determine.
   (O)   State, local, or other mandatory fees.
      (1)   Unless specifically stated above to be separate and additional, the
rates, fees, and charges previously set forth herein are intended to include,
cover, and satisfy the following:
         (a)   State of Indiana solid waste management fees. The amount of the
final disposal fee payable to the State of Indiana per the provisions of I.C.
13-20-22-1 et seq. as now in force and effect or as from time to time amended;
plus
         (b)   Elkhart County solid waste management fees. The amount of the
fee pursuant to the provisions of I.C. 13-21-13-1 et seq. as now in force and
effect or as from time to time expanded; plus
         (c)   State of Indiana solid waste disposal fees. The amount of the
solid waste disposal fees payable to the State of Indiana per the provisions of
I.C. 13-20-21-6 et seq. as now in force and effect or as from time to time
amended; plus
         (d)   Any other mandatory fees. The amount of any other mandatory fees
required by applicable federal, state, or local law or ordinances which shall
give rise to a fee to be imposed upon the final disposal of solid waste at the
Elkhart County Landfill.
      (2)   All provisions hereof to the contrary notwithstanding, the Board of
Commissioners shall be entitled to increase any or all of the rates, fees, and
charges at the Elkhart County Landfill, otherwise defined in this section to
address changes or increases to any of the fees, mandatory or otherwise,
specified by divisions (1)(a) through (d) above. Any change in rates, fees or
charges associated with such fees contemplated by divisions (1)(a) through (d)
above increasing shall be documented in the records of the Commissioners, and
written notice of any such change shall be submitted by the Commissioners to
the Elkhart County Council for placement in the records of the Elkhart County
Council, and for merger of such determination with the public records and
copies associated with this section.
   (P)   Commissioner determinations. All decisions of the Board of
Commissioners, or the active administration, staff, or the Manager at the
Elkhart County Landfill, with regard to the interpretation and/or
implementation of this section, are intended to be binding and fully
enforceable, without further involvement of the Elkhart County Council, or any
rights to challenge or appeal such determinations to the Elkhart County
Council.
   (Q)   Collection, enforcement, and attorney fees. Unless modified or
eliminated by an "annual contract," "inter-local agreement," or other contract
standard, the Elkhart County Landfill/Commissioners shall have the right and
authority to oversee collection of all fees, charges, and rates under this
section, and collect/recover penalty and attorney fees, consistent with the
provisions of I.C. 36-9-30-21(j) as currently in force and effect, or as
modified or relabeled hereafter.

      (1)   Minimum dosing chamber capacity shall be 800 gallons for pump
assisted systems or otherwise shall be sized no less than one bedroom
equivalent less than the total number of bedroom equivalents for the dwelling
as indicated on the permit application.
      (2)   Minimum septic tank sizing for all systems shall be 1,000 gallons.
   (C)   Reuse of existing private on-site sewage systems.  Requests for re-
utilization of existing private on-site sewage systems in conjunction with
dwelling reconstruction and/or replacement may proceed as follows.
      (1)   Continued use of an existing private on-site sewage system may be
considered when public health concerns have been demonstrated to have been
taken into account and the system is not contributing to a nuisance condition
nor exhibiting signs of failure. A review of each individual private on-site
sewage system record for the affected address must be made prior to issuance of
a zoning clearance and/or building permit for dwelling reconstruction and/or
replacement. Permission to use an existing private on-site sewage system does
not imply further trouble-free service. The Health Department will require
prompt repair and/or replacement upon observation and documentation of any
private on-site sewage system failure.
      (2)   In the interest of public health, application for use of existing
private on-site sewage systems will be scrutinized on an individual case-by-
case basis and will be prohibited unless all of the following conditions are
verified and confirmed:
         (a)   A record of a Health Department permit having been issued,
inspected and approved exists for the system;
         (b)   Adequate septic tank capacity and absorption field area exists
for the proposed use;
         (c)   Direct observation of system functioning (no obvious or apparent
signs of failure) is required and may be provided by a septic pumper/hauler.
The tank(s) must be pumped and cleaned for this evaluation of the tank(s) and
absorption field. The septic pumper/hauler must provide a report as to the
functioning, capacity and condition of the existing system;
         (d)   A “to scale” drawing must be provided as required to ensure that
isolation distances will remain intact; and
         (e)   A set of floor plans for the dwelling reconstruction and/or
replacement must be provided.
   (D)   Isolation distances.
      (1)   Isolation distances and encroachments shall meet the requirements
set forth in 410 I.A.C. 6-8.3-57 Separation Distances.
      (2)   Isolation distances shall remain intact on new construction.
Discretion may be utilized on repair or replacement systems on a case by case
basis, but never shall well, seasonal high water table or 100-year flood plain
isolation distances be reduced. Isolation distances are specified in 410 I.A.C.
6-8.3 and 410 I.A.C. 6-10-1.1. The isolation distance from a seasonal high
water table shall be 24 inches (vertical separation) for conventional systems
and 20 inches for elevated sand mound systems.
   (E)   On-site visits. Proposed improvements to property where a building
permit is required will necessitate an on-site visit by the Health Department
when:
      (1)   No record of a private on-site sewage system is found or exists
within the Health Department permit data files; or
      (2)   An on-site system resides on the property and is ten years or older
in age where the Health Department has an inspection record in the permit data
files with measurements but improvements are proposed outside the original
foundation of the dwelling.
   (F)   Minimum private on-site sewage system sizing for stand-alone systems.
The minimum sizing requirement for dwellings or outbuildings is 300 GPD.
(Ord. 2012-153, passed 4-16-2012)
§ 52.20 SUBDIVISION OF LAND.
   The Wastewater Treatment Assessment Matrix (The Matrix) and the
Environmental Health Technical Review and Development Standards (The Standards)
will be the tools used to evaluate the subdivision of land in regard to
sanitary facilities for the county. This subchapter will abide by and be in
concert with respect to the Subdivision Control Ordinance of Elkhart County,
Indiana (Ordinance 2009-67). The Matrix and The Standards are hereby
incorporated and adopted by reference. One copy of The Matrix and The Standards
shall be on file with the Health Department. Two copies of the Matrix and The
Standards are on file in the Auditor’s office for public inspection.
(Ord. 2012-153, passed 4-16-2002)
§ 52.21 SITE INVESTIGATION.
   (A)   Prior to construction permit application or permit issuance, an on-
site evaluation must be performed by the Health Officer to evaluate each lot or
parcel for suitability for a private on-site sewage system or privy, to
establish minimum sizing requirements and to ascertain any special engineering
necessary. Before an on-site evaluation will be performed, all lot corners must
be visibly marked so they can be easily located. All existing utilities (gas,
electricity, phone and any or all other utilities present on the property) must
be marked prior to providing a soil description.
   (B)   Soil borings.
      (1)   Repair and/or replacement systems. The minimum number of borings
required for repair and/or replacement private on-site sewage systems is one
per existing lot or parcel in the area of installation for the repair and/or
replacement.
      (2)   New construction. The minimum number of borings per lot or parcel
is one per proposed system location and must include the reserve area(s) or
such number as stipulated in The Matrix and The Standards, whichever is
greater.
(Ord. 2012-153, passed 4-16-2012)
§ 52.22 CONSTRUCTION PERMITS.
   (A)   No person shall construct, install, alter, repair, expand or replace a
private on-site sewage system without a valid construction permit issued
pursuant to this subchapter. The owner of any real estate where a private on-
site sewage system or privy is to be constructed or installed or where any
alteration, repair, expansion or replacement of an existing private on-site
sewage system is planned shall obtain a written construction permit before any
construction begins. The construction permit issued by the Health Officer must
be obtained prior to issuance of the building permit. The owner shall apply for
a construction permit on a form provided by the county. The owner shall
supplement the application form with plans, specifications and other
information deemed necessary by the Health Officer and as required by the
applicable state regulations. The applicant shall pay a construction permit and
inspection fee as set forth in the Health Department Fee Schedule Ordinance to
the Health Department at the time the application is filed. The issuance of a
construction permit shall not be construed as authority to violate, cancel or
set aside any of the provisions of this subchapter. Failure to obtain a
construction permit prior to system installation will result in the assessment
of a late fee as per the Health Department Fee Schedule Ordinance.
   (B)   A signed permit application by the owner or his or her agent will
serve as an affidavit to affirm the total number of bedrooms the dwelling will
have and must be confirmed with a complete corroborating set of floor plans for
each floor of the structure including the basement.
   (C)   The owner shall post the construction permit in a conspicuous place at
or near the dwelling or facility where the private on-site sewage system is
under construction. The notice shall be plainly visible from the public
thoroughfare nearest this structure.
   (D)   When a construction permit has expired or has been revoked, the work
specified on the private on-site sewage system permit shall not commence,
continue or resume unless a new application and fee have been submitted and a
new construction permit has been obtained.
   (E)   Fees. Any fees paid by check or other means which is rejected or
returned for insufficient funds will require payment of a $25 return fee,
require the bearer to make any such future payments on a “cash only” basis and
cause any permit to be suspended until full payment is made to the Health
Department.
   (F)   Permit fees are not refundable. Transfer of ownership of the real
estate for which a private on-site sewage system construction permit has been
issued shall automatically void the permit for that property; provided,
however, the transfer of ownership that occurs as a part of a contractual
agreement between builder and/or developer and the buyer shall not void the
permit if all other conditions of the permit remain the same.
   (G)   Construction permits for new construction issued under the provisions
of this subchapter or under any predecessor ordinance by the Health Officer or
the State Department of Health shall be valid for a period of two years from
the date of issuance.
   (H)   Construction permits issued for repair and/or replacement private on-
site sewage systems shall be valid for the period of one year.
   (I)   Construction permit expiration.
      (1)   Construction permits shall expire and become void upon satisfactory
completion of the specified work authorized or upon the date of expiration
specified by ordinance, specifically: one year from date of issuance for repair
or replacement permits and two years from date of issuance for new construction
permits.
      (2)   Construction permits may be authorized to be extended by the Health
Officer beyond the expiration date due to soil conditions being adverse to
typical installation methods, i.e., frost/frozen conditions, too wet, soil
moisture demonstrated to be beyond plastic limit and any other conditions which
might arise which would adversely affect system installation and/or functioning
or longevity.
(Ord. 2012-153, passed 4-16-2012)
§ 52.23 PLOT PLANS.
   (A)   The owner shall attach to the application for construction of a

   (B)   The Health Officer may suspend a permit to construct a private on-site
sewage system whenever information on the application or a plot plan is found
to be inaccurate. The Health Officer may revoke a permit to construct a private
on-site sewage system whenever information on the application or a plot plan is
found to be inaccurate and the inaccurate information will preclude or
eliminate the ability to lawfully install the system as designed.
(Ord. 2012-153, passed 4-16-2012)
§ 52.24 ABSORPTION FIELD.
   (A)   The soil absorption field must be located in an area such that the
proposed trench bottom is equal to or higher than the elevation of the 100-year
flood plain as designated on the FIRM. The infiltrative surface (i.e., the
ground surface) for elevated sand mounds must also be equal to or above the
elevation of the 100-year flood plain as designated on the FIRM.
   (B)   After a proposed soil absorption field installation area has been
selected and approved, the area in which it is to be installed shall not be
cut, filled, compacted, excavated, altered or disturbed, unless the alterations
performed are specified on the construction permit approved by the Health
Officer.
   (C)   In the event that an approved absorption field area is cut, filled,
compacted, excavated, altered or disturbed in a way which is not approved by
the Health Officer, the construction permit shall be void. If the damage can be
overcome or another area used, a new application for a construction permit can
be submitted along with a new construction permit fee which will be required.
   (D)   The area proposed for the soil absorption field shall be protected
from vehicular traffic by roping or fencing prior to construction permit
issuance. Vehicular traffic in the proposed absorption field area is permitted
only in connection with the installation of the absorption field under the
supervision of a registered installer. If the proposed absorption field area is
damaged, a new on-site evaluation will be required. If the soil characteristics
have changed, the construction permit will be void. If the damage can be
overcome or another area used, a new application for a permit can submitted
along with a new construction permit fee which will be required.
   (E)   Property alterations or additions such as garages, driveways, patios,
swimming pools and like structures or improvements shall not be placed on or
over the soil absorption field area or in any future expansion or reserve area
required under §
52.26.
   (F)   Discharges from foundation footing drains, air conditioners,
dehumidifiers, downspouts and other clear water drains shall not be allowed
into or onto the absorption field or in the area above the absorption field
where such would drain across the absorption field. A subsurface discharge
shall be utilized for such clear water discharges.
   (G)   Where it is necessary to pump sewage from an area below the
residential sewer or the facility sewer, a separate leak-proof sump shall be
provided exclusively for such purposes.
(Ord. 2012-153, passed 4-16-2012)
§ 52.25 REPAIRS.
   The Health Officer by issuing a construction permit to repair a private on-
site sewage system does not thereby approve of the system nor acknowledge that
the system meets all requirements of the county or the Indiana State Department
of Health. The Health Officer does recognize that a number of older private on-
site sewage systems in the county cannot meet current requirements due to site
or system limitations and that proposals for repair must make the best use of
the available space and the system and must meet acceptable standards in the
interests of public health. Isolation distances will be required to be
maintained to wells, seasonal high water tables and the 100-yr flood plain as
designated on the FIRM.
(Ord. 2012-153, passed 4-16-2012)
§ 52.26 RESERVE AREA.
   (A)   Absorption fields for all lots in subdivisions whose plots are fully
and formally approved by the local Plan Commission and other public agencies
with the responsibility therefore and recorded with the County Recorder prior
to September 1, 1991 shall be designed and installed in a manner that best
utilizes the existing area and maximizes the potential for replacement,
expansion, or repair of the absorption field. No exemptions from the
requirements of 410 I.A.C. 6-8.3 et. seq. shall be granted.
   (B)   Lots in subdivisions that do not qualify under division (A) above
shall provide at least two times the required absorption area in suitable soils
to allow for the original and one replacement, expansion or repair of the
original absorption field. This area shall be reserved for the installation of
the original absorption field and one replacement, expansion or repair of the
absorption field. The use of the reserved area shall be limited to those uses
which will not decrease the size of the reserve area and will not decrease the
loading rate of the soils. Use of an alternating valve mechanism to utilize
both systems is preferred and shall be implemented upon installation of the
repair and/or replacement reserve area system. The existing system may not be
removed upon its failure, but shall remain intact on one side of an alternating
valve mechanism.
(Ord. 2012-153, passed 4-16-2012)
§ 52.27 SUBSURFACE DRAINS.
   (A)   Subsurface drains must be installed at least six inches into the
massive clay, glacial till or fragipan, and a four-inch diameter or greater
perforated pipe must be used and backfilled to or within two inches of the
surface with washed stone not larger than the stone used in the absorption
trenches or with material specified in 410 I.A.C. 6-8.3 for use in subsurface
drains.
   (B)   Subsurface drains may be employed with conventional trenches only
where the soils have a loading rate high enough to allow for rapid movement of
water to the drain in order to lower and maintain the water table at a depth of
24 inches below all absorption field trenches. Soils having a loading rate of
less than six-tenths gallons per day per square foot shall not be suitable for
the installation of a subsurface drain to rapidly lower and maintain a water
table. Should a person wish to attempt to use a subsurface drain of any
description to lower a water table in soils having a loading rate of less than
six-tenths gallons per day per square foot, then such person must demonstrate
to the satisfaction of the Health Officer that the proposed subsurface drain
can indeed rapidly lower and maintain the water table. To do so, at a minimum,
the subsurface drain must be installed at the prescribed depth and location to
potentially allow for the private on-site sewage system installation. Not less
than two piezometers will then be installed in the central area of the proposed
private on-site sewage system. The piezometers must be constructed of four-inch
schedule 40 PVC with a secure cap. One shall be installed to a depth of at
least 12 inches below the level at which the lowered water table is to be
maintained. The second piezometer must be installed as directed by the Health
Officer in the surface soils and into the first indication of soil mottling.
The piezometers must remain available for review by the Health Officer through
at least one high water table period (December through June) to verify that the
water table can be lowered and maintained before a permit for the private on-
site sewage system will be considered.
   (C)   A free outfall for the discharge from the subsurface drain shall be
provided on-lot. Otherwise, easements for the use and maintenance of any drain
used or to be used to transport the water from the subsurface drains or
subsurface drain to an outfall located off-lot must be obtained from all owners
of adjacent properties through which the underground drain runs to the point of
discharge. Copies of the recorded easements must be submitted with the
application for a permit to install any private on-site sewage system which has
a subsurface drain as a component that discharges off-lot. The use of a legally
established, publicly maintained drainage improvement shall be permitted only
after written permission for such use is first obtained from the public agency
with jurisdiction over such drainage improvement (Surveyor’s office/Drainage
Board).
   (D)   Subsurface drains. Subsurface drains, when required, will be installed
around the absorption field area or sand mound on the upslope and sides only.
Minimum depth for a subsurface drain shall be 36 inches. This depth shall be
measured from the existing ground surface to the bottom of the drain excavation
or six inches into compact till, whichever is greater. All drains shall have an
approved outlet with a prescribed two and four-tenths inches positive slope or
greater for every 100 feet of drain length. Drain outlets to the ground surface
shall be fitted with an animal guard approved by the Health Officer.
(Ord. 2012-153, passed 4-16-2012)
§ 52.28 INSPECTIONS.
   No person shall cover any private on-site sewage system or any part thereof
unless he or she first obtains written approval from the Health Officer. No
person shall place a private on-site sewage system into operation without first
obtaining written approval for such operation from the Health Officer. The
Health Officer shall be allowed to inspect the work at any stage of
construction. The applicant for the construction permit shall notify the Health
Officer when the work is ready for final inspection and before any underground
portions are covered. The Health Officer shall make the inspection within two
working days of the receipt of notice from the applicant. Efforts will be made
to inspect on the day requested if the requests are received before 10:00 a.m.
the day of inspection and completion will occur during normal Health Department
working hours.
(Ord. 2012-153, passed 4-16-2012)
§ 52.29 RIGHT OF ENTRY.
   The Health Officer shall be permitted to enter upon any property at any
reasonable and proper time for the purposes of inspection, observation,
measurement, sampling and testing necessary to carry out and review compliance
with the provisions of this subchapter upon producing proper credentials and
identification.
(Ord. 2012-153, passed 4-16-2012)
§ 52.30 NOTICES.
   Any person found to be violating any provision of this subchapter shall be
served with a written order stating the nature of the violation and providing a
time limit for its satisfactory correction. If a person receives a written
order from the Health Officer directing compliance with any provisions of this
subchapter, that person shall comply with the provisions of the order and
perform all acts required by the order within the time limit set forth in the
order. The order shall be served by the Health Officer and may be served by
certified mail or personal delivery. An order shall also be deemed served when
an inspection tag or report indicating the violation shall be attached to any
portion of the on-site private sewage system which is the subject of the order.
(Ord. 2012-153, passed 4-16-2012)
§ 52.31 REGISTRATION.
   (A)   Except for the owner working on the on-site private sewage system
serving the dwelling in which he or she lives, no person shall construct,
install, replace, alter or repair any private on-site sewage system in the
county unless the person is registered with the Health Department. Application
for registration shall be on forms provided by the Health Department. Failure
to obtain or renew registration prior to system installation will be subject to
a late fee per the Health Department Fee Schedule Ordinance.
   (B)   Every person required to register under this section shall be
knowledgeable of all laws, rules and regulations of both the state and the
county governing private on-site sewage systems. The applicant for registration
must demonstrate knowledge of the applicable laws, rules and regulations before
becoming registered by passing a proficiency exam conducted by the Health
Department with a score of 80 or higher. All tests shall be multiple choice,
true or false, and non-open book format consisting of 40 questions. The
registration exam shall be reviewed from time to time to determine its
applicability to current laws, rules and regulations. The exam questions shall
not be changed except for order or format without review and approval by two
designated representatives of the Builders Association of Elkhart County and by
two registered on-site private sewage system contractors. After satisfactory
completion of two different ECHD examinations, only the registration fee will
be required to renew registration. IOWPA certification may serve as the second
satisfactory completion upon presentation of credentials which are valid and in
effect for the period of registration. An owner wishing to install, repair or
otherwise work on the private on-site sewage system serving the dwelling in
which he or she lives shall be required to demonstrate knowledge of the
applicable laws, rules and regulations by completing the same proficiency exam
conducted by the Health Department. Where taking a written exam is not
feasible, due to language or reading difficulties, arrangements will be made to
allow for a verbal examination to assure proficiency. Opportunity for re-
examination of registered installers shall be afforded to an applicant upon
request but no more frequently than once every seven days. At the request of
the Health Officer, but not more often than once per year, a person registered
under this section shall attend a course on private on-site sewage systems and
installation conducted by the Health Department or the state.
   (C)   Registrations under this section shall expire annually on June 30.
   (D)   Whenever the Health Officer determines that there has been a violation
of any provision of this subchapter or the applicable rules and regulations of
the Indiana State Department of Health by a person registered under this
section, the Health Officer shall give written notice, in person or by
certified or registered mail, of the alleged violation to the person to whom
registration was granted. Such notice shall include:
      (1)   A statement of the alleged violation; and
      (2)   An order allowing a reasonable time, up to 14 days or as otherwise
determined by the Health Officer, for the performance of any act required to
correct the violation.
   (E)   If the violation is not corrected within the designated time, the
Health Officer may suspend or revoke the registration subject to the provisions
for hearing contained in §
52.32. If the registration is suspended, the registration can be reinstated by
the Health Officer upon correction of all violations. If registration is
revoked, the requirements for becoming registered including testing and the
payment of the registration fee apply prior to re-registration. Re-registration
shall not occur until all outstanding violations are corrected to the
satisfaction of the Health Officer.
   (F)   Any person constructing, installing, replacing, altering or repairing,
any private on-site sewage system who is not registered under the provisions of
this section shall be deemed to be in violation of this subchapter and subject
to all penalties described herein.

delivered by regular United States mail to the person requesting the hearing at
least ten days prior to the hearing. If the person requesting the hearing so
requests, the Health Officer may grant a continuance of the hearing date for a
period of not more than 30 days.
   (C)   A tape recording shall be made of the hearing, and the cost borne by
the Health Department; however, a transcript of the hearing will be made only
if a person requests it and shall be transcribed at the cost of such person.
The County Board of Health shall make a ruling based upon the complete hearing
record and shall sustain, modify or rescind any order, suspension, revocation
or ruling challenged in the hearing. A written report of the hearing decision
including the reason(s) for such decision shall be furnished to the affected
person by the Health Officer within ten days of the hearing.
   (D)   At the request of the Health Officer, staff testimony may be presented
at the hearing.
   (E)   The County Board of Health may in its discretion establish a Hearing
Board to conduct on-site sewage system violation hearings in the county. Any

§ 53.05 PRIVATE WATER WELL SYSTEMS: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   If a person intends to construct, install, replace or abandon a
private water well within the boundaries of a municipality, and if the
municipality has an ordinance regulating private water wells, the person shall
obtain permission for the private water well activity from the municipality
before applying for a permit under this chapter.
   (B)   No permits will be issued for the construction, installation, or
replacement of potable private water wells within a subdivision, planned unit
development, or other area served by a municipal water service.
   (C)   After January 1, 2018, the effective date of this chapter, and subject
to the approval of the municipality having jurisdiction, if a subdivision is
approved where a municipal water system is available, the subdivision developer
must make connection to that municipal water system and shall extend the
municipal water system to all lots in the subdivision at the developer’s
expense.
   (D)   No permit will be issued for the construction or installation of a new
potable private water well that is intended, to serve more than one single-
family dwelling or more than one unit of a multi-family dwelling, if each
individual unit in the building is separately owned. A private water well in
these circumstances must be registered with and meet the requirements of the
state for a public well. However, a dawdi haus, a grandparent's cottage, or a
guest house may be connected to the private water well serving the main
residence on a parcel or lot, when both residences are owned by the same
individual or entity.
   (E)   A permit may be issued for a non-potable private water well within a
subdivision, planned unit development, or other area served by a municipal
water service unless a municipal ordinance, the ordinance establishing the
subdivision or the planned unit development, or other local, state, or federal
law or regulation prohibits the installation of a non-potable private water
well where proposed.
   (F)   Any private water well in the plume of known groundwater contamination
shall be abandoned as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from the
time when municipal water service is made available to the property served by
the private water well. Until that time, the owner of any property served by
such a private water well shall install, operate, maintain, and use drinking
water filtration systems to reduce the contamination in the water drawn from
the private water well to meet EPA drinking water standards.
   (G)   New private water well construction and installation shall generally
be prohibited in areas of known groundwater contamination, such as those
designated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency or an agency of
the State of Indiana, including, but not limited, to Super Fund Sites,
Environmental Restrictive Covenant Sites, and other groundwater use restriction
sites. The Health Officer will follow the guidance of the designating agency
regarding the drilling of private water wells in the delineated area and will,
if a new private water well is necessary in such an area, issue a permit if the
location and installation of such a private water well is consistent with the
advice of the designating agency, and all precautions, as outlined in 312 lAC
13-3-2, are strictly adhered to in order to prevent the mixing of aquifers, or
the inadvertent contamination of a suitable water supply. Any special well
construction methods, techniques and materials that are proposed to be used
shall be enumerated on the permit in any situation where a private water well
must be drilled in a known groundwater contamination area.
   (H)   There shall be no connections between a private water well or water
supply and a public or municipal water supply.
   (I)   Dug wells may not be installed in the County, except for dewatering
wells.
(Ord. 2017-24, passed 11-20-2017) Penalty, see §
53.99
§ 53.06 PERMITS.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (H) herein, no person shall construct,
install, replace or abandon a private water well, unless the Health Officer has
issued a permit pursuant to this chapter to the owner of the real estate where
a private water well is to be constructed or installed, or where any
replacement or abandonment of an existing private water well is planned. The
owner shall apply for a permit on a form provided by the Health Officer. The
owner shall supplement the application form with plans, specifications, and
other information deemed necessary by the Health Officer, and as required by
applicable federal and state statutes and regulations. The applicant shall pay
a permit fee to the Health Department, as prescribed by the Health Department
Fee Schedule Ordinance, at the time the application is filed. The issuance of a
permit shall not be construed as authority to violate, cancel, or set aside any
of the provisions of this chapter. Failure to obtain a permit prior to private
water well construction, installation, replacement, or abandonment will result
in the assessment of a late fee three times the regular permit fee as per the
Health Department Fee Schedule.
   (B)   The owner shall post the permit in a conspicuous place at or near the
dwelling or facility where the private water well system work is occurring. The
notice shall be plainly visible from the public thoroughfare nearest this
structure.
   (C)   When a permit has expired or has been revoked, the work specified on
the private water well system permit shall not commence or resume unless a new
application and fee have been submitted and a new permit has been obtained.
   (D)   Permit fees are not refundable. In the event that a purported payment
of a permit fee by check or other means is not honored by the drawee, credit
card issuer or other third-party payer, the person who issued the check or used
such other means will be required to pay any penalties and late fees and be
required to pay any future permit fees in cash.
   (E)   Transfer of ownership of the real estate for which a private water
well system permit has been issued shall automatically void the permit for that
property, unless the transfer has been disclosed in the permit application and
approved with the permit. An example may be an expected transfer from a builder
or developer to an owner following the construction of a house.
   (F)   Permits issued under the provisions of this chapter shall be valid for
a period of 12 months from the date of issuance. In the event the work
authorized by the permit is not completed within 12 months from the date of
issuance, the permit shall automatically expire and become void.
   (G)   A separate permit shall not be required for well abandonment if the
abandonment and the drilling of a new private water well are undertaken as
parts of the same project.
   (H)   The following exceptions exist with respect to the permit requirement.
      (1)   In emergency well installation situations, where it becomes
necessary to restore water to a house, facility or other building and the
emergency does not allow time for the submission of a site plan and permit
application, a licensed and registered water well driller may proceed in such
an emergency to install a new private water well, but a permit application must
be submitted therefor on the first business day after the work has been
commenced. A water well driller who commences an emergency private water well
installation proceeds at his own risk, including the risk of having to
undertake remedial work to bring the new private water well into compliance,
and the risk that the Health Officer may issue a stop order. Should the work
not meet acceptable standards, the work must be brought into compliance with
all applicable codes, rules or ordinances within a specified time period, not
to exceed 14 days.
      (2)   Monitoring wells used solely for the purpose of testing for
contamination of the groundwater must be permitted, but will be permitted by
the parcel rather than by the individual well.
      (3)   Temporary dewatering wells are not required to obtain a permit
under this chapter.
   (I)   The Health Officer shall not issue a permit unless the application
therefor, and the site plans submitted therewith, are complete and accurate.
The Health Officer may revoke a permit or issue a stop work order if the Health
Officer finds, after the issuance of a permit, that the application therefor or
the site plans submitted therewith are inaccurate or incomplete.
   (J)   If the Health Officer does not approve an application for a permit,
the Health Officer shall advise the applicant of the Health Officer’s rationale
for not approving the application and inform the applicant of any technical or
administrative options known to the Health Officer.
(Ord. 2017-24, passed 11-20-2017) Penalty, see §
53.99
§ 53.07 APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   An application for a permit to construct, install, replace, or abandon
a private water well shall be made in writing on forms provided by the Health
Officer.
   (B)   A person applying for a permit to install a new private water well
system shall submit with the application two copies of a site plan that
conforms with the requirements of §
53.08. The application must be complete and accurate. The required permit fee
must be submitted with the application. The application must identify the site
by the Auditor’s parcel identification number (PIN), the Treasurer’s tax
identification number, the site’s legal description, or the site’s property
address. Also, the latest aerial photo of the site must be attached.
   (C)   If the site plan includes a proposed new onsite sewage system, the
application for a permit to install a new private water well shall include a
copy of the plan for the new onsite sewage system that has been approved and
signed by the Health Officer.
(Ord. 2017-24, passed 11-20-2017) Penalty, see §
53.99
§ 53.08 SITE PLANS.
   (A)   For new building construction, the site plan must be drawn on a recent
plat of survey or have the survey attached. For replacement private water wells
of existing structures, the site plan should be superimposed upon the survey
map, or a copy of the survey map should be submitted with the application if a
survey of the site has been made.
   (B)   The site plan must show the following required features:
      (1)   The location of existing onsite buildings, driveways, parking areas
and other improvements, even if they will be removed;
      (2)   The location of any proposed new buildings, driveways, parking
areas and other improvements;
      (3)   The location of utility and access easements;
      (4)   The location of existing water wells;
      (5)   The location of existing and proposed onsite sewage systems,
including the locations of the septic tank or tanks, sewer line or lines,
absorption trenches, subsurface drains and distribution boxes;
      (6)   All onsite potential sources of groundwater contamination;
      (7)   The boundaries of the site and the dimension of each boundary; and
      (8)   If the applicant has a title search for the subject property, a
copy of the title search must be submitted.
   (C)   The site plan submitted with an application for a new private water
well shall be large enough to show legibly the proposed location of the new
private water well, and the location of required features. The site plan shall
be drawn to scale, and shall show accurate measurements of the distances from
the proposed location of the new private water well to each of the other
required features of the site plan, including the boundaries of the site.
   (D)   If the site is within a flood plain, the site plan must show
topographical elevations and indicate that the top of the finished well casing
or pitless adapter for the proposed private water well shall be at least two
feet above the elevation of the regulatory flood elevation.
   (E)   The site plan shall include, as an inset or as an attachment, a sketch
of the geographical location of the site, showing at least the closest
intersection of public roads.
   (F)   The site plan must state the name, address, email address and
telephone number of the person who prepared the site plan.
   (G)   To the extent practicable, a site plan shall also show the location of
water wells, onsite sewage systems and potential sources of groundwater
contamination on any contiguous site, when the water well will potentially be
located less than 100 feet from the contiguous site. The location of such
features may be a matter of record in the Health Department.
   (H)   A person applying for a permit to abandon a private water well shall
submit with the application a site plan large enough to show legibly the
location of the well in relationship to the boundaries of the site and existing
features, such as onsite buildings, onsite sanitary sewer lines, and onsite
sewage systems, and, if any existing building is to be demolished, to two
nearby property pins or permanent landmarks, such as numbered electric poles.
(Ord. 2017-24, passed 11-20-2017)
§ 53.09 SITE EVALUATION.
   Before a permit for the installation of a private water well is issued, the
Health Officer must evaluate the site to determine the suitability of the
proposed location for the installation of the water well. The Health Officer
shall review the site plan submitted with the application for the permit, and
may visit the site in order to evaluate the proposed location for installation
of the private water well, and to ascertain any special conditions that may
need additional consideration. The Health Officer’s site evaluation will also
include a record search for known groundwater contamination.
(Ord. 2017-24, passed 11-20-2017)
§ 53.10 LOCATION AND INSTALLATION.
   (A)   A private water well shall be located:
      (1)   At the highest point on the site consistent with the general layout
and surroundings, but in any case in a place protected against surface drainage
and flooding; and
      (2)   As far removed from any known or probable source of contamination
as the general layout of the premises and surroundings allow.
   (B)   The isolation distances for private water wells required by 312
I.A.C.13-3-2 must be observed. In addition, the following isolation distances
for private water wells must be observed:
      (1)   A minimum of 50 feet from all portions of a residential onsite
sewage system and the designated reserve onsite sewage system area as approved
by the Health Department;
      (2)   A minimum of 100 feet from all portions of a commercial onsite
sewage system and the designated reserve onsite sewage system area as approved
by the Health Department;
      (3)   A minimum of five feet from side, rear or front lot lines;
      (4)   A minimum of five feet from any public right-of-way;
      (5)   A minimum depth of 25 feet, as measured from the ground surface to
the top of the well screen;
      (6)   A minimum of five feet from a dwelling or other access-inhibiting
structures, including any building overhangs.
   (C)   Every private water well shall be located so that it will be
reasonably accessible by proper equipment for cleaning, treatment, testing,
inspection, and for such other attention as may be necessary. No private water
well shall be located so that the top of the well will be within the basement
of any building or under a building having no basement. Nothing shall be
constructed in proximity to a private water well, including landscaping, that
will interfere with the inspection, maintenance or abandonment of the well.
   (D)   The finished well casing shall extend at least one foot above the
ground level. However, if the site is within a flood plain, the finished well
casing shall extend at least two feet above the elevation of the regulatory
flood elevation.
   (E)   Well heads and well casing openings shall not be located in any pit,
room, area or space that is below the elevation of the surrounding ground
surface, unless the conditions and construction requirements prescribed by the
Department of Natural Resources for the location of well heads and well casing
openings in such spaces are observed.
   (F)   In the instance when water cannot be obtained from a new private water
well due to excessive depth or other geographical limitations within the
permitted location area, and the licensed water well driller must go outside
the approved location area on the subject property, the following conditions
shall be met.
      (1)   All isolation conditions as previously outlined for all private
water wells must be followed.
      (2)   If a variance from the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management or the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is needed, it must be
obtained and submitted to the Health Department as soon as possible, but no
later than ten business days after receipt of the variance.
      (3)   A water well driller who goes outside the approved location area
for private water well installation proceeds at his or her own risk, including
the risk of having to undertake remedial work to bring the new private water
well into compliance, and the risk that the Health Officer may issue a stop
order. Should the work not meet acceptable standards, the work must be brought
into compliance with all applicable codes, rules or ordinances within a
specified time period, not to exceed 14 days.
   (G)   In the instance when water cannot be obtained from a new private water
well due to excessive depth or other geographical limitations within the
permitted location area, and the licensed water well driller must go outside
the subject property’s property lines, a new application shall be submitted to
the Health Department for approval, and the following conditions shall be met.
      (1)   Easements or other access rights in perpetuity for all properties
that come in contact with any portion of the private water well, or any of its

   Signs or other markings indicating that the designated spaces are only for
the use of certain persons or groups shall be posted at spaces as determined by
the Commissioners or their designees consistent with the provisions of this

owner, operator or user of the vehicle shall be issued a ticket or citation,
and be subject to the imposition of a fine, as set forth in §
71.99. Additionally, any vehicle parked in one of the designated spaces, which
vehicle is not owned or being used by the certain person or types of persons

representatives or agents of the Commissioners, as designated in §
71.22, at the expense of the owner, operator or user of the vehicle.

71.99. Additionally, any improperly parked vehicle in a space designated solely

county parking sticker shall be entitled to use the designated general public

ticket or citation for a fine as set forth in §
71.99. Additionally, any vehicle parked so as to avoid the two-hour parking

adhesive label tag was received, the owner shall thereafter affix the self-
adhesive label tag to the existing numbered metallic tag.
   (C)   Each numbered metallic tag shall be valid from January 1 to May 15 of
the following year for a maximum of 16.5 months only, and all numbered metallic
tags shall expire at midnight on May 15 of the year following the date stamped

be attached to any horse-drawn vehicle at any time.
   (D)   At time of collection of the annual license fee, and the issuance of
the number of metallic tags or self-adhesive label tags for subsequent renewal
years aforedescribed, a registration receipt shall be issued for each numbered
metallic tag or self-adhesive label tag so purchased. The registration receipt
shall be countersigned by the owner of the horse-drawn vehicle. The

§ 75.04 ANNUAL FEE FOR HORSE-DRAWN TRAILERS.
   (A)   There is hereby imposed upon each resident of the county, who is the
owner of a horse-drawn trailer, which horse-drawn trailer is used upon the
highways or roads of the county, an annual license fee in the sum of $50. The
annual license fee of $50 shall apply to each horse-drawn trailer for the owner
thereof. By way of example, a county resident who is the owner of four horse-
drawn trailers used upon the highways or roads of the county shall be charged
an annual license fee of $50 for each trailer, for a total of $200 for the four
horse-drawn trailers.
   (B)   Each county resident who owns a horse-drawn trailer used upon the
highways or roads of the county shall pay the license fee attributable to a
horse-drawn trailer as set forth by this chapter to the County Treasurer. The
required license fee or fees required under this chapter shall be paid after
January 1 and before May 15 of each year. Upon payment of the license fee, each
owner of a horse-drawn trailer shall receive a numbered metallic tag bearing
the legend “Elkhart County, Indiana,” the year of issuance and a consecutive
number. With respect to subsequent renewal years for a horse-drawn trailer
previously licensed under this chapter, the owner of a horse-drawn trailer may
receive a self-adhesive label tag bearing the year of issue. The form of the
plate shall be with a color scheme providing for a white or light background
and black or dark numerals and legends. The owner shall thereafter affix the
numbered metallic tag to the horse-drawn trailer and keep and preserve the
metallic tag on the horse-drawn trailer so long as the metallic tag is
effective and has not expired. With respect to subsequent renewal years for a
horse-drawn trailer previously licensed under this chapter for which a self-
adhesive label tag was received, the owner shall thereafter affix the self-
adhesive label tag to the existing numbered metallic tag.
   (C)   Each numbered metallic tag shall be valid from January 1 to May 15 of
the following year for a maximum period of 16.5 months only, and all numbered
metallic tags shall expire at midnight on May 15 of the year following the date
stamped on the numbered metallic tag; provided, however, the expiration date
shall be extended an additional year for a horse-drawn trailer properly
licensed under this chapter for which a self-adhesive label tag was received
and which is affixed to the metallic tag. Only one metallic tag provided by
this section may be attached to any horse-drawn trailer at any time.
   (D)   At time of collection of the annual license fee, and the issuance of
the number of metallic tags or self-adhesive label tags for subsequent renewal
years aforedescribed, a registration receipt shall be issued for each numbered
metallic tag or self-adhesive label tag so purchased. The registration receipt
shall be countersigned by the owner of the horse-drawn trailer. The
registration receipt shall be carried in or on the horse-drawn trailer at all
times of operation upon the highways or roads of the county.

provisions of this chapter, the dangerous animal may be impounded and held
until a hearing is held. At the hearing, the court shall determine whether, in
fact, a violation of this section has occurred. If the court determines that a
violation of this section has occurred, it shall have the authority to impose a
fine and/or order the animal humanely euthanized. A dangerous animal shall not
be euthanized until after the court has rendered a final decision.
      (10)   In the event that a dangerous animal changes owner, the new owner
must meet the dangerous animal requirements of this section. The original owner
shall notify the County Code Enforcement that ownership of the animal has been
transferred and provide the name and address of the new owner.

institution, or persons or patients thereat, provided conspicuous signs are
displayed in adjoining streets and/or area to the institution stating a
prohibition on such noise, after a termination request. The creation of any
such noise in the area of an institution in such a manner as to be plainly
audible at a distance of 50 feet from the point of creation of the same after a
termination request shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this
division (B)(8). Further, the creation of such noise impacting an institution

the noise source of not less than 15 feet, and irrespective of the 50 feet
standard set forth in divisions (B)(1) through (B)(8) above, shall be prima
facie evidence of a noise prohibited by this section.
      (2)   All provisions of division (C)(1) above to the contrary
notwithstanding, noise that creates fewer decibels than 83 dBA from 15 feet
also constitutes noise prohibited by this section if such noise otherwise
constitutes a prohibited noise stated in this section. Further, there is not
any decibel measurement requirement necessary to prove the existence of a noise
prohibited by section.
   (D)   Additional prohibitions unrelated to termination request or dBA level.
      (1)   The operation by a business of outdoor public address systems

§ 110.036 AERIAL AND UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION.
   In those areas of the service area where all of the transmission or
distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone
communications and electric services are underground, the franchisee likewise
shall construct, operate and maintain all of its transmission and distribution
facilities underground; provided that the facilities are actually capable of
receiving the franchisee’s cable and other equipment without technical
degradation of the cable system’s signal quality. In those areas of the service
area where the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public
utilities providing telephone communications, and electric services are both
aerial and underground, the franchisee shall have the sole discretion to
construct, operate and maintain all of its transmission and distribution
facilities, or any part thereof, aerially or underground. Nothing contained in
this section shall require the franchisee to construct, operate and maintain
underground any ground-mounted appurtenances such as subscriber taps, line
extenders, system passive devices (splitters, directional couplers),
amplifiers, power supplies, pedestals or other related equipment.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section, in the
event that all of the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective
public utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are
placed underground after the effective date of this franchise, the franchisee
shall only be required to construct, operate and maintain all of its
transmission and distribution facilities underground if it is given reasonable
notice in advance of the time that they are placed underground.

§ 110.037 REQUIRED EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE.
   Whenever the franchisee shall receive a request for service from a potential
subscriber and at least ten residences exist within 1320 cable-bearing strand
feet (one-quarter cable mile) of its trunk or distribution cable, it shall
extend its cable system to those subscribers at no cost to the subscribers for
cable system extension, other than the usual connection fees for all
subscribers; provided that the extension is technically feasible, and if it
will not adversely affect the operation, financial condition or market
development of the cable system, or as provided for under §
110.038.
(Prior Code, § 36-2-2-23) (Ord. 04-61, passed 2-2-2004, 2004 COM REC 61–71)
§ 110.038 SUBSCRIBER CHARGES FOR EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE.
   No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, for unusual
circumstances, such as a subscriber’s request to locate his or her cable drop
underground, existence of more than 150 feet of distance from distribution
cable to connection of service to subscribers, or a density of less than ten
residences per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet of trunk or distribution cable,
service may be made available on the basis of a capital contribution in aid of
construction, including cost of material, labor and easements. For the purpose
of determining the amount of capital contribution in aid of construction to be
borne by the franchisee and subscribers in the area in which service may be
expanded, the franchisee will contribute an amount equal to the construction
and other costs per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the
actual number of residences per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet of its trunks
or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals ten residences. Subscribers
who request service hereunder will bear the remainder of the construction and
other costs on a pro rata basis. The franchisee may require that the payment of
the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by potential subscribers
be paid in advance.
(Prior Code, § 36-2-2-23) (Ord. 04-61, passed 2-2-2004, 2004 COM REC 61–71)
§ 110.039 SERVICE TO PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
   The franchisee shall, upon request, provide without charge, a reasonable
number of outlets of expanded basic cable to those franchising authority
offices, fire station(s), police station(s) and public school building(s) that
are passed by its cable system. The outlets shall not be used to sell services
in or throughout the buildings, nor shall outlets be located in areas open to
the public. The franchising authority shall take reasonable precautions to
prevent any use of franchisee’s cable system in any manner that results in the
inappropriate use thereof or any loss or damage to the cable system. Users of
the outlets shall hold the franchisee harmless from any and all liability or
claims arising out of their use of the outlets, including but not limited to,
those arising from copyright liability. The franchisee shall not be required to
provide an outlet to the buildings where the drop line from the feeder cable to
the buildings or premises exceeds or unless the appropriate governmental entity
agrees to pay the incremental cost of the drop line in excess of 300 cable
feet.

§ 110.040 EMERGENCY USE.
   (A)   In accordance with the provisions of FCC Regulations part 11, subpart
D, § 11.51(h)(1), and as those provisions may from time to time be amended, the
franchisee shall install, if it has not already done so, and maintain an
emergency alert system (EAS) for use in transmitting emergency act
notifications (EAN) and emergency act terminations (EAT) in local and state-
wide situations as may be designated to be an emergency by the local primary
(LP), the state primary (SP) and/or the state emergency operations center
(SEOC), as those authorities are identified and defined within FCC Regulations
§ 11.51.
   (B)   The franchising authority shall permit only appropriately trained and
authorized persons to operate the EAS equipment and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the franchisee, its employees, officers and assigns from any claims
arising from use of the cable system or the EAS equipment by the franchising
authority, its employees, authorized representatives or designees, including,
but not limited to, reasonable attorney fees. Additionally, the franchising
authority shall indemnify, save and hold harmless the franchisee against
damage, loss or inappropriate use of the equipment and shall agree to use due
care and to take reasonable precautions against damage, loss or inappropriate
use of the EAS equipment or other cable system equipment which may be used
during a declared emergency.

service license unless the event fails to meet the requirements of a catered
event, in which case a temporary food service license will be required.
   (C)   A food service license shall be issued for a term of one year
beginning April 1 and expiring on March 31 of the subsequent year and shall be
renewed annually. Partial year licenses shall not be issued but the renewal
period for the new year shall begin on February 1 of the new license year. Food

of the public in each licensed food service. With respect to mobile food
establishments, the name, address and telephone number of the licensee shall be

§ 112.07 SUSPENSION OF LICENSE.
   (A)   The Health Officer may, upon written notice, without prior warning or
hearing, suspend any license to operate a food service for any of the following
reasons:
      (1)   The operation, in the opinion of the Health Officer, constitutes an
imminent health hazard, such as may be created by an extended loss of water
supply, extended loss of power supply, sewage back-up into the establishment,
severe structural damage, fire, flood, tornado or other cause;
      (2)   The food service has one or more critical item violation(s) not
corrected at the time of inspection or has 20 or more non-critical item
violations as confirmed by a complete and independent review by a second
representative of the Health Officer;
      (3)   Interference with the Health Officer in the performance of his or
her duties; or
      (4)   Failure to correct any specific violation on two or more
consecutive routine inspections.
   (B)   Upon documentation being provided of the existence of any of the
circumstances in division (A) above, the food service shall immediately cease
operation, and shall immediately institute all corrective measures on all
violations identified. Failure to voluntarily cease operations may result in an
immediate license suspension.
   (C)   Suspension shall be for a period not exceeding 30 days. Whenever the
license to operate a food service is suspended, the licensee or the person-in-
charge, shall be notified in writing that the license to operate the food
service is, upon serving of the notice, immediately suspended and that
opportunity for a hearing will be provided if a written request for a hearing
is filed, by the licensee or the person-in-charge, with the Health Officer
within ten days. An opportunity for a hearing with the Health Officer shall be
afforded within 20 days of receipt of the request. If no written request for
hearing is filed within ten days, the suspension is sustained. Operations shall
not be resumed until authorized by the Health Officer. The Health Officer shall
end the suspension upon request of the licensee or the person-in-charge if the
reason for the suspension no longer exists. Before the license is reinstated, a
reinstatement fee, as provided in the Health Department Fee Schedule, shall be
paid. If after 30 days the suspension is still in place, the Health Officer
shall conduct a hearing for license revocation.
   (D)   In the event a temporary food service license expires, as provided in
§
112.17(B), a new license may be obtained only after compliance with all
requirements of this chapter, the reason for expiration no longer exists and a
new application for license and appropriate fee are submitted. A second
expiration of a temporary food service license, at any single event or
celebration, shall be deemed a revocation of the license for that event. A new
license may not be obtained until all reasons for revocation no longer exist
and a period of 14 days has passed.

   (A)   A routine inspection of a food service will ordinarily be performed at
least once every six months. Additional inspections may be performed as often
as necessary for the efficient and effective enforcement of this chapter.
   (B)   Food services that on three or more consecutive routine inspections
have no critical item violations and no more than five non-critical item
violations may make written request that their inspection frequency be reduced
to once annually. If approved, an annual inspection will be conducted until a
time as the food service violates these conditions at which time the variance
shall be revoked without notice or hearing. Request for annual inspection may
not be made again until the food service again routinely meets the requirements
of this chapter and again makes written application for the variance.
   (C)   Temporary food establishments shall be inspected prior to beginning
any operations and as often thereafter as necessary to assure compliance with
this chapter.

   (A)   The completed inspection form shall specify a reasonable period of
time for the correction of violations found. Corrections of all violations
shall be accomplished within the period specified, in accordance with the
following provisions.
      (1)   If an imminent health hazard is determined by the Health Officer to
exist, such as, but not limited to, those created by an extended loss of water
supply, an extended power outage or sewage back-up into the food service, the
food service shall immediately cease operations. Operations shall not be
resumed until authorized by the Health Officer.
      (2)   All critical item violations shall be corrected immediately or
within any period specified by the Health Officer, but in any event, shall not
exceed ten days following inspection. A time extension may be granted by the
Health Officer upon documentation and evidence that corrective action is
ongoing. The documentation shall not, however, guarantee an extension of the
period for correction. A follow-up inspection shall be conducted to confirm
correction.
      (3)   All non-critical item violations shall be corrected as determined
by the Health Officer, but in any event, shall be corrected by the time of the
next routine inspection.
      (4)   In the case of temporary food establishments, all corrections shall
be completed prior to the issuance of a license to operate. All violations
noted after issuance of a temporary food establishment license shall be
corrected immediately.
   (B)   Failure to comply with divisions (A)(1), (A)(2), (A)(3) and/or (A)(4)
above may result in a revocation of the license to operate the food service. If
any person fails to maintain and operate a temporary food establishment in
compliance with any valid order of the Health Officer, the license of that food
service shall automatically expire, and the further sale or serving of food
shall be prohibited. Any person continuing to sell or serve food in a temporary
food establishment, whose license has expired hereunder, may be referred to the
County Prosecutor or the County Attorney for enforcement action.

            1.   A written notice of hold order is issued to the licensee of
the food service or to the person in charge; and
            2.   The notice specifies in detail the reason(s) for the hold
order. The Health Officer shall tag, label or otherwise identify any food
subject to the hold order. No food subject to a hold order shall be used, sold,
moved from the food service or destroyed without permission from the Health
Officer.
   (B)   The written notice of hold order shall state that a written request
for hearing may be filed with the Health Officer within ten days. If a request
for hearing is received, the hearing shall be held within 20 days after receipt
of the request. On the basis of evidence produced at the hearing, the hold
order may be vacated or the licensee may be directed by written order to
denature or destroy the food. If the food is to be denatured or destroyed, this
action shall be taken under supervision of the Health Officer.

§ 112.19 REVIEW OF PLANS.
   Before beginning the construction or major remodeling of a food service or
an existing structure to be converted to a food service, a plan review fee, as
provided in the Health Department Fee Schedule as amended periodically, along
with properly prepared plans and specifications for construction, major
remodeling or conversion shall be submitted to the Health Officer for review
and approval. The plans and specifications shall indicate the proposed layout,
arrangement, mechanical plans, construction materials of work areas and the
type and model of proposed fixed and non-fixed equipment and facilities. No
food service shall be constructed, extensively remodeled or converted except in
accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Health Officer.
Failure to submit the appropriate plan review fee and obtain approval of
construction plans prior to beginning construction, major remodeling or
conversion may result in the issuance of a stop work order. A late fee will be
assessed for any food service that begins construction or remodeling of a new
or existing structure without first submitting properly prepared plans to the
Health Officer. The late fee shall be equal to the amount set forth in the
Health Department Fee Schedule. The plan review fee with the late fee shall be
paid to the Health Department with the submission of the plans for review.

§ 151.06 PERMITS.
   (A)   Building permit. A building permit is a license to perform any work in
accordance with the requirements of this subchapter. All applications for
permits to be issued by the county shall state the tax code number assigned by
the County Auditor to that parcel of real estate.
   (B)   Requirements.
      (1)   No building permit shall be issued by the Building Commissioner for
a Class 1 structure unless and until a construction design release has been
issued by the state.
      (2)   No person shall construct, reconstruct, extend, alter, repair,
remodel or make an addition to any building or portion of a building, fireplace
or chimney of any existing building, or perform any plumbing work, electrical
work, heating work, ventilation work, air conditioning work or other work for
which this subchapter establishes applicable codes, rules or standards
governing such work before a written application on the prescribed form to do
so is submitted to and approved by the Building Commissioner and a permit is
issued by him or her for the proposed work.
      (3)   Permit applications for Class 1 structures must be accompanied by
the plans and prints in paper format or in electronic/digital PDF format;
provided, however, the Building Commissioner may require submission in both
paper format and in electronic/digital PDF format.
      (4)   Interior or exterior painting and routine maintenance or repairs
which do not affect electric, plumbing, heating, ventilation, air conditioning
or structural stability are specifically exempted from the requirements of
obtaining a permit under this section.
   (C)   Permit issuance.
      (1)   Before issuing any permit, the Building Commissioner may require
the applicant to file a set of detailed plans and specifications, a copy of
which may be retained in the office of the Building Commissioner. In the case
of any commercial or industrial building or structure, such set of detailed
plans and specifications will be required to include a preliminary report or
estimate from the County Health Department Environmental Health Division, based
upon a soil scientist’s sample, setting forth the type of sewage disposal
system most suitable for the proposed site. At the discretion of the Building
Commissioner, a permit may be issued without all necessary sanitation, sewer
and/or septic tank permits issued by the County Health Department Environmental
Health Division to a commercial or industrial applicant who has received a
positive or workable preliminary report from the County Health Department
Environmental Health Division. Any changes from the approved plans or
specifications shall be made only after a revised copy of them has been
submitted to and approved by the Building Commissioner.
      (2)   Permits may not be issued to landowners who have real estate
adjacent to subdivision streets which have not been opened or constructed in
accordance with the County Zoning Ordinance and the county subdivision control
regulations or who do not otherwise have legal access to the parcel of real
estate.
   (D)   Use and occupancy. Irrespective of whether a permit has been issued,
no building for which a permit is herein required shall be used or occupied by
the owner or any other person (other than usage relative to completion of the
work or construction at issue) unless and until the Building Commissioner has
issued both an occupancy permit and a utility service hook-up authorization. No
such occupancy permit or utility service hook-up authorization shall be issued
by the Building Commissioner until all requirements of the permit process have
been complied with, the work or construction contemplated has been carried out
in accordance with the permit (and the plans and specifications approved as a
part thereof), the provisions of this subchapter and any other laws and
ordinances which are administered or enforced by the county have been
satisfied, and the necessary formal sanitation, sewer and septic tank permits
relative to the building or structure (if any) have been issued by the County
Health Department Environmental Health Division and/or the State Board of
Health as required by statute or regulation. After final inspection, when it is
found that the building or structure complies with the provisions of this
subchapter and any other laws and ordinances which are administered or enforced
by the county, the Building Commissioner shall issue a certificate of
occupancy.
   (E)   Term of permits. Permits shall expire one year after the date of
issuance and shall be null and void if the construction has not reached final
inspection within that one-year period; provided, however, extensions may be
granted on residential permits for three months and on commercial permits for
six months. At the conclusion of any extension granted, the permit shall then
expire. Upon permit expiration, an extension or new permit is required.
Construction thereafter, without an extension or a new permit, shall be
considered a violation of this subchapter and be subject to enforcement action.

fee paid hereunder which was erroneously paid or collected. The Building
Commissioner may also authorize the refunding of not more than 80% of a permit
fee when no work has been done under a permit issued in accordance with this
subchapter. The Building Commissioner shall not authorize the refunding of any
fee paid except upon written application filed by the original permitee not
later than 180 days after the date of the fee payment.
   (C)   Local government exemption. All local governmental units shall be
exempt from payment of the permit fees provided the local governmental unit
furnishes a written statement to the Building Commissioner requesting that the
fee be waived. Said statement shall specifically identify that the fee in
question would be the responsibility of a local governmental unit and not the
responsibility of a builder or contractor.
      (1)   Nothing in this section shall be deemed an elimination of the
requirement for the issuance of a proper permit required under this subchapter.
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to eliminate the right
of the Building Commissioner to conduct on-site inspections of any work taking
place pursuant to any permit.

this subchapter, then the unit shall be subject to any and all actions,

standards for building conditions or maintenance in the county by adding the
following provisions to that definition.
   UNSAFE BUILDING AND PREMISES. Any building or structure which has any or all
of the conditions or defects described in this section shall be deemed an
UNSAFE BUILDING AND PREMISES, if those conditions or defects exist to the
extent that life, health, property, or the safety of the public or the
occupants of that building or structure are endangered:
      (1)   If any door, aisle, passageway, or other means of exit is not of
sufficient width or size or is not so arranged as to provide safe and adequate
means of exit in case of fire or panic in compliance with any applicable
Building Code requirement;
      (2)   If the stress in any materials, member, or portion of them, due to
all dead or live loads, is more than one and one-half times the working stress
or stresses allowed for new buildings of similar structure, purpose, or
location;
      (3)   If any portion has been damaged by fire, earthquake, wind, flood,
or by any other cause, to the extent that its structural strength or stability
is materially less than it was before that catastrophe and is less than the
minimum requirements for new buildings of similar structure, purpose, or
location;
      (4)   If any portion, member, or appurtenance is likely to fail, to
become detached or dislodged, or to collapse and thereby injure persons or
damage property;
      (5)   If any portion of a building or any member, appurtenance, or
ornamentation on the exterior of it is not of sufficient strength or stability
or is not so anchored, attached, or fastened in place to be capable of
resisting a wind pressure of one-half of that specified for new buildings of
similar structure, purpose, or location without exceeding the working stresses
permitted for those buildings;
      (6)   If any portion has racked, warped, buckled, or settled to the
extent that walls or other structural portions have materially less resistance
to winds or earthquakes than is required in the case of similar new
construction;
      (7)   If the building or structure, or any portion of it, is likely to
partially or completely collapse due to:
         (a)   Dilapidation, deterioration, or decay;
         (b)   Faulty construction;
         (c)   The removal, movement, or instability of any portion of the
ground necessary to support that building;
         (d)   The deterioration, decay, or inadequacy of its foundation; or
         (e)   Any other cause.
      (8)   If, for any reason, the building or structure, or any portion of
it, is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is being used;
      (9)   If the exterior walls or other vertical structural members list,
lean, or buckle, to the extent that a plumb line passing through the center of
gravity does not fall inside the middle one-third of the base;
      (10)   If the building or structure, exclusive of its foundation, shows
33% or more damage or deterioration of its supporting member or members, or 50%
damage or deterioration of its non-supporting members, enclosing, or outside
walls or coverings;
      (11)   If the building or structure has been so damaged by fire, wind,
earthquake, or flood, or has become so dilapidated or deteriorated as to
become:
         (a)   An attractive nuisance to children; or
         (b)   Freely accessible to persons for the purpose of committing
unlawful acts.
      (12)   If any building or structure has been constructed, exists, or is
maintained in violation of any requirement or prohibition set forth in §§
151.01 through 151.11, as amended and replaced from time to time, or of any
state law or other county ordinance governing the condition, location, or
structure of buildings; provided, however, that legal nonconforming buildings
or structures as permitted by and in compliance with 675 I.A.C. 12 shall not be
considered an UNSAFE BUILDING OR PREMISES by reason alone of having such legal
nonconforming condition;
      (13)   If any building or structure which, whether or not erected in
accordance with all applicable laws and ordinances, has in any non-supporting
part, member, or portion, less than 50%, or in any supporting part, member, or
portion, less than 66% of the:
         (a)   strength;
         (b)   fire-resisting qualities or characteristics; or
         (c)   weather-resisting qualities or characteristics required by law
in the case of a newly constructed building of like area and height;
      (14)   If a building or structure used or intended to be used for
dwelling purposes is found by the County Building Department to be unsanitary,
unfit for human habitation, or is likely to cause sickness or disease, due to
inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, decay, damage, faulty construction or
arrangements, inadequate light, air, or sanitary facilities, or for any other
reason;
      (15)   If any building or structure is determined by the County Building
Department to be a fire hazard because of obsolescence, dilapidated condition,
deterioration, damage, inadequate exits, lack of sufficient fire-resistive
construction, faulty electrical wiring, gas connections or heating apparatus,
or for any other reason; or
      (16)   If any portion of a building or structure remains on a site after
the demolition or destruction of the building or structure, or any building or
structure is abandoned for more than six months so that it constitutes an
attractive nuisance or a hazard to the public safety.

STORMWATER USER FEES
§ 154.065 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ADVISORY BOARD. The Advisory Board for the Greater Elkhart County MS4 as
established under the interlocal agreement between the County of Elkhart, City
of Elkhart, City of Goshen and Town of Bristol for the implementation of the
Phase II Stormwater NPDES Permit Regulations.
   EQUIVALENT RESIDENTIAL UNIT (ERU). The number of units, equal to the assumed
average amount of impervious area of a single-family residential parcel of real
estate within the county, which is established at 3,600 square feet of
impervious area. The unit value, which will be carried out and rounded off to
one decimal point, being the equivalent of one tenth of an ERU, is also the
basis for calculating the assessment of stormwater user fees for the county
stormwater system.
   IMPERVIOUS AREA. Those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of
stormwater into the soil as it enters under natural conditions prior to
development. Common IMPERVIOUS AREAS include, but are not limited to, roof
tops, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas,
gravel surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings and other
surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff
which existed prior to development.
   KEY NUMBER. A number assigned to a tract of land in the county by the County
Auditor that identifies the taxing district in which the tract is located, is a
number that is not assigned to any other tract in the county, and is listed in
the transfer book or records maintained under I.C. 6-1.1-5.
   NONRESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE. All real estate tax parcels which are not
described by the definition of residential real estate shall be defined as
nonresidential. NONRESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE will include:

§ 154.066 STORMWATER USER FEE.
   A stormwater user fee shall be imposed on each and every tax parcel of real
estate within the unincorporated portions of the county which directly or
indirectly contributes to the stormwater system of the county, which charge
shall be assessed against the owner thereof, who shall be considered the user
for purposes of this subchapter. This charge is hereby deemed to be reasonable
and necessary to pay for the regulation, planning, operation, maintenance,
repair, replacement and improvement of the existing and future county
stormwater system.
(Ord. 2010-01, passed 9-27-2010; Ord. CO-2024-09, passed 3-4-2024)
§ 154.067 STORMWATER RATES.
   Until later revised or amended, the stormwater user fees shall be at the
rate of $15 per year per ERU. This stormwater rate is designed to cover the
cost of rendering stormwater service to the users of the county stormwater
system and shall be the basis for the assessment of the stormwater user fee.
This rate is established so as to maintain adequate fund reserves to provide
for reasonably expected variations in the cost of providing services,
variations in the requirements for providing those services, as well as future
improvements and capital needs. This rate may be evaluated and adjusted, as
necessary, with regard to its sufficiency to satisfy the needs of the County
Department of Stormwater Management; otherwise, this rate shall remain in
effect.
(Ord. 2010-01, passed 9-27-2010; Ord. CO-2024-09, passed 3-4-2024)
§ 154.068 RATE STRUCTURE AND CALCULATION.
   (A)   There is hereby assessed a stormwater user fee to each owner of
residential real estate and nonresidential real estate located within the
unincorporated portions of the county which contain impervious area in an
amount based upon the assigned ERU as determined below. The user fees shall be
calculated and assessed each year on a tax parcel basis by key number.
   (B)   All real estate having impervious area within the unincorporated
portions of the county will be assigned an ERU in accordance with the following
provisions.
      (1)   Residential real estate. A residential tax parcel containing a
single-dwelling unit shall be assigned one ERU. A residential tax parcel
containing two or three dwelling units shall also be assigned one ERU. All
other residential tax parcels containing more than three dwelling units shall
be assigned an ERU based upon the parcel’s individually measured impervious
area in square feet divided by 3,600 square feet. This division will be
calculated and rounded to the first decimal place.
      (2)   Nonresidential real estate. Each tax parcel of nonresidential real
estate shall be assigned an ERU based upon the parcel’s individually measured
impervious area in square feet divided by 3,600 square feet. This division will
be calculated and rounded to the first decimal place.
      (3)   Based on existing data. The identification of real estate tax
parcels and key numbers, the classification of primary use, the determination
of whether a tax parcel contains a dwelling unit, the number of dwelling units
a tax parcel contains and the classification of the type of dwelling unit and
type of real estate may be based upon the existing data in the county computer
assisted mass appraisal (CAMA) system database for the respective determination
date used for making the stormwater user fee assessments. The calculation of
the individually measured impervious area on a tax parcel may be computed with
a digitization method that uses available technologies and practices (such as
but not limited to, aerial photography, Geographic Information Services (GIS)
based analysis) as approved by the County Department of Stormwater Management.
If for any reason the calculation of the individually measured impervious area
on a tax parcel cannot be accurately computed using the available technologies
and practices for the respective determination date, the calculation of the
individually measured impervious area on a tax parcel may be adjusted based
upon the data from any permitted construction, additions, demolitions and other
changes on a tax parcel which occur after the date of the aerial photography
utilized by the County Department of Stormwater Management or based upon the
actual verified conditions on the tax parcel, or both.
      (4)   Determination date. For each current year stormwater user fee
assessment, the determination date shall be March 1 of the prior year.
   (C)   Utilizing the provisions in §§
154.066 and
154.067, the assessment for any tax parcel with a calculated stormwater user
fee equal to or less than $2.25 will be waived.
   (D)   There shall be no other exceptions or exemptions from the assignment
of ERUs and the assessment of stormwater user fees for a particular type or
classification of real estate tax parcel within the county.

§ 154.069 COLLECTION OF USER FEES.
   (A)   The collection of the stormwater user fees authorized by this
subchapter shall be effectuated through a charge appearing each year on the
property tax statements of the affected property owner. One- half of the
stormwater user fees charged each year for a real estate tax parcel shall be
billed on each of the spring and fall property tax statements for that parcel.
The user fees shall be due and payable at the same time as the property taxes
appearing on the spring and fall property tax statements are due and payable.
In the event only one property tax statement is billed for a real estate tax
parcel, the entire annual stormwater user fees for that parcel authorized by
this subchapter shall be billed on that property tax statement which shall be
due and payable at the same time as the property taxes appearing on the
property tax statement are due and payable.
   (B)   If user fees are not paid when due, they shall be charged and assessed
late payment penalties by the County Treasurer in the same way and in the same
manner that delinquent property taxes are charged and assessed.
   (C)   If user fees and penalties are not paid when due, they shall be
collected by the County Treasurer in the same way that delinquent property
taxes are collected.

§ 154.070 APPEALS OF ERU DETERMINATION.
   (A)   If, in the opinion of any user, the ERU assigned to the user’s real
estate tax parcel is inaccurate in light of the number of dwellings or amount
of impervious area on the property, the user shall have the right to contest
the ERU determination and thus the stormwater user fees assessed in accordance
with the provisions contained in this section.
   (B)   The user shall obtain and complete a petition to appeal stormwater
assessment form which shall be filed with the county MS4 operator with
verifiable documentation supporting the user’s claim. To be timely for any
current year stormwater user fee assessment, a petition to appeal must be filed
no later than the date on which the spring installment of user fees shall be
due and payable. The county MS4 operator shall refer the petition to the
Advisory Board for the Greater Elkhart County MS4.
   (C)   The Advisory Board shall investigate the user’s claim and, upon review
thereof, shall render a written determination that either the original ERU
determination and assessment should be affirmed or that the user’s rate should
be adjusted and how much the adjustment should be.
   (D)   The determination made by the Advisory Board shall be forwarded to the
user by certified mail, return receipt requested. The user shall have 15 days
from date of receipt to request reconsideration if dissatisfied with the
decision from the Advisory Board. Any additional facts concerning the dispute
shall be reduced to writing and submitted, along with a copy of the original
petition and supporting documents, to the county MS4 operator. The county MS4
operator shall refer the matter to the Board of the County Department of
Stormwater Management. The Advisory Board shall submit a written report of the
determination in the case, along with any documents used, in denying the user’s
claim or in recommending an adjustment.
   (E)   Thereafter, the Board of the County Department of Stormwater
Management shall review all documentation and conduct an informal hearing to
determine and resolve the dispute based upon the documentation submitted and
any oral testimony. The Board shall issue a determination which shall be
binding upon the County Department of Stormwater Management and the user. The
hearing shall be recorded and the minutes of the hearing provided upon request
at a cost per page as determined by the Secretary for the Board which rate
shall be amended from time to time.
   (F)   Any user aggrieved by the final Board determination shall have the
right to judicial review of the determination in accordance with state law.
   (G)   If a user’s stormwater assessment is reduced or eliminated by the
Advisory Board, the Board of the County Department of Stormwater Management, or
court of law, the user shall be refunded accordingly for any overpayment made
from the earlier of the date the stormwater user fee assessment was paid or was
due and payable.
   (H)   A dispute or appeal of an ERU determination for stormwater assessment
shall not be a valid reason for non-payment of the originally assessed
stormwater user fee.
