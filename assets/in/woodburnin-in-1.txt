implementation, with the compliance and with mandated certifications of either
the nepotism policy may be subject to action allowed by law.

and certifications connected with the contracting with unit by a relative
policy is a violation and may result in the discipline, including termination,

city who fails to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, with the
compliance and with mandated certifications of either the nepotism policy or

DRUG FREE WORKPLACE
§ 32.30  DRUG FREE WORKPLACE POLICY.
   (A)   Overview.  Whereas, the City of Woodburn, Indiana makes a commitment
to provide employees a safe working environment, to ensure that employees,
equipment and operating practices comply with health and safety standards, and
to maintain public confidence in the city and its employees. Since the City of
Woodburn values each employee, the city offers employees assistance in dealing
with alcohol and drug abuse problems.
   (B)   Policy.
      (1)    Whereas, the city requires all employees to report for work in a
condition that allows them to perform their duties in a safe and efficient
manner. Employees will not be permitted to work under the influence of alcohol
or with prohibited drugs in their systems thereby affecting job performance.
      (2)   Violation of any provision of this section will be considered just
cause for disciplinary action up to and including discharge, even for a first
offense. In addition, refusal to adhere to any part of the policy may be
considered an act of insubordination and also may lead to disciplinary action
up to and including discharge.
      (3)   This section and related procedures may be modified by the city at
any time in order to comply with any applicable federal, state or local laws or
to better serve the needs of the city.
   (C)   Prohibited drugs.
      (1)   Prohibited drugs are defined as illegal substances, including
controlled substances as defined in the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C.
8120 and the Code of Federal Regulations (21 C.F.R. 1308.11-1308.15) and
prescription controlled substance which have not been prescribed by a licensed
physician or dentist for specific treatment purposes for the employee. Abuse of
prescription or over-the-counter drugs will also be treated as a substance
abuse problem under this section.
      (2)   This section prohibits the illegal use, sale, transfer,
distribution, possession, or unlawful manufacture of narcotics, drugs, or other
controlled substances while on the job or on city premises (including vehicles
used for city business). These include but are not limited to marijuana,
cocaine, crack, PCP, heroin, LSD, amphetamines, hallucinogens, and
barbiturates. Any illegal substances found on such premises will be turned over
to the state police and may lead to criminal prosecution.
   (D)   Alcohol.
      (1)   The use of alcohol on the job or on city premises is prohibited,
unless such use is non-abusive and is part of an authorized official event held
off city premises.  The use of alcohol in vehicles used for city business is
strictly prohibited.
      (2)   Alcohol possession applies to all open or unsealed alcoholic
beverage containers. Such containers are not allowed on the job or on city
premises, unless their possession is part of an authorized official event.
Possession of such containers in vehicles used for city business is never
authorized.
   (E)   Reporting violations.
      (1)   Employees must as a condition of employment, abide by the terms of
this section and report any conviction to the city under a criminal drug
statute for violations occurring on or off city premises when conducting city
business. Report of a conviction must be made to the city within five business
days after the conviction. The city will then notify the appropriate
contracting officer within ten days after receiving notice from either the
employee or from another source. (These requirements are mandated by the Drug-
Free Workplace Act of 1988.)
      (2)   An employee who is involved with off the job illegal drug activity
may be considered in violation of this section. In determining whether
disciplinary action will be imposed for this activity, the city will consider
the circumstance of each incident, including but not limited to any adverse
effect the employee's actions may have on its customers, other employees, the
public, or the city's reputation and image.
      (3)   Any questions regarding the reporting of violations should be
directed to the Clerk- Treasurer.
   (F)   Employee rehabilitation.
      (1)   Health maintenance is primarily a personal responsibility and it is
the individual's responsibility to correct unsatisfactory job performance or
behavioral problems caused by alcohol or drug abuse. In an effort to assist
employees, the city will provide various means for employees and their family
members to remain aware of the dangers of substance abuse in the workplace and
to overcome drug and alcohol related problems.
      (2)   Employees with a personal, alcohol or drug related problem are
encouraged to volunteer to participate in a approved rehabilitation program
upon referral from the Employee and Family Assistance Program, before work
performance becomes affected.
      (3)   Participation in a rehabilitation program will not be considered a
barrier to employment nor a cause for disciplinary action. Employees will not
be disciplined merely because of participation in a rehabilitation program or
excused from the disciplinary consequences of conduct which is in violation of
this section or any other city policies or job requirements.
      (4)   Any employee identified through a city investigation as having a
substance abuse problem also may not avoid disciplinary action by requesting to
participate in an approved rehabilitation program.
      (5)   Circumstances in each case will be evaluated to determine the
course of action to be taken (i.e., whether the employee will be offered the
opportunity to participate in a rehabilitation program and/or will be subject
to discipline.)
   (G)   Testing.
      (1)   The city will ask employees to submit to random alcohol or drug
tests.
      (2)   Additional alcohol or drug testing may be required for employees in
the following circumstances:
         (a)   When unsatisfactory job performance or other employee behavior
is reasonably indicative of substance abuse;
         (b)   During and after participation in a drug or alcohol
rehabilitation program for a reasonable period of time as determined by the
city;
         (c)   When required by law.
      (3)   If a supervisor identifies an employee with a behavior pattern and/
or job performance reasonably indicative of substance abuse, the supervisor
(with the concurrence of the next level of supervision) may recommend that the
employee have a fitness for duty examination by a physician designated by the
city. The physician will determine whether a fitness for duty examination is
necessary and whether alcohol or drug tests will be required.
      (4)   Pre-employment drug testing is part of the pre-employment physical.
The method of testing will be determined by the city. Applicants who test
positive for prohibited drugs in their systems will not be offered employment.
Any questions regarding reapplication opportunities should be directed to the
Clerk-Treasurer.

   (G)   Failure to abide by internal controls.
      (1)   An employee who fails to abide by or cooperate with the
implementation, compliance and certifications connected with the internal
control system commits a violation thereof and may result in the discipline,
including termination, of the employee.
      (2)   An elected or appointed official of the city who fails to abide by
or cooperate with the implementation and the mandated certifications of the

by any and all of the following actions or such others as authorized by this
Council: (a) posting a copy of this section in its entirety in at least one of
the locations in the city where it posts employer posters or other notices to
its employees; (b) providing a copy of this section to its employees and
elected and appointed officials; (c) providing or posting a notice of the
adoption of this section; or (d) any such other action or actions that would
communicate the polioes established by this section to the city's employees and
elected and appointed officials.
   (I)   (1)   Daily deposit amounts made at Horizon Bank will be compared to
the amount processed in the Banyon software, be they utility payments or any
other type of check or cash deposit. The Clerk-Treasurer and the Deputy Clerk
will both initial for a given transaction in this way, as either the preparer
of said transaction or the one who confirmed that it was processed correctly.
If for some reason this process will not be timely, either set of initials can
be replaced by the initials of a Council member.
      (2)   Petty cash, while not used very often, still has a function within
the Clerk-Treasurer's office. Petty cash will be reconciled quarterly, or
sooner if there exists a need, and will be logged and verified by both the
Clerk-Treasurer and the Deputy Clerk.
      (3)   Monthly reconciliation will be performed by the Clerk-Treasurer and
confirmed by the Deputy Clerk in a timely manner following a given month. The
Clerk-Treasurer will initial to confirm that reconciliation has occurred,
followed by either the Deputy Clerk, or if they are unable to do so timely, a
Council member.
      (4)   The Clerk-Treasurer will provide the Council with documentation
showing the reconciliation of city funds in a timely manner after a quarter of
the year has concluded.
      (5)   The Deputy Clerk will inspect payroll check origination quarterly
under the direction of the Clerk-Treasurer and this process will be confirmed
by a log of the event and initials of both the Deputy Clerk and the Clerk-
Treasurer.
      (6)   All checks that are originated by the City of Woodburn will be
signed by the Clerk-Treasurer and either the Mayor or the current Council
member who was delegated to have that authority.
      (7)   For any check that is to be originated, a claim docket will be
presented to Council for their approval. In order for a claim to be considered
valid, all present members of that quorum that were in favor of paying the
claims as presented, need to sign the claim register. In the case that the
Clerk-Treasurer originates a check under their authority prior to the
presentation and approval of Council, signatures of that claim register in a
similar method, even though signed after origination, will be considered valid.
      (8)   Anyone on the City of Woodburn's payroll that has access to a city
credit card or line of credit from a vendor are to abide by the format listed
in §
33.14 regarding the use and procedures for credit cards and lines of credit.
Should §
33.14 not be in force by January 31, 2017, then division (I)(8) of this section
will not apply and the city will not be bound to execute it in any capacity.
      (9)   Currently, only the Deputy Clerk and the Clerk-Treasurer handle
city funds. If any other department is dealing with a customer or resident who
wishes to have a payment processed, they are to refer that customer to City
Hall. The only potential exception to this is the Woodburn Police Reserves.
They are to handle all incoming and outgoing funds, if any, according to their
established procedures.
      (10)   For any loss in either city funds or city property, the party who
discovers the situation is to follow the current structure that is in place for
the city's materiality threshold. This will determine whether or not it can be
handled internally or if the State Board of Accounts needs to be informed of
the loss.
      (11)   Anyone who suspects the possibility of fraud is encouraged to
report their concerns to their department head, the Clerk-Treasurer, or the
Mayor. The State Board of Accounts is always an acceptable option as well,
particularly if you doubt the integrity of the individuals involved regarding
the resolution of said potential conflict.

   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings discharging sanitary sewage water or other liquids into the city’s
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and
the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each such
case, for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for
each user and the minimum charge and the sewage rates and charges shall apply
to each of the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate, or buildings
served through the single water meter.

only on the volume, but also on strength and character of the stronger-than-
normal domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose of.
The city shall require the industrial user to determine the strength and
content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly into
the sanitary sewage system, in such manner and by such method as the city may
deem practicable in the light of the conditions and attending circumstances of
the case, in order to determine the proper charge. The industrial user shall
furnish a central sampling point available to the city at all times.

in the manner provided by law and ordinance.
   (A)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed
monthly.
   (B)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying
the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but
such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in event
payment is not made as herein required. The owners of properties served, which
are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to examine the
collection records of the city for the purpose of determining whether bills
have been paid by such tenant or tenants, provided that such examination shall
be made at the office at which the records are kept and during the hours that

§ 51.087  COST ANALYSIS STUDIES PROVIDED.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain
fair and equitable and be in proportion to the cast of providing services to
the various users of user classes, the city shall cause a study to be made
within a reasonable period of time following the first 12 months of operation,
following the date on which this chapter goes into effect. Such study shall
include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the costs associated with the
treatment of excessive strength effluents from industrial users or user
classes, the financial position of the sewage works and the adequacy of its
revenue to provide reasonable funds for operation and maintenance,
replacements, debt service requirements and capital improvements to the waste
treatment systems.
   (B)   Thereafter, on an annual basis, within a reasonable period of time
following the normal accounting period, the city shall cause a similar study to
be made for the purpose of reviewing the fairness and equity of the rates and
charges for sewage services on a continuing basis. The studies shall be
conducted by officers or employees of the city or by a firm of certified public
accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers which firms shall have
experience in such studies, or by such combination of officers, employees,
certified public accountant, or engineers as the city shall determine to be
best under the circumstances.

postponed, the disconnection of water service for 30 days, if:  Prior to the
disconnection date specified in the notice of disconnection, the customer
provides to the utility a medical statement from a licensed physician or public
health official which states the disconnection of water service would be a
serious and immediate threat to the health or safety of a designated person in
the household of the customer.  The postponement or disconnection will be
continued far one additional 30 day period upon the furnishing of an additional
medical statement.
   (B)   The utility will not disconnect service to the customer:
      (1)   Upon failure to pay for the service rendered at a different meter
address, residence or location, if such billing has remained unpaid for less
than 45 days;
      (2)   Upon failure to pay for services to a previous occupant of premises
to be served, unless the utility has good reason to believe the customer/
applicant is attempting to defraud the water utility by using another name.
(Ord. G-91-1048, passed 2-4-91)
§ 52.54  WATER MAIN EXTENSIONS.
   The City Water Utility requires a person(s), firm(s) and/or corporation(s)
to pay for the costs of the extension(s) required to adequately serve water for
domestic, commercial and/or fire protection.  This policy intends to place the
costs of installation of local water mains upon the owners of the properties
benefitted.
(Ord. G-91-1048, passed 2-4-91)
BILLING PROCEDURES; RATES
§ 52.65  DEPOSITS.
   (A)   All waterworks accounts shall be in the name of the owner of the real
property being serviced by the Utility.  Upon the written request of the owner,
the utility shall send the water bill to a tenant or other non-owner resident
provided that the owner signs a statement, in a form determined by the City-
Clerk Treasurer, acknowledging full responsibility to pay the water bill in the
event of non-payment by the tenant or residential user.  The Utility shall
require each non- owner tenant or resident to post a cash deposit equal to the
applicant’s estimated billing for a period of 90 days, but not less than $100,
as a guarantee against the non-payment of bills for service.  No water service
shall be connected or continued in the name of a new tenant or non-owner
resident until the owner of record for the property has signed the above
described written statement accepting full responsibility and the non-owner
resident has posted the deposit with the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (B)   The utility may require a present customer to make a reasonable cash
deposit when the customer has been mailed a disconnect notice for two
consecutive months or any three months within the preceding 12 month period, or
when the service has been disconnected pursuant to §
52.67.  The amount of such deposit will not exceed an amount equal to their
estimated billing for a period of 60 days, but not less than $25, as a
guarantee against non-payment of future bills for service.  In cases where such
deposit is required as a result of a disconnection for non- payment, full
payment of the deposit will be required prior to restoration of service.
   (C)   Except for non-owner deposits, deposits will be refunded promptly,
along with a statement accounting for each transaction involving the deposit,
upon satisfactory payment by the customer for a period of 12 months
consecutively.  Any customer whose account was delinquent for any two
consecutive months during the 12 month period will not qualify for such
consideration.
   (D)   Procedure following a customer request for termination of service:
      (1)   The utility will require payment of any past due balance currently
billed and owing;
      (2)   The utility will apply the deposit to the final billing;
      (3)   Any portion of the deposit remaining after such application will be
forwarded to the customer.
   (E)   The utility will maintain a record of each applicant or customer
making a deposit which will indicate:
      (1)   The name of the customer;
      (2)   The current address of the customer so long as there exists an
active account with the utility in the same name;
      (3)   The amount of the deposit;
      (4)   The date of receipt of deposit; and
      (5)   A record of each transaction affecting such deposit.
   (F)   Each customer will be provided a written receipt from the utility at
the time the deposit is paid.
   (G)   Any deposit made by the applicant, or any other person to the utility
(less any lawful deductions), or any sum which the utility is ordered to refund
for utility service, which has remained unclaimed for seven years after the
utility has made diligent efforts to locate the person who made such deposit or
the heirs of such persons, will be presumed abandoned and treated in accordance
with the laws of this state as “Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act.”
   (H)   A deposit may be used by the utility to apply toward any unpaid
balance following disconnection of service, provided, however, that any surplus
may be returned to the customer.  In instances where the deposit is used to
apply to arrearages, the utility may require a new deposit to replace that
applied to unpaid balances before service is restored.
(Ord. G-91-1048, passed 2-4-91; Am. Ord. G-02-1127, passed 9-9-02)
§ 52.66  BASIS FOR MONTHLY BILLING.
   (A)   All water usage charges, other than for unmetered fire service or
other special purposes, will be calculated upon the registration of the meter
or meters installed, which registration shall be prima facia evidence of the
amount of water used.
   (B)   (1)   The utility will make an effort to read meters every month or at
intervals as designated by the City Board of Public Works and Safety.  In the
event that the utility is unable to read the meter, or should the meter fail to
register, or if the utility is unable to gain access to the customer’s
premises, the customer will be billed on the basis of average of consumption as
shown by the record of previous meter readings.
      (2)   The first charge after a meter reading is obtained will be then
adjusted by averaging consumption over a period from the last reading, charging
for each period in accordance with the schedule of rates in effect for the
periods, and allowing credit for the amount of estimated billings as applicable
to the event.
   (C)   After six consecutive months of estimating, the utility will
automatically boost the consumption to four times the estimated amount.  The
customer will continue to be billed at the boosted rate until such time as an
actual read is taken and validated.  Any necessary billing adjustments will be
made on the following billing, after the actual read.
   (D)   Where water is taken through more than one meter, then, each meter
will be read and billed separately.
   (E)   All water passing through meters will be charged for at the applicable
rates, whether used, wasted or lost through leakage.
   (F)   The utility will not be bound by billings rendered under a mistake of
fact as to the quantity of service rendered.
(Ord. G-91-1048, passed 2-4-91)
§ 52.67  PAYMENT OF BILLS; FAILURE TO PAY.
   (A)   Billings rendered to customers for water service will reflect at least
the following information:
      (1)   The dates at the beginning and ending of the service period, and
the meter reading at the end of the period for which the billing is rendered;
      (2)   The previous balance, if any;
      (3)   The amount of the billing;
      (4)   The date on which the billing is due;
      (5)   If an estimated billing, a clear coding or other indication
identifying the billing as an estimated bill;
      (6)   An explanation, which can be readily understood, of all the codes
and/or symbols on the billing.
   (B)   Billings will be rendered monthly. If a billing is not paid on or
before the due date indicated on the billing, the customer will be considered
delinquent.  A period of two consecutive months delinquent will then constitute
termination of water services to the customer by the utility.
   (C)   Failure to receive a billing shall not affect the right of the utility
to cut off and discontinue service for non-payment as provided above.
   (D)   At the time of the execution of any agreement, the customer must agree
to pay all future billings as they become due for water service.  Failure to
fulfill the terms of the agreement will make the same null and void and the
total unpaid past-due amount, together with any associated service charges
related thereto, will become due.  Failure to comply with the conditions of the
agreement will result in the discontinuance of the service without further
notice to the customer.
   (E)   Disputing the accuracy of any billing shall not be a valid reason for
non-payment of the billing by the customer, or abatement of charges.
   (F)   The customer may pay a billing under protest, giving written notice
that redress of the dispute is being sought by the customer.  Such written
notice must be filed with the Utility Office Department of the Utility, with
payment, prior to the due date of the billing, with no exceptions.
   (G)   The Board of Public Works and Safety shall review the written protest
as received from the customer, for disposition of the request.  Utility Office
personnel will not be in authority to render disposition of the dispute.
   (H)   Failure to make payment on or before the billing due date, pending
settlement of a disputed billing, shall be considered the same as with any
other past due account, regardless of past payment history of the customer.
   (I)   All water charges follow the customer rather than the property; if a
customer moved from the premises where water service has been supplied, such
customer will be held responsible for the payment of all billings rendered for
the service supplied to the premises until proper notice of discontinuance of
water service has been given to the office of the utility.
   (J)   Moving from one location to another location in no way absolves the
customer from any unpaid charges incurred at a previous location.
   (K)   A customer’s service may be discontinued for failure to pay any of the
unpaid charges due from the customer, regardless of the premises with respect
to which the charges were incurred.
(Ord. G-91-1048, passed 2-4-91)
§ 52.68  ADJUSTMENT OF BILLING.
   (A)   Adjustments due to meter error.  If any service meter is found to not
be accurate, the following procedure for the adjustment of billings will be
observed:
      (1)   Fast meters.  When a meter is found to have a positive average
error (for example, is fast, in excess of 2% the utility will refund or credit
the customer’s account with the amount in excess of that determined to be an
average charge for one-half of the time elapsed since the previous test of the
meter, or six months, whichever period is shorter.  This average charge will be
calculated on the basis of the units registered on the meter over corresponding
periods either prior or subsequent to the period for which the meter is
determined to be fast.  No part of a minimum service charge will be refunded.
      (2)   Stopped or slow meters.  When a meter is stopped or has a negative
average error (for example, is slow, in excess of 2% the utility may charge the
customer an amount estimated to be an average charge for one-half of the time
elapsed since the previous meter test or six months, whichever period is
shorter.  This average charge shall be calculated on the basis of the units
registered on the meter over the corresponding periods or subsequent to the
period for which the meter is determined to be slow or stopped.  Such action
may be taken only in cases where the utility is not at fault for allowing the
stopped or slow meter to remain in service.
   (B)   Billing.  All billing errors, including incorrect tariff applications,
will be adjusted to the known date of the error or for a period of one year,
whichever is shorter.
(Ord. G-91-1048, passed 2-4-91)
§ 52.69  COLLECTIONS; DEFERRED PAYMENT CHARGE.
   (A)   Civil action.  The utility may bring a civil action to recover any
delinquent charges together with applicable interest at the statutory rate, the
costs and disbursements of the actions, and any other remedies prescribed by
law.
   (B)   Deferred payment charges.  All billings for water services not paid on
or before the due date indicated on the billing shall be subject to a
collection or deferred payment charge of 10% or as amended by ordinance from
time to time, and in effect at the time that the charge is posted to the
account.
(Ord. G-91-1048, passed 2-4-91)

   (B)   (1)   The Economic Development Division staff of the Allen County
Department of Planning Services shall not review applications for Economic
Revitalization Area status for any of the facility types noted below, whether

Revitalization Area designation, for personal property deduction only, for
entities operating wholesale operations under a license issued under I.C. 7.1-
3-3, I.C. 7.7-3-8, or I.C. 7.1-3-13; provided, however, that an applicant/

eligible to make said application or have said application approved if the
applicant/taxpayer is also licensed to do business under any other section
contained in I.C. 7.1 et seq.
   (C)   Applications will be evaluated and the information provided within
will be applied toward the point system to determine the recommended length of
the abatement. Unless otherwise provided in, or limited by, divisions (D), (F),
(H), (I) and (J) below or as otherwise provided by this chapter, abatements can
be granted for a period of three, five, seven or ten years for both real and
personal property as determined by the point system.
   (D)   For applications that include personal property, the applicant/
taxpayer shall provide the expected life of each asset (piece of equipment) for
depreciation purposes. The abatement period for personal property may be
limited to a term that is less than the depreciable life of the asset.
   (E)   For applications that include new manufacturing equipment, as defined
in I.C. 6-1.1-12.1-1(3), the applicant/taxpayer shall indicate whether "special
tools" (as defined by 50 I.A.C. (Department of Local Government Finance),
Article 4.2, Assessment of Tangible Personal Property) are included in the new
manufacturing equipment. Special tooling may be limited to a one-year abatement
term.
   (F)   (1)   For applicants/taxpayers indicating that there is a retail
component to their facility, they must also indicate, by percentage of overall
business, to what extent the facility contains retail activities.
         (a)   Anything less than 10% shall be considered a de minimis amount,
while any amount above 50% will make any application for the redevelopment or
rehabilitation of real estate ineligible for abatement, unless located within a
designated Economic Development Target Area designated by the Council by
ordinance pursuant to I.C. 6-1.1-12.1-7 and not defined as ineligible under
I.C. 6-l.l-12.1-3(e).
         (b)   For retail percentages between 10% and 50%, only the non-retail
percentage of the total investment shall be included in the abatement deduction
amount.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, when a facility is located within a
designated Economic Development Target Area and not defined ineligible under
I.C. 6-1.1-12.1-3(e), then a ten year deduction may be granted without adhering
to the point system.
   (G)   (1)   For applicants/taxpayers that are service-based businesses, the
following criteria must be met to be eligible for abatement:
         (a)   More than 25% of the customer base for the service-based
business is located outside of Allen County, Indiana or more than 25% of the
annual gross revenue of the service-based business is generated by customers
located outside of Allen County; or
         (b)   The amount of the investment for which the abatement is being
sought by the applicant/taxpayer is $5,000,000 or more.
      (2)   For purposes of this division, a SERVICE-BASED BUSINESS means a
commercial enterprise that derives more than 50% of its annual gross revenue
directly from labor performed in an expert manner by an individual or team for
the benefit of its customers/clients as opposed to the sale of tangible goods
and/or products. The definition includes, without limitation, businesses such
as law firms, accounting firms, consulting firms, financial services firms,
insurance agencies, marketing/advertising agencies, and medical and dental
practices. The definition does not include retail establishments, the
eligibility of which is determined under I.C. 6-1.1-12.1-3(e).
   (H)   Applicants/taxpayers for a deduction involving the redevelopment or
rehabilitation of a speculative building may receive a ten-year phased
deduction without adhering to the point system. For purposes of this division,
a "speculative building" means a building development, construction, or
rehabilitation of at least 50,000 square feet that is reasonably likely to
create new jobs when the developer has no formal commitment from a buyer or
tenant to purchase or lease the end product, whether the end product is a fully
completed, move-in ready building or a partially completed shell suitable for
build-out improvements by the future owner or tenant. Additional incentives for
the final build out and personal property (equipment) may be considered upon
the identification of the end user. Any additional incentives will adhere to
the point system for real and personal property abatement at the time of
submittal.
   (I)   (1)   The owner of an eligible vacant building, as defined in I.C. 6-
1.1-12.1-1(17), is entitled to a deduction from the assessed value of the
building if the applicant/taxpayer or tenant of the applicant/taxpayer occupies
the eligible vacant building and uses it for commercial or industrial purposes.

§ 151.03  COMMUNITY BENEFIT REVIEW.
   (A)   The Council shall consider all findings of fact pertaining to an
application for tax abatement.
   (B)   The Council, in its deliberations, may, pursuant to I.C. 6-1.1-12.1-2,
give consideration to the following general standards to determine if:
      (1)   The proposed use of the real estate for which a deduction is being
sought is consistent with the land use policies contained in the Allen County
Comprehensive Plan adopted by the Council;
      (2)   The deduction will assist in the inducement of a project that will
result in the retention and/or creation of substantial employment opportunities
relative to the value of the investment;
      (3)   The deduction will encourage the use of vacant or under-utilized
land or improvement or replacement of a deteriorated or obsolete structure
designated as appropriate for industrial or commercial development;
      (4)   The deduction will encourage the improvement or replacement of
deteriorated or obsolete manufacturing, research and development, logistical
distribution, and information technology equipment; and/or
      (5)   The deduction will assist in the inducement of a project which
would provide long-term benefits to the tax base of the city and Allen County,
Indiana, warranting the granting of abatement.
   (C)   In all instances, the Council shall find that evidence has been
provided either in the application or during the public hearing that the real
estate proposed for designation is either in an area "which has become
undesirable for, or impossible of, normal development and occupancy because of
a lack of development, cessation of growth, deterioration of improvements or
character of occupancy, age, obsolescence, substandard buildings, or other
factors which have impaired values or prevent a normal development of property
or use of property" or, "where a facility or a group of facilities that are
technologically, economically, or energy obsolete are located and where the
obsolescence may lead to a decline in employment and tax revenues" or, when
applicable, been found to be a Residentially Distressed Area pursuant to I.C.
6-1.1-12.1-2.
   (D)   The Council shall not consider an application for designation, unless
a waiver of noncompliance has been granted pursuant to I.C. 6-1.1-12.1-11.3, if
prior to the filing of the application:
      (1)   An improvement location permit has been filed for the project at
the Allen County Department of Planning Services;
      (2)   A building permit for the subject rehabilitation has been filed for
the project at the Allen County Building Department; or

(Ord. 19-1373, passed 9-3-19)
§ 151.04  COMPLIANCE WITH STATEMENT OF BENEFITS (CF-1) ANNUAL REVIEW.
   (A)   The applicant/taxpayer shall provide Economic Development staff with
an annual report (Compliance with Statement of Benefits, form CF-1) showing the
extent to which there has been compliance with the Statement of Benefits (SB-1)
form. The CF-1 form must be filed with the Allen County Auditor, the Economic
Development Division staff, and the City Clerk Treasurer, according to the
filing schedule required by I.C. 6-1.1-12.1-5.1, I.C. 6-l.l-12.1-5.3(j), and
I.C. 6-1.1-12.1-5.6.
   (B)   Economic Development Division staff shall analyze all CF-1 forms and
compile a summary sheet and findings of fact to present to the Council from
which a determination of substantial compliance or noncompliance will be made.
   (C)   Economic Development Division staff shall use the following review
procedure of CF-1 forms:
      (1)   The first step in the review process compares the CF-1 form to the
Statement of Benefits (SB-1) form approved by Council to find whether the
project substantially complies with the SB-1. Substantial compliance shall be
defined as:
         (a)   Creating or retaining at least 75% of the total number of full-
time and/or part-time jobs delineated in the approved Statement of Benefits
(SB-1) form; and/or
         (b)   Creating or retaining at least 75% of the total salaries
delineated in the approved Statement of Benefits (SB-1) form within the time
frame projected in the applicant/taxpayer's approved Statement of Benefits (SB-
1) form.
      (2)   If the project is deemed not to be in substantial compliance in the
first step, the staff shall investigate further whether the applicant/taxpayer
made a reasonable effort to substantially comply and whether the applicant/
taxpayer's failure to substantially comply was caused by factors beyond their
control. Staff will:
         (a)   Examine whether the investment in real estate or personal
property equals or exceeds 75% of the investment delineated in the approved
Statement of Benefits (SB-1) form within the projected time frame; and
         (b)   Contact the person listed as the contact person on the CF-1 form
to seek an explanation as to why the project is not in substantial compliance.
The staff may request the explanation be provided in writing.
      (3)   If the staff finds, based on the second step, that the applicant/
taxpayer made a reasonable effort to substantially comply, and that the
applicant/taxpayer's failure to substantially comply was caused by factors
beyond the control of the applicant/taxpayer, the project will be considered in
substantial compliance for purposes of the CF-1 form. If the staff finds, based
on the second step, that the applicant/taxpayer did not make a reasonable
effort to substantially comply, and that its failure to substantially comply
was not caused by factors beyond the applicant/taxpayer's control, the project
will be considered not in substantial compliance for purposed of the CF-1 form.
Staff will provide a report summarizing the staffs' findings to the Council
from which the Council can make a determination as to whether the project
should or should not be deemed to be in substantial compliance.
   (D)   The Council will review the CF-1 forms using the following criteria:
      (1)   Employment:
         (a)   Number of employees retained (jobs retained); and
         (b)   Number of additional employees (jobs created);
      (2)   Salaries:
         (a)   Salaries of employees retained (salaries retained); and
         (b)   Salaries of additional employees (salaries created); and
      (3)   Investment (values of proposed project):
         (a)   Real estate: cost of real estate improvements; and
         (b)   Personal property: cost of new manufacturing, new research and
development, new logistical distribution and new information technology
equipment.
   (D)   State law provides that within 45 days after an applicant/taxpayer
files a CF-1 form, the Council shall determine whether the applicant/taxpayer
has substantially complied with the Statement of Benefits (SB-1) form. Those
forms that are found by the staff not to be in substantial compliance will be
brought to the attention of the Council first for the Council to determine what
further action is necessary. However, since the 45 day time period only limits
the Council's ability to pursue terminating a deduction, those that are found
to be in compliance will be submitted for formal approval with a final report
following the end of the filing period.
   (E)   If an applicant/taxpayer fails to file a CF-1 form by the filing
deadline, fails to file a CF-1 form that provides sufficient information (as
determined by staff) to determine substantial compliance, or the circumstances
are such that the staff has information indicating that the information
provided on the CF-1 form may be inaccurate, the staff will make a reasonable
effort to contact the applicant/taxpayer to obtain a complete and accurate CF-
1 form. If the applicant/taxpayer still fails to provide a complete and
accurate CF-1 form, then the staff will bring the failure to the attention of
the Council for the Council to determine whether the project should be deemed
not to be in substantial compliance. The staff, working with the Allen County
Auditor's Office, will monitor applicants/taxpayers who have receive a SB-
1 approval from the Council and who are eligible to receive a tax abatement
deduction, to facilitate the timely and accurate submission of CF-1 forms.
   (F)   The staffs' determination that the project fails to substantially
comply with a Statement of Benefits does not necessarily mean that the
abatement will be rescinded. If the Council, based on the information provided
by the staff, determines that a project is not in substantial compliance, the
staff will mail official notification to the applicant/taxpayer and schedule a
hearing with the Council pursuant to I.C. 6-1.1-12.1-5.9. The hearing will be
held within 30 days after the date on which the notice is mailed.
   (G)   Based on the evidence presented at the hearing by the applicant/
taxpayer and other interested parties, the Council shall determine whether the
applicant/taxpayer has made reasonable efforts to substantially comply with the
Statement of Benefits and, whether any failure to substantially comply was
caused by factors beyond the control of the applicant/taxpayer. If the Council
determines that the applicant/taxpayer has not made reasonable efforts to
comply with the Statement of Benefits, the Council shall adopt a resolution
terminating the applicant/taxpayer's deduction under the authority of I.C. 6-
1.1-12.1-5.9(c).
   (H)   An applicant/taxpayer (or, in the case of a deduction for an eligible
vacant building, the applicant/taxpayer or tenant of the applicant/taxpayer)
that has received a deduction for real property or personal property and: (1)
ceases operations at the facility for which the deduction was granted; and (2)
is found to have intentionally provided false information concerning plans to
continue operations at the facility, may be required to repay to the Allen
County Treasurer, under the authority of I.C. 6-1.1-12.1-12, those property
taxes that were deducted, if the Council has adopted a resolution incorporating
the provisions of that section for the Economic Revitalization Area.
