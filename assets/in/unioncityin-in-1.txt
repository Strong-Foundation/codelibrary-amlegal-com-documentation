   (A)   The purpose of this policy is to establish a procedure for the
classification of capital assets, including fixed assets and infrastructure,
for accuracy in financial reporting through the state Board of Accounts and to
fix the minimum value of capital assets to be reported on the city's financial
reports. This issuance of a policy document is related to the implementation of
a new reporting model, Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement 34.
The capital asset threshold is $5,000. An asset with a value under $5,000 shall
be expenced in the year of purchase. The infrastructure portion of this policy
is effective January 1, 2006.
   (B)   The city has established a Capital Asset Policy in order to provide a
higher degree of control over its considerable investment in capital assets,
and to be able to demonstrate accountability to its various constituencies.
   (C)   The purpose of establishing a Capital Policy is fivefold:
      (1)   To safeguard the investments of the citizens of Union City;
      (2)   To fix responsibility for the custody of equipment;
      (3)   To provide a basis for formulating capital asset acquisition,
maintenance and retirement policies;
      (4)   To provide data for financial reporting; and
      (5)   To demonstrate appropriate stewardship responsibility for public
assets.
   (D)   This policy is intended to classify capital assets, including fixed
assets and infrastructure, for accuracy in financial reporting through the
Indiana State Board of Accounts. For purposes of this subchapter, capital
assets do not include data processing programs, software programming, or
computer operations procedures.

NEPOTISM AND CONTRACTING WITH A UNIT BY A RELATIVE
§ 40.45 FINDINGS.
   (A)   The city finds that it is necessary and desirous to adopt a policy of
conduct with regard to nepotism in the employment with the city, and in
contracting with the city, in order to continue to be able to provide local
government services to its residents and to comply with the new laws effective
July 1, 2012, known as IC 36-1-20.2 and IC 36-1-21, respectively.
   (B)   The city finds that both IC 36-1-20.2 and IC 36-1-21 specifically
allow a unit to adopt requirements that are “more stringent or detailed” and
that more detailed are necessary.
   (C)   The city further finds that a single member of the legislative body
cannot act for the body to make work assignments, compensation, grievances,
advancement or a performance evaluation without prior authority of a majority
of the body, and therefore, without such authority by the majority, he or she
will not be in the direct line of supervision (see IC 36-4-6-11 and IC 36-5-2-
9.4).
   (D)   The city finds that a single member of governing bodies with authority
over employees in the city cannot act for the governing body to make work
assignments, compensation, grievances, advancement or a performance evaluation
without prior authority of a majority of the body, when a statute provides that
a majority is needed to act, and therefore, without such authority by the
majority, the single member will not be in the direct line of supervision (see
IC 36-4-9).

§ 51.52 ALLOWANCES FOR WATER NOT ENTERING SEWER SYSTEM AND OTHER SPECIAL
SITUATIONS.
   The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewer system and obtained
from sources other than the utility that serves the city shall be determined by
the city in such manner as the city shall reasonably elect, and the sewage
service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates; except, as is
hereinafter provided in this section, the city may make proper allowances in
determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be
consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the city that such
quantities do not enter the sanitary sewer system.
   (A)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the city's
sanitary sewer system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the city and the water used thereon or
therein is not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not
acceptable to the city, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise
measured or determined by the city. In order to ascertain the rate of charge
provided in this chapter, the owner or other interested party shall, at his
expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or
any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the
determination of sewage discharge.
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the city's
sanitary sewer system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the city, and in addition, is a user of
water from another source which is not measured by a water meter or is measured
by a meter not acceptable to the city, then the amount of water used shall be
otherwise measured or determined by the city. In order to ascertain the rates
or charges, the owner or other interested parties shall, at his expense,
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the
determination of sewage discharge.
   (C)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the city's
sanitary sewer system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and
the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each such
case, for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for
each user and the base charge and the flow rates and charges shall apply to
each of the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate, or buildings
served through the single water meter.
   (D)   In the event two or more dwelling units such as mobile homes,
apartments, or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other
liquids into the city's sanitary sewer system, either directly or indirectly,
are users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water
meter, then in such case, billing shall be for a single service in the manner
set out elsewhere herein, except that the minimum bill shall not be less than
the number of such dwelling units times the base rate per month of $12.55. In
the case of mobile home courts, the number of dwelling units shall be computed
and interpreted as the total number of mobile home spaces available for rent
plus any other dwelling units served through the meter. A dwelling unit shall
be interpreted as a room or rooms or any other space or spaces in which cooking
facilities are provided.
   (E)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water, or other liquids into the city's
sanitary sewer system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess
of 25,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the
city that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not
and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other interested
party shall, at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric
measuring devices, or any adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the city for the determination of sewage discharge.

§ 51.53 DETERMINATION OF SURCHARGES.
   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably adjusted to
the service rendered to users, the city shall base its charges not only on the
volume, but also on strength and character of the stronger-than-normal domestic
sewage and shall require the user to determine the strength and content of all
sewage and wastes discharge, either directly or indirectly into the sanitary
sewage system, in such manner and by such method as the city may deem
practicable in the light of the conditions and attending circumstances of the
case, in order to determine the proper charge. The user shall furnish a central
sampling point available to the city at all times.
   (A)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a biochemical
oxygen demand of 300 milligrams per liter of fluid or suspended solids in
excess of 300 milligrams per liter of fluid. Additional charges for treating
stronger-than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis:
      (1)   Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids. There shall be an
additional charge per pound of suspended solids received in excess of 300
milligrams per liter of fluid:
 
Excessive Strength Surcharge: Rates Per Pound in Excess of 300 mg/l
  Present Phase I Phase II Phase III
SS $0.30   $0.31   $0.32    $0.33
 
      (2)   Rate surcharge based upon BOD. There shall be an additional charge
per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for BOD received in excess of 300
milligrams per liter of fluid.
 
    Present Phase I Phase II Phase III
BOD $0.30   $0.31   $0.32    $0.33
 
   (B)   The determination of suspended solids and five-day biochemical oxygen
demand contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the latest copy of
"Standards Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage and Industrial Wastes",
as written by the American Public Health Association, the American Water Works
Association and the Water Pollution Control Federation, and in conformance with
"Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants",
Regulation CFR Part 136, published in the Federal Register on October 16, 1973.
   (C)   Phase I rates and charges as herein set forth become effective on the
first full billing period occurring after the adoption of this Ordinance. Phase
II rates and charges become effective on the first full billing period on or
after January 1, 2021 and thereafter. Phase III rates and charges shall become
effective on the first full billing period on or after January 1, 2022 and
thereafter.

in the manner provided by law and ordinance.
   (A)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed
monthly. At the end of each year, each user shall be given a notice of the
rates charged for operation, maintenance, and replacement for that user for the
next preceding year.
   (B)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying
the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but
such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in the event
payment is not made as herein required. The owners of properties served, which
are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to examine the
collection records of the city for the purpose of determining whether bills
have been paid by such tenant or tenants, provided that such examination shall
be made at the office at which said records are kept and during the hours that
such office is open for business.
   (C)   Phase I rates and charges as herein set forth become effective on the
first full billing period occurring after the adoption of this Ordinance. Phase
II rates and charges become effective on the first full billing period on or
after January 1, 2021 and thereafter. Phase III rates and charges shall become
effective on the first full billing period on or after January 1, 2022 and

§ 51.55 REVIEW OF RATES.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain
fair and equitable and be in proportion to the cost of providing services to
the various uses of user classes, the city shall cause study to be made within
a reasonable period of time following the first two years of operation,
following the date on which this section goes into effect. Such study shall
include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the costs associated with the
treatment of excessive strength effluents from industrial users, volume and
delivery flow rate characteristics attributed to the various users or user
classes, the financial position of the sewage works, and the adequacy of its
revenue to provide reasonable funds for the operation and maintenance,
replacements, debt service requirements, and capital improvements to the waste
treatment systems.
   (B)   Thereafter, on a biennial basis, within a reasonable period of time
following the normal accounting period, the city shall cause a study to be made
for the purpose of reviewing the sufficiency of the revenues to properly
operate the wastewater treatment facility and all appurtenances attached
thereto; and maintaining proportionality among the user classes of the rates
and charges for sewer services. Said studies shall be conducted by officers or
employees of the city, or by a firm of certified public accountants, or a firm
of consulting engineers which firms shall have experience in such studies, or
by such combination of officers, employees, certified public accountants, or
engineers as the city shall determine to be best under the circumstances.

the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as
trade secrets of the user.
   (B)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written
request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the national
pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit, state disposal system
permit, or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions of
a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in
judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information.
   (C)   Information accepted by the city as confidential, shall not be
transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the city
until and unless a ten-day notification is given to the user.

in this chapter or 90 days following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the POTW by a new discharger, any discharger subject to this
chapter shall submit to the authority a report indicating the nature and
concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its
discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons. The report shall
state whether the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being
met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O & M or pretreatment is
necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an
authorized representative of the discharger and certified to by a qualified
engineer licensed to practice in the state.
   (B)   Periodic compliance reports.
      (1)   Any discharger subject to a pretreatment standard set forth in this
chapter, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the
case of a new discharger, after commencement of the discharge to the authority,
shall submit to the authority during the months of June and December, unless
required more frequently by the authority, a report indicating the nature and
concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent, which are
limited by the pretreatment standards hereof. In addition, this report shall
include a record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows
during the reporting period reported in division (A) above. Flows shall be
reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided however, where cost or
feasibility considerations justify, the authority may accept reports of average
and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The authority, for good
cause shown considering such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays,
budget cycles, or other extenuating factors, may authorize the submission of
said reports on months other than those specified above.
      (2)   Reports of discharges shall contain all results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow and nature and concentration or
production and mass where required by the authority. The frequency of
monitoring by the discharger shall be as prescribed in the applicable
pretreatment standard of this chapter. All analyses shall be performed in
accordance with 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto.

      (2)   A penalty equal to 10% of the delinquent amount shall be charged on
any account that is 15 days delinquent.
   (B)   The rates and charges fixed in this chapter, as well as its other
provisions, shall be extended to and cover any premises that obtain water
service from the city following the enactment of this chapter, without the
necessity of any hearing or notice.
   (C)   If any service rate or charge established by this chapter is not paid
within 60 days after the notice of intent to disconnect, a statement for the
charge may be placed in the hands of the City Attorney, who shall institute a
civil action in the name of the City Waterworks to recover the amount of the
unpaid charges, reasonable and necessary attorney fees and court costs, when
the City Attorney, in the exercise of his or her discretion, deems such an
action likely to result in the payment of the unpaid bill and charges.
   (D)   The city shall have no liability or responsibility to provide water or
sewage service to any residence or business within the city, where there exists
an outstanding water or sewage bill.
   (E)   Any over payment or under payment of water or sewage bills up to and

§ 53.25 APARTMENT BUILDINGS.
   The owner of any building with two or more apartments shall make the meter
deposit and be responsible for the payment of all water bills within that
building. If there is only one meter that serves two or more apartments, the
cost for the water provided to these apartments may be divided equally between
the apartments; however, dividing the water service between apartments shall
not be interpreted to shift the ultimate liability for the water service from
the owner of the building to the tenants.

at that property, as well as any penalties for failure to pay the bill, whether
that water bill is incurred in the name of the owner or a tenant occupying the
property.
   (B)   Upon the written request of the landlord, the City Waterworks shall
mail the water bill to the tenant or tenants occupying the property served;
however, the billing of the water service to the tenant does not relieve the
owner of the liability for the water bill, if the tenant fails to make the
payment. The owners of property receiving water service shall have the right to
examine the collection records of the City Waterworks for the purpose of
determining whether the rates and charges made for water service have been paid
by the tenants occupying their property. The examination of the records may be
made in the office of the Clerk- Treasurer during business hours.

chain, or cord directly attached to the animal's neck, or by a leash less than

of such unreasonable weight as to prevent the animal from moving about freely.
   (D)   It shall be unlawful for any animal to be tethered between the hours
of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.; or to tether any un-sterilized dog for any period
of time unless the dog is in visual range of a competent adult who is outside
with the dog; or to tether or confine an animal at a vacant structure or
premises for any purpose or time when it is not monitored by a competent adult
who is present at the property for the duration of such tethering or

toggle or attachment. Pinch, prong, or choke collars shall not be used. The

dog from moving about freely, is free of tangles, cannot be entangled with
another animal or object, and is at least 12 feet in length.

must be at least 12 feet in length and the tether length must be greater than

authority shall in such instance direct remedies to such person where

endangered; the enforcement authority may take immediate action, up to and
including confiscation of the endangered animal for immediate medical care.

animal involved. A judgment by the court which orders forfeiture or other
disposition of the animal by the city or any third party shall include as a

such activity upon receipt of notice as provided in division(F) herein. For
purposes of this section, an owner of real estate is defined as any person or
entity that, alone or with others, has legal or equitable title to any real
property. When any real property is owned by more than one person or entity, or

violations of this section.
   (E)   Upon receipt of any report or complaint of suspected activity
constituting a civil nuisance as defined herein, the Police Department shall
conduct such investigation, as it deems necessary. At any time prior to or
during said investigation, the Department shall, when deemed appropriate under
the circumstances, send an initial warning letter to the owner and/or occupant
of the property that it suspects such activity may be occurring and that an
investigation is about to commence or is ongoing. The initial warning letter
shall inform the recipient that:
      (1)   If it is determined that a civil nuisance is occurring, it is a
violation of both state and local law;
      (2)   If it is determined that a civil nuisance is occurring, it may
result in fines being assessed pursuant to this city code;
      (3)   If it is determined that a civil nuisance is occurring, the owner
must abate the suspected nuisance to avoid any fines being assessed under this
section by evicting those responsible;
      (4)   If it is determined that a civil nuisance is occurring, the Police
Department will, at the owner's request, deliver an eviction notice to the
responsible tenant;
      (5)   If the investigation reveals that a civil nuisance is in fact
taking place, the city and the Police Department intend to take further legal
action; and
      (6)   If it is determined that a civil nuisance is occurring, the
property owner will be notified and given the opportunity to abate the nuisance
before any fines are assessed.
   (F)   Whenever the Police Department determines that a civil nuisance as
defined in division (A) herein exists, which determination must be made by the
Chief of Police or a designated officer and approved by the City Attorney, the
police shall, when deemed appropriate under the circumstances, cause written
notice to be served on the owner and occupant that a present occupant or tenant
of that property has been using the property so as to constitute a civil
nuisance as defined herein or has been allowing the property to be so used.
Said notice shall contain a copy of this section of this city code and shall
warn the recipient of the following:
      (1)   That a civil nuisance exists on the property;
      (2)   The date and time the civil nuisance was first discovered;
      (3)   The location on the property where the civil nuisance is allegedly
occurring;
      (4)   That such activity is a violation of both state and local law;
      (5)   That such activity may result in fines being assessed pursuant to
city code;
      (6)   That the owner must abate the civil nuisance by evicting those
responsible to avoid any fines being assessed under this section;
      (7)   That, if the owner chooses to abate the civil nuisance by evicting
those responsible, he or she must so inform the Police Department in writing
and commence said eviction within 30 days of receipt of this notice;
      (8)   That the Police Department will, at the owner's request, deliver an
eviction notice to the property; and
      (9)   That if the owner fails to abate the civil nuisance, the city and
the Police Department may take further legal action, including but not limited
to, filing suit pursuant to I.C. 32-30-8.
   (G)   After receiving an initial warning letter or second notification under
this section, if a property owner so requests, an eviction notice signed by the
property owner shall be delivered to the responsible tenant by the Police
Department. (The Police Department shall inform the property owner that, if the
tenant or occupant refuses to leave, it will be necessary to file an eviction
proceeding through the proper court).
   (H)   (1)   The notice required pursuant to division (F) shall be given by:
         (a)   Sending a copy of the notice by registered or certified mail to
the residence or place of business or employment of the person to be notified,
the return receipt requested;
         (b)   Delivering a copy of the order or statement personally to the
person to be notified; or
         (c)   Leaving a copy of the order or statement at the dwelling or
usual place of abode of the person to be notified.
      (2)   If, after a reasonable effort, service is not obtained by a means
described in division (H)(1) service may be made by publishing the notice in
accordance with I.C. 5-3-1.
      (3)   Notice is deemed given to the owner, upon receipt of notice as
indicated above, by the owner of record pursuant to the records and files of
the Randolph County Assessor's Office.
   (I)   Within 30 days of receipt of notice in accordance with division (F),
the owner must initiate such legal action as is necessary to evict all persons
responsible for or permitting the civil nuisance which shall include, at a
minimum, a notice of eviction delivered by the Police Department or the
property owner by serving notice pursuant to IC 32-30-8-5, and must diligently
prosecute such legal action to a conclusion.
   (J)   In the case of a multiple unit dwelling, the only person necessary to
name in an eviction proceeding is the tenant/occupant occupying the actual unit
involved with the nuisance as defined herein.
   (K)   Charging an owner of real estate with a violation of this section
shall be adjunct to and not a substitution for, any criminal charges filed
against occupants or tenants of that owner's real estate for any illegal
activity.
   (L)   The Chief of Police shall use reasonable efforts to train, educate,
and assist owners of real estate in evicting, and avoiding the placement of,
tenants or occupants in their real estate who are known violators of illegal
activities under IC 35-48-4.
   (M)   Any owner of real estate violating this section, which violation
causes the city to begin its own eviction process pursuant to IC 32-30-8, shall
be fined $50 to assist with costs associated in utilizing state law. No fines
shall be assessed until at least 30 days after receipt of notice required by
division (F). Each day such violation continues shall be deemed a separate
violation, beginning with the 31st day following receipt of notice as required
by division (F).
   (N)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to encourage or authorize
the discrimination by lessors against any persons based upon race, creed,
religion, sex, age or national origin. Rather, it is the intent of this section
to hold persons accountable for acquiescing in or participating in the
continued use of his/her property as the location of illegal drug activity.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 157.01 TITLE.
   This chapter will be known and may be cited and referred to as the "Storm
Drainage Control Ordinance of Union City, Indiana" and will hereafter be
referred to as "this ordinance” or “this chapter.”
(Ord. 00-22, passed 12-28-00)
§ 157.02 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is recognized that smaller streams and drainage channels serving
Randolph County may not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey storm
water runoff, resulting when land use changes from open or agricultural use to
a more urbanized use. It is further recognized that deposits of sediment from
developments during and after construction can reduce capacities of storm
sewers and drainage systems and result in damages to receiving lakes and
streams.
   (B)   Therefore, it shall be the policy of the Drainage Board that the
storage and controlled release of storm water runoff shall be required of all
new major subdivision residential development, commercial, industrial, and
institutional development, and any commercial, industrial or institutional
redevelopment in or within two miles of the corporate limits of the city and
within the county. The release rate of storm water from developed lands shall
not exceed the release rate from the land area in its present land use.
   (C)   If it is determined that the standard release rate of storm water has
contributed to or caused flooding in the existing state, the allowable release
rate may be reduced to a lower limit. Conversely, there are some circumstances
where detention is not justified and may be waived by the Board.
   (D)   Because topography and the availability and adequacy of outlets for
storm runoff vary with almost every site, the requirements for storm drainage
tend to be an individual matter for any project. It is recommended that each
proposed project be discussed with the city's Engineer or Street Commissioner
at the earliest practical time in the planning stage.
(Ord. 00-22, passed 12-28-00; Am. Ord. 2001-17, passed 1-14-02)
§ 157.03 APPLICABILITY.
   This chapter shall become effective after its final passage, approval and
publication as required by law. The affected land shall be the applicable land
area within the city, contiguous to the city, or within a two-mile radius of
the existing corporation limits of the city and within Indiana. Any residential
major subdivision, or commercial, industrial or institutional development or
construction project thereon, which has had its drainage plan approved by the
Board and has initiated construction activities consistent with the approved
plan prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be exempt from all of
the requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 00-22, passed 12-28-00)
§ 157.04 CONFLICTING ORDINANCES.
   The provisions of this chapter shall be deemed as additional requirements to
minimum standards required by other ordinances of the city. In the case of
conflicting requirements, the most restrictive shall apply.
(Ord. 00-22, passed 12-28-00)
§ 157.05 COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER ORDINANCES.
   In addition to the requirements of this chapter, compliance with the
requirements set forth in other applicable ordinances with respect to
submission and approval of preliminary and final subdivision plats, improvement
plans, building and zoning permits, construction inspections, appeals, and
similar matters, and compliance with applicable state statutes and regulations
shall be required.
   (A)   Permits for construction in a floodway.
      (1)   The 1945 Flood Control Act, IC 14-28-1, of Indiana, prohibits the
construction of abodes or residences in or on a floodway. Flood Hazard
Management Ordinance says that prior approval of the Department of Natural
Resources is required for any type of construction, excavation, or filling in
or on a floodway. All projects proposed to be located in a floodway must also
comply with the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   All applications made to and granted approval by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) do not in any way relieve a property
owner of the necessity of securing easements or other property rights, permits
or approvals from affected property owners and/or local, state and federal
agencies.
   (B)   Compliance with 327 IAC 15-5. All land disturbing activities,
including subdivision development and individual, commercial, industrial and
institutional site development that disturb five acres or more in total must
comply with 327 IAC 15-5 (Rule 5) "Storm Water Runoff Associated With
Construction Activity". It shall be the responsibility of the landowners or
developers to determine if this rule applies to their project. The Board will
make no determination of the applicability of this rule to individual projects.
Copies of the Notice of Intent (NOI) letters shall also be filed with the Area
Plan Commission prior to the start of land disturbing activity.
(Ord. 00-22, passed 12-28-00)

individual.
   (D)   Words used in the present tense shall include the future; and words
used in the singular number shall include the plural, and the plural the

platted lot", or "parcel".
   (H)   Unless the context clearly indicates the contrary, where a regulation
involves two or more items, conditions, provisions, or events connected by the
conjunction "and", "or", or "either ...or", the conjunction shall be
interpreted as follows:
      (1)   "And" indicates that all the connected items, conditions,
provisions, or events shall apply.
      (2)   "Or" indicates that the connected items, conditions, provisions, or
events may apply singly or in any combination.

STORM SEWERS AND DRAINAGE CONTROL
§ 157.20 STORM WATER CONTROL POLICY.
   (A)   It is recognized that (with the possible exception of the White River
and Mississinewa River) the smaller streams and drainage channels serving the
county may not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey storm water
runoff resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, the storage and
controlled release rate of excess storm water runoff shall be required for any
new major subdivision residential development, commercial, industrial or
institutional development, and any commercial, industrial or institutional
redevelopment in the county.
   (B)   Exceptions to the requirement are minor subdivisions as described in
the county Subdivision Control Ordinance. In addition, the Board, after
thorough investigation and evaluation, may waive the requirement of controlled
runoff set out in this chapter.
   (C)   The release rate of storm water from development, redevelopments, and
new construction requiring controlled release may not exceed the storm water
runoff from the land area in its present state of development. The developer
must submit to the Board detailed computations of runoff before and after
development, redevelopment or new construction, which demonstrate that runoff
will not be increased. These computations must show that the peak runoff rate
after development for the 100-year return period storm of critical duration
must not exceed the 10-year return period pre-development peak runoff rate.

§ 157.22 DETERMINATION OF RUNOFF QUANTITIES.
   Runoff quantities shall be computed for the area of the parcel under
development plus the area of the watershed flowing into the parcel under
development. The quantity of runoff which is generated as the result of a given
rainfall intensity may be calculated as follows:
   (A)   Area less than or equal to 200 acres.
      (1)   For areas up to and including 200 acres, the rational method may be
used. Typical runoff coefficients are listed herein. In the rational method,
the peak rate of runoff, Q, in cubic feet per second is computed as:
Q=CIA
where C equals runoff coefficient, representing the characteristics of the
drainage area and defined as the ratio of runoff to rainfall; I equals average
intensity of rainfall in inches per hour for a duration equal to the time of
concentration (tc) for a selected rainfall frequency; A equals tributary
drainage area in acres. Guidance to selection of the runoff coefficient "C" is
provided in Appendix B, Tables 1 and 2, which show values for different types
of surface and local soil characteristics. The composite "C" value used for a
given drainage area with various surface types shall be the weighted average
value for the total area calculated from a breakdown of individual areas having
different surface types.
      (2)   Table 3 of Appendix B provides runoff coefficients and inlet times
for different land use classifications. In the instance of undeveloped land
situated in an upstream area, a coefficient or coefficients shall be used for
this area in its present or existing state of development.
      (3)   Rainfall intensity shall be determined from the data shown in
Appendix B, Table 6. The time of concentration (tc) to be used shall be the sum
of the inlet time and flow time in the drainage facility from the most remote
part of the drainage area to the point under consideration. The flow time in
the storm sewers may be estimated by the distance in feet divided by velocity
of flow in feet per second. The velocity shall be determined by the Manning
Formula.
      (4)   Time of concentration (tc) is the combined time required for the
runoff to reach the inlet of the storm sewer. It includes overland flow time
and flow time through established surface drainage channels such as swales,
ditches and sheet flow across such areas as lawns, fields, and other graded
surfaces, it may be computed by using the Time of Concentration Worksheet, in
Appendix A.
   (B)   For areas larger than 200 acres, hydrograph techniques and/or computer
modeling methods may be used. Hydrograph techniques and computer modeling
methods used to determine storm water runoff shall be proven methods, subject
to approval of the Board.(see also §
157.27(F)

collector streets is limited to maintaining two clear 10-foot moving lanes of
traffic. One lane is to be maintained on local streets, while marginal access
streets can have a water spread equal to one-half of their width.
      (2)   Open channels carrying peak flows greater than 30 cubic feet per
second shall be capable of accommodating peak runoff for a 50-year return
period storm within the drainage easement.

2.08 of the Indiana Department of Transportation's Design Manual Part IV -
Volume 2, or other approved design procedure. The inlet grate opening provided
must be adequate to pass the design 10-year flow with 50% of the sag inlet
areas clogged. An overload channel from sag inlets to the overflow channel or
basin shall be provided at sag inlets, so that the maximum depth of water that
might be ponded in the street sag shall not exceed seven inches.
   (I)   Workmanship and materials.
      (1)   Workmanship. The specifications for the construction of storm
sewers shall not be less stringent than those set forth in the latest edition
of the Indiana Department of Transportation's "Standard Specifications";
additionally, ductile iron pipe shall be laid in accordance with American Water
Works Association (AWWA) C-600, and clay pipe shall be laid in accordance with
American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) C-12.
      (2)   Materials.
         (a)   Storm sewer manholes and inlets shall be constructed of masonry,
cast in place concrete or precast reinforced concrete. Material and
construction shall conform to Indiana Department of Transportation's "Standard
Specifications", Section 720.
         (b)   Pipe and fittings used in storm sewer construction shall be
extra strength clay pipe (ASTM C-700), ductile iron pipe (AWWA C-151), or
concrete pipe (ASTM C-76). Other pipe and fittings not specified herein may be
used only when specifically authorized by the Board. Pipe joints shall be

§ 157.25 OPEN CHANNEL DESIGN STANDARDS.
   All open channels, whether private or public, and whether constructed on
private or public land, shall conform to the design standards and other design
requirements contained herein.
(A)Hydraulic capacity. The waterway for channels shall be determined using
Manning's Equation.
Q = AV = A 1.486 R2/3 S1/2
   n
   Where:   A = Waterway area of channel in square feet
      Q = Discharge in cubic feet per second (cfs)
      V, R, S and n are explained in §
157.24(A)
   (B)   Channel cross-section and grade. The required channel cross- section
and grade are determined by the design capacity, the material in which the
channel is to be constructed, and the requirements for maintenance. A minimum
depth may be required to provide adequate outlets for subsurface drains,
tributary ditches, or streams. The channel grade shall be such that the
velocity in the channel is high enough to prevent siltation but low enough to
prevent erosion. Velocities less than 1½ feet per second should be avoided
because siltation will take place and ultimately reduce the channel cross-
section. The maximum permissible velocities in vegetal-lined channels are shown
in Appendix B, Table 7. Developments through which the channel is to be
constructed must be considered in design of the channel section.
   (C)   Side slopes. Earthen channel side slopes shall be no steeper than 3 to
1. Flatter slopes may be required to prevent erosion and for ease of
maintenance. Where channels will be lined, side slopes shall be no steeper than
1½ to 1 with adequate provisions made for weep holes. Silo slopes steeper than
1½ to 1 may be used for lined channels, provided that the side lining and
structural retaining wall are designed and constructed with provisions for live
and dead load surcharge.
   (D)   Channel stability.
      (1)   Definition. Characteristics of a stable channel are:
         (a)   It neither aggrades nor degrades beyond tolerable limits.
         (b)   The channel banks do no erode to the extent that the channel
cross-section is changed appreciably.
         (c)   Excessive sediment bars do not develop.
         (d)   Excessive erosion does not occur around culverts, bridges or
elsewhere.
         (e)   Gullies do not form or enlarge due to the entry of uncontrolled
surface flow to the channel.
      (2)   Aged conditions. Channel stability shall be determined for an aged
condition and the velocity shall be based on the design flow or the bank full
flow, whichever is greater, using "n" values for various channel linings as
shown in Appendix B, Table 4. In no case is it necessary to check channel
stability for discharges greater than that from a 100-year return period storm.
      (3)   Post construction. Channel stability must be checked for conditions
immediately after construction. For this stability analysis, the velocity shall
be calculated for the expected flow from a 10-year return period storm on the
watershed, or the bank full flow, whichever is smaller. The "n" value for newly
constructed channels in fine- grained soils and sands may be determined in
accordance with the National Engineering Handbook 5, Supplement B, Soil
Conservation Service, and shall not exceed 0.025. The allowable velocity in the
newly constructed channel may be increased by a maximum of 20% to reflect the
effects of vegetation to be established under the following conditions:
         (a)   The soil and site in which the channel is to be constructed are
suitable for rapid establishment and support erosion controlling vegetation.
         (b)   Species of erosion controlling vegetation adapted to the area,
and proven methods of establishment are shown.
         (c)   The channel design includes detailed plans for establishment of
vegetation on the channel side slopes.
   (E)   Drainage of waterways. Vegetated waterways and dry-detention basins
with a gradient of less than 1% that are subject to low flows of long duration,
or where wet conditions prevail, shall be provided with a subsurface tile drain
to keep the channel bottom relatively dry and to prevent the establishment of
weed or cattail growth. Subsurface tile drain lines may be outlet through a
drop structure at the end of the waterway, through a standard tile outlet pipe
or outlet into the storm sewer system. Subsurface drainage tiles shall be
installed with two feet of cover over the top of the tile and shall be offset
from the centerline of the channel.
   (F)   Appurtenant structures.
      (1)   The design of channels will provide all structures required for the
proper functioning of the channel and the laterals thereto and travelways for
operation and maintenance. Recessed inlets and structures needed for entry of
surface and subsurface flow into channels without significant erosion or
degradation shall be included in the design of channel improvements. The design
is also to provide the necessary flood gates, water level control devices, and
any other appurtenance affecting the functioning of the channels and the
attainment of the purpose for which they are built.
      (2)   The effect of channel improvements on existing culverts, bridges,
buried cables, pipelines and inlet structures for surface and subsurface
drainage on the channel being improved and laterals thereto shall be evaluated
to determine the need for modification or replacement. Culverts and bridges
which are modified or added as part of channel improvement projects shall meet
reasonable standards for the type of structure, and shall have a minimum
capacity equal to the design discharge or governmental agency design
requirements, whichever is greater.
   (G)   Disposition of spoil. Spoil material resulting from clearing, grubbing
and channel excavation shall be disposed in such a manner which will:
      (1)   Minimize overbank wash.
      (2)   Provide for the free flow of water between the channel and
floodplain unless the valley routing and water surface profile are based on
continuous dikes being installed.
      (3)   Not hinder the development of travelways for maintenance.
      (4)   Leave the right-of-way in the best condition feasible, consistent
with the project purposes, for productive use by the owner.
      (5)   Improve the aesthetic appearance of the site to the extent
feasible.
      (6)   Be approved by the IDNR or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (whichever
is applicable) if deposited in the floodway.
   (H)   Construction and materials.
      (1)   Construction. Specifications shall be in keeping with the current
standards of engineering practice and shall describe the requirements for
proper installation of the project to achieve its intended purpose.
      (2)   Materials.
         (a)   Materials acceptable for use as channel lining are:
            1.   Grass
            2.   Revetment riprap
            3.   Concrete
            4.   Hand-laid riprap
            5.   Precast cement concrete riprap
            6.   Grouted riprap
            7.   Gabions
         (b)   Other lining materials shall receive specific approval of the
Board. Materials shall comply with the latest edition of the Indiana Department
of Transportation's "Standard Specifications".

§ 157.26 ACCESSORY DRAINS.
   (A)   Sump pumps. Sump pumps installed to receive and discharge ground
waters or other storm waters shall be connected to the storm sewer where
possible or discharged into a designated storm drainage channel. Sump pumps
installed to receive and discharge floor drain flow or other sanitary sewage
shall be connected to the sanitary sewers. A sump pump shall be used for one
function only, either the discharge of storm waters or the discharge of
sanitary sewage.
   (B)   Down spouts. All down spouts or roof drains shall discharge onto the
ground or be connected to the storm sewer. No down spouts or roof drains shall
be connected to the sanitary sewers.
   (C)   Footing and foundation drains. Footing drains shall be connected to
storm sewers where possible or designated storm drainage channels. No footing
drains or drainage tile shall be connected to the sanitary sewer.
   (D)   Basement floor drains. Basement floor drains shall be connected to the
sanitary sewers.

§ 157.27 STORM WATER DETENTION.
   The following shall govern the design of any improvement with respect to the
detention of storm water runoff:
   (A)   Acceptable detention methods. The increased storm water runoff
resulting from a proposed residential major subdivision, commercial,
industrial, or institutional development should be detained on-site by the
provisions of appropriate wet or dry-bottom reservoirs, by storage on parking
lots, streets, lawns, or other acceptable techniques. Measures which retard the
rate of overland flow and the velocity in runoff channels shall also be used to
control the runoff rate partially. Detention basins shall be sized to store
excess flows from storms with a 100-year return period. Control devices shall
limit the discharge to a rate no greater than that prescribed by this chapter
(see divisions (E) and (F) of this section).
   (B)   Design storm. Design of storm water detention facilities shall be
based on a return period of once in 100 years. The storage volume and outflow
rate shall be sufficient to handle storm water runoff from a critical duration
storm, as defined in divisions (E) and (F) of this section. Rainfall depth-
duration-frequency relationships and intensity- duration-frequency
relationships shall be those given in Appendix B, Tables 5 and 6.
   (C)   Allowable release rate.
      (1)   The allowable release rate of storm water originating from a
proposed residential major subdivision, commercial, industrial, or
institutional development shall not exceed the amount specified in §
157.20, Storm Water Control Policy, and as described in divisions (E) and (F)
of this section.
      (2)   In the event the natural downstream channel or storm sewer system
is inadequate to accommodate the release rate provided above, then the
allowable release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted by the capacity
of the receiving downstream channel or storm sewer system and additional
detention shall be required to store that portion of the runoff exceeding the
capacity of the receiving sewers or waterways.
      (3)   If more than one detention basin is involved in the development of
the area upstream of the limiting restriction, the allowable release rate from
any one detention basin shall be in direct proportion to the ratio of its
drainage area to the drainage area of the entire watershed upstream of the
restriction.
   (D)   Drainage system overflow design. Drainage systems shall have adequate
capacity to convey the storm water runoff from all upstream tributary areas
through the development under consideration for a storm of 100-year design
return period calculated on the basis of the upstream land in its present state
of development. An allowance, equivalent to the reduction in flow rate
provided, shall be made for upstream detention when such upstream detention and
release rate have previously been approved by the Board and evidence of its
construction can be shown.
   (E)   Determination of storage volume - rational method. For areas of 200
acres or less, the rational method may be used to determine the required volume
of storm water storage. The following 11-step procedure may be used to
determine the required volume of storage. Other design methods may also be
used, subject to approval of the Board, and as described in division (F) of
this section.
      Step   Procedure
      (1)   Determine total drainage area in acres "A".
      (2)   Determine composite runoff coefficient "CU" based on existing land
use (undeveloped).
      (3)   Determine time of concentration "tC" in minutes based on existing
conditions.
      (4)   Determine rainfall intensity "IU" in inches per hour, based on time
of concentration from data given in Appendix B, Table 6 for the 10-year return
period.
      (5)   Compute runoff based on existing land use (undeveloped), and 10-
year return period:
QU=CUIUA
      (6)   Determine composite runoff coefficient "Cd" based on developed
conditions and a 100-year return period.
      (7)   Determine the 100-year return period rainfall intensity "Id" for
various storm durations "td" up through the time of concentration for the
developed area using Appendix B, Table 6.
      (8)   Determine developed inflow rates "Qd" for various storm durations
“td" measured in hours.
Qd=CdIdA
      (9)   Compute a storage rate "Std" for various storm durations "td" up
through the time of concentration of the developed area.
Std=Qd–Qu
      (10)   Compute required storage volume "SR" in acre-feet for each storm
duration "td". This assumes a triangular hydrograph of duration (2*td) hours
with the peak flow of Std at td hours.
SR=Std (td/12)
      (11)   Select the largest storage volume computed in step 10 for
detention basin design.
   (F)   Determination of storage volume - other methods. Methods other than
the rational method for determining runoff and routing of storm water may be
used to determine the storage volume required to control storm water runoff.
The procedures or methods used must receive the prior approval of the Board.
The ILLUDAS, TN-20 and TR-55 models are approved by the Board for appropriate
use in analysis of the runoff and routing of storm water. The use of these
models or other approved procedures can be defined in a seven-step procedure to
determine the required storage volume of the detention basin.
      Step   Procedure
      (1)   Calibrate the hydrologic/hydraulic model that is to be used for
prediction of runoff and routing of storm water.
      (2)   For each storm duration listed in Appendix B, Table 5, perform,
steps three through six.
      (3)   Determine the 10-year, undeveloped peak flow. Denote this flow by
Q10U
      (4)   Determine the 100-year runoff hydrograph (H100d) for developed
conditions.
      (5)   Determine the hydrograph that must be stored (H100S) by subtracting
a flow up to Q10U from the hydrograph (H100d) found in step 4.
      (6)   Determine the volume of water (VS) to be stored by calculating the
area under the hydrograph (H100S).
      (7)   The detention basin must be designed to store the largest volume
(VS) found for any storm duration analyzed in step 6.
   (G)   General detention basin design requirements.
      (1)   Basins shall be constructed to detain temporarily the storm water
runoff which exceeds the maximum peak flow rate authorized by this chapter. The
volume of storage provided in these basins, together with such storage as may
be authorized in other on-site facilities, shall be sufficient to control
excess runoff from the 100-year storm.
      (2)   The following design principles shall be observed:
         (a)   The maximum volume of water stored and subsequently released at
the design release rate shall not result in a storage duration in excess of 48
hours unless additional storms occur within the period.
         (b)   The maximum planned depth of storm water stored (without a
permanent pool) shall not exceed four feet.
         (c)   All storm water detention facilities shall be separated by not
less than 50 feet from any building or structure to be occupied.
         (d)   All excavated excess spoil may be spread so as to provide for
aesthetic and recreational features such as sliding hills, sports fields, and
the like. Slopes no steeper than 4 horizontal to 1 vertical for safety, erosion
control, stability and ease of maintenance shall be permitted.
         (e)   Safety screens having a maximum opening of four inches shall be
provided for any pipe or opening to prevent children or large animals from
crawling into the structures.
         (f)   Danger signs shall be mounted at appropriate locations to warn
of deep water, possible flooding conditions during storm periods and other
dangers that exist. Fencing shall be provided if deemed necessary by the Board.
         (g)   Outlet control structures shall be designed to operate as simply
as possible and shall require little or no maintenance and/or attention for
proper operation. They shall limit discharges into existing or planned
downstream channels or conduits so as not to exceed the predetermined maximum
authorized peak flow rate.
         (h)   Emergency overflow facilities such as a weir or spillway shall
be provided for the release of exceptional storm runoffs or in emergency
conditions, should the normal discharge devices become totally or partially
inoperative. The overflow facility shall be of such design that its operation
is automatic and does not require manual attention.
         (i)   Grass or other suitable vegetative cover shall be provided
throughout the entire basin area. Grass should be cut regularly at
approximately monthly intervals during the growing season or as required.
         (j)   Debris and trash removal and other necessary maintenance shall
be performed on a regular basis to assure continued operation in conformance to
design.
         (k)   A report shall be submitted to the Board describing (a) the
proposed development; (b) the current land use conditions; (c) the method of
hydraulic and hydrologic analysis used, including any assumptions or special
conditions; (d) the results of the analysis; and (e) the recommended drainage
control facilities. Hydraulic and hydrologic calculations, including input and
output files, shall be included as appendices to the report.
   (H)   Dry-bottom basin design requirements. Detention basins which will not
contain a permanent pool of water shall comply with the following requirements:
      (1)   Provisions shall be incorporated to facilitate complete interior
drainage of dry-bottom basins, to include the provisions of natural grades to
outlet structures, longitudinal and transverse grades to perimeter drainage
facilities, paved gutters, or the installation of subsurface drains.
      (2)   The detention basin shall, whenever possible, be designed to serve
a secondary or multi-purpose function. Recreational facilities, aesthetic
qualities (open spaces) or other types of use shall be considered in planning
the detention facility.
   (I)   Wet-bottom basin design requirements. Where part of a detention basin
will contain a permanent pool of water, all the items required for detention
storage shall apply except that the system of drains with a positive gravity
outlet required to maintain a dry-bottom basin will not be required. A
controlled positive outlet will be required to maintain the design water level
in the wet-bottom basin and provide required detention storage above the design
water level. However, the following additional conditions shall apply:
      (1)   Basins designed with permanent pools or containing permanent ponds
shall have a water area of at least one-half acre. If fish are to be maintained
in the pond, a minimum depth of approximately ten feet shall be maintained over
at least 25% of the pond area. The remaining pond area shall have no extensive
shallow areas, except as required by division (I)(3) below.
      (2)   In excavated ponds, the underwater side slopes in the pond shall be
stable. In the case of valley storage, natural slopes may be considered to be
stable.
      (3)   A safety ledge four to six feet in width is required and must be
installed in all ponds approximately 30 to 36 inches below the permanent water
level. In addition, a similar maintenance ledge 12 to 18 inches above the
permanent water line shall be provided. The slope between the two ledges shall
be stable and of a material such as stone or riprap which will prevent erosion
due to wave action.
      (4)   A safety ramp exit from the pond is required in all cases and shall
have a minimum width of 20 feet and exit slope of 6 horizontal to 1 vertical.
The ramp shall be of a material that will prevent its deterioration due to
vehicle use and/or wave action
      (5)   Periodic maintenance is required in ponds to control weed and
larval growth. The pond shall also be designed to provide for the easy removal
of sediment which will accumulate during periods of pond operation. A means of
maintaining the designed water level of the pond during prolonged periods of
dry weather is also required.
      (6)   For emergency use, basin cleaning or shoreline maintenance,
facilities shall be provided or plans prepared for auxiliary equipment to
permit emptying and drainage.
      (7)   Facilities to enhance and maintain pond water quality shall be
provided, if required to meet applicable water quality standards. Design
calculations to substantiate the effectiveness of these aeration facilities
shall be submitted with final engineering plans. Agreements for the perpetual
operation and maintenance of aeration facilities shall be prepared to the
satisfaction of the Board.
   (J)   Parking lot storage. Paved parking lots may be designed to provide
temporary detention storage of storm waters on all or a portion of their
surfaces. Outlets will be designed so as to empty the stored waters slowly.
Depths of storage must be limited to a maximum depth of seven inches, so as to
prevent damage to parked vehicles, and so that access to parked vehicles is not
impaired. Ponding should, in general, be confined to those positions of the
parking lots farthest from the area served.
   (K)   Facility financial responsibilities. The construction cost of storm
water control systems and facilities as required by this chapter shall be
accepted as part of the cost of land development. If general public use of the
facility can be demonstrated, negotiations for public participation in the cost
of such development may be considered.
   (L)   Facility maintenance responsibility.
      (1)   See §
157.28(C) concerning detention basins within residential major subdivisions.
      (2)   On commercial, industrial and institutional developments,
maintenance of detention facilities during construction and thereafter shall be
the responsibility of the land developer/owner.
   (M)   Inspections. All public and privately-owned detention storage
facilities shall be inspected not less often than once every five years. For
commercial, industrial and institutional sites, the property owner shall
provide a certified inspection report by a licensed professional engineer or
land surveyor covering physical conditions, available storage capacity and
operational condition of key facility elements to the Board. For inspections
within major subdivisions, see §
157.28(C)(3).
   (N)   Corrective measures. If deficiencies are found by the inspector, the
owner of the detention/retention facility will be required to take the
necessary measures to correct such deficiencies. If the owner fails to do so,
the city will undertake the work and collect from the owner using lien rights,
if necessary.
   (O)   Joint development of control systems. Storm water control systems may
be planned and constructed jointly by two or more developers as long as
compliance with this chapter is maintained.
   (P)   Installation of control systems. Runoff and erosion control systems
shall be installed as soon as possible during the course of site development.
Detention/retention basins shall be designed with an additional 10% of
available capacity to allow for sediment accumulation resulting from
development and to permit the pond to function for reasonable periods between
cleanings. Basins should be designed to collect sediment and debris in specific
locations so that removal costs are kept to a minimum.
   (Q)   Detention facilities in floodplains. If detention storage is provided
within a floodplain, only the net increase in storage volume above that which
naturally existed on the floodplain shall be credited to the development. No
credit will be granted for volumes below the elevation of the regulatory flood
at the location unless compensatory storage is also provided.
   (R)   Off-site drainage provisions. When the allowable runoff is released in
an area that is susceptible to flooding, the developer may be required to
construct appropriate storm drains through such area to avert increased flood
hazard caused by the concentration of allowable runoff at one point instead of
the natural overland distribution. The requirement of off-site drains shall be
at the discretion of the Board.

§ 157.28 EXISTING REGULATED DRAINS AND ESTABLISHMENT OF URBAN REGULATED DRAINS.
   The County Drainage Board has established a system of regulated rural and
urban drains as shown on official maps located in the office of the County
Surveyor. Maintenance and administrative jurisdiction over these drains is
empowered to the Drainage Board by IC 36-9-27-15.
   (A)   Drainage easements. When an existing regulated drain is within the
property to be developed, easements must be provided to cover all elements of
the drainage system and must be designed as follows:
      (1)   To be adequate to install, access, and maintain the drainage
facilities.
      (2)   To minimize conflicts with utility easements.
      (3)   To maintain a sufficient buildable area on each lot or parcel.
      (4)   No trees, shrubs, or other vegetative obstructions shall be allowed
within drainage easements per IC 36-9-27-33.
      (5)   No driveways shall be allowed in drainage easements except for the
purpose of crossing a front yard drainage easement to provide access to the
property.
      (6)   Minimum drainage easements are as per IC 36-9-27-33.
   (B)   Existing regulated drains.
      (1)   No individual may dredge, reconstruct, fill, or outlet any drainage
tile or storm sewer pipe into a county regulated drain without the prior
written approval of the Drainage Board. The County Surveyor, or designated
representative, shall supervise any work done to a regulated drain by any
individual granted such written authorization from the Drainage Board.
      (2)   The Drainage Board may levy assessments to property owners within a
regulated drain's watershed in order to maintain the drain in accordance with
IC 36-9-27-44 and to reconstruct a regulated drain in accordance with IC 36-9-
27-50.
      (3)   As per IC 36-9-27-66, whenever land has been assessed as benefitted
by the construction, reconstruction, or maintenance of a regulated drain and
there is not an open or tiled drain connecting the land with the regulated
drain or the waters from the land flow over or through land owned by others to
reach the regulated drain, the owner of the land assessed may petition the
Drainage Board to construct through the land of the other owners a new drain
that will connect the petitioner's lands with the regulated drain.
      (4)   A private crossing, control dam, or other permanent structure or
obstruction may not be placed over or through a regulated drain unless the
plans for the structure have been reviewed by the County Surveyor and approved
in writing by the Drainage Board.
   (C)   Establishment of urban regulated drains. The Drainage Board shall
require that developers of major residential subdivisions create an urban
regulated drain as part of the major subdivision plat. The urban regulated
drain shall include all storm sewers, subsurface drains, inlets, manholes, and
detention basins within the subdivision.
      (1)   Urban regulated drainage easements shall maintain a minimum width
of 20 feet centered over all closed conduits or 20 feet each side of an open
urban regulated drain or detention basin.
      (2)   A minimum 15-foot wide access easement shall be platted between the
detention basin and the nearest public street right-of-way.
      (3)   The County Surveyor shall establish a schedule for the assessment
of each lot in the subdivision in an amount not to exceed $100 per lot per year
to provide an accumulating maintenance and repair fund. These funds can be used
to inspect repair and maintain storm sewers, curb inlets, manholes, subsurface
tile drains, outlet pipes, and detention basins in the subdivision. Within the
context of this chapter, moving shall not be defined as a maintenance activity
covered by an assessment. Individual property owners shall maintain
responsibility for mowing portions of the urban regulated drain within and
adjacent to each individual lot.

§ 157.29 DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR MINOR SUBDIVISIONS AND OTHER LAND DISTURBING
ACTIVITIES.
   (A)   Driveway requirements. Any site that derives access from a city street
shall be required to obtain approval from the Street Commissioner, or designee,
prior to installation of a new access to the street. Any site that derives
access from a county highway shall be required to obtain approval from the
County Highway Supervisor, or designee, prior to installation of a new access
to the highway. A drainage culvert for the purpose of conveying water from the
roadside ditch underneath the driveway shall be required to be placed under all
driveways entering onto a county road, unless a culvert is deemed unnecessary
by the County Highway Supervisor. The minimum size for such a culvert shall be
12 inches in diameter and 30 feet in length. The size of the drainage culvert
shall provide capacity for the flow from a 25-year design return period storm.
   (B)   Allowable drainage outlet. It shall be illegal to outlet any storm
sewers, sump pump drains, downspout drains, perimeter septic system tile
drains, farm tile drains, foundation or floor drains into the right-of-way of
any roadway including all county roads, state highways, federal highways,
private streets, regulated open or tile drains, onto adjacent property, and so
on, without the written approval of the agency having jurisdiction over the
roadway, regulated drain, or the owner of the property upon which the water
will flow. Outletting of subsurface tile drains into a 6 or 8-inch outlet tile
or open channel of a legal drain located within a county road right-of-way and
which has been designed to serve such a purpose shall be permitted subject to
plan approval of the County Surveyor or the County Highway Supervisor.
   (C)   Maintenance of existing roadside ditches. The excavation, filling,
paving, and/or any other type of construction of roadside drainage ditches
located within county highway right-of-ways is prohibited. Exceptions may be
granted by the Drainage Board or the County Highway Superintendent and must be

§ 157.40 CERTIFICATION REQUIRED.
   (A)   After completion of the project and before final approval and
acceptance can be made, a professionally prepared and certified "as- built" set
of plans shall be submitted to the Board for review. These plans shall include
all pertinent data relevant to the completed storm drainage system and shall
include:
      (1)   Pipe size and pipe material.
      (2)   Invert elevations.
      (3)   Top rim elevations.
      (4)   Lengths of all pipe structures.
      (5)   Data and calculations showing detention basin storage volume.
      (6)   Certified statement on plans stating the completed storm drainage
system substantially complies with construction plans as approved by the Board.
   (B)   All such submitted plans shall be reviewed for compliance within 45
days after submission to the Board or County Surveyor. If notice of
noncompliance is not given within 45 days of submission of the plans, the plans
shall be construed as approved and accepted.
(Ord. 2000-22, passed 12-28-00)
§ 157.41 CHANGES IN PLANS.
   Any revision, significant change or deviation in the detailed plans and
specifications after formal approval by the Board shall be filed in duplicate
with and approved by the Board prior to implementation of the revision or
change. Copies of the revisions or changes, if approved, shall be attached to
the original plans and specifications. Revised copies of construction plans
shall be filed with the Board and the County Surveyor.
(Ord. 2000-22, passed 12-28-00)
§ 157.42 ENFORCEMENT.
   Individuals found to be in violation of this chapter shall be subject to
specific penalties including, but not limited to, a warning letter, a stop-work
order, or a suit for injunction; issued by a representative of the County
Surveyor or the Board.
   (A)   Stop-work order.
      (1)   A representative for the County Surveyor or Board shall post a
written stop-work order indicating items/reasons for the order if:
         (a)   Any land disturbing activity regulated under this chapter is
being undertaken without a permit;
         (b)   The conditions of the permit are not being met.
      (2)   Following the issuance of a stop-work order, the developer may only
work on-site to bring the development into compliance, but no progress on the
work may occur until a ruling is made by the Board. The owner or developer may
appeal to the issuer of the stop-work order to retract it if the reason(s) for
the stop-work order has/have been remedied prior to the next regularly
scheduled Board meeting.
   (B)   Board ruling. At the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board, it
shall make a ruling on the stop-work order to determine the remedial action
required and the time period to complete the remedial action.
(Ord. 2000-22, passed 12-28-00)
§ 157.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   If the remedial action set forth in §
157.42 is not completed in accordance with the Board ruling, a penalty shall be
imposed on the owner or developer up to a maximum of $500 per day.
   (B)   Any individual violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall
be subject to the legal remedies available to the Board, which may include suit
for injunction in either Randolph County Circuit Court or Superior Court,
penalties and fines, and reimbursement of legal fees.

city’s codes concerning unsafe buildings or unsightly premises.
   (B)   Inspection at least once every five years. Every rental unit operated

      (3)   A written inspection report of the inspection under division (C)(2)
has been issued to the owner of the rental unit or rental unit community (as

   (D)   Additional inspections. In addition to the routine inspection, the
city may inspect any rental unit, if the political subdivision has reason to
believe or receives a complaint that the rental unit does not comply with
applicable code requirements, so long as the city provides 72 hours written
notice as provided in division(A)(2) above. There shall be no charge for the
additional inspection.
   (E)   Access. Every occupant of a rental unit shall give the owner thereof

provisions of this chapter.
   (F)   Inspection fee. There shall be no charge for any routine inspection or
additional inspection.

owner of every registered and inspected rental unit an inspection certificate
as proof that the unit passed inspection. The inspection certificate shall be
valid until the next inspection.
   (H)   Violation notice. If an inspection officer finds that a rental unit or
any part thereof fails to comply with any standard set forth in this chapter,
any other ordinance of the city or any statute of the State of Indiana, he or
she shall give notice of the alleged violation to the owner of the rental unit
(the "Violation Notice"). The violation notice shall be in writing and shall
reasonably describe the violation found. The violation notice shall further
specify the date by which the violation must be corrected.

   (J)   Curing violations. A rental unit that the inspection officer finds to
be unsafe or uninhabitable shall be repaired so that it meets acceptable
standards within 15 days of the violation notice. Any other violations shall be
repaired within 30 days of the violation notice. Failure to cure a violation
shall result in a violation of this chapter and the owner may be cited into the
City Court. The Board of Public Works may extend the period for cure for good
cause.
   (K)   Re-inspection. Upon termination of the applicable notice period as
provided in division (J) above, the city may re-inspect the property and charge
an inspection fee for any and all such re-inspections.
