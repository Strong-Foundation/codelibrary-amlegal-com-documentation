§ 10.01  TITLE OF CODE.
   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the city, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered, and consolidated into component codes,
titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the “City of
Austin Code,” for which designation “Code of Ordinances,” “Codified
Ordinances,” or “Code” may be substituted.  Code title, chapter, and section
headings do not constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.
§ 10.02  INTERPRETATION.

same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.

   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.

reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or subsection.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters, or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)
§ 10.05  RULES OF INTERPRETATION; DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Rules of interpretation. This code shall be construed by the following
rules unless the construction is plainly repugnant to the legislative intent or
context of the provision.

usual sense. Technical  words and phrases having a peculiar and appropriate 
meaning in law shall be understood according to their technical import.
      (2)   Words imputing joint authority to three or more persons shall be
construed as imputing authority to a majority of the persons, unless otherwise
declared in the section giving the authority.
      (3)   Where a section requires an act to be done which, by law, an agent
or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.
      (4)   Words denoting the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the
feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,
and words in the plural shall include the singular; the use of a verb in the
present tense shall include the future, if applicable.

(I.C. 1-1-4-5)
§ 10.06  SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   If any section of this code now enacted or subsequently amended or its

not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid section
or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is
severable.  If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the
invalidity does not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of
whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a statute stating that the provisions of an act are
severable as provided in division (B) of this section does not affect the
operation of division (B) with respect to that act.

§ 10.07  REFERENCE TO OTHER SECTIONS.
   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof, the
reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified, or renumbered unless the subject matter is
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.08  REFERENCE TO OFFICES; NAME DESIGNATIONS.
   (A)   Reference to offices.  Reference to a public office or officer shall
be deemed to apply to any office, officer, or employee of this municipality
exercising the powers, duties, or functions contemplated in the provision,
irrespective of any transfer of functions or change in the official title of
the functionary.
   (B)   Name designations.  Whenever any ordinance or resolution of the
Council refers to any board, bureau, commission, division, department, officer,
agency, authority, or instrumentality of any government, and that name
designation is incorrectly stated; on the effective date of that ordinance or
following the effective date, the rights, powers, duties, or liabilities placed
with that entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named
board, bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority, or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date
or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which the duties,
liabilities, powers, and rights were transferred.
(I.C. 1-1-6-1)
§ 10.09  ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published.  No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
the error.
§ 10.10  REASONABLE TIME.
   (A)   In all cases where an ordinance requires an act to be done in a
reasonable time or requires reasonable notice to be given, reasonable time or
notice shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of the act or the giving of the notice.
   (B)   The time within which an act is to be done, as herein provided, shall
be computed by excluding the first day and including the last. If the last day
be a Saturday, Sunday, or a state holiday, it shall be excluded.
§ 10.11  REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture, or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12  LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected
by the repeal and reenactment; but all suits, proceedings, and prosecutions for
causes arising or acts committed prior to the effective date of this code may
be commenced and prosecuted with the same effect as if this code had not been
enacted.

section of this code, the chapter or section shall be specifically repealed and
a new chapter or section, containing the desired amendment, substituted in its
place.
   (B)   Any ordinance which is proposed to add to the existing code a new
chapter or section shall indicate, with reference to the arrangement of this

indication thereof as may appear in the text of the proposed ordinance, a
caption or title shall be shown in concise form above the ordinance.

course of a normal work day.
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques. A grab sample can be composed of discrete samples, but all samples
must be obtained and combined within a 15-minute time period from start of
sampling to finish. When taking a grab sample, the entire mouth of the sample
jar must be submerged below the surface of the wastestream. The pH sample
should be analyzed immediately and must not be held longer than two hours in
any case.
   (B)   Grab sample. The Wastewater Superintendent may use a grab sample to
determine noncompliance with any pretreatment standards.

the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred
as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to
person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines,
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
      (3)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
discharge described in division (B)(1) above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees who are in a position to cause, discover, or observe such an
accidental discharge are advised of the emergency notification procedures.
   (C)   Reports of changed conditions. All industrial users must notify the
Wastewater Superintendent of any planned significant changes to the user’s
operations or system which will alter the volume or characteristics of its
wastewater, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which
the industrial user has submitted initial notification under division (D) below
at least 30 days before the change. Industrial users described in division (C)
(5) below are subject to additional notification of change reporting
procedures.
      (1)   For purposes of this requirement, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES include, but
are not limited to, flow increases of 20% or greater, and/or the discharge of
any previously unreported pollutants.
      (2)   The Wastewater Superintendent may require the user to submit
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §
51.122 of this chapter.
      (3)   The Wastewater Superintendent may issue a wastewater discharge
permit under §
51.122 of this chapter or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit in
response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
      (4)   No user shall implement the planned changed condition(s) until and
unless the Wastewater Superintendent has responded to the industrial user’s
notice.
      (5)   Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating
equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production based
standard shall notify the Wastewater Superintendent within two business days
after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month.
   (D)   Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
      (1)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Wastewater
Superintendent, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any
discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would
be a hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. part 261. Such notification must include
the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 261, the EPA
hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, other).
If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month
to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to
the extent such information is known and readily available to the user; an
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an
estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste-
stream discharged during that calendar month, and a estimation of the mass of
constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following
12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days submitted
only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of
changed conditions must be submitted under division (C) below. The notification
requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under
the self-monitoring requirement of §
51.125(B) through (D) of this chapter.
      (2)   Discharges are exempt from the requirements of division (A), above,
during a calendar month in which the discharge is no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of
non-acute hazardous wastes (in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes) as specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), require
a onetime notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more
than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
      (3)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA, being 42
U.S.C. §§ 6901 et seq.,  identifying additional characteristics of hazardous
waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must
notify the Wastewater Superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste
Division Wastewater Superintendent, and State hazardous waste authorities of
the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such
regulations.
      (4)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
      (5)   All industrial users permitted by the city shall make a one time
notification to the Wastewater Superintendent on the city’s “Hazardous Waste
Notification Form” stating if the company is subject to the reporting
conditions in divisions (D)(1) and (D)(2) above.
      (6)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
   (E)   Reports from non-permitted users.
      (1)   All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit
shall provide appropriate reports to the Wastewater Superintendent as the
Wastewater Superintendent may require.
      (2)   Written reports required under any section of this chapter will be
deemed to have been submitted on the date post-marked. For reports which are
not marked, or do not show a postmark, the date of receipt of the report shall
govern.

§ 51.190  ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT/REMEDIES.
   The Wastewater Superintendent shall prepare, for passage by the City
Council, an Enforcement Response Guide (ERG) to ensure that the requirements of
40 C.F.R. 125.120 through 125.140, and § 403 of the Clean Water Act, being 42
U.S.C. § 1343, will be met. The ERG shall outline various administrative
actions the Wastewater Superintendent may take for various pretreatment
violations. The maximum fine shall be $1,000 per violation. The Wastewater
Superintendent shall review and update, on an annual basis, for the City
Council any changes needed to ensure compliance with the federal, state and
local pretreatment regulations as listed in the act and this chapter.
(Ord. 2009-02, passed 5-12-2009)
§ 51.191  CONSENT ORDERS.
   The Wastewater Superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with
any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time
period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and
effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §§
51.193 and
51.194 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Ord. 2009-02, passed 5-12-2009)
§ 51.192  SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   The Wastewater Superintendent may order a user which has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to appear before the Wastewater Superintendent and show cause why
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on
the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user
show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice
of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice
may be served on any authorize representative of the user. A show cause hearing
shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user.
(Ord. 2009-02, passed 5-12-2009)
§ 51.193  ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the Wastewater Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Wastewater Superintendent may issue an order to the user
responsible for the discharge directing that the user come in compliance within
a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time
provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the
user of liability of any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2009-02, passed 5-12-2009)
§ 51.194  CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   When the Wastewater Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
requirement, or that the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the
Wastewater Superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it to cease
and desist all such violation and directing the user to:
   (A)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   (B)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operation and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the users.
(Ord. 2009-02, passed 5-12-2009)
§ 51.195  EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   The Wastewater Superintendent may immediately suspend a user’s discharge,
after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or
cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons. The Wastewater Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user’s
discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment.
   (A)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Wastewater
Superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment any individuals. The Wastewater
Superintendent may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Wastewater Superintendent that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in §
51.196 of this chapter are initiated against the user.
   (B)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Wastewater Superintendent prior to the
date of any show cause or termination hearing under §
51.192 or §
51.196 of this chapter. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as
requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Ord. 2009-02, passed 5-12-2009)
§ 51.196  TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.
   In addition to any other provisions of this chapter, any user who violated
the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
   (A)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
   (B)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
   (C)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
   (D)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring, or sampling;
   (E)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §
51.140 of this chapter. Such user will be notified of the proposed termination
of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under §
51.192 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of
this option by the Wastewater Superintendent shall not be a bar to, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2009-02, passed 5-12-2009)
§ 51.197  JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.

user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Wastewater Superintendent may
petition through any court of general jurisdiction within the county, for the
issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which
restrains or complies the specific performance of the wastewater discharge
permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of
the user. The Wastewater Superintendent may also seek such other action as is
appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the
user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against a user.
   (B)   Civil penalties. In addition to the administrative fines available
herein, a user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall also be liable to the city for a
maximum civil penalty of $1,000 per violation, per day. In the case of a
monthly or other long-term average, discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for
each day during the period of the violation.
   (C)   Recovery of fees. The Wastewater Superintendent may recover reasonable
attorney’s fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement
activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any
actual damages incurred by the city.
   (D)   Determining civil liability. In determining the amount of civil
liability, the Court shall take into account all relevant circumstances,
including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the
magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through
the user’s violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of
the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
   (E)   Other action. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite, for taking any other action against a user.
(Ord. 2009-02, passed 5-12-2009)
§ 51.198  REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE.
   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The Wastewater
Superintendent may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in
accordance with the city enforcement response plan. However, the Wastewater
Superintendent may take other action against any user when the circumstances
warrant. Further, the Wastewater Superintendent is empowered to take more than
one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.

   (A)   When the Wastewater Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Wastewater Superintendent may fine such user in an amount not
to exceed $1,000 as set forth in the enforcement response guide. Such fines
shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or
other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day
during the period of violation.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall after 45 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance, and interest shall
accrue thereafter at a rate of 1 ½% per month. A lien against the user’s
property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the Wastewater Superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment of
the fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request
has merit, the Wastewater Superintendent may convene a meeting on the matter.
In the event the user’s appeal is successful, the payment, together with an
interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user.

§ 93.07  WHEN ABATEMENT NOTICE NOT REQUIRED.
   Where, in the opinion of the enforcement authority, a nuisance exists which
creates a substantial and imminent health or safety hazard requiring immediate
abatement in order to protect health and safety, the enforcement authority,
shall abate the nuisance without the necessity of issuing an abatement notice
as set out in §
93.05 but only after notifying the Board of Works. The enforcement authority
shall then present its actions to the Board of Works at the Board's next
meeting following the abatement action.

§ 93.08  HEARINGS.
   (A)   Any owner, tenant or occupant, or person holding a substantial

who disputes the existence of a nuisance, or disputes the nature of the
abatement action ordered in the abatement notice, may, within ten calendar days
of service of the abatement notice, serve upon the Board of Works a written
request for a hearing. The written request does not need to be in any
particular form, but shall clearly indicate that a hearing is requested, and
shall set out the nature of the individual's disagreement with the content of
the abatement notice.
   (B)   Upon receipt of the written request for a hearing, the Board of Works
shall place the matter on the agenda of the Board of Works for hearing. The
Board of Works shall function as hearing body to adjudicate the matter.
   (C)   The Board of Works shall give written notice to the party requesting
the hearing of the date and time of the hearing. Such notice shall be given no
less than five calendar days prior to the date set for the hearing.
   (D)   At the hearing, which may be adjourned from time to time, it shall be
the city's burden to go forward with evidence sufficient to demonstrate that a
nuisance exists, and that the actions required are reasonably calculated to
abate the nuisance within a reasonable period of time. The party requesting the
hearing shall have the right to dispute the existence of the nuisance, the
reasonableness of the remedy, or the reasonableness of the time allowed for
remedial action. The party requesting the hearing may propose alternative
remedies or time periods for remedial action, or alternate remediation plans.
   (E)   At the hearing, both sides may present witnesses, elicit testimony,
introduce physical evidence, cross-examine opposing witnesses or dispute
evidence submitted by their hearing opponent. Both sides may present oral
arguments. Both sides may be represented by counsel.
   (F)   At such hearings shall be open to the public pursuant to Indiana
statutes on open meetings.
   (G)   Upon conclusion of the presentation of evidence and oral argument, if
any, the Board of Works shall deliberate and render a decision either
confirming, amending, or rescinding the disputed content of the abatement
notice. The decision of the Board of Works shall be final.
   (H)   All time parameters set out in the abatement notice for completion of
compliance actions shall be tolled, pending the outcome of the Board of Works'
decision. In cases where the actions of the enforcement authority are upheld,
or are upheld as modified by the Board, it shall be the responsibility of the
Board, in its decision, to establish time periods for completion of compliance
activities held in abeyance during the hearing process.
(Ord. 2014-02, passed 4-10-2014)
§ 93.09 COMPLIANCE WITH ABATEMENT NOTICE.
   It being the intent of this chapter to promote the abatement of nuisances
within the city, in those instances where the nuisance is abated to the
satisfaction of the enforcement authority as required in the abatement notice,
or as required by the Board of Works after hearing, and within the time periods
set out in the abatement notice, or within any other extended time periods
agreed to by the enforcement authority, or such time extensions as are, after
the hearing, ordered by the Board of Works, no further fines or penalties will
be imposed. The Board of Works shall make written note of the compliance and
the enforcement file shall be closed.
(Ord. 2014-02, passed 4-10-2014)  Penalty, see §

§ 93.10  FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ABATEMENT NOTICE.
   Failure, neglect, or refusal by the record owner or his or her agent, or the
tenant or occupant, to comply with the orders set out in the abatement notice
within the time periods set out therein, or within any extended time periods
agreed to by the enforcement authority, shall constitute a violation of this
Ordinance and shall render the record owner or his or her agent, or the tenant
or occupant, liable to a fine as set forth in §
93.99. Each day's failure, neglect or refusal to abate the nuisance during the
time period allowed for compliance shall constitute a separate offense under
this subchapter. The record owner of the premises upon which the nuisance is
found to exist, and the tenant or occupant, may be held jointly and severally
liable for the payment of fines assessed under this subchapter.

§ 93.11  ABATEMENT BY CITY.
   (A)   In addition to fines imposed under §
93.99, in non-emergency situations where abatement is not accomplished
immediately by the city, failure, neglect, or refusal of any party to abate a
nuisance as required by the abatement notice shall authorize the enforcement
authority to obtain the permission of the Board of Works to abate the nuisance
as set out in the abatement notice. Where such permission is sought, the
enforcement authority shall file a copy of the abatement notice with the
Recorder of Scott County, Indiana, to give constructive notice to subsequent
purchasers that the real estate is subject to the costs associated with the
abatement. Work may be accomplished with city crews if the work is within their
capacity to accomplish, or the work may be advertised for public bid and
awarded to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder. An accurate accounting
shall be kept of all costs incurred in abating the nuisance. Upon completion of
the abatement, a statement for costs incurred shall be forwarded to the record
owner by certified mail. Should such costs remain unpaid ten calendar days
after receipt by the owner of record, or upon return of the certified mail as
undeliverable, appropriate legal action may be taken to compel payment of costs
incurred. Any judgment for costs obtained shall be filed as a judgment lien
against the real estate upon which the nuisance was abated.
   (B)   In the alternative, where there has been non-compliance with the
abatement notice, the city is also authorized to seek equitable relief in a
court of competent jurisdiction to compel compliance with the orders set out in
the abatement notice.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES, AND DEFINITIONS
§ 151.001  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
City Council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 2014-03, passed 5-12-2014)
§ 151.002  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-proofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 2014-03, passed 5-12-2014)
§ 151.003  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result In damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters.
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
Increase erosion or flood damage.
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (F)   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and
their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2014-03, passed 5-12-2014)
§ 151.004  OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health.
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public,
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains.
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
(Ord. 2014-03, passed 5-12-2014)
§ 151.005  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE.  Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
      ZONE A.  Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood event.
Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood
elevation or depths are shown.
      ZONE AE and A1-A30.  Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance
flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown
within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-
A30.)
      ZONE AO.  Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      ZONE AH.  Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
      ZONE AR.  Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      ZONE A99.  Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE).  A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE).  Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter toad-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL.  A request for a review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING.  A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding Is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD.  The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE).  The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.

ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which
control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state,
or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for
preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. Floodplain management
regulations are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain
ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain management
requirements.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING).  A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary

§ 151.064  STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
151.021, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in §§
151.060 to
151.067 have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community's more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is
defined as an increase In the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
fifteen-hundredths of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood
elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway
condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 C.F.R. § 65.12.
(Ord. 2014-03, passed 5-12-2014)
§ 151.065  STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
151.060 to
151.067 have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor or
any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.

§ 151.066 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in §§
151.060 to
151.067 have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
151.060 to
151.067 have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, will not Increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and will not increase flood damages
or potential flood damages.

imposed under any other law of the state, then the regulations established by
virtue of this chapter shall prevail only if they assure the promotion of the
health, safety, convenience, and welfare of the citizens.
   (B)   Historic buildings and districts. Where preservation of existing
conditions or restoration to original conditions consistent with the intent of

of this chapter, a building on the National Register of Historic Places, a

landmark of the state shall be exempt from such requirements that conflict with
historic accuracy.
(Ord. 1991-07, passed 1-7-1991)

§ 152.024  MANUFACTURED HOUSING.
   It is the intent of this section to encourage provision of alternate modest
income housing in general residential areas by permitting the use of certain
manufactured homes, as defined herein, in all districts in which similar
dwellings constructed on site are permitted, subject to the requirements set
forth herein to assure acceptable similarity in exterior appearance between
such manufactured homes and dwellings that have been or might be constructed
under these and other lawful regulations on adjacent or nearby lots in the same
district.
   (A)   Permanent placement. The establishment, location, and use of
manufactured homes as scattered-site residences shall be permitted in any zone
permitting installation of a dwelling unit, subject to the requirements and
limitations applying generally to such residential use in the appropriate zone,
and provided such homes shall meet the following requirements and limitations.
      (1)   The home shall meet all requirements applicable to single-family
dwellings, and possess all necessary improvement location, building, and
occupancy permits and other certifications as required by this chapter.
      (2)   The home shall meet the minimum square footage requirements for the
appropriate zone.
      (3)   The home shall be attached and anchored to a permanent foundation
in conformance with the regulations in the Indiana One and two-family Dwelling
Code and with manufacturer’s installation specifications.
      (4)   The terms of division (A) above shall apply to the placement of
manufactured housing located outside mobile home parks only.
      (5)   The exterior siding material on the home shall extend below the top
of the foundation by at least one inch.
      (6)   A dwelling unit fabricated on or after January 1, 1981, in an off-
site manufacturing facility for installation or assembly at the building site,
bearing a seal certifying that it is built in compliance with the federal
Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Code or Indiana Public
Law 360, Acts of 1971, as promulgated by the Indiana Administrative Building
Council. Should a court, either federal or state, determine that the
fabrication date of January 1, 1981, is arbitrary or a violation of any federal
or state right, including equal protection laws, this chapter shall not be
interpreted to exclude fabricated dwelling units constructed after July 15,
1976, which manufactured homes comply with all HUD Code requirements.
   (B)   Temporary placement.
      (1)   Permitted placement.  The placement of manufactured homes built
prior to January 1, 1981, and mobile homes shall be permitted within the
corporate limits of the city, and outside of mobile home parks, on a temporary
basis in the following circumstances:
         (a)   For use of a manufactured home or mobile home as a caretaker’s
quarters or a construction office at a job site;
         (b)   For use of a manufactured home or mobile home as a temporary
residence, located on the building lot, during the course of construction of a
site-built dwelling and when the Board of Zoning Appeals has approved the
temporary placement by granting a variance to the owner or contract buyer who
is in the process of constructing said site-built dwelling after obtaining a
building permit for same; or
         (c)   For use of a manufactured home or mobile home as a temporary
residence, located adjacent to an existing residence, when the Board of Zoning
Appeals has approved the temporary placement by granting a variance to the
owner or contract buyer whose own health or the health of another necessitates
care and where the facts show that an unnecessary hardship would occur if not
permitted to locate a temporary residence adjacent to the residence of one who
is able to provide such care or is in need of such care.
      (2)   Provisions regulating permitted placement. A temporary use permit
shall be obtained prior to placement of a manufactured home or mobile home for
temporary use as herein defined. For use of a manufactured home or a mobile
home as temporary residences, placement shall be additionally subject to:
         (a)   Applicable health provisions for sanitary facilities;
         (b)   Providing an adequate ground anchor; and
         (c)   Setback provisions as stated in the appropriate zone.
      (3)   Time limitations for temporary placement. A temporary use permit
may be issued for a period not to exceed one year. A variance, when granted
under the circumstances herein described, shall not exceed one year. A variance
may be renewed, at the discretion of the Board of Zoning Appeals, for an
additional one-year period by requesting such an extension through the
established procedures for filing an appeal except that the normal filing fee
shall be waived in cases of medical hardship as herein defined.
      (4)   Utility requirements. Manufactured or mobile homes used for
temporary uses shall have an approved water supply, sewage disposal system, and
utility connections, where appropriate, and at the discretion of the Plan
Commission or its designated administrator.
      (5)   Permit fee. A temporary use permit shall be issued by the Plan
Commission’s designated administrator. The fee shall be $25 and is in addition
to all other required permits for utilities and sewage disposal systems.
   (C)   Violation.
      (1)   Subject to removal. A mobile home or manufactured home, placed upon
property in violation of this chapter, shall be subject to removal from such
property. However, the home owner must be given a reasonable opportunity of not
more than 60 days to bring the property into compliance before action for
removal can be taken. If action finally is taken by the appropriate authority
to bring compliance, the expenses involved may be made a lien against the
property.
      (2)   Removal method. The Plan Commission or the Board of Zoning Appeals
or their designated administrator may institute a suit in an appropriate court
for injunctive relief to cause such violation to be prevented, abated, or
removed.

         (a)   Accessory uses/structures shall be permitted in all zones in
accordance with the provisions of this section. Accessory uses/structures:
            1.   Shall be incidental and commonly associated with the operation
of the principal use of the lot;
            2.   Shall be operated and maintained under the same ownership and
on the same lot as the principal use;
            3.   Shall, in residence zones, be clearly subordinate in height,
area, and bulk to the principal use served;

            1.   Such pool shall be installed in the rear yard of the premises;
            2.   There shall be erected and maintained at minimum a good
quality fence not less than five feet in height enclosing the entire portion of
the premises upon which such pool shall be installed and entirely surrounding
the area in which such pool is located; and
            3.   Every gate or other opening in the fence enclosing such pool,

shall be kept securely closed and locked at all times when the owner or
occupant of the premises is not present at such pool.
         (d)   Amateur radio sending and receiving antennae, provided the
height thereof including masts shall not exceed 75 feet measured from the

§ 152.034  NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES.
   (A)   General. Within the zones established in this chapter, there exist
nonconforming uses and structures which may continue to exist in accordance
with the following provisions. The intent and goal of this section and this
chapter is to lessen nonconforming uses and structures.
   (B)   Lots. In any zone permitting only single-family dwellings, a single-
family dwelling shall be permitted on a lot which does not comply with the
width and area requirements of this chapter, provided such lot was of record at
the time of enactment of this chapter, and provided further that adjustments in
yards are in accordance with provisions of this chapter. If two or more lots or
parts of lots are in single ownership and enjoy continuous frontage at the time
of the enactment of this chapter, and if all or part of such lots do not meet
the width and area standards contained in this chapter, the lands involved
shall be considered to be an undivided parcel. No portion of said parcel shall
be used in a manner which may reduce compliance with the provisions of this
chapter.
   (C)   Uses of land; abandonment. A nonconforming use of land shall not be
enlarged, expanded, nor extended to occupy a larger area of land than was
occupied at the time of the enactment of this chapter. A nonconforming use may
be extended throughout any part of an existing structure which was arranged for
such use prior to the enactment of this chapter. Such use shall not be moved in
whole or in part to another location on the lot or parcel of land other than
that occupied by the use at the time of the enactment of this chapter. If any
such use ceases for a period of more than six months (except when government
action or legal proceedings impede access to the premises, as determined by the
Board of Zoning Appeals), any subsequent use of such land shall conform with
the provisions of this chapter unless 66% or more of the surrounding uses of
land within a 660-foot radius are also nonconforming uses of the same
restriction as said subsequent use, thereupon, the proponent of said subsequent
use shall apply for a certificate of nonconformity under the established
procedures and additionally provide signed affidavits affirming the existence
of surrounding nonconforming uses, as herein defined, of the same restriction.
Said six-month limitation shall constitute an abandonment of the nonconforming
use. Provided however, a property owner may commence repairs on restoration as
provided in §
152.035 within said six-month limitation and will not be declared an
abandonment if said repairs are completed within a reasonable time.
   (D)   Structures. A nonconforming structure shall not be moved in whole or
in part to another location on the lot or parcel of land unless said relocation
would bring the structure into conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
If a nonconforming structure is made to conform, any future expansion or
enlargement of said structure shall be in conformance with the provisions of
this chapter. A nonconforming structure may be expanded or enlarged provided
such expansion or enlargement would not further encroach upon the nonconforming
characteristic of the structure.
   (E)   Substitutions. A nonconforming use may be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same or greater restriction provided said change does
not cause further violation of the performance standards of this chapter.

§ 152.035  REPAIRS AND RESTORATION.
   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the repair of a nonconforming
structure. Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of a
structure be destroyed by any means, it may be reconstructed provided it does
not further encroach upon the structure. Nothing shall prevent the repair of a
structure containing a nonconforming use and, where the structure is destroyed
by any means, the resumption of said use shall be subject to the provisions of
§
152.034(C).

§ 152.036  PROOF OF NONCONFORMITY.
   (A)   A certificate of nonconformity shall transfer with ownership of
property and shall be considered proof of a legal nonconforming use with said
use being subject to the applicable provisions of §
152.034.
   (B)   Upon written request by the Administrative Zoning Officer or by his or
her own volition, the owner of a property shall present documentary evidence to
said Officer that a building or use owned by him or her qualifies as a legal
nonconforming use.

§ 152.037  GENERAL EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   Structures other than buildings. Towers, chimneys, stacks, spires,
penthouses, cupolas, water tanks, silos, windmills, monuments, domes, grain
elevators, and like structures may be built to a greater height than
established in this chapter, except in the approach area of any airport where
no structure shall be built which exceeds the maximum height permissible under
the rules and regulations of any governmental agency. (See also §
152.054(A).)
   (B)   Projections. Cornices, eaves, sills, canopies, or similar
architectural features, but not including bay windows or vertical projections,
may extend or project into a required side yard not more than 18 inches and
maximum of 36 inches into a front or rear yard. Any enclosed porch shall be
considered as part of the main building.
   (C)   Setbacks. Where a new building or an addition to an existing building
is proposed on a lot which adjoins two or more lots occupied by buildings, the
setbacks for such new building or addition to an existing building shall be the
main setback of the buildings on each side of the new building or addition to
an existing building.
   (D)   Residential side yard. For a lot having a width of not less than 40
feet and not more than 50  feet at the building line at the time of the

ZONES
§ 152.050  DIVISION INTO ZONES.
   In order to carry out the purposes of this chapter, the incorporated
territory of the city is hereby divided into zones or districts paying
reasonable regard to existing conditions, the character of buildings erected in
each zone, the most desirable use for which the land in each zone may be
adapted, and the conservation of property values throughout the city.
(Ord. 1991-07, passed 1-7-1991)
§ 152.051  CLASSES OF ZONES.
   The incorporated territory of the city is hereby divided into the following
zones:

§ 152.052  ZONE MAPS.
   (A)   General. The zones referred to in §
152.051 and their boundaries, are shown upon maps which are hereby made a part
of this chapter. Such maps are designated as the “Zone Maps for the City of
Austin, Indiana.” The maps and all notations, references, and other information
shown thereon shall be as much a part of this chapter as if matters set in them
were all fully described in this chapter.
   (B)   Identification and recording. All city zone maps shall be identified
by the signature of the President of the City Council, and shall be attested by
the City Clerk-Treasurer and shall bear the seal of the city. Following the
adoption of the city maps by the proper legislative authority, a copy of this
chapter, inclusive of zone maps, shall be filed with the City Clerk-Treasurer,
and the Recorder of the County of Scott, Indiana.
   (C)   Zone boundaries. Where any property is indicated in the zone maps as
acreage and is not subdivided into lots, or where a zone boundary line shall be
determined by using the scale shown on the map, zone boundaries are intended to
follow lot lines, property lines, railroad right-of-ways, city and county
limits, shore lines, lines of streams, canals, lakes or other bodies of water.
Where a boundary divides a lot which was in single ownership at the time of the
enactment of this chapter, the zone applying to the larger portion of the lot
shall be considered as extending to the entire lot. If each portion of the lot
is equal in size, then the most restrictive zone shall apply to both portions
of the divided lot.
   (D)   Restoration. In the event any official zone map may become damaged,
destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret due to physical deterioration or the
nature and number of changes made, the City Council may by ordinance and after
public hearing adopt a new official zone map.
   (E)   Changes. No changes shall be made to the zone maps of the city except
in full conformity with the procedures set forth in this chapter. Zone maps
shall be revised every year in December, and all zone changes officially
adopted by the proper governmental body shall be incorporated on the maps. The
maps as updated shall be submitted to the Plan Commission for its
consideration. If the Commission is satisfied that the changes are correct, it
shall forward the maps to the City Council for adoption. Once adopted, a copy
of the updated maps shall be filed with the City Clerk-Treasurer and the
Recorder of the County of Scott, Indiana.
   (F)   Street vacation. Whenever a street, road, alley, railroad right-of-
way, or other public way is officially vacated, the zones on each side of such
vacated way shall be extended to the center of such street, road, alley,
railroad right-of-way, or public way. This change shall be automatically
achieved and shall not require following procedures established in this chapter
for proposed zone changes.
   (G)   Annexation. Any territory officially annexed to the city shall retain
the same zone or zones as it had when the territory was unincorporated.
   (H)   Similar uses. Similar uses to those permitted in each zone may be
allowable. Whether a certain use is similar to a use listed in a specific zone,
such similarity shall be determined by the Plan Commission under established
procedures.
   (I)   Procedural. Each proposed zoning change referred to the City Council
shall set forth the exact use, for which the petitioner is requesting the
change. If the City Council acts favorably on the requested change, such change
shall be only for the specific use requested by the petitioner and for no other
use. Should the petitioner wish to change the use from the use originally
granted but within the same general zone, he or she shall submit a new petition
and follow established procedures as for a new change in zoning.
      (1)   Should the petitioner to whom a zone change is granted for a
specific use fail to begin construction or installation of a use approved by
the City Council within one year after the passage of the change of zone, the
Zoning Officer shall the inform the City Council, which may initiate the
proceedings to rezone the property subject of the zone change to its original
classification.
      (2)   Within 60 days prior to the expiration of the one-year period, the
petitioner may present the City Council with a bill of particulars setting
forth reasons for failure to commence construction or use. The City Council may
consider said reasons in deciding whether or not to initiate a change  in zone
as herein provided.

   (I)   Sexually oriented business.
      (1)   Purpose. It is recognized that there are some sexually oriented
business uses which by their very nature have serious objectionable operational
characteristics, particularly when they are located in close proximity to
residential neighborhoods, parks, religious facilities, and schools, and
thereby have a deleterious impact upon property values and the quality of life
in such surrounding areas. It has been acknowledged by communities across the
nation that state and local governmental entities have a special concern in
regulation the operation of such businesses under their jurisdiction to ensure
that these adverse secondary effects will not contribute to the blighting or
downgrading of adjacent neighborhoods nor endanger the well-being of the youth
in the communities. The special regulations deemed necessary to control the
undesirable externalities arising from these enterprises are set forth in this
section. The primary purpose of these controls and regulations is to preserve
the integrity and character of residential neighborhoods, to deter the spread
of urban blight, and to protect minors from the objectionable operational
characteristics of these sexually oriented businesses by restricting their
close proximity to religious facilities parks, schools, and residential areas.
      (2)   Prohibitions.
         (a)   The establishment, enlargement, construction, reconstruction, or
structural alteration of any sexually oriented business shall be prohibited if

of any existing religious facility, church, school, park, single-family
district R-1, R-2 Zoning District within the city.
         (b)   No sexually oriented business shall be established, operated,
located, constructed, reconstructed or commenced in any zoning district in the
city except or unless the site shall be located in Limited Industrial Zone
within the city.
         (c)   Adult cabarets, video viewing booths or arcade booths, as
defined herein, are prohibited in all sexually oriented businesses in all
zoning districts within the jurisdiction of the city.
      (3)   Measurement.
         (a)   The distance between one sexually oriented business and anther
shall be measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening structure
or objects, from the closest exterior structural wall of each business.
         (b)   The distance between a sexually oriented business and any
religious facility, school, park, or residential zoning district (R-1, R-2)
shall be measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures
or objects, from the closest exterior structural wall of the sexually oriented
business to the nearest property line of the religious facility, school, park,
or residential zoning district.
      (4)   Exterior display.
         (a)   No sexually oriented business shall be conducted in any manner

§ 152.061  FA FLOOD AREA ZONE.
   (A)   General. Certain areas in the city, under existing conditions, are
unsuitable for permanent occupancy being subject to periodic inundation. The
purpose of the FA Flood Area Zone is to safeguard human life and property from
the dangers of flood and avoid the losses both in life and wealth which may
occur. The city has adopted an ordinance to control flood hazard areas which
should be read in conjunction with this zoning chapter. The city’s ordinance
for flood hazard area shall take precedence and be superior to the terms herein
only if there is determined to be an ambiguity or duplication.
   (B)   Boundaries. The boundaries of the FA Flood Area Zone have been
determined from data obtained from the Louisville District of the Corps of
Engineers of the Department of the Army and the Federal Emergency Management
Agency. Such boundaries run on the west side of the city from State Road 256
south to York Road and on the south side of the city from the intersection of
Cross Street and High Street south to York Road. (see Map at the end of this
section). The city has a flood hazard boundary map, FHBM, and a flood insurance
rate map, FIRM, which were prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
which maps are utilized herein.
   (C)   Permitted uses.
      (1)   No building, structure, or land shall be used and no building or

have not yet been determined;
         (b)   1.   If the site is in an identified floodway the Building
Official shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Department of Natural Resources and
apply for a permit for construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C.
Title 14, a permit from the Natural Resources Commission is required prior to
the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit,
construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes
land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing, and paving,
etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the building;
            2.   No action shall be taken by the Building Official until a
permit has been issued by the Natural Resources Commission granting approval
for construction in the floodway. Once a permit has been issued by the Natural
Resources Commission, the Building Official may issue the local improvement
location permit, provided the provisions contained in Sections 7 and 8 of this
ordinance have been met. The Improvement Location Permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit issued by the Natural Resources Commission;
         (c)   If the site is located in an identified floodway fringes, then
the Building Official may issue the local improvement location permit provided
the provisions contained in this chapter have been met. The key provision is
that the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be
at or above the flood protection grade;
         (d)   If the site is an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and floodway fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Building Official
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Department of Natural Resources for
review and comment.
            1.   No action shall be taken by the Building Official until either
a permit for construction in the floodway or a letter of recommendation citing
the 100-year flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Department of Natural Resources.
            2.   Once the Building Official has received the proper permit or
letter of recommendation approving the proposed development, an improvement
location permit may be issued provided the conditions of the ILP are not less
restrictive than the conditions received from Natural Resources and the
provisions contained in Section 7 and 8 of this ordinance have been met.
         (e)   Preventing increased damages. No development in the Flood Hazard
Area shall create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights
or velocity or threat to public health and safety.
            1.   Within the floodway identified on the flood boundary and
floodway map or the flood insurance rate map, the following standards shall
apply:

(including levees) the city shall submit a request to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency to revise the regulatory flood data.
            2.   Within all SFHAs identified as A Zones (no 100-year flood
elevation and/or floodway/floodway fringe delineation has been provided), the
following standard shall apply: the total cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
will not increase the regulatory flood elevation more than one-tenth (0.1) of
one foot and will not increase flood damages or potential flood damages.
            3.   Public health standards in all SFHAs. No development in the
SFHA shall include locating or storing chemicals, explosives, buoyant
materials, flammable liquids, pollutants, or other hazardous or toxic materials
below the flood protection grade, unless such materials are stored in a storage
tank or floodproofed building constructed according to the requirements of
division (C)(2)(f) below. New and replacement sanitary sewer lines and on-site
waste disposal systems may be permitted providing all manholes  or other 
above-ground openings located below the FPG are watertight.
         (f)   Protecting buildings. In addition to the damage prevention
requirements of division (C)(2)(e) above, all buildings to be located in the
SFHA shall be protected from flood damage below the FPG. This building
protection requirement applies to the following situations:
            1.   Construction or placement of any new building valued at more
than $1,000;
            2.   Structural alterations made to an existing building that
increase the market value of the building by more than 50% (excluding the value
of the land) ;
            3.   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged building that are
valued at or more than 40% of the market value of the building (excluding the
value of the land) before damage occurred;
            4.   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new
manufactured home on an existing site. This chapter does not apply to returning
the existing manufactured home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it
was removed to avoid flood damage; and
            5.   Installing a travel trailer on a site for more than 180 days.
   (D)   Prohibited uses. The following uses shall be totally prohibited in the
FA Flood Area Zone:

§ 152.063  MHR MOBILE HOME RESIDENCE ZONE.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   Mobile homes are increasingly becoming a part of the urban scene,
therefore it has become necessary to establish a zone for them containing basic
and uniform regulations and performance standards in order to protect the
safety, health, and welfare of their occupants as well as the total community.
      (2)   A mobile home park must be sufficient to accommodate the desired
number of units, parking area for motor vehicles, access roads and walkways,
and recreational facilities - all as required in this section. Among the
features to be considered in the planning of mobile home parks shall be: size,
shape, topography, land costs, local codes and ordinances, uses of adjoining
properties, availability of water supply and sewage disposal. Prior to filing
an application for an MHR Mobile Home Residence Zone the interested persons
shall consult with local and state health authorities to determine the
suitability of the site.
   (B)   Standards. The following standards shall be complied with in any plan,
application, or request for a change in zone to permit a mobile home park. Such
standards shall be over and above those which may be required by other local or
State agencies. State standards in I.C. 22-15-4-1 et seq. as amended and 410
I.A.C. 6-6 as amended are minimum standards.
      (1)   Roads: Parking. All streets intended to be dedicated to the public
shall be constructed and designed in compliance with the standards set forth in
the subdivision regulations. All streets intended to be privately owned and
maintained shall be constructed and designed in compliance with the standards
specified herein. All internal streets shall have a minimum width of 24 feet of
pavement. If parking is prohibited on both sides of an internal street, the
width may be reduced to 18 feet of pavement. Internal streets shall be two-way
streets if they are 500 feet or less in length or serve less than 25 mobile
homes.
         (a)   They shall be one-way streets regardless of length if they
provide access to mobile homes on one side of the street only. Dead-end streets
shall be provided with a turn-around having at least 60 feet in diameter.
         (b)   Entrance streets connecting with internal streets shall be not
less than 34 feet in width if parking is permitted on both sides. If parking is
permitted on one side only, such a street may have a width of 27 feet, provided
the entrance street is more than 100 feet in length and does not provide access
to abutting mobile home lots within the first 100 feet.
         (c)   All streets shall intersect at right angles. Street
intersections should be at least 150 feet apart and the intersection of more
than two streets at one point shall be avoided.
         (d)   Grades shall be less than 8%. Short runs up to 12% could be used
if necessary. All streets shall be provided with a smooth, hard, and dense
surface properly drained and according to the most recent city or county
specifications.
         (e)   To reduce traffic hazards, parking or individual parking spaces
on each lot shall be provided at a ratio of eight spaces for every four mobile
home lots. Every parking space shall be located within 100 feet of the mobile
home it is intended to serve.
      (2)   Walkways. Where traffic is expected to be heavy such as in the
proximity of recreation areas, management or service areas, three and one-half
foot common walks shall be provided. Walks shall also be provided on each
mobile home lot so as to connect it with the street. Such walk shall have a
minimum width of two feet.
      (3)   Lots. Every lot in a mobile home park shall contain 3,500 square
feet in area to avoid overcrowding and in order that modern mobile homes and
appurtenances can be properly accommodated. There shall be a 15-foot clearance
between mobile homes, including mobile homes placed end to end. No mobile home
shall be closer to any park property line than 25 feet, 30 feet to any street
or right-of-way, 15 feet to any recreational area. In determining clearances
and open spaces, accessory structures having a horizontal area in excess of 25
square feet located within ten feet of a window shall be considered as a part
of the mobile home. Driveways for individual mobile home lots shall be at least
eight feet in width with an extra two feet if they serve as walks. The on-lot
parking space served by a driveway shall be nine feet wide and 20 feet long.
      (4)   Recreation. Every mobile home park shall provide recreation areas
in a ratio of at least 100  square feet of space for each mobile home lot. No
outdoor recreation area, however, shall be less than 2,500 square feet.
Recreation areas shall be located on sites substantially free from traffic
interference and hazards. The same shall be properly buffered with trees,
evergreens and/or other vegetative growth.
      (5)   Service buildings. There shall be a service building on every
mobile home park to accommodate laundry and storage facilities whose
construction shall conform to local and state building regulations. Such
building shall be of permanent construction and shall have a weather-resistant
exterior finish of moisture-resistant material. Floors shall be impervious to
water and sloped to drains connected to a sewerage system.
   (C)   Permits.
      (1)   It shall be unlawful for any person to construct, alter, or extend
any mobile home park unless he or she has been issued a zoning permit by the
Plan Commission. Application for such permits shall be filed with said Plan
Commission and shall contain the following information: Name and address of the
applicant; location and legal description of the property; and complete
engineering plans and specifications for the proposed park. Engineering plans
shall include the area and dimensions of tract;  number,  location, and size of
all mobile home lots;  location and width of all roadways and walkways; 
location of service buildings and other buildings;  location of water, plans,
and specifications for the water supply systems; plans and specifications for
buildings constructed or to be constructed within the mobile home park; and the

information shall be supplied to the Plan Commission for obtaining a permit.
      (2)   No zoning permit shall be issued by the Plan Commission for the
installation of a mobile home park until a zone change has been favorably
completed and all the requirements of this section have been met. Any extension
of an existing park which was not a part of the original plan shall meet all
the requirements of this section and a permit shall be obtained from said
Officer based on the number of additional lots and the per-lot fee as stated in
this chapter. The zoning permit for the mobile home park shall not be
considered as a permit for common buildings constructed in conjunction with the
park. All recreation buildings, service buildings, and other buildings housing
common facilities shall be considered commercial buildings for the purpose of
obtaining all applicable permits.
   (D)   Sewage-water.
      (1)   No mobile home park shall be permitted unless the same shall be
connected to existing sewerage facilities or unless it provides a sewage
disposal plant which shall adequately serve the proposed park and any future
extension of it. Any sewage disposal plant shall have the approval of the State
of Indiana Board of Health.
      (2)   No mobile home park shall be permitted unless the same is connected
to a public water supply system or shall provide its own adequate centralized
water facility acceptable to the State Board of Health. Written certification
from the agency shall be furnished to the Plan Commission. The sanitary sewer
system and the storm sewer system shall be separate and shall be sized and
designed according to standard engineering practice. Storm sewers shall provide
a minimum velocity of two and five tenths per second when flowing full. Written
certification from an appropriate body or agency shall be furnished to the Plan
Commission that the storm sewers are installed as such or that the drainage
system has been approved.
   (E)   Pest control. Mobile home parks shall establish and operate under the
most rigid practices to control mosquitoes, flies, roaches, rats, fleas, ticks,
chiggers, and other pests.
   (F)   Refuse collection.  Mobile homes shall each be equipped with a 30-
gallon container. Such container shall be regularly sprayed with suitable
insecticides to reduce odors and to eliminate fly incidence. All refuse
containing garbage shall be collected at least once weekly. The mobile home
park shall include a central collection area for garbage and solid waste with
room for an enclosed dumpster or other suitable collector approved by the
city’s garbage collection official.
   (G)   Electrical distribution.
      (1)   Electrical wiring, equipment, and appurtenances shall be installed
and maintained in accordance with applicable permits, codes, and regulations.
Where such codes do not exist the provisions of the National Electrical Code
shall control.
      (2)   All streets, walkways, buildings, and other facilities shall be
adequately lighted. An average illumination level of at least six-tenths (0.6)
footcandle and a minimum illumination level of one-tenth (0.1) footcandle shall
be maintained on all streets. Potentially hazardous locations such as
intersections, steps or ramps shall be illuminated with a minimum level of
three-tenths (0.3) footcandle.

based. The Board's decision may reverse, affirm, wholly or partly, the ruling
of the Administrative Zoning Officer and shall be final unless judicial review
is sought by the applicant.
   (E)   Vote. The concurring vote of the majority of the members of the Board
shall be necessary to grant an appeal. Failure of a motion to receive such
majority shall constitute a denial of the appeal. Decisions of the Board shall

at any time prior to the hearing or he or she may do so verbally at the

shall be completed within six months from the time of the Board’s action,
unless otherwise directed by the Board.
   (H)   Hearing.  No second hearing shall be entertained by the Board on a
case ruled upon by it, unless new facts and evidence are submitted which, in
the Board’s judgment, materially changes the case. A plea for such second
hearing shall be requested in writing to the Board. The Board shall determine
prior to scheduling a second hearing if such facts and evidence do exist.
Change in ownership of the property affected by an appeal shall be insufficient
reason for hearing.  Should the Board, at a regularly scheduled meeting, decide
that there are substantial grounds for a second hearing and it is fully
satisfied that new evidence has been submitted, the applicant shall be advised
in writing of the Board’s ruling and will then be entitled to refile for
rehearing in conformance with established schedules and procedures. The proper
legal notices shall be published and all interested parties shall be duly
notified.
   (I)   Advice. No informal request for advice, or moot questions, shall be
considered by the Board. Any advice, opinion, or information given by a Board
member shall not be binding on the Board.
   (J)   Proof for a variance.  It shall be incumbent upon an applicant to
conclusively prove at the public hearing that, if he or she is compelled to
meet the provisions of this chapter he or she cannot secure reasonable use of
his or her property and:
      (1)   The grant will not be injurious to the public health, safety, and
general welfare;
      (2)   The use or value of the land or area adjacent to the property
included in the variance will not be adversely affected;
      (3)   The need for the variance arises from some condition peculiar to
the property involved and does not exist in similar property in the same
district;
      (4)   The strict application of the terms of this chapter will constitute
an unusual and unnecessary hardship as applied to the property in which the
variance is sought; and
      (5)   That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment
of a substantial property right possessed by other property in the same
vicinity and district but which is denied to the property in question.
