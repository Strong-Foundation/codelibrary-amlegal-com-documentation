§ 10.01 TITLE OF CODE.
   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the town, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered and consolidated into component codes, titles,
chapters and sections, shall be known and designated as the “Putnam County
Code”, for which designation “code of ordinances”, “codified ordinances” or
“code” may be substituted. Code title, chapter and section headings do not
constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.
§ 10.02 INTERPRETATION.

same rules of construction, definition and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.03 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.04 CONSTRUCTION OF CODE.
   (A)   This code is a codification of previously existing laws, amendments

   (B)   Any appropriation repealed and reenacted by this code is continued
only for the period designated in the original enactment of that appropriation.
   (C)   The numerical order and position of sections in this code does not
resolve a conflict between two or more sections.
   (D)   Any irreconcilable conflict between sections shall be resolved by
reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or division.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning, application
or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)

or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.
      (4)   Words denoting the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the
feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,

§ 10.06 SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   If any section of this code now enacted or subsequently amended or its
application to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid section
or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is severable.
If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of
whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a statute stating that the provisions of an act are

authority or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; on the effective date of that ordinance or following the
effective date, the rights, powers, duties or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date
or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which the duties,
liabilities, powers and rights were transferred.

words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
the error.

   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to

contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected

receipt of the asset, to examine the asset to make sure no damage was incurred
during shipment, and to make sure the asset was received in working order. The
steward is also responsible for arranging the necessary preventative

steward also ensures that the asset is used for the purpose for which it was
acquired and that there is no personal or unauthorized use. The steward is
responsible for reporting any loss, theft, or damage to the assets.
         (c)   Departments are to maintain inventories of all capital assets,

   (A)   Animals found in cruel, abusive or neglectful situations, animals
trained, bred or kept for the purpose of animal fighting or animals that have
been abandoned as defined in this chapter or under state law may be promptly
seized if no immediate contact with the owner or keeper can be made. The
officer shall leave written notice stating the location of the animal and the
reason for impoundment.
   (B)   When, in the opinion of the Animal Control Director or Officer, a
diseased or injured animal, taken into custody, is in need of immediate
treatment, so as to lessen the animal’s suffering or to prevent the spread of a
communicable disease to other animals, the animal shelter shall immediately
obtain the services of, or place the animal with, a licensed veterinarian for
the purpose of administering necessary treatment. Animals displaying signs of
illness or injury at the time of impoundment will be treated immediately at the
expense of the owner/keeper. Any animal displaying clinical signs of illness or
injury that, in the opinion of a licensed veterinarian, would cause undue
suffering to that animal or pose a substantial health risk to other animals in
the shelter shall be immediately humanely euthanized. In the absence of an
available veterinarian, the animal shelter kennel manager will consult with the
Executive Director or President of the Board of Directors of the animal shelter
if he or she feels that euthanasia is needed to prevent the animal from undue
suffering. The decision to euthanize will be documented in a written report,
which will include the reason for euthanization. This action may be taken to
control the spread of disease or to eliminate any further pain and suffering of
an animal.
   (C)   Animals so removed will be impounded and held at the animal shelter or
other designated facility until such time the violator is in compliance with
this chapter. In no event shall this period exceed ten days, at which time the
animal shall become the property of the animal shelter, unless an extension is
necessary for the involved county law enforcement agency to have ample time to
prepare a court case if prosecution is warranted, and a bond is posted as
provided in division (F) below. In the case of animals impounded for quarantine
at the animal shelter, the animal will become the property of the animal
shelter if not claimed, and all fees paid, by closing time of the shelter on
the eleventh day of the quarantine.
   (D)   Animals impounded for reasons beyond the control of the owner, such
as, but not limited to, a house fire, death of the owner or arrest of the
owner, will be held for ten days during which time a reasonable effort will be
made to contact the owner and/or his or her representative. After the tenth day
of impoundment, the animals will become the property of the animal shelter.
   (E)   Animals awaiting disposition by the courts shall remain in the custody
of the animal shelter or other designated facility unless such disposition is
made, or placed in a foster home until legal arrangements have been completed.
   (F)   Pursuant to impoundment of an animal under this section, any county
law enforcement agency and/or the animal shelter may file a petition with the
court requesting that the owner or keeper of the animal post a bond to cover
the costs of care of the animal while it is in the custody of the animal
shelter. This petition shall be accompanied by an affidavit or statement from
the animal shelter that sets forth an estimate of the reasonable expenses that
the animal shelter expects to incur while providing for the care of the animal.
Reasonable expenses include, but are not limited to, the estimated cost of
veterinary care, including vaccinations, food and board for the animal. The
owner or keeper of the animal shall be provided written notice of the petition
by personal service or certified mail. Any such mail shall be sent to the last
known residence or, if the address is not known, such notice shall be sent to
the address from which the animal was seized. Refusal to accept certified mail
or failure to receive mail due to other delays will not negate this division
(F).
      (1)   The court in which the petition is filed shall hold a hearing on
the petition. At the hearing, the filing law enforcement agency from the county
has the burden of proving that there is probable cause to find that the animal
was the subject of a violation as listed under, any subchapter, section or
division of this chapter. If the court finds that probable cause exists, the
court shall order the owner or keeper of the animal to post bond to cover the
cost of the care of the animal for a minimum of 30 days.
      (2)   Bond must be posted within a maximum of three business days
following the bond hearing judgment. If bond has not been posted with the
allotted three days, the animal immediately becomes the property of the animal
shelter. In lieu of posting said bond, the legal owner may immediately
relinquish ownership of the animal to the HSPC. The owner, however, will remain
responsible for any and all costs associated with caring for the animal
(boarding, veterinary care, medications and the like) incurred during the time
that the animal is impounded prior to the court hearing.
      (3)   Bond must be posted at the animal shelter animal shelter in cash or
certified funds only. The bond shall be deposited into the county’s General
Fund, in a specific sub-account for animal control cases. The animal shelter
may draw on this account to cover the actual expenses incurred in the care of
the animal.
      (4)   If, at the end of 30 days, the matter for holding said animal(s)
has not been adjudicated, another bond must be posted. The renewal bond must be
paid no later than the close of business on the thirtieth day. If the thirtieth
day should fall on a weekend or holiday, the bond must be posted by the close
of business on the last regular business day prior to the weekend or holiday.
The bond must be renewed every 30 days thereafter until the matter is
adjudicated by the court having jurisdiction. Failure to repost bond at the end
of any 30-day period will be considered voluntary relinquishment of the animal
(s).
      (5)   Upon conviction of the accused, the court at its discretion may
order any remaining bond money and/or animal(s) forfeited to the animal
shelter.
      (6)   In the event of the acquittal or final discharge, without
conviction of the accused, the court shall direct the delivery of the animal(s)
and any bond posted to the owner or keeper/responsible person less any
reasonable medical, housing and administrative costs. Reasonable expenses
incurred by the shelter will be paid from the animal control sub-account.
   (G)   This section applies to any and all animals held as impounded at the
animal shelter, other designated facility or under the direction of any county
law enforcement agency.

other designated facility upon providing the following:
      (1)   Proof of ownership, which can include, but is not limited to:
microchip, pictures, veterinarian statement, county dog tax form; and
      (2)   Payment of redemption fee as noted in §
90.125 or as determined by the courts, and any other service/medical fees,
payment of an impoundment fee of $50 plus a boarding fee for each day the
animal was impounded; the annual license fee if such has not been paid; and the
cost of rabies vaccination if the animal has not been vaccinated within the
prescribed time period, and any medical/veterinary fees accrued for treatment
of disease or injury. These fees, as applicable, shall also apply to biting
animals held for rabies observation at the animal shelter.
   (B)   If a dog or cat is not claimed by the owner within five days of notice
to the owner, or a dog or cat of unknown ownership, whose owner is not
identified within five days of impoundment, shall become the property of the
animal shelter and may be placed for adoption or euthanized.

provisions or perform any duty imposed by this chapter or when there is
reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any building or upon any
premises any violation of the provisions of this chapter or state law, the any
county law enforcement agency or Health Officer is authorized at all reasonable
time to inspect the same for compliance with the provisions of this chapter or
any state law; provided that:

credentials to the occupant and request entry, explaining the reasons
therefore; and
      (2)   If the property is unoccupied, the Officer shall make a reasonable
effort to locate the owner or other persons having control of the property and
request entry explaining the reasons therefore.
   (B)   In the event a county law enforcement agency or the County Health
Officer has reasonable cause to believe that the keeping or maintaining of an
animal is so hazardous, unsafe or dangerous as to require inspection to
safeguard the animal or the public health and/or safety, the Officer shall
first present proper credentials and request entry, explaining the reason
thereof. If entry is refused or cannot be obtained because the owner or other
person(s) having charge or control of the property cannot be found after
reasonable search, the Officer shall have recourse to secure a search warrant
for inspection of the property.

(Ord. 2015-3-2, passed 3-2-2015)
§ 110.104 COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Homebased Vendor (HBV). A HBV is not a FOOD ESTABLISHMENT as defined
in § 110.003 and I.C. 16-18-2-137. State law added a specification into the
definition of food establishment which excludes an individual vendor of a
farmers' market or roadside stand meeting the requirements of state law.
Because a HBV is not a food establishment, it is not subject to FOOD
ESTABLISHMENT regulatory activities, such as registration, permitting/licensing
and routine inspection activities usually conducted by local health
departments, Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH), or other Indiana Food
Regulatory Departments, provided the vendor has complied with state law.
   (B)   The production area of a HBV is required to be in the vendor's primary
residence, which may include another building or structure on the HBV premises,
and will not be routinely inspected. The HBV cannot comingle the activities of
a HBV food product and those of a food establishment. If a HBV sells food
products other than those produced in the home, then it becomes a food
establishment. One is either a HBV or a food establishment, not both.
   (C)   A HBV failing to meet the requirements of Section 29(b) means the
vendor's place of production and food product(s) become subject to all of the
food safety requirements of a FOOD ESTABLISHMENT. Examples include the
operation of a cafe, restaurant, or grocery store.
   (D)   (1)   Food Products produced by a HBV (I.C. 16-18-287.8 and Section 29
(b)(2)) include, but are not limited to:
         (a)   Baked items, such as cookies, cakes, fruit pics, cupcakes, bars,
yeast breads, fruit breads, baguettes;
         (b)   Candy and confections, such as caramels, chocolates, fudge,
peanut brittle, chocolate covered fruits, bon bons, buckeyes, chocolate covered
nuts;
         (c)   Produce, such as unprocessed fruits and vegetables (i.e.
cherries, blackberries, cranberries, grapefruit, strawberries, oranges,
blueberries, plums, tomato);
         (d)   Tree nuts, legumes;
         (e)   Pickles processed in a traditional method; and
         (f)   Honey, molasses, sorghum, maple syrup.
      (2)   The above food products may be refrigerated or frozen for quality
purposes.
      (3)   The above listed items are typical examples of food products that
are either high acid and/or low water activity, therefore making them a NON-
POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS FOOD.
      (4)   Whole, uncut produce is not restricted from sale regardless of the
locale of its origin.
      (5)   Mushrooms grown as a product of agriculture are not restricted from
sale. It is recommended that uncultivated (wild) mushrooms be certified in
writing as to their species by a person competent to make such a certification.
      (6)   Traditional jams, jellies, and preserves made from strawberries,
grapes, raspberries, etc. are often made form acid foods and have a low Aw in
its final form as safety factors. Special recipes of these products, including
those which may be called “low sugar” or “no sugar added,” as well as some
fruit butters (pumpkin, pear) may fall into the category of acidified food or
low-acid canned food and may not be allowed to be sold since they may be
considered a potentially hazardous food.
      (7)   A HBV's food product in it's final form shall not be potentially
hazardous food. HBV food products may NOT contain ingredients in any form which
have as a component:
         (a)   Meat (domestic or wild);
         (b)   Poultry;
         (c)   Aquatic animal products;
         (d)   Dairy (including cheese, butter, yogurt, but excluding some
baked items, i.e. cakes and cookies); or
         (e)   Egg products (excluding some baked items, i.e. cakes and
cookies, and dried noodles), including fresh shell eggs.
      (8)   In addition, a HBV's food product shall not be:
         (a)   A “canned” or other “hermitically sealed container” of acidified
food, (i.e. salsas, chutney, chow-chow, pickled beets);
         (b)   A “canned” or other “hermitically sealed container” of low-acid
food (i.e. cooked vegetables, meats, poultry, raw fish);
         (c)   Cut melons;
         (d)   Raw seed sprouts that have been harvested;
         (e)   Non-modified garlic-in-oil mixtures; and
         (f)   Cut tomatoes.
      (9)   Packaging considered to be “canned” or “hermitically sealed”
consists of cans, glass jars, plastic containers, laminated pouches, paperboard
containers, etc.
      (10)   The use of “reduced oxygen packaging” method, such as the use of a
vacuum packaging machine, is not allowed.
      (11)   All state or Federal laws governing the production and sale of the
above listed items are still applicable.
      (12)   If the food product of a HBV is found to be or contain any of the
above listed items, it should be considered a violation of this chapter and
state law, and according to state law, must not be sold.
      (13)   Purdue University or other private consultants may serve as
resources to assist in determining if a specific food product is acceptable to
be produced and sold as an HBV food product.
      (14)   Poultry up to 1,000 birds can be sold to the end consumer at a
Farmer's Market or roadside stand or from the farm. All poultry sold at a
farmer's market, roadside stand or farm, must be sold frozen.
      (15)   Rabbits that are slaughtered and processed on the farm to be sold
at a farmer's market or at a roadside stand must be frozen.
   (E)   Labeling/misbranded of HBV food products. 
      (1)   There are some very specific labeling requirements for the food
product of a HBV. Any food product provided by a HBV shall include a label
which contain the following:
         (a)   The name and address of the producer of the food product. The
common or usual name of the food product.
         (b)   The ingredients of the food product, in descending order by
predominance or by weight. The net weight and volume of the food product by
standard measure or numerical count. The date on which the food product was
processed.
         (c)   The following statement in at least ten point type: “This
product is home produced and processed and the production area has not been
inspected by the State Department of Health or the Putnam County Health
Department.”
      (2)   This labeling must be present with and/or on the food at the point
of sale regardless of whether or not the product is packaged. Unpackaged food,
such as baked items, should be considered “labeled” when there is easily
readable signage accompanying the food product stating all of the above listed
items. Labeling (or signage) is not required for whole, uncut produce. A HBV
food product which is not labeled according to Section 29(b)(5) is misbranded
and may not be sold until the label is provided or corrected.
   (F)   Roadside stand or farmer's market. 
      (1)   To comply with the subsection 29(a), a “Home-Based Vendor” may sell
their food product(s) ONLY in two places:
         (a)   A farmer's market; and
         (b)   A roadside stand.
      (2)   These products may not be sold at any other venue, such as a
grocery store, restaurant, festival, carnival or any other event, without a
permit issued by the Putnam County Health Department.
Market Master, Event and/or Festival Coordinator:
      (3)   Market Master, Event/Festival Coordinators have control over the
vendors who are allowed to participate and the product(s) each vendor may sell.
The Market Master, Event/Festival Coordinator has the authority, above and
beyond the Putnam County Health Department, to remove a vendor and/or food
product from sale. It is recommended that the Putnam County Health Department
educate the Market Masters and Event/Festival Coordinators on state law and the
implications it may have on their particular market, event/festival. The
decision to allow the sale of products produced by a HBV lies with the Market
Master and Event/Festival Coordinators. However, some permits may be required
by the Putnam County Health Department. It is the responsibility of the Market
Master and/or the Event/Festival Coordinator to contact the Putnam County
Health Department to inform them of what is being sold at the farmer's market,
event or festival and the dates times and location of the market, event, or
festival. It is also the responsibility of the Market Master and/or the Event/
Festival Coordinator to verify that vendors have the proper permits and
certifications.
      (4)   Inspections of the farmer's markets, events and festivals will be
conducted during reasonable times and will be unannounced. Any person selling
items not permitted under state law will be asked to stop selling the
unpermitted item. The Market Master and/or the Event/Festival Coordinator will
be informed of the violation. If the vendor continues to sell the unpermitted
product, the Market Master and/or the Event/Festival Coordinator could be held
liable. All violations will be documented in writing at the time of the
inspection.
      (5)   Any vendor at a farmer's market, festival or event that is required
to have a retail food permit as defined in Rule 410 IAC 7-24 and/or Ord. 2015-
3-2 and does not have a permit will be asked to leave the event, the vendor,
the Market Master, and/or the Event/Festival Coordinator will be issued a
written violation notice at the time of the violation. If the vendor does not
leave, the Market Master, and/or the Event/Festival Coordinator could be held
liable.

compliance with minimum requirements. This action may be taken by issuing an
order in writing.
(Ord. 2016-3-7, passed 3-7-2016)
§ 111.05 INTERACTIVE PLAY ATTRACTION.
   (A)   The following are based on the requirements of the Indiana State
Department of Health's Swimming Pool Rule, 410 IAC 6-2.1, modified to fit the
needs of an interactive play attraction. NOTE: Requirement E (disinfection) and
F (filtration) do not apply to interactive play attractions that drain to
waste.
   (B)   Plans. Plans must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Homeland
Security, Fire Prevention and Building Safety Commission for a design release
prior to construction, rehabilitation or alteration as required per Rule 675
IAC 20-5-2.
   (C)   Water supply. Potable water that meets the provisions of Rule 327 IAC
8-2 shall be used as the source water.
   (D)   Sewage disposal. All waste must be disposed of in a sanitary sewer. In
some instances, IDEM has permitted the wastewater to be used for irrigation.
   (E)   Disinfect the recirculated water. A minimum concentration of 2.0 ppm
chlorine or 4.0 ppm bromine with secondary disinfection of ultraviolet light or
ozone and a pH in the range of 7.2 through 7.8 must be maintained. This higher
level of disinfection is needed because the probability of fecal contamination
is increased with an interactive play attraction. Also, chlorine will dissipate
faster in an interactive play attraction due to the water being sprayed.
Chlorine concentrations shall be monitored electronically, so the water
fountain will shut off automatically if the chlorine level drops below 2.0 ppm.
For interactive play attractions constructed, rehabilitated or altered after
August 7, 2013, Rule 675 LAC 20-5-23 requires: secondary disinfection such as
ultraviolet light or ozone in addition to chemical disinfection.
      (1)   Disinfection equipment shall be tested and listed for use in spray
pad disinfection.
      (2)   Ultraviolet light dosage shall be 40 mJ/cm2 or greater.
      (3)   Ultraviolet light systems shall have a properly calibrated light
intensity meter, automatic water flow shutoff in the event the light intensity
decreases below recommended level and an alarm to advise of a malfunction.
         (a)   It shall be UV-C unit producing a wavelength of 254 nanometers.
         (b)   The standard for testing and listing of the UV unit for
secondary disinfection is US EPA Ultraviolet Disinfectant Guidance Manual dated
November, 2006, publication number EPA 815-R-06-007. This standard requires a
three log (99.9%) reduction of Cryptosporidium oocysts, based on the theory of
reducing to a concentration of one oocyst per 100 ml (average volume of water
swallowed by a swimmer). An ISO 9000:2000 accreditation or NSF Standard 50
listing are both acceptable for validation.
      (4)   Do not use stabilized chlorine for disinfection.
   (F)   Filter the recirculated water. The design shall provide a separate
filter for the interactive play attraction. Do not use the same filter serving
a pool or other water recreation facility to also filter the water from an
interactive water fountain. Shared filters could spread contamination to all
pools and fountains on the same system. Also, other water venues may not be set
up to disinfect at the high levels required for water from an interactive play
attraction. A turnover rate of 0.5 hours is required per Rule 675 IAC 20-5-14
(b), for interactive play attractions constructed, rehabilitated or altered
after August 7, 2013.
   (G)   Both the design and operational procedures shall assure that trip
hazards are prevented.
   (H)   Any grates on the deck pad must be kept secured and in good repair.
   (I)   Flush any materials or contaminants off the surface of the spray pad
daily prior to opening. Clean more thoroughly, if necessary. Both the design
and the operational procedures should assure that the water used for pre-
opening cleaning is discharged to waste.
   (J)   Bathrooms, with diaper changing areas must be provided, and be located
to assure easy access. Bathroom breaks should be encouraged. The required
number of plumbing facilities is listed in Rule 675 IAC 20-5-25, for
interactive play attractions constructed, rehabilitated or altered after August
7, 2013.
   (K)   Drinking fountains must be provided, and be located to assure easy
access as required in Rule 675 IAC 20-5-25(e), for interactive play attractions
constructed, rehabilitated or altered after August 7, 2013. Easily accessible
sources of safe drinking water will discourage drinking of water from the
interactive play attraction.
   (L)   The following signs shall be posted:
      (1)   Do not use if you had diarrhea within the last two weeks;
      (2)   No pets allowed;
      (3)   No glass or sharp objects are allowed on the spray pad;
      (4)   Do not drink the water; and
      (5)   Children who are not toilet trained must use swim diapers covered
by rubber pants with tight fitting elastic at the waist and legs.
   (M)   In case of a fecal accident, the fecal accident procedure outlined in
swimming pool rule 410 IAC 6-2.1 should be utilized.
   (N)   Overhead electrical wires shall be located at least 20 feet away from
any spray pad, measured horizontally. Also, there should be no unprotected
electrical circuits or wiring within ten feet of any spray pad.
   (O)   To prevent injury to patrons, unless certified by a feature designer
and/or manufacturer, the water spray from a feature nozzle shall not exceed a
height of six feet and not exceed a flow rate of 20 psi.

111.05, he shall issue a written order listing such violations to the
proprietor or, in the proprietor's absence, to the person in charge, and
setting a date by which the violation shall be abated.
   (C)   The Health Officer, upon a hearing with the permittee, may revoke the
permit and promptly file written notice of the action to the permittee if the
permittee should fail to show cause as to why their permit should not be
revoked. The Health Officer or the Health Officer's representative shall
maintain a permanent record of proceedings filed in the Office of the Putnam
County Health Department.
   (D)   Any permit issued under this chapter may be temporarily suspended by
the Health Officer, without notice or hearing, for a period not to exceed 30

151.006   Severability
§ 151.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND METHODS.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-1-4-11
granted the power to local government units to control land use within their
jurisdictions. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of Putnam County; the Town
Council of the Towns of Bainbridge, Cloverdale, Roachdale, and Russellville
(hereinafter noted as Putnam County) do hereby adopt the following floodplain
management regulations.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of Putnam County are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      (2)   Structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health.
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions.
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains.
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
area.
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas.
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained.
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain.
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible.
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (D)   Methods of reducing flood loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities.
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters.
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage.
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 2022-11-7, passed 10-12-2022)
§ 151.002 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them meaning they have in common
usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.

structure includes at least two outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof.
      (2)   Examples of accessory structures include, but are not limited to,
two-car detached garages (or smaller), carports, storage and tool sheds, and
small boathouses.
      (3)   The following may have uses that are incidental or accessory to the
principal structure on a parcel but are generally not considered to be
accessory structures by the NFIP:
         (a)   Structures in which any portion is used for human habitation,
whether as a permanent residence or as temporary or seasonal quarters, such as
a detached garage or carriage house that includes an apartment or guest
quarters, or a detached guest house on the same parcel as a principal

entertainment.
         (c)   Development that does not meet the NIFP definition of a
structure for floodplain management purposes. Examples include, but are not
necessarily limited to, a gazebo, pavilion, picnic shelter, or carport that is
open on all sides (roofed but not walled).
   ADDITION (to an existing structure). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.

the natural grade elevation. Fill material includes but is not limited to
consolidated material such as concrete and brick and unconsolidated material
such as soil, sand, gravel, and stone.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. 
      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from:
         (a)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
         (b)   The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters
from any source.
         (c)   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by
flooding and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of
normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and
deposited along the path of the current.
      (2)   FLOOD OR FLOODING also includes the collapse or subsidence of land
along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion or
undermining caused by waves or current of water exceeding anticipated cyclical
levels that result in a flood as defined above.
   FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Areas subject to the 1% annual chance flood. (See SPECIAL
FLOOD HAZARD AREA).
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available
digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM and
the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOODPLAIN).
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The BFE plus two feet at any given location

by water from any source. (See FLOOD).
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulative increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE or FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the floodplain lying outside the
floodway.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   HARDSHIP. (As related to variances of this chapter.) The exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
Putnam County Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is
exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or
financial hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of
one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship.
All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally
intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:

Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminary determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district.
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs that have been certified by: (a) an
approved state program as determined by the Secretary of Interior; or (b)
directly by the Secretary of Interior in states without approval programs.
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in

Natural Resources and FEMA, used to determine the base flood, other frequency
floods, flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries, and flood
profiles.
   INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL - EVALUATION SERVICE (ICC-ES) REPORT. A document
that presents the findings, conclusions, and recommendations from a particular
evaluation. ICC-ES reports provide information about what code requirements or
acceptance criteria were used to evaluate a product, and how the product should
be identified, installed.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). FEMA's comment on a
proposed project that would, upon construction, result in modification of the
SFHA through the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
      (2)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (CLOMR-F). A
letter from FEMA stating that a proposed structure that will be elevated by
fill would not be inundated by the base flood.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a building or of land is not
located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A
LOMA in only issued by FEMA.
      (4)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT OUT AS SHOWN (LOMA-OAS). An official
determination by FEMA that states the property or building is correctly shown
outside the SFHA as shown on an effective NFIP map. Therefore, the mandatory
flood insurance requirement does not apply. An out-as-shown determination does
not require elevations.
      (5)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (6)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). FEMA's modification
of the SFHA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill outside the
existing regulatory floodway.

must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or
meet or exceed the following criteria:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
         (b)   At least two openings are designed and maintained for the entry
and exit of floodwater; and these openings provide a total net area of at least
one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of all
such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher. Doorways
and windows do not qualify as openings.
      (6)   The first floor of a building elevated on pilings or columns in a
coastal high hazard area (as that term is defined in 44 CFR 59.1), as long as
it meets the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3.

The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

   (A)   Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard (SFHAs) within the jurisdiction of Putnam County,
Indiana as identified in division (B) of this section, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by Putnam County, Indiana.
   (B)   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.
      (1)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of Putnam County, delineated as an "AE
Zone" on the Putnam County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate
Map dated June 5, 2012 shall be determined from the one-percent annual chance
flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Putnam County, Indiana and
Incorporated Areas and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) dated
June 5, 2012 as
well as any subsequent updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with the most recent date. Should
the floodway limits not be delineated on the FIRM for a studied SFHA designated
as an "AE Zone", the limits of the floodway will be according to the best
available flood layer as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources (INDNR).
      (2)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for
each SFHAs within the jurisdiction of Putnam County, delineated as an "A Zone"
on the Putnam County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas FIRM, dated June 5, 2012,
as well as any subsequent updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the
FEMA with the most recent date, shall be according to the best available flood
layer provided by INDNR, provided the upstream drainage area from the subject
site is greater than one-square mile. Whenever a party disagrees with the best
available flood data layer, the party needs to replace existing data with
better data that meets current engineering standards. To be considered, this
data must be submitted to INDNR for review and subsequently approved.
      (3)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas
shall be according to the best available flood layer as provided by INDNR,
provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one
square mile.
      (4)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.
   (C)   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain
development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of
special flood hazard.
   (D)   Compliance.
      (1)   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or
structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of
this chapter and other applicable regulations.
      (2)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the most conservative
(highest) base flood elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed
structure; or for other developments, affecting any part of the area of the
development.
      (3)   No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations.
   (E)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (F)   Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground elevations.
      (1)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) with base flood elevations provided (riverine or lacustrine Zone AE) on
the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the
profiles or table of still water elevations shall govern.
      (2)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
      (3)   If the natural grade elevation of the site in question is at or
above the base flood elevation and a LOMA or LOMR-FW is obtained, the
floodplain regulations will not be applied provided the LOMA or LOMR-FW is not
subsequently superseded or invalidated.
   (G)   Interpretation. In the interpretation of application of this chapter
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit not repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (H)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Therefore, this chapter does not create any liability on the part of Putnam
County, INDNR, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on this chapter, or any administrative decision made lawfully
thereunder.
   (I)   Penalties for violation. Failure to obtain a Floodplain Development
Permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a Floodplain
Development Permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. All violations shall be considered a common nuisance
and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code for
Putnam County. All violations shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding
$2,500.
      (1)   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the
violation continues to exist.
      (2)   The Putnam County Floodplain Administrator shall inform the owner
that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages
and therefore may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be
suspended.
      (3)   Nothing herein shall prevent Putnam County from taking such other
lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.

permits may be required. If specific federal, state and/or local permits are
known, require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file
with the floodplain development permit.
         (f)   Conduct substantial damage determinations to determine whether
existing structures, damaged from any source and in special flood hazard areas
identified by FEMA, must meet the development standards of these regulations.
         (g)   For applications to improve structures, including alterations,
movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, change of occupancy, additions,
rehabilitations, renovations, substantial improvements, repairs of substantial
damage, and any other improvement of or work on such buildings and structures,
the Floodplain Administrator shall:
            1.   Verify and document the market value of the pre-damaged or
pre-improved structure.
            2.   Compare the cost to perform the improvement; or the cost to
repair a damaged building to its pre-damaged condition; or, the combined costs
of improvements and repair, if applicable, to the market value of the pre-
damaged or pre-improved structure. The cost of all work must be included in the
project costs, including work that might otherwise be considered routine
maintenance. Items/activities that must be included in the cost shall be in
keeping with guidance published by FEMA to ensure compliance with the NFIP and
to avoid any conflict with future flood insurance claims of policy holders
within the community.
            3.   Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes

151.003(B) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         (a)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
               1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries.
               2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed
structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special
flood hazard area.
               3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts, and subdivision or large-scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations.
         (b)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have required
technical data for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map
Revision and submitted to FEMA. The INDNR will review the submittals as part of
a partnership with FEMA. The INDNR will review the submittals as part of a
partnership with FEMA. The submittal should be mailed to the INDNR at the
address provided on the FEMA from (MT-2) or submitted through the online Letter
of Map Change website. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.

Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to this section.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Putnam County
Commissioners and may be submitted to FEMA at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Putnam County have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Putnam County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map
accurately represent the Putnam County boundaries, include within such
notification a copy of a map of Putnam County suitable for reproduction,
clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which Putnam
County has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (F)   Variance procedures.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals (the Board) as established by the
Putnam County Commissioners shall hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances from requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   The Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error
in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Floodplain
Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. Any person
aggrieved by the decision of the Board may appeal such decision to the Putnam
County Circuit Court.
      (3)   In considering upon such applications, the Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
         (a)   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         (b)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         (e)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         (f)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         (g)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         (h)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         (i)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters at the site.
         (j)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (4)   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance.
      (5)   Variances from the provisions of this chapter shall only be granted
when the Board can make positive findings of fact based on evidence submitted
at the hearing for the following:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship as defined in §
151.002.
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
      (6)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §
151.005 (A)(1), (A)(3)(a) or (A)(4) will be granted.
      (7)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §
151.005 (A)(1), (A)(3)(a), or (A)(4) will require a permit from INDNR.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated regulatory floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (8)   Variances to the provisions of flood hazard reduction of §
151.005 may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
      (9)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
"historic structures" upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an
"historic structure" and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
      (10)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use.
      (11)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (12)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
      (13)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (14)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the FEMA or INDNR upon request.
(Ord. 2022-11-7, passed 10-12-2022)
§ 151.005 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   (A)   Floodplain status standards.
      (1)   Floodways (Riverine). Located within SFHAs, established in §
151.003(B), are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. Under the provisions of the
Flood Control Act (IC 14-28-1) a permit for construction in a floodway from
INDNR is required
prior to issuance of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit,
construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes
land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing, and paving
undertaken before the actual start of construction of the structure. General
licenses and exemptions to the requirements of the Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-
28-1 and 312 IAC 10) may apply to qualified additions/improvements to existing
lawful residential structures, rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland
restoration, utility line crossing, outfall projects, creek rock removal, and
prospecting.
         (a)   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in §
151.003(B), the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward
the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to INDNR
and apply for approval for construction in a floodway, provided the activity
does not qualify for general license or exemption (I.C. 14-28-1 or 312 IAC 10).
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by INDNR for construction in the floodway, or
evidence provided by an applicant that the development meets specified criteria
to qualify for a general license or exemption to the requirements of the Flood
Control Act. The Floodplain Development Permit shall meet the provisions
contained in this chapter.
         (c)   The Floodplain Development Permit cannot be less restrictive
than an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by INDNR, or the
specified criteria used to qualify for a general license or exemption to the
Flood Control Act for a specific site/project.
         (d)   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development shall
cause no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge without first obtaining a Conditional Letter of Map Revision and
meeting requirements of §
151.004(E)(1). A Conditional Letter of Map Revision cannot be issued for
development that would cause an increase in flood levels affecting a structure
and such development should not be permitted.
         (e)   In floodway areas identified by INDNR through detailed or
approximate studies but not yet identified on the effective FIRM as floodway
areas, the total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not adversely affect
the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This
adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory
flood of at least fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by
comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that
under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
         (f)   For all projects involving channel modification or fill
(including levees) Putnam County shall submit the data and request that the
FEMA revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard regulations found at
44 CFR § 65.12.
      (2)   Fringe (Riverine). If the site is in the fringe (either identified
on the FIRM or identified by INDNR through detailed or approximate studies and
not identified on a FIRM), the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
Floodplain Development Permit provided the provisions contained in this chapter
have been met.
      (3)   SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/
fringes (Riverine).
         (a)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square
mile:
            1.   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to INDNR for review and comment.
            2.   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from INDNR (approval for construction in a floodway, letter of
authorization, or evidence of general license qualification) or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment citing the one-percent annual chance flood
elevation and the recommended Flood Protection Grade has been received from
INDNR.
            3.   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from INDNR, a
Floodplain Development Permit may be issued, provided the conditions of the
Floodplain Development Permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from INDNR, and the provisions contained in this section have been
met.
         (b)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
            1.   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and one-percent annual chance flood elevation for the
site.
            2.   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in this
chapter have been met.
      (4)   SFHAs not identified on a map.
         (a)   If a proposed development site is near a waterway with no SFHA
identified on a map, the Floodplain Administrator shall verify the drainage
area upstream of the site. If the drainage area upstream of the site is
verified as being greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to INDNR for review and comment.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from INDNR (approval for construction in a floodway, letter of
authorization, or evidence of general license qualification) or a floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment citing the one-percent annual chance flood
elevation and the recommended Flood Protection Grade has been received from
INDNR.
         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualifications, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from INDNR, a
Floodplain Development Permit may be issued, provided the conditions of the
Floodplain Development Permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from INDNR and the provisions in this chapter have been met.
   (B)   General standards. In al! areas of special flood hazard, the following
provisions are required:
      (1)   All new construction, reconstruction or repairs made to a
repetitive loss structure, and substantial improvements shall be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
      (2)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage below the FPG.
      (3)   New construction and substantial improvements must incorporate
methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      (4)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning
equipment, and other service facilities shall be located at/above the FPG for
residential structures. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air
conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be located at/above
the FPG or designed so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within
the components below the FPG for non- residential structures. Water and sewer
pipes, electrical and telephone lines, submersible pumps, and other
waterproofed service facilities may be located below the FPG.
      (5)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
      (6)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
      (7)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      (8)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure that is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall meet
the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter.
      (9)   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres.
      (10)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
      (11)   Fill projects that do not involve a structure must be protected
against erosion and scour during flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulk
heading. If vegetative cover is used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three
feet horizontal to one foot vertical.
      (12)   Non-conversion agreements shall be required for all new or
substantially improved elevated structures with an enclosure beneath the
elevated floor, accessory structures, and open-sided shelters.
      (13)   Construction of new solid waste disposal facilities, hazard waste
management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall not
be permitted in areas of special flood hazard.
   (C)   Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard where base
flood elevation data or flood depths have been provided, as set forth in §
151.003(B), the following provisions are required:
      (1)   Building protection requirements. In addition to the general
standards described in division (B) of this section, structures to be located
in the SFHA shall be protected from flood damage below the FPG. This building
protection requirement applies to the following situations:
         (a)   Construction or placement of a residential structure.
         (b)   Construction or placement of a non-residential structure.
         (c)   Addition or improvement made to an existing structure where the
cost of the addition or improvement equals or exceeds 50% of the value of the
existing structure (excluding the value of the land). An addition and/or
improvement project that is continuous in scope or time is considered as one
project for permitting purposes.
         (d)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged structure where the
costs of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure (excluding the value of the
land) before damage occurred (the costs of any proposed additions or
improvements beyond restoring the damaged structure to its before damaged
condition must be included in the cost).
         (e)   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new
manufactured home on an existing site.
         (f)   Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site
for more than 180 days.
         (g)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a repetitive loss structure.
         (h)   Addition or improvement made to an existing structure with a
previous repair, addition or improvement constructed since the community's
first floodplain ordinance.
      (2)   Residential construction.
         (a)   New construction or substantial improvement of any residential
structures shall meet provisions described in division (A) of this section and
applicable general standards described in division (B) of this section.
         (b)   In Zone A and Zone AE, new construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structures shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, at or above the FPG. Should solid foundation perimeter
walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the
standards of division (C)(2)(c) of this section. Should fill be used to elevate
a structure, the standards of division (C)(2)(d) of this section must be met.
         (c)   Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior

§ 152.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter shall be to set standards for house numbering
and road naming in the county and establish the authority and methods to be
used when assigning addresses to properties in the county. These standards
shall be used to establish residence locations which will be used in the
implementation of an enhanced 911 emergency response system in the county. It
is intended to provide continuity, avoid duplication and prevent general
confusion regarding the location of developed parcels of land in the county.
(Ord. 91-8-19, passed 8-19-1991)
§ 152.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ADDRESS PLANNING AUTHORITY. The County Area Plan Commission and the Planning
Director shall serve as the coordinating body in the county with the
responsibility for assigning street addresses within its jurisdiction. The
agency shall coordinate its addressing efforts with the County Sheriff; local
postmasters; and large mailers in the county such as utilities, government and
the like.
   BASE LINES. Existing recognizable lines which divide the county into
quadrants or sectors. The second principal meridian and the range line are BASE
LINES in the county.
   BLOCK INTERVAL. The hundred number interval is the distance between grid
lines, or the point where the next highest block number designation is used.
   CUSTOMER (ADDRESSEE). A family, individual, residence, business or industry
which receives mail at a delivery point.
   FRONTAGE INTERVAL. The distance in foot frontage along a street, highway or
county road which is used to assign consecutive property numbers, beginning
from the nearest grid or base line. The address system used by the county
assumes a frontage interval of 10.56 feet.
   GRID LINES. Imaginary lines or actual county roads which are located a
specific distance from and perpendicular or parallel to base lines. These lines
indicate the point where block numbers change from 100 to the next higher
hundred. GRID LINES are used to standardize the numbering of parallel blocks at
the same distance from the base lines.
   LOT. A lot is a designated parcel, tract, development or area of land which
either is now being or will be used eventually for construction of a structure.
   PRIMARY ADDRESS NUMBER (CITY-TYPE ADDRESS). The numeric or alphanumeric
component of a city-type address which proceeds the street name.
   STRUCTURE. A residential home; apartment building; business or commercial
building; industrial or manufacturing building; or publicly owned building
which fronts onto a public street or road.
(Ord. 91-8-19, passed 8-19-1991)
§ 152.03 PROPERTY ADDRESS NUMBERING SYSTEM.
   (A)   Advantages of a property address numbering system. A street numbering
system and corresponding property addresses provide individual structures with
an exact geographic location in the county. City-type street/road addresses are
necessary in order to provide a structure with a specific and more accurate
identification for efficient mail delivery; to provide an easily identifiable
geographic reference point for quick dispatch of police, fire and emergency
rescue equipment; to provide utility companies with a permanent address record
for billing and service calls tied to a specific structure; and to provide ease
of location identification for friends, service vehicles or other individuals
trying to locate a specific structure or a county road. A numbering system
should make it easy for anyone to find the location of a county road or
residential property in a short period of time and allow for a systematic
expansion of address numbers as community growth occurs.
   (B)   The grid coordinate system.
      (1)   The county has structured the naming of its road system and the
issuance of property addresses based on the Lyman/Purdue Street Numbering
System. The system is better known as the grid coordinate system. The system
utilizes two base lines which run at approximate right angles to each other to
divide the county into quadrants. Most of the county roads are numbered based
on their distance from the north-south and east-west base lines. In the county
the north-south base line consists of the second principal meridian line.
      (2)   The east-west base line consists of the range line.
   (C)   County road numbers and names. Existing posted county street/road
numbers or names will be used to delineate an assumed distance in feet from a
base line or each other (grid lines) even though a true measurement to said
road is not exactly the distance stated on the road sign. All address
measurements will be taken from the middle of an intersection.
   (D)   Property numbering intervals. Street addresses are assigned in
increasing order from each base and grid line. In the county, 1,000 potential
property addresses exist for each 5,280 feet (one mile) of distance from the
base lines. There are approximately 50 address numbers that will be available
for each side of the street/road within each tenth of a mile. All of those
available numbers will probably not be needed, depending on the density of
development along the street/road. Therefore, addresses occur at each ten and
fifty-six hundredths foot interval and block numbers change every 528 linear
feet along a street/road. A specific street/road address is determined by
measuring the number of ten and fifty-six hundredths foot intervals between the
nearest grid line or county street/road signpost to the front entrance of a
structure.
(Ord. 91-8-19, passed 8-19-1991)
§ 152.04 PROPERTY ADDRESSING.
   (A)   Assignment of official permanent property addresses.
      (1)   All residences; commercial; industrial; and public structures
located in the county shall be assigned a permanent city-type street address.
Structures located on the south side of an east-west street/road and those
located on the west side of a north-south street/road shall have an even
numbered property address. Structures located on the north side of an east-west
street/road and those located on the east side of a north-south street/road
shall have an odd number.
      (2)   Street addresses are to be assigned based on a measurement of the
distance from the nearest grid line to the main accessway or drive to the
structure. A structure shall always be addressed to the street/road where the
main accessway intersects.
   (B)   Determining a property address. An official street address shall
contain no more than five digits with the first digit, or the first two digits
if the structure is located ten or more miles from the north-south baseline,
indicating the milepost or distance from the base lines. The second or third
digit shall indicate the block number which will change each 528 linear feet.
The last two digits indicate the number of ten and fifty-six hundredths foot
intervals from the structure to the nearest block or grid line.
   (C)   Placement and size of address numbers. Once a property address has
been assigned to a specific structure, it shall be the responsibility of the
property owner or resident to provide the address number on the structure or on
the mailbox or mailbox post in rural areas, or on a sign facing the street/
road. Numbers are to be placed on structures in a location which faces the
street upon which it is addressed. The numbers and the complete address if
desired should be placed on the structure near a main entry door or on a
cornice, porch and the like located above the main entry door. The letters
should be located at least five feet above the threshold on the right side of
any entrance door. On rural mailboxes, the numbers and lettering shall be
located on the mailbox or the mailbox post. Numbers and lettering shall be
located on both sides of the mailbox or the mailbox post. In all situations
property number lettering shall exceed one inch in vertical height and the
color of the letters shall contract with the background of the mailbox or
mailbox post in order to be readable. Street address numbers and lettering
should be placed in a visible location on all residential, commercial,
industrial and public structures on or before June 1, 1992.
(Ord. 91-8-19, passed 8-19-1991; Ord. passed 12-3-2001)
§ 152.05 RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROPERTY ADDRESSING AND ROAD NUMBERING.
   (A)   Area Plan Commission responsibilities.
      (1)   In the unincorporated areas of the county, the responsibility for
the issuance of street addresses shall be assigned to the staff of the County
Area Plan Commission.
      (2)   I.C. 36-7-4-405 grants a Plan Commission the power to prescribe a
numbering system, assign street numbers and approve the naming of all streets
in platted subdivision. The Area Plan Commission shall issue and keep a
permanent record of all issued property addresses within its jurisdiction and
share said addresses with local postal authorities and E911 personnel.
   (B)   County road or highway names or changes in such names. Determination
of county road or highway names or changes in such names shall be the sold
responsibility of the County Commissioners and the County Highway Department.
   (C)   Final approval. The Area Plan Commission shall have final approval in
the naming of streets in platted subdivision, mobile home parks, commercial or
industrial business parks and the like under its jurisdiction. Local
incorporated communities shall have final approval in the naming of roads and
subdivision streets located within their corporate boundaries.
(Ord. 91-8-19, passed 8-19-1991)
§ 152.06 REQUIREMENTS FOR OBTAINING STREET ADDRESSES.
   In no case shall an individual or business be permitted to assign an address
to their property or a structure on that property. Addressing is the sole
responsibility of the County Area Plan Commission and the local incorporated
cities and towns in the county. The postal services shall only recognize
addresses issued by these agencies. No public utility shall service a location
until an address has been obtained.
(Ord. 91-8-19, passed 8-19-1991)
§ 152.07 INCORPORATED CITIES AND TOWNS.
   The County Area Plan Commission and the County Commissioners do not have
political jurisdiction over the implementation of numbering systems within the
incorporated cities and towns in the county. Numbering in these communities
shall be the responsibility of the local Plan Commission, Town Board or City
Council. However, the County Commissioners may require that city-type addresses
be implemented in these communities for purposes of defining structures for
E911 identification. All structures in the county shall be required to have
city-type property addresses including those in incorporated communities. The
rural route and box system now in place in some incorporated communities shall
be eliminated and city-type addresses shall be assigned to all structures in
the communities by June 1, 1992. Communities shall follow the existing address
system now in place in the community, or develop a system which utilizes north-
south and east-west base lines as described in §
152.03.
(Ord. 91-8-19, passed 8-19-1991)
§ 152.08 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   All structures in the county shall have their new addresses posted on their
structure, mailbox or mailbox post by June 1, 1992. Customers of the postal
service shall have until June 1, 1993, to communicate their new address to all
of their mailers. No mail will be forwarded to rural route and box number type
postal addresses in the county by the postal service after June 1, 1993.

vegetation, watercourses or other similar elements which, if preserved, would
add attractiveness and value to the proposed development and surrounding area
as long as the entire site is not precluded from reasonable development.
   (B)   The natural topography shall be retained where ever possible in order
to reduce runoff onto adjoining property and to avoid extensive regrading of
the site.
   (C)   Building locations shall be carefully studied in relation to existing
12 inch and larger caliper trees, and other pertinent site features.
   (D)   Consideration shall be given to varying the setback line required in

consistent with the need to minimize flood damages; all public utilities and
facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems shall be located
and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; adequate drainage shall
be provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards; on-site waste disposal
systems, per the requirements of the County Health Department and/or the
Indiana State Department of Health.
      (2)   If there is a question as to the location of the subdivision in
relation to a floodway or flood fringe area, the Director shall direct the
developer or his or her agent to submit the plans to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources in order to locate the floodway and flood fringe area in
relation to the subdivision.
   (G)   Primary subdivision plat and construction plans containing lands
identified elsewhere by ordinance as flood prone areas shall have the elevation
of the 100-year flood and the locations of the floodway and flood fringe areas.

CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION
§ 154.185 PURPOSE/INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   (1)   A conservation subdivision provides an alternative lot size and
layout option which generally utilizes the clustering of houses and the
dedication of remaining land to conservation areas.
      (2)   The purposes of this subchapter, among others, are as follows:
         (a)   To implement adopted land use, transportation and community
policies, as identified in the County Comprehensive Plan;
         (b)   To conserve open land, including those areas containing unique
and sensitive natural features such as woodlands, steep slopes, streams,
floodplains and wetlands, by setting them aside from development;
         (c)   To protect areas of the county with productive agricultural
soils for continued or future agricultural use, by conserving blocks of land
large enough to allow for efficient farm operation;
         (d)   To provide greater design flexibility and efficiency in the
siting of services and infrastructure, including the opportunity to reduce the
length of roads, utility runs and the amount of paving required for residential
development;
         (e)   To reduce erosion and sedimentation by the retention or existing
vegetation and the minimization of development on steep slopes;
         (f)   To provide for a diversity of lot sizes, building densities and
housing choices to accommodate a variety of age and income groups, and
residential preferences, so that the county’s population diversity may be
maintained;
         (g)   To implement adopted county policies to conserve a variety of
irreplaceable and environmentally sensitive resource lands as set forth in the
County Comprehensive Plan;
         (h)   To create neighborhoods with direct visual access to open land,
with amenities in the form or neighborhood open space, and with a strong
neighborhood identity;
         (i)   To provide for the conservation and maintenance of open land in
the county to achieve the above mentioned goals and for active or passive
recreational use by residents;
         (j)   To provide multiple options for landowners in order to minimize
impacts on environmental resources (sensitive lands such as wetlands,
floodplain and steep slopes) and disturbance of natural or cultural features
(such as mature woodlands, hedgerows and tree lines, wildlife habitats,
historic buildings and other cultural features);
         (k)   To provide standards reflecting the varying circumstances and
interests of individual landowners, and the individual characteristics of their
properties; and
         (l)   To conserve scenic views and elements of the county’s rural
character, and to minimize perceived density, by minimizing views of new
developments from existing roads.
   (B)   In order to achieve these purposes, this subchapter provides the
process and standards for the development of conservation subdivisions.
(Ord. 1999-4-19, passed 4-19-1999)
§ 154.186 STANDARDS FOR CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION DESIGN.
   (A)   Determining density or yield.
      (1)   Applicants shall have the option of estimating the legally
permitted density on the basis of mathematical percentages and formulas
contained in this subchapter, or on the basis of a yield plan. Such yield plans
consist of conventional lot and street layouts, and must conform to the
county’s regulations governing lot dimensions, land suitable for development
(for example, not including wetlands, street area and parking). Although such
plans shall be conceptual in nature, and are not intended to involve
significant engineering cost, they must be realistic, and not show potential
house sites or streets in areas that would not ordinarily be legally permitted
in conventional layout.
      (2)   In order to prepare a realistic yield plan, applicants generally
need to first map the conservation areas on their site. Typical yield plans
would include, at minimum, basic topography, vegetation, location of potential
wetlands, 100-year floodplain and soils as indicated in the county soil survey
published by the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service.
      (3)   On sites not served by public sewage or a centralized private
sewage treatment facility, soil suitability for septic systems in the area to
be developed shall be demonstrated, by methods approved by the County Health
Department. This means information from soil survey, not on site soil boring.
   (B)   Minimum percentage of conservation areas. The minimum percentage of
land that shall be designated as conservation, and protected from further
subdivision through the recorded plat, shall be as specified in Table A:
      (1)   The following types of land classifications should be included in
the conservation area:
         (a)   Large woodland tract possessing quality timber and classified
forest;
         (b)   Wetlands, as defined by latest version of U.S. Army of Corps of
Engineers, jurisdiction manual;
         (c)   Designated floodplain and/or alluvial soils;
         (d)   Land with slopes exceeding 25%;
         (e)   All lands as classified as prime soils, as defined by Natural
Resource Conservation Service;
         (f)   Land under permanent easement prohibiting future development
(including easements for drainage structures);
         (g)   Karst topography;
         (h)   Unique and natural areas as designated by Heritage Trust; and
         (i)   Riparian areas.
      (2)   All conservation area shall be restricted from further subdivision
through a conservation easement, in a form acceptable to the county and duly
recorded in the County Recorder’s office as part of the plat.
   (C)   Density bonus. Additional density may be allowed by the Plan
Commission when one of the following public benefits is proposed:
      (1)   Development of a conservation subdivision: a density bonus will be
granted for the development of the proposed subdivision by following the
conservation subdivision design methods outlined in this subchapter and
providing the minimum primary, secondary and buffer conservation areas required
by the zoning district;
      (2)   Creation of an endowment for conservation area maintenance; and
      (3)   Implementation of density bonus: the Plan Commission may allow up
to a 10% density bonus to generate additional income to the applicant for the
sole purpose of endowing a permanent fund to offset continuing costs of
maintaining open space and conservation land of the proposed subdivision.
         (a)   These density bonuses may be implemented by reducing the amount
of total conservation area or by reducing the minimum lot area requirements by
up to 10% or by a combination of these approaches at the discretion of the Plan
Commission. In no case, shall the minimum required primary conservation area or
buffer area be reduced to provide the density bonus. In most cases, this
subchapter provides sufficient flexibility that the minimum conservation area
goals can be met while still accommodating the density bonuses.
         (b)   The bonuses density factor found in Table B shall be applied to
the gross developable area as calculated in division (A) above. In cases where
the calculation indicates a fraction of a dwelling unit, the applicant may
increase the number of dwelling units to the next larger number of full
dwelling units.
   (D)   Location of conservation areas.
      (1)   The location of conservation areas conserved through compact
residential development shall be consistent with the policies contained in the
Comprehensive Plan, and with the recommendations contained in Designing Open
Space Subdivisions: A Practical Step-by-Step Approach.
      (2)   Conservation areas shall be comprised of primary, secondary and
buffer conservation areas. All lands within primary and buffer conservation
areas are required to be protected by a permanent conservation easement,
prohibiting further development and setting other standards safeguarding the
site’s special resources from negative changes.
         (a)   Primary conservation areas. This category consist of wetlands,
land within the 100-year floodplain, steep bluffs and karst topography. These
sensitive lands are not considered to be buildable (for both conventional and
conservation subdivisions).
         (b)   Buffer areas. A 100-foot greenway which separates the housing
area from the other remaining conservation areas and is designated as
permanently protected, however in the absence of primary conservation areas the
buffer area can attribute.
         (c)   Secondary conservation areas.
            1.   This category is in addition to the primary and buffer
conservation areas, and constitutes the balance of the remaining land that
shall be designated and protected from further subdivision. Full density credit
for land in this category will be as indicated for each zone in Table C so that
the development potential is not reduced by this designation. Such density
credit may be applied to other unconstrained parts of the site.
            2.   Although the locations of primary conservation areas are
predetermined by the locations of floodplain, wetlands, steep slopes and soils
subject to slumping, greater latitude exists in the designation of secondary
conservation areas.
            3.   The location of the secondary conservation areas shall be
guided by the maps and policies contained in the Comprehensive Plan, and shall
typically include all or part of the following kinds of resources: mature
woodlands, aquifer recharge areas, significant prime farmland, historic,
archaeological or cultural features listed (or eligible to be listed) on
national, state or county registers or inventories, and scenic views into the
property from existing public roads. Secondary conservation areas, therefore,
typically consist of upland forest, meadows, pastures and farm fields, part of
the ecologically connected matrix of natural areas significant for wildlife
habitat, and water quality protect.
         (d)   Interconnected conservation area network. As these policies are
implemented, it is the intent that, where possible, the protected conservation
areas in each new subdivision will eventually adjoin each other, ultimately
forming an inter-connected network of conservation areas, across the county.
   (E)   Evaluation criteria.
      (1)   In evaluating the layout of lots and conservation areas, the layout
of lots and conservation areas, the following criteria will be considered by
the Planning Commission as indicating design appropriate to the natural,
historic and cultural features, and meeting the purposed of this subchapter.
      (2)   Diversity and originality in lot layout shall be encouraged to
achieve the best possible relationship between development and conservation
areas.
      (3)   Accordingly, the Planning Commission shall evaluate proposals to
determine whether the proposed conceptual preliminary plan:
         (a)   Protects and preserves all prime agricultural soils, floodplain,
wetlands and steep slopes from clearing, grading, filing or construction
(except as may be approved by the county for essential infrastructure);
         (b)   Preserves and maintains mature and/or unfragmented woodlands,
existing fields, pastures and/or orchards, and creates sufficient buffer areas
to minimize conflicts between residential and agricultural uses. For example,
locating house lots and driveways within wooded areas, or edge of woods is
generally recommended, with two exceptions. The first involves significant
wildlife habitat or mature and/or unfragmented woodlands which raise an equal
or greater preservation concern, as described in divisions (E)(3)(e) and (E)(3)
(h) below. The second involves predominantly agricultural areas, where remnant
tree groups provide the only natural areas for wildlife habitat;
         (c)   If development must be located on open fields or pastures
because of greater constraints in all other parts of the site, dwellings should
be sited on the least prime agricultural soils;
         (d)   Maintains or creates an upland buffer of natural native species
vegetation of at least 100 feet in depth adjacent to wetlands and surface
waters, including creeks, streams, springs, lakes and ponds;
         (e)   Designs around existing hedgerows and treelines between fields
or meadows. Minimizes impacts on large woodlands (greater than five acres),
especially those containing many mature trees or a significant wildlife
habitat, or those not degraded by invasive vines. Also, woodlands of any size
on highly erodible soils with slopes greater than 10% should be avoided.
However, woodlands in poor condition with limited management potential can
provide suitable locations for residential development. When any woodland is
developed, greater care shall be taken to design disturbed areas (for
buildings, roads, yards, septic disposal fields and the like) in locations
where there are no large trees or obvious wildlife areas, to the fullest extent
that is practicable;
         (f)   Leaves scenic views and vistas unblocked or interrupted,
particularly as seen from public roadways. For example, in open agrarian
landscapes, a deep no-build, no-plant buffer is recommended along the public
roadway where those views or vistas are prominent or locally significant. In
wooded areas where the sense of enclosure is a feature that should be
maintained, a deep no-build, no-cut buffer should be respected, to preserve
existing vegetation;
         (g)   Protects wildlife habitat areas of species listed as endangered,
threatened, or of special concern by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and/or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency;
         (h)   Designs around and places consideration of sites of historic,
archaeological or cultural value, and their environs, insofar as needed to
safeguard the character of the future, including stone walls, spring houses,
barn foundations, cellar holes, earthworks, burial grounds and the like;
         (i)   Protects rural roadside character and improves public safety and
vehicular carrying capacity by avoiding development fronting onto existing
public roads. Establishes buffer zones along the scenic corridor of rural roads
with historic buildings, stone walls and the like;
         (j)   Landscapes common areas (such as community greens), cul-de-sac
islands and both sides of new streets with native shade trees specie and
flowering shrubs with high wildlife conservation values;
         (k)   Provides actives recreation areas in suitable locations offering
convenient access by residents, and adequately screened from nearby house lots;
         (l)   Includes a pedestrian circulation system designed to assure that
pedestrians can walk safely and easily on the site, between properties and
activities or special features within the neighborhood conservation system.
Trails, which in turn should link with potential conservation areas on
adjoining undeveloped parcels (or with existing conservation areas on adjoining
developed parcels, where applicable); and
         (m)   Provides conservation areas that are reasonably contiguous, and
whose configuration is in accordance with the guidelines contained in the
Design and Management Handbook for Preservation Areas, produced by the Natural
Lands Trust. For example, fragmentation of conservation areas should be
minimized so that these resource areas are not divided into numerous small
parcels located in various parts of the development. To the greatest extent
practicable, this land shall be designed as a single block with logical,
straightforward boundaries. Long thin strips of conservation land shall be
avoided, unless the conservation future is linear or unless such configuration
is necessary to connect with other streams or trails. The conservation areas
shall generally abut existing or potential conservation areas land on adjacent
parcels, and shall be designed as part of larger contiguous and integrated
greenway system, as per the policies in the goal, objectives and strategies the
County Comprehensive Plan.

§ 154.187 SITE PLANNING PROCEDURES FOR CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   Process overview.
      (1)   The sequence of actions prescribed in this subchapter is as listed
below.
      (2)   These steps shall followed sequentially, and may be combined only
at the discretion of the Planning Commission Department:
         (a)   Pre-application discussion;
         (b)   Existing features (site analysis) plan. (Clock starts with the
submission of this plan at the on-site walkabout or at a regularly scheduled
meeting of the Planning Commission);
         (c)   On-site walkabout by Planning Department, Technical Advisory
Committee members and applicant;
         (d)   Pre-submission conference;
         (e)   Conceptual preliminary plan (conceptual illustration of
conservation areas land, potential house sites, street alignments and tentative
lot lines, prepared according to the four-step design process described
herein);
         (f)   Preliminary plan submission, determination of completeness,
review of overall planning concepts and decision;
         (g)   Preliminary engineering certification;
         (h)   Final plan submission, determination completeness, review and
decision;
         (i)   Plat signature; and
         (j)   Recording at County Recorder’s office.
   (B)   Elements of the preliminary plan process.
      (1)   Pre-application discussion. A pre-application discussion is
strongly encouraged between the applicant, the site designer(s), and the
Planning Department. The purpose of this informal meeting is to introduce the
applicant and site designer(s) to the county zoning and subdivision regulations
and procedures, and to discuss the applicants objectives in relation to the
Plan Commission official policies and ordinance requirements. The Technical
Advisory Committee and Department shall conduct such activities.
      (2)   Existing features (site analysis) plan.
         (a)   Existing features (site analysis) plans analyzing each sites
special features are required for all proposed subdivisions, as they form the
basis of the design process for conservation areas, house locations, street
alignments and lot lines. The applicant or his or her representative shall
bring a copy of the existing features (site analysis) plan to the on-site
walkabout.
         (b)   Detailed requirements for existing features (site analysis)
plans are contained in another section of this subchapter, but at the minimum
must include:
            1.   A contour based at least upon topographical maps published by
the U.S. Geological Survey;
            2.   The location of severely constraining elements such as steep
slopes (over 25%), wetlands, watercourses, intermittent streams and 100-year
floodplain, and all rights-of-way and easements;
            3.   Soil boundaries as shown on USDA Soil Conservation Service
medium-intensity maps;
            4.   The location of significant scenic views into or out from the
property, watershed divides and drainageways, fences or stone walls, rock
outcrops and existing structures, roads, tracks and trails; and
            5.   Vegetation map showing woodlands.
         (c)   These existing features (site analysis) plans shall identify
primary conservation areas (floodplain, wetlands and steep slopes, as defined
in the process for computing adjusted tract acreage), and secondary
conservation areas as described in §
154.186(D)(2)(c).
      (3)   On-site walkabout.
         (a)   After the existing features (site analysis) plan has been
prepared, the Planning Department shall schedule a mutually convenient date to
walk the property with the applicant and his or her site designer.
         (b)   The purpose of this visit is to familiarize Planning Department
and Technical Advisory Committee with the property’s special features, and to
provide them an informal opportunity to offer guidance (or at least a response
to the applicant regarding the tentative location of primary conservation
areas.
      (4)   Pre-submission conference. Prior to the submission of the sketch
plan or conceptual preliminary plan, the applicant shall meet with the Planning
Department to discuss how the four-step approach to designing subdivisions,
described in division (B)(6) below, could be applied to the subject property.
At the discretion of the Planning Department this conference be combined with
the on-site walkabout.
      (5)   Conceptual preliminary plan.
         (a)   After the pre-sketch conference, a sketch plan or a conceptual
preliminary plan shall be submitted for all proposed subdivision. As used in
this subchapter, the term PRELIMINARY PLAN refers to the preliminarily
engineered sketch plan drawn to illustrate initial thoughts about a conceptual
layout for conservation lands, house sites and street alignments. This is the
stage where drawings are tentatively illustrated, before heavy engineering
costs are incurred in the design of any proposed subdivision layout.
         (b)   A conceptual preliminary plan shall be submitted by the
applicant to the County Plan Director who will then submit it to the Planning
Commission for review for the purpose of securing early agreement on the
overall pattern of the streets, houselots, primary conservation areas and
potential trail linkages (where applicable), prior to any significant
expenditure on engineering costs in the design of streets, stormwater
management, or the accurate delineation of internal lot boundaries.
      (6)   Four-step process.
         (a)   Each conceptual preliminary plan shall follow a four-step design
process, as described below.
         (b)   When the conceptual preliminary plan is submitted, the applicant
shall be prepared to demonstrate to the Planning Commission that these four
design steps were followed by his or her site designers in determining the
layout of their proposed streets, houselots and conservation lands.
            1.   Designating conservation areas. During the first step, all
potential primary conservation areas, are identified, using the existing
features (site analysis) plan. Primary conservation areas shall consist of
wetlands, floodplain, slopes over 25% and soils susceptible to slumping, and
agricultural lands.
            2.   Location of house sites. During the second step, potential
house sites are tentatively located, because the proposed location of houses
within each lot represents a significant decision with potential impacts on the
ability of the development to meet the 13 evaluation criteria contained in §
154.186(E), subdivision applicants shall identify tentative house sites on the
conceptual preliminary plan a proposed house sites on the detailed final plan.
House sites should generally be located not closer than 100 feet from primary
conservation areas. The building footprint of proposed residences may be
changed by more than 50 feet in any direction, with majority approval of the
members of the Planning Commission. Changes involving less that 50 feet do not
require approval.
            3.   Street and lot layout. The third step consists of aligning
proposed streets to provide vehicular access to each house in the most
reasonable and economical way. When lots and access streets are laid out, they
shall be located in a way that avoids or at least minimizes adverse impacts on
the primary conservation areas. To the greatest extent practicable, wetland
crossings and streets traversing existing slopes over 15% shall be strongly
discouraged. Street connections shall generally be encouraged to minimize the
number of cul-de-sacs to be maintained by the county and to facilitate easy
access to and from homes in different parts of the property (and on adjoining
parcels). Where cul-de-sacs are necessary, those serving six or fewer homes may
be designed with hammerheads facilitating three-point turns. If cul-de-sacs are
necessary, those serving six or fewer homes shall generally be designed with a
central island containing indigenous trees and shrubs (either conserved on
site, or planted). The county generally encourages the creation of single-
loaded residential access streets, in order that the maximum number of homes in
new developments may enjoy views of conservation areas. All streets and roads
are subject to standards set forth in §§
154.160 through
154.171 (Ord. 1996-7-1 as approved by the Board of Commissioners July 1, 1996,
and recorded in Book 106 on pages 292 through 298 in County Records), with the
exception of the surface which shall be determined by the Plan Commission with
recommendation by the Technical Advisory Committee.
            4.   Lot lines. The fourth step is simply to draw in the lot lines,
and to show the following information of the lots: width, depth and frontage.
      (7)   Preliminary engineering certification. Prior to approval of the
conceptual preliminary plan, the applicant shall submit the Planning Commission
a preliminary engineering certification that show the approximate layout of the
proposed streets, house-lots and conservation land, complies with the county
zoning and subdivision regulations, particularly those section governing the
design of subdivision streets and storm water management facilities. This
certification requirement is meant to provide the county with assurance the
proposed plan is able to be accomplished writing the current regulations of the
county. The certification shall also note any waivers needed to implement the
plan as drawn.
(Ord. 1999-4-19, passed 4-19-1999)
§ 154.188 OWNERSHIP AND MAINTENANCE OF CONSERVATION AREAS.
   (A)   Restrictions. Conservation areas shall be permanently restricted from
future subdivision and development, unless through the county comprehensive
planning process the purpose of the area has changed.
   (B)   Ownership options. The following methods may be used, either
individually or in combination, to own conservation areas; however,
conservation areas shall be initially offered for dedication to the
municipality. Common facilities shall not be transferred to another entity
except for transfer to another method of ownership permitted under this
section, and then only when there is no change in the conservation areas, ratio
of the overall development. Ownership methods shall conform to the following.
      (1)   Fee simple dedication to a unit of government. The unit of
government may, but shall not be required to, accept any portion of the
conservation areas, provided that:
         (a)   There is no cost of acquisition to the unit of government; and
         (b)   The unit of government agrees to and has access to maintain such
areas.
      (2)   Condominium association. Conservation areas may be controlled
through the use of condominium agreements. Such agreements shall be in
accordance with I.C. 32-25 as amended. All conservation or portions thereof
shall be held as “common element”.
      (3)   Homeowner’s association.
         (a)   Conservation in areas or portions thereof, may be held in common
ownership by a homeowner’s association, subject to all of the provisions for
homeowner’s associations set forth in state regulations.
         (b)   In addition, the following regulations shall be met.
            1.   The applicant shall provide the unit of government a
description of the organization of the proposed association, including its by-
laws, and all documents governing ownership, maintenance, and use restrictions
for areas thereof.
            2.   The proposed association shall be established by the owner or
applicant and shall be operating (with financial subsidization by the owner or
applicant, if necessary) before the sale of any dwelling units in the
development.
            3.   Membership in the association shall be automatic (mandatory)
for all purchasers of dwelling units therein and their successors in title.
            4.   The association shall be responsible for maintenance and
insurance of conservation areas or portions thereof.
            5.   The by-laws shall confer legal authority on the association to
place a lien on the real property of any member who falls delinquent is his or
her dues. Such dues shall be paid with the accrued interest before the lien may
be lifted.
            6.   Written notice of any proposed transfer of conservation areas
or portions thereof by the association or the assumption of maintenance for
conservation areas or portions thereof must be given to all members of the
association and to the local unit of government.
            7.   The association shall have adequate staff to administer,
maintain and operate such conservation areas.
      (4)   Private conservation organization or conservancy district/unit of
government. With permission of the Plan Commission, an owner may transfer
either fee simple title of the conservation areas easements on the conservation
areas to a private non-profit conservation organization or to the unit of
government provided that:
         (a)   The conservation organization is acceptable to the unit of
government and is a bona fide conservation organization intended to exist
indefinitely;
         (b)   The conveyance contains appropriate provisions for proper
reverter or retransfer in the event that the organization or the county becomes
unwilling or unable to continue carrying out its functions;
         (c)   The conservation area is permanently restricted from future
development through a conservation easement and the unit of government is given
the ability to enforce these restrictions; and
         (d)   A maintenance agreement acceptable to the unit of government is
established between the owner and the organization or the county.
      (5)   Dedication of easements to the unit of government.
         (a)   The Plan Commission/County Executive Board may, but shall not be
required to, accept easements for public use of any portion of the conservation
areas or facilities. In such cases, the facility remains in the ownership of
the condominium association, homeowner’s association, or private conservation
organization while the easements are held by the local unit of government.
         (b)   In addition, the following regulations shall apply.
            1.   There shall be no cost of acquisition to the local unit of
government.
            2.   Any such easements for public use shall be accessible to the
residents of the local unit of government.
            3.   A satisfactory maintenance agreement shall be reached between
the owner and the local unit of government.
      (6)   Non-common private ownership. Up to 80% of the required
conservation areas may be included within one or more large “conservancy lots”
of at least ten acres provided the conservation area is permanently restricted
from future development.
   (C)   Maintenance. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Plan Commission, the
cost and responsibility of maintaining conservation areas, shall be borne by
the property owner condominium association, homeowner’s association or
conservation organization.
      (1)   The applicant shall, at the time of preliminary plan submission,
provide a plan for maintenance of conservation areas, and operation of common
facilities.
         (a)   The plan shall define ownership.
         (b)   The plan shall establish necessary regular and periodic
operation and maintenance responsibilities for the various kinds of
conservation areas (i.e., lawns, playing fields, meadow, pasture, cropland
woodlands and the like).
         (c)   The plan shall estimate staffing needs, insurance requirements
and associated costs, and define the means for funding the maintenance of the
conservation areas and operation of any common facilities on an on-going basis.
Such funding plan shall include the means for funding long-term capital
improvements as well as regular yearly operating and maintenance costs.
         (d)   At the local unit of government (Plan Commission and/or
Executive Board) discretion of the applicant may be required to escrow
sufficient funds for the maintenance and operation costs of common facilities
for up to one year.
         (e)   Any changes to the maintenance plan shall be approved by the
Plan Commission after petition provides public notice and letters to interested
parties.
      (2)   In the event that the organization established to maintain the
conservation area and the common facilities, or any successor organization
thereto, fails to maintain all or any portion thereof in reasonable order and
condition, the local unit of government may assume responsibility for
maintenance, in which case any escrow funds may be forfeited and any permits
may be revoked or suspended.
      (3)   The local unit of government may enter the premises and take
corrective action, including extended maintenance. The costs of such corrective
action shall charged to the property owner, condominium association,
homeowner’s association, conservation organization or individual property
owners who make up a condominium or homeowner’s association and may include
administrative costs and penalties. Such costs shall become a lien on said
properties. Notice of such lien shall be filed by the local unit of government
in the office of the County Auditor and the County Recorder.
   (D)   Maintenance endowment.
      (1)   Such maintenance activities may include mowing meadows, removing
invasive vines, paying insurance premiums, paying local taxes and costs
associated with active or passive recreation facilities. Spending from this
Fund should be restricted to expenditure of interest so that the principal may
be preserved. Assuming an annual average interest rate of 5%, the amount
designated for the Endowment Fund shall be at least 20 times the estimated
annual maintenance costs. Such estimate shall be prepared by an agency, firm or
organization acceptable to the Plan Commission, and with experience in managing
conservation land and recreational facilities.
      (2)   The Endowment Fund is not designed to pay for private road
maintenance or shared utility system maintenance.
      (3)   The Endowment Fund may be supplemented by an annual assessment on
each lot by the designated entity with ownership and maintenance
responsibilities for the conservation areas and other common elements such as
private roads and shared utility lines.
      (4)   Because additional dwellings, beyond the maximum that would
ordinarily be permitted, may reasonably be considered to be net of development
costs and represent true profit, 25% of the net selling price of the endowment
lots shall be donated by the applicant to the Endowment Fund for the
conservation lands in the subdivision. This Fund shall be transferred by the
developer to the designated entity with ownership and maintenance
responsibilities (such as a homeowner’s association, a land trust, condominium
association or unit of local government) for the conservation areas at the time
the designated entity is created.
      (5)   When estimating the projected maintenance costs of the conservation
areas, it is not necessary to include conservation land that is not accessible
by the subdivision residents for their common enjoyment. Such lands would
typically include areas designated on the final plat for future agricultural,
horticultural, silvicultural or equestrian uses, which may be leased or sold to
another party for those express purposes, and which are protected from future
development by permanent conservation easement. In such cases, the density
bonus may be adjusted proportionately to reflect only the acreage that is
accessible to residents for their passive or active recreation. In most cases,
maintenance efforts will be focused on primary conservation areas and buffer
areas.

§ 154.189 MODIFICATIONS.
   (A)   The Plan Commission may, by conditional use approval and after a
public hearing, permit the modification of the provisions of this subchapter,
in order to encourage a well-planned cluster development. However, in terms of
modifying any dimensional requirement (lot area, width, setbacks and the like),
such modification may not be greater than 25%.
   (B)   Any conditional use to permit such a modification shall be subject to
the following criteria:
      (1)   The design and modification shall be in harmony with the purposes
and the land use standards contained in this subchapter;
      (2)   The design and modifications shall generally enhance the
development plan, the central core area, the streetscapes and the
neighborhoods, or at least not be any less desirable than the plan that could
be created in conformance with this subchapter;
      (3)   The design and modifications shall not produce lots or streets
systems that would be impractical or detract from the appearance of the
district, and shall not adversely affect emergency vehicle access or deprive
adjoining noncommercial properties of adequate light and air;
      (4)   Increased residential density or intensification of nonresidential
uses shall be offset by corresponding special efforts by the applicant to
improve the appearance of the development through enhanced architectural and
landscaping efforts; and
      (5)   The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed modifications
will produce equal or better results, from the local unit of government
perspective, and represent the minimum modification necessary.

(Ord. passed 7-20-1992)
§ 155.021 FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT (FP).
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this district is to regulate development in
flood prone areas. The new construction of buildings and other new development
or land uses in the flood hazard areas of the county, if not properly regulated
to account for the potential hazard, could result in the loss of life and
property, create health and safety hazards, and lead to extraordinary
expenditures for flood protection and relief. Development of these areas is not
essential to the orderly growth of the community. These lands are suitable for
open space and other uses that do not require structures or fill. The
identification of the floodplain, which includes the floodway and flood fringe,
has been made by the Federal Flood Insurance Administration of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources shall
exercise primary jurisdiction in the floodway under the provisions of I.C. 14-
28-1 et seq.; however, the Plan Commission or Board of Zoning Appeals may
impose terms and conditions on any permits they issue which are more
restrictive than those imposed by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
   (B)   Permitted uses.
      (1)   The following low flood damage potential uses/activities do not
obstruct flood flows and are allowed in the FP District, provided they do not
require structures, fill or storage of materials or equipment:
         (a)   Agricultural uses such as farming, grazing, truck farming and
horticulture;
         (b)   Forestry and nursery uses;
         (c)   Outdoor recreational uses, including fishing, boating, hiking,
bicycling and horseback riding;
         (d)   Conservation of soil and water, plants and wildlife;
         (e)   Wildlife management areas;
         (f)   Wells and utility lines; and
         (g)   Buildings lawfully existing prior to the adoption of these
provisions.
      (2)   The above and foregoing uses shall be permitted provided they do
not require the extensive use of structures or storage of materials or
equipment; however, in no event shall the use of fill from either within or
without the Floodplain District be allowed without the specific permission from
and authority of the Department of Natural Resources.
   (C)   Prohibited uses. The following uses are specifically prohibited in the
floodplain, except where allowed by special exception:
      (1)   The storage or disposal of any soil, loam, peat, sand, gravel, rock
or other mineral substance, refuse, trash, rubbish, debris or dredged soil,
except by special exception;
      (2)   The drainage, excavation or dredging, or removal or relocation of
loam, peat, sand, gravel, soil, rock or other mineral substance, except as
necessary to work, or permitted as of right or by special exception;
      (3)   The storage or disposal of materials used for snow and ice control
including sand, salt and other deicing chemicals;
      (4)   The manufacture, storage or disposal of hazardous wastes;
      (5)   Solid waste landfills, junk yards, salvage yards and dumps; and
      (6)   Septic tanks and fields.
   (D)   Nonconforming uses. Any building, structure, or use of land in the
Floodplain District which is not in conformance with this chapter constitutes a
nonconforming use. All applications to repair, extend or enlarge a
nonconforming use shall be forwarded to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and shall be incorporated into the issuance of any local permit.
   (E)   Issuance of improvement location permit.
      (1)   The Plan Commission shall keep and maintain all records, including
all first floor elevations, certificates, plans and other materials associated
with any permit or variance issued within the floodplain.
      (2)   (a)   The Plan Commission shall not issue an improvement location
permit within the floodplain until the applicant submits evidence that:
            1.   A proper permit or letter or recommendation for it has been
granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources;
            2.   All buildings or additions to existing buildings shall have
flood protection grades at least two feet above the regulatory flood; and
            3.   No use shall increase the base flood level of a regulatory
flood.
         (b)   A commercial or industrial well will not adversely effect any
municipal water supply source.
      (3)   The Plan Commission shall not issue an improvement location permit
for a mobile home in a floodplain.
      (4)   All applications for improvement location permits involving new
construction or substantial improvement to existing buildings shall be
accompanied by an elevation certificate which needs to be completed by the
applicant and have the lowest floor elevation certified by a licensed
professional engineer or land surveyor. The elevation certificate should be
presented to the Plan Director at the time the owner is applying for a
certificate of occupancy.
   (F)   General disclaimer in areas of potential flooding. In the floodplain,
floodway and flood fringe areas defined in this chapter, the degree of flood
protection established is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
based on engineering and scientific considerations. Larger floods can and will
occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by constructed or
natural causes such as ice or debris jams. This chapter does not imply that
areas outside flood hazard areas as defined in this chapter shall be free of
flooding or flood damage. This chapter does not create any liability on the
part of the county, the Plan Commission, Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, the state or any elected or appointed official or employee of them
for any flood damages that result from any reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made under it.
   (G)   Mapping disputes. In a case where a property owner disputes the
boundaries of a zoning district, flood protection grade data or regulatory
flood profile data, the owner shall file a written protest with the Plan
Director. The written protest shall document the disputed area, and be prepared
and attested to by a registered professional engineer. The protest then will be
submitted by the Plan Director to the Plan Commission. The item of dispute will
be brought to the attention of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, and
in no case will such data be revised without the written approval of the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
   (H)   Basis for establishing a Floodplain District. The FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT
is defined as that area shown as the regulatory flood or identified as the
special flood hazard area (SFHA) on the flood hazard boundary map of Putnam
County prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and dated
February 24, 1978.
   (I)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter repeals and replaces
other ordinances adopted by the county to fulfill the requirements of the
national flood insurance program. However, this chapter does not repeal the
original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the program.
Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements,
covenants or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinance
easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever
imposes the more restrictive restrictions shall take precedence. In addition,
the county shall assure that all national flood insurance regulations
(contained in 44 C.F.R. Part 60.3) and state floodplain management regulations
and laws (312 I.A.C. 10-1-1 et seq.) are met.
(Ord. passed 7-20-1992)

§ 155.031 ME-MINERAL EXTRACTION DISTRICT.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   The following regulations shall pertain only to those mining and
extracting operations initiated after the formal adoption of this chapter.
      (2)   All existing operations and contiguous lands owned or leased by the
mining company for the purpose of mineral extraction shall not be subject to
the conditions and requirements of this chapter. These areas need to be on file
in the County Plan Commission office prior to the formal adoption of this
chapter.
      (3)   Mineral extraction: nothing in this chapter shall prevent the use
and alienation of mineral resources by the owner or alienee.
      (4)   No production shall be started until the Plan Commission has made a

shall be conducted. The Plan Commission shall investigate the area to be
developed, as well as the surrounding area, in order to determine the
conditions to be prescribed so as to protect surrounding property.
   (B)   Purpose. The purpose of this district is to provide land for the
mining, excavation, processing and storing of mineral resources. This district
is designed to ensure that these resources are properly managed and that all
land which mineral extraction has occurred will be left in such condition, so
as to not create a hazard or nuisance which either immediately or in the future
affects the health, safety or general welfare of the community.
   (C)   Permitted uses. The plant area will be used for the following: the
excavation, processing, storage, stockpiling, distribution and sale of the

(such as limestone, dolomite, sandstone, shale and similar materials), no
sloping shall be required if any overlaying unconsolidated materials are sloped
as described in divisions (E)(1)(a) and (E)(1)(b) above and a horizontal shelf
at least ten feet wide is present between the bottom of the slope and the top
of the vertical wall.
      (2)   Fencing. If an open excavation greater than ten feet in depth
exists, a substantial fence shall be maintained either on the property line or
at least 200 feet outside the excavation. The fence shall be at least a six-
wire, four-foot high fence, limiting access to the excavated area.

(Ord. passed 7-20-1992)
§ 155.047 SIGNS.
   (A)   Purpose. The intent of this section of the chapter is to promote and
protect the public health, welfare and safety, and create a more attractive
appearance by preserving the scenic and natural beauty of the county by
regulating outdoor signs.
   (B)   Safety considerations; requirements. All freestanding billboards or
advertising sign boards shall be 15 feet or more from any public right-of-way
line, to avoid confusion and reduce view obstruction.
   (C)   Aesthetic considerations; guidelines.
      (1)   Freestanding signs are appropriate where a building is set back
from the street; the architecture of the building is not conducive to a sign;
or several businesses are located in one building.
Hanging signs are appropriate where buildings are most visible from an angle or
when buildings are close together. Hanging signs should have consistent
placement, size and materials, and should be located below the level of the
second floor windows.
      (2)   Signs attached to buildings should define or enhance architectural
elements of the building, not obscure or obliterate them. Signs should stay
within the architectural frames provided for them by the buildings.
      (3)   Where feasible, sign letters should be attached directly to the
building without superfluous back-facing, particularly when a “sign band” or
cornice is a part of the building facade. Signs should not be placed on
surfaces which were not intended for signs.
      (4)   All signs not currently in conformance with these guidelines due to
renovations should be removed. Signs can be attractively printed on store
windows, particularly where the sign band is insufficient or there are multiple
businesses in one building. Roof signs and general advertising signs are
inappropriate.
   (D)   Development standards.
      (1)   In the agricultural districts: signs accessory to roadside stands
shall be limited to two signs per lot with no sign larger than ten square feet
and set back at least ten feet from any right-of-way.
      (2)   In the agricultural and residential districts:
         (a)   Small announcement or professional signs shall not exceed ten
square feet; and
         (b)   One name plate shall not exceed ten square feet for each
dwelling.
      (3)   In the commercial districts, advertising signs are permitted if
they advertise only the services, articles or products offered or in use within
the buildings, subject to the following requirements:
         (a)   The aggregate area of signs on any building site should not
exceed 5% of the building facade to which the sign is oriented or 300 square
feet whichever is less;
         (b)   All signs shall be attached to the main building and shall not
project more than four feet perpendicular from the building nor project more
than five feet above the roof; and
         (c)   The aggregate area of signs in the Commercial General District
shall not exceed two 200 square feet.
      (4)   In the commercial and industrial districts, advertising signs and
billboards are permitted, subject to the following conditions:
         (a)   The aggregate area of advertising signs shall not exceed 500
square feet in area;
         (b)   The structure supporting the signs, and not attached to
buildings, shall be located at least 15 feet from the property line where
oriented towards collector or local streets, 40 feet for freeways and 30 feet
for arterial streets. No self-supporting sign or parts thereof shall project
over a street right-of-way. Subject to INDOT approval;
         (c)   The aggregate size of billboards shall not exceed 600 square
feet; and
         (d)   There shall be at least 500 feet between billboards with no more
than two located within any designated 1,500 foot distance. No billboard shall
violate the Federal Highway Beautification Act, being 23 U.S.C. § 131.
      (5)   In all districts:
         (a)   Temporary real estate signs and construction or contractor’s
signs shall not exceed two in number per lot or be more than six square feet;
and
         (b)   Billboards are prohibited in all districts except the CG and I
Districts.
   (E)   Permits and fees required.
      (1)   Sign permits shall be obtained to erect, construct, enlarge, move
or convert any sign.
      (2)   Application for permits shall be made to the County Plan
Commission, and shall include the following information:
         (a)   Name and address of the owner of property on which the sign is
located or is to be located;
         (b)   Name and address of the owner of the sign; and
         (c)   A drawing and description of the sign. Dimensions, construction
supports, electrical wiring and components, materials of the sign, and method
of attachment must be shown. If required by the Plan Commission, certified
engineering data shall also be shown.
      (3)   The application and permit fee shall be filed with the County Plan
Commission. If any sign is installed prior to obtaining a permit, the
application fee shall be doubled. Signs must be constructed or installed within
90 days of receipt of the permit, in order for it to remain valid. Permits are
not required for residential signs, signs indicating type of crop planted, or
temporary real estate signs.
   (F)   Enforcement.
      (1)   (a)   The County Plan Commission may order the removal of any sign
in violation of this section, upon giving 30 days’ written notice to the owner/
operator of the sign.
         (b)   Signs considered to present an immediate threat to public safety
may be removed immediately without written notice.
      (2)   Signs removed by the Plan Commission shall be held by the county
for redemption by the owner. To redeem, the sign owner shall pay all costs
incurred by the county for removal, within 30 days of its removal. Signs not
redeemed within 30 days may be disposed of by the county.
   (G)   Maintenance. All signs must be kept in good condition and must be
safe, neat, clean and attractive. When a sign advertises a business no longer
located on the property on which the sign is located, the owner must remove the
sign within three months. Such removal is considered part of maintenance.
Failure to properly maintain a sign could result in automatic revocation of the
permit after proper notification has been made.

NONCONFORMING USES
§ 155.095 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Generally. The lawful use of a building or premises, existing at the
time of passage of this chapter, which does not conform to the use regulations
of the district in which it is located shall be deemed to be a legal,
nonconforming use.
   (B)   Nonconforming uses.
      (1)   (a)   Nonconforming uses are considered incompatible or undesirable
with permitted uses in the districts in which the use is located. Within the
districts established by this chapter there are nonconforming lots, structures
and uses of land. These nonconforming lots, structures and uses of land were
lawful prior to passage of this chapter, but are now prohibited, regulated or
restricted.
         (b)   It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconforming
uses to continue until they are removed.
         (c)   Existing registered (on file in Plan Commission office)
nonconforming uses can be sold provided the future owner re-registers the
business with the Plan Commission office. (All other regulations in this
section still apply.)
         (d)   Nonconforming structures and uses shall not be enlarged upon,
extended or expanded, with exceptions to residential homes in A1, A2, R1 and R2
Districts existing before the enactment of this chapter. These structures can
obtain an ILP (§
155.066) with out receiving a variance if the improvement is not proposed
within required setbacks of that district. Illegal uses existing at the time
this chapter is enacted shall not be validated by virtue of its enactment.
      (2)   To avoid undue hardship, this chapter does not require a change in
the plans, construction or designated use of any building or development in
which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption of this chapter. Where demolition and removal of a building has
progressed to a significant degree, such demolition or removal shall be
considered to be construction, provided that the work is carried on diligently.
      (3)   When a nonconforming use of land or structure is discontinued or
abandoned for six consecutive months, the structure and/or premises shall
thereafter be used in conformance with regulations of the district in which it
is located.
      (4)   Where nonconforming use status applies to both a structure and
premises, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
      (5)   Any nonconforming structure damaged by fire, flood, explosion or
other casualty may be reconstructed and used as before if the reconstruction is
undertaken within 18 months of the casualty, and if the restored structure has
no greater coverage and contains no greater cubic content than previously.
      (6)   Normal maintenance and repair of a structure containing a
nonconforming use may be performed, provided there is not physical change to
the structure and such maintenance or repair does not extend or intensify the
nonconforming use.
      (7)   No building shall be erected or expanded and no use of land area
expanded upon any premises devoted to a nonconforming use, except in
conformance with all other provisions of this chapter.
      (8)   This chapter does not require any change in the plans, construction
or designated use of a building for which a building permit or improvement
location permit has been issued prior to the date of passage of this chapter
and on which construction will be begun within 30 days after the date of the
permit and diligently completed (within 18 months from beginning construction).
      (9)   This chapter does not require any change in the plans, construction
or designated environmental management use of any county property for which a
construction and/or operation permit has been filed with and/or issued by the
Indiana Department of Environmental Management and/or the United State
Environmental Protection Agency prior to the date of the passage of this
chapter.
      (10)   When a nonconforming use is discontinued for six months, the use
of the same shall thereafter conform to the uses permitted in the district in
which it is located, and any nonconforming dwelling which is deficient in
ground floor area, and which is removed from a lot, shall not relocate on the
lot or be replaced by any other dwelling which is not in compliance with the
requirements of this chapter. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, an
agricultural confinement feeding operation established prior to the enactment
of this chapter may be discontinued for a period of up to two years and
thereafter re-established without the need for a rezone, special exception or
variance per other requirements of this chapter.

SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS
§ 155.110 SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   Generally. Special exceptions are publicly or municipally operated
uses traditionally affected with a public interest, and those uses entirely
private in character but of such an unusual nature that their operation may
raise unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property
and public facilities.
   (B)   Procedure.
      (1)   Upon receipt of an application for special exception, the Plan
Director shall refer the application to the Board for public hearing.
      (2)   A copy of each application shall be referred concurrently to the
Commission. The Plan Commission may, without public hearing, review the
application for special exception and report on any effect the application
might have upon the County Comprehensive Plan.
      (3)   In order for a special exception to be granted, the Board must find
in writing that:
         (a)   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the special
exception will not be injurious to the public health, safety or general welfare
of the community;
         (b)   The special exception will not affect the use and value of other
property in the immediate area in a substantially adverse manner; and
         (c)   The establishment of the special exception will be consistent
with the character of the district (particularly that area immediately adjacent
to the special exception) and the permitted land use.
      (4)   The Board may impose conditions as part of its approval to protect
the public health, and for reasons of safety, comfort and convenience. All
special exceptions are subject to the development standards of the county
subdivision regulations §§
154.110 through
154.118,
154.130 through
154.132,
154.145 through
154.147 and
154.160 through
154.171 if deemed necessary by the Board. The Board shall either direct the
Plan Director to issue an improvement location permit for the special exception
or to reject the application. The findings of the Board and its order to the
Plan Director shall be in writing.
   (C)   Existing use.
      (1)   An existing use which is listed here as a special exception and
which is located in a district in which the special exception may be permitted
at the time of enactment of this chapter is a conforming use, providing the use
meets the minimum development standards set forth in the respective districts.
      (2)   Any expansion of the special exception involving the enlargement of
buildings, structures and land devoted to the use, shall be subject to the
requirements and procedures described in this section.
   (D)   Delay.
      (1)   Any person who is issued an improvement location permit for a
special exception must begin construction within nine months after the permit
is issued; complete the special exception within two years after such
construction is begun, whichever is later; and conform to the provisions of any
restrictions or conditions which the Board imposed in conjunction with approval
of the special exception by the Board and upon the basis of which the
improvement location permit was issued.
      (2)   Persons failing to do so may be required by the Board upon its own
motion, and shall be required by the Board upon written petition of any person,
to show cause why such approval should not be withdrawn and such improvement
location permit revoked.
   (E)   Alteration, change, amendment or extension. The holder of an
improvement location permit for a special exception may apply to the Board at
any time for an alteration, change, amendment or extension of the application
or use upon which such permit was based.
      (1)   Upon receipt of the application, the Board shall proceed as in the
case of original application for a special exception.
      (2)   If the Board approves and orders the application or use changed,
altered, amended or extended, it shall notify the Plan Director who shall issue
an amended improvement location permit.
      (3)   The Board may impose any additional reasonable requirements or
conditions including, but not limited to, establishing building setback lines
and lot sizes for a special exception use, if, in the Board’s judgment,
additional requirements or conditions are necessary for the protection of the
public health, safety, comfort and convenience.

   (A)   Title. These regulations shall officially be known, cited and referred
to as the “Wireless Telecommunication Facility Regulations of Putnam County”
(hereinafter “these regulations”).
   (B)   Purposes. In order to protect the public health, safety and general

and siting standards;
      (3)   Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas through
performance standards and incentives;
      (4)   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through structural standards and setback requirements; and
      (5)   Provide mechanisms for the mitigation of tower proliferation
through tower sharing requirements for all new tower applicants and those
existing towers that are physically capable of sharing.

provided by law.
      (2)   No wireless communications facility may be constructed within the
jurisdiction without an approved and signed permit from the Planning Department
after approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (E)   Enactment. In order that wireless communications facilities may be
constructed in accordance to these purposes and policies, these regulations
shall be in full force and in effect in the manner provided by law. All
applications for wireless communication facility sitings pending on the
effective date of these regulations shall be reviewed under these regulations.
   (F)   Interpretation, conflict and separability.
      (1)   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of these regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements
for the protection of public health, safety and general welfare. These
regulations shall be construed broadly to promote the purposes for which they
are adopted.
      (2)   Conflict. These regulations are not intended to interfere with,
abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other
provision of law except as provided in these regulations. Where any provision
of these regulations imposes restrictions different from any other ordinance,
rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law, the provision, which is
more restrictive or imposes higher standards shall control.
      (3)   Separability. If any part or provision of these regulations or the
application of these regulations to any service provider or circumstances is
adjudged invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, the judgement shall be
confined in its operation to the part, provision or application directly
involved in the controversy in which the judgement shall be rendered and it
shall not affect or impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations
or the application of them to other service providers or circumstances. The
County Board of Zoning Appeals hereby declares that it would have enacted the
remainder of these regulations even without any such part, provision or
application, which is judged to be invalid.

proposed transmissions and indicates all potential interference problems.
      (3)   Before the introduction of new service or changes in existing
service, telecommunication providers shall notify the Planning Department at
least ten calendar days in advance of such changes to allow time to monitor
interference levels during the testing process. (All new sites/structures are
encouraged to show a good faith effort by providing local public safety telecom
location at the 100-foot mark at a minimal cost.)
   (I)   Abandoned or unused portions of towers. Abandoned or unused towers or
portions of towers shall be removed as follows:
      (1)   The owner of a wireless facility shall annually (in January) file a
declaration with the Planning Department as to the continuing operation of
every wireless carrier installed on the facility subject to these regulations.
Each carrier shall be illustrated by its height on the facility; and
      (2)   Failure to do so shall be determined to mean the facility is no
longer in use and considered abandoned, thus subject to the following.
         (a)   All abandoned or unused towers and associated facilities shall
be removed within 180 days of the cessation of operations at the site unless
the Planning Department approves a time extension via the Board of Zoning
Appeals approval. A copy of the relevant portions of a signed lease which
requires the applicant to remove the tower and associated facilities upon
cessation of operations at the site shall be submitted at the time of
application. If the applicant does not remove the facility, then it is the
responsibility of the property owner.
         (b)   Unused portions of towers above a manufactured connection shall
be removed within 180 days of the time of antenna relocation. The replacement
of portions of a tower previously removed requires the issuance of a new

STANDARDS.
   (A)   Zoning district description.
      (1)   Agricultural Protection District (A1). This district is established
to protect suitable land for active agricultural production in the county.
Agricultural production is recognized as the primary economic activity in the
county, and certain lands are particularly suited to such uses because of their
size, configuration, soil, topography and location in relation to other land
uses. This district is intended to prevent the conversion of such agricultural
lands to urban uses and to promote the compatibility of land uses in the
county.
      (2)   Agriculture District (A2). This district is established to permit
the full range of agricultural activities as well as certain planned large lot
residential development with development standards, which protect the full
range of agricultural uses as determined by the Plan Commission, and other uses
customarily conducted in agricultural areas. This use is primarily located
along highways and scenic corridors, and adjacent to municipalities.
      (3)   Low Density Residential District (R1). The purpose of this district
is to provide areas of low density, suburban type residential development with
particular emphasis on promoting residential subdivision development.
      (4)   Medium Density Residential District (R2). The purpose of this
district is to provide areas of moderate density, suburban residential
development with particular emphasis on promoting residential subdivision
development.
      (5)   Commercial Convenience District (CC). Businesses in the CC District
cater to and are located close to residential districts and are development in
a manner that reflects the residential character of the area. These businesses
must not create excessive congestion, noise or other objectionable influences.
Businesses located in this district tend to serve the day-to-day needs of the
neighborhoods in which they are located.
      (6)   Commercial General District (CG). Businesses located in the CG
District require locations on or near major arterials and their intersections.
CG businesses serve the day-to-day needs of the neighborhood, and supply the
more permanent and durable needs of the whole community.
      (7)   Industrial District (I). Uses located in this district encompass
light and heavy industrial activities. Heavy industrial activities are
generally major operation and extensive in character, and require large sites,
open storage and service areas, quick access to regional transportation, and
generate nuisances such as smoke, noise, vibrations, dust, glare, air pollution
and water pollution. Heavy industrial uses should be located away from
residential and commercial uses. Light industrial uses are relatively clean,
quiet, and free of smoke, noise, color or dust.
      (8)   Mineral Extraction District (ME). The purpose of this district is
to provide land for the mining, excavation, processing and storing of mineral
resources. This district is designed to ensure that these resources are
properly managed and that all land which mineral extraction has occurred will
be left in such conditions, so as to not create a hazard or nuisance which
either immediately or in the future affects the health, safety or general
welfare of the community.
      (9)   Preservation District (PV). The purpose of this district is to
retain and promote open space, historic and scenic views, the surroundings of
culturally significant buildings or structures, and ecologically significant
land adjacent to rivers. The Preservation District will also minimize soil
erosion, siltation and water pollution.
   (B)   Wireless facility sitting standards; zoning.

      (1)   Violations. If any new construction, structural changes, alteration

location permit, such action violates this section by the person performing the
construction or work and the person owning the real estate.
      (2)   Common nuisance. Any building which shall be erected, raised or

provision of this chapter or of any regulations made by the Commission, shall
be deemed to be a common nuisance and the owner of the building, land or
premises shall be liable for maintaining a public nuisance.
      (3)   Penalties for violation. The procedures for the enforcement of this
chapter are as follows.
         (a)   Actions for injunction for violations of this chapter shall be
instituted by the Commission to restrain individuals or governmental units from
violating the provisions of this chapter as enacted pursuant to I.C. 36-7-4 as
amended, except that such actions may also be instituted by the county.
         (b)   The Plan Director shall be the designated enforcement officer
and shall act for the Commission and shall not be personally liable for his or
her official acts.
         (c)   The Commission as relator or otherwise, may institute suits for
mandatory injunctions directing individuals or governmental units to remove
structures erected in violation of the provisions of this chapter. If the
Commission shall be successful in any such suit, the respondent shall bear the
cost of the action.
      (4)   Fines.
         (a)   General procedure. There shall be a minimum of a three step
procedure for the enforcement of violations. Intermediate steps, including
additional notices of violation and extensions of time limits for compliance
may be used by the Plan Director at his or her discretion. The minimum steps
are as follow.
            1.   Notice of violation. The Plan Director shall issue a notice of
violation to the person(s) who has committed, in whole or in part, a violation.
Said notice is a warning to violator(s) that a violation has been determined
and that it must be corrected within a specified time period.
            2.   Notice of fines for violation. The Plan Director shall issue a
notice of fines for violation to the person(s) who has committed; in whole or
in part, a violation. The notice of fines for violations is a citation that
states the fines for the violation. The notice of fines for violation shall be
mailed via certified mail, return receipt requested. The person(s) in violation
will be given a time period to pay all applicable fines, and must correct the
violation within the time period specified by the Plan Director or face
additional fines.
            3.   Legal action. If the person(s) in violation refuses to pay the
fines or correct the violation, the Plan Director may refer the violation to
the Plan Commission Attorney in order to pursue Court action. Additional fines
and liens against the property may also be pursued until the matter is
resolved.
         (b)   Monetary fines. Monetary fines may be imposed, in addition to
the fees specified in §
155.068, at the discretion of the Plan Director with the notice of fines for
violations.
            1.   Multiple violations. Each violation shall constitute a
separate offense.
            2.   Fine amount. Each separate offense shall be subject to a fine
from $1,000 to $2,500 per day from the day of compliance requested by the Plan
Director in the notice of violation.
               a.   In addition to any fine imposed, any person who initiates
any activity which requires a permit without first obtaining a permit may be
required to pay three times the normal amount of the permit consistent with the
adopted fee schedule.
               b.   The amount of the fine shall be at the discretion of the
Plan Director.
            3.   Payment. The payment of any violation shall be by cash or
cashier’s check and shall be delivered to the Plan Director who shall forward
same to the County Auditor for deposit.
               a.   Fine payments will not be accepted for a violation on a
property on which other violations remain unresolved.
               b.   The Plan Director may, at his or her discretion, waive
fines for the otherwise timely correction of the violation.
         (c)   Appeals. Any person receiving a notice of violation and/or fines
for violation may appeal the violation and/or fine to a court of jurisdiction.
A written statement from the person in violation, giving notice of the filing
of an action with a court, shall be submitted to the Plan Director via
certified mail at least three days prior to the date any fine and/or compliance
is due.
            1.   Fines. Fines due will be postponed until the court of
jurisdiction have made a ruling as to the violation and/or fine. The person(s)
in violation shall have a maximum of 90 days to complete the hearing process.
Failure to meet this deadline will reinstate all fines due by the person(s) in
violation, including those which would have accumulated during the appeal
process.
            2.   Additional notices. No additional notices will be issued by
the County Planner if the person(s) in violation has (have) submitted an appeal
or notice of court review.
         (d)   Enforcement. The County Planner via the Plan Commission Attorney
may bring an action in the Putnam Circuit of Superior Court to evoke any legal,
equitable or special remedy, for the enforcement of any ordinance or regulation
created under I.C. 36-7-4, and its subsequent amendments.
      (5)   Amendments. All amendments to this chapter shall conform to
relevant provisions of I.C. 36-7-4-600 et seq. and all acts amendatory thereto.
      (6)   Validity. If any title, article, section, clause, paragraph,
provision or portion of this chapter shall be held to be invalid or
unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall
not affect any other title, article, section, clause, paragraph, provision or
portion of this chapter.
