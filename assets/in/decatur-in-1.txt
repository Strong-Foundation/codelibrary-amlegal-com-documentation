(Prior Code, § 34.40) (Ord. 1988-10, passed 5-17-1988) (Amended 7-29-2008)
§ 33.002 WARRANTS DRAWN ON CITY TREASURY.
   Pursuant to I.C. 36-1-3-5 (Home Rule Legislative Authority), the Common
Council does hereby authorize the Mayor, as the Fiscal Officer of the city, to
draw warrants on the city treasury for miscellaneous city expenditures not made
under the discretion of a department and not specifically fixed by statute.
(Prior Code, § 34.20) (Ord. 1984-9, passed 8-21-1984)
§ 33.003 EMPLOYEE CREDIT CARDS.
   (A)   The City Clerk-Treasurer, as the financial officer of the city, is
authorized to establish a credit card account in the name of the City of
Decatur, Indiana with a financial institution under terms and conditions deemed
acceptable by the city Clerk-Treasurer.
   (B)   Individual account credit cards may be issued to employees of the
following city departments:
      (1)   City of Decatur Fire Department;
      (2)   City of Decatur Police Department;
      (3)   City of Decatur Utilities Department;
      (4)   City of Decatur Mayor's Department;
      (5)   City of Decatur Building/Planning Department; and
      (6)   City of Decatur Public Works Department.
      (7)   No more than four individual account credit cards may be issued to
employees within each department.
   (C)   Issuance of an individual account credit card to a department employee
shall not be permitted unless and until such employee executes a credit card
use agreement on file in the city Clerk-Treasurer's office. Such agreement
identifies that use of an account credit card shall be limited to business
purposes authorized by the city. Such agreement further exposes the employee to
personal liability for misuse of an account credit card issued to such employee
and establishes city remedies in the event of misuse. Under such agreement,
unauthorized use or misuse of an account credit card by an employee shall
result in such employee being held personally liable for such charges,
ancillary charges related thereto such as interest and penalties, and any costs
of enforcement and collection, including but not limited to reasonable attorney
fees. In the agreement, the city reserves the right to unilaterally revoke the
employee's use of the city's line of credit at any time upon delivery to the
employee of written notice of revocation signed by the city Clerk-Treasurer. In
the event an employee's use of an account credit card is so revoked or in the
event the employee's employment with the city, Indiana is terminated for any
reason, such account credit card issued to such employee shall be immediately
surrendered to the city Clerk-Treasurer's office. Upon delivery of revocation
or termination of employment, such employee shall be prohibited from further
use of the city's line of credit.
   (D)   An employee who is issued an account credit card may use such card for
permitted business travel expenses identified in the city's Employee Handbook
regarding meetings, conferences and conventions, regarding mileage, parking and
tolls, regarding meals, regarding lodging and regarding airfare. In addition,
use of an account credit card may be made by an employee for additional,
limited on-line business purchases if pre-approved by the city Clerk-Treasurer.
   (E)   A claim filed by an employee with the Common Council of the city in
connection with use of an account credit card must be itemized as provided in
I.C. 5-11-10 and timely submitted for Common Council consideration, approval
and payment by the city. If a claim is not itemized or properly documented by
an employee and is rejected or denied by the Common Council, the employee shall
be personally responsible for payment of the claim until such time as the claim
is resubmitted with proper itemization or documentation. If any interest or
penalty is incurred due to a claim being rejected or denied because the claim
is inadequately itemized or due to late filing for timely consideration by the
Common Council to avoid interest or late charges being assessed to the city
under its agreement with a financial institution, the employee shall be
personally liable for any such interest or penalty charged to the city arising
from such employee's use of the city's line of credit.
   (F)   In addition to any remedies available to the city under the credit
card use agreement in the event of unauthorized use or misuse of an account
credit card by an employee, such employee may be subject to disciplinary action
pursuant to the city's Employee Handbook.
   (G)   The city Clerk-Treasurer is authorized to seek an account line of
credit of up to $50,000 with the financial institution selected by the city
Clerk-Treasurer. Each individual credit card issued to an employee as an
authorized city card holder shall have an individual number assigned to such
employee and shall have a maximum limit of $2,000 against said line of credit.
Upon recommendation by the city Clerk-Treasurer and consent of the financial
institution, the maximum line of credit or the limit per card, as herein
established, may be adjusted from time to time by a resolution of the Common
Council.
   (H)   Credit card use agreement. The credit card use agreement on file in
the city Clerk-Treasurer's office, which must be executed by an employee before
an account credit card may be issued to such employee and before such employee
is authorized to charge permitted expenses against the city's line of credit,
is attached to Ord. 2018-8 as Exhibit "A." The city Clerk-Treasurer shall have
the right to amend or modify such agreement from time to time as may be
necessary or appropriate, subject to approval of the Common Council of the city
by resolution. In the event such agreement is amended or modified, each
employee who has been issued an account credit card shall be obligated to sign
the amended or modified agreement in order to continue to have the right to use
the account credit card issued to him or her.
(Prior Code, § 34.50) (Ord. 2004-18, passed 11-16-2004; Ord. passed 2-7-2010;

regular or special meeting following the preapproved payment of the expense.
(Ord. 2013-5, passed 7-1-2013)

   (A)   This section is to clarify and establish an uniform video franchise
fee to be paid by all current and future holders of video franchise
certificates issued by the Indiana Utilities Regulatory Commission which
authorize providing video services within the city.
   (B)   A 3% video franchise fee shall be paid, in the manner and as
determined pursuant to I.C. 8-1-34, to the city by a holder of a franchise
certificate issued by the Indiana Utilities Regulatory Commission which
authorizes the holder to provide video services to customers within the city
limits.
   (C)   Nothing shall be construed to relieve holders of franchise
certificates issued by the Indiana Utilities Regulatory Commission from paying
a 3% franchise fee to the city for quarterly periods such holders provided
video services within the city prior to the effective date of this section, as
such holders were obligated to pay a 3% fee prior to this section by virtue of

building which benefits from such services shall be billed on a combined
statement, hereinafter referred to as the utility bill, which statement shall
contain a breakdown of charges for each service and which statement shall
contain a payment due date. The utility bill shall be invoiced to the owner at
the billing address shown on the Adams County, Indiana property tax card,

lot, parcel of real estate, or building which benefits from utility or other
included city services identified on the utility bill shall be liable to the
city for such invoiced services, regardless of whether the property is occupied
by the owner. The city, at the city's discretion, may allow such services to be
billed to an occupant at the owner's and occupant's request, which requests
shall be made on forms approved by the Board of Public Works and Safety and
which forms shall be available through the city. Provided, however, in such
case, the owner and occupant of a property shall remain jointly and severally
liable to the city for any unpaid utility bills billed to an occupant,
notwithstanding any lease or contract terms to the contrary. In the event
payment of an invoice is not received in full before discontinuance or
disconnection of a city service to a property, or in the event a request is
made to transfer services to a successor owner, services shall not be restored
to said property or transferred until such time as payment of all outstanding
invoiced amounts, including reconnect fees, if any, have been paid in full.
Liability shall follow the property, shall remain the liability of the current
owner and shall become the joint and several liability of any successor owner
if unpaid utility bills are not paid by the prior owner at the time record
ownership is transferred to a successor owner. In addition, the city reserves
the right to refuse to provide city services to a lot, parcel of real estate or
building owned, in part or outright, or occupied by a person or legal entity
which owes the city for city services provided to such person or legal entity
at a different lot, parcel of real estate or building until such time as all
outstanding amounts due to the city for such services are paid in full.
(Ord. 2018-15, passed 8-7-2018)
§ 50.41 NOTICE AND REMEDY IN EVENT OF NON-PAYMENT.

parcel of real estate, or building, as shown on the utility bill, remain unpaid
for more than 30 days from the original due date, a shut off notice of service
and discontinuance of services shall be posted at the lot, parcel of real
estate, or building. Failure on the part of the owner or occupant to pay in
full unpaid utility bills, including late fees, within ten days of the date of
such notice shall result in the shut off of water service and discontinuance of
other services to said lot, parcel of real estate, or building, regardless of
occupancy. Such services shall not be restored to such lot, parcel of real
estate, or building until such time as all outstanding amounts invoiced for
services to such lot, parcel of real estate, or building, including reconnect
fees, have been paid in full. The remedy for non-payment of a utility bill as

(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.008 STORM WATER USER'S FEES ESTABLISHED.
   (A)   There shall be imposed on each and every developed property in the
city, except exempt property, a storm water user's fee, which shall be set from
time to time by ordinance or resolution, and in the manner and amount
prescribed by this chapter.
   (B)   Prior to establishing or amending user's fees, the municipality shall

(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.010 PROPERTY CLASSIFICATION FOR STORM WATER USER'S FEE.
   (A)   Property classifications. For purposes of determining the storm water
user's fee, all properties in the city are classified into one of the following
classes:
      (1)   Single-family residential property;
      (2)   Other developed property; or
      (3)   Exempt property.
   (B)   Single-family residential fee. The municipality's Common Council finds
that the intensity of development of most parcels of real property in the
municipality classified as single-family residential is similar and that it
would be excessively and unnecessarily expensive to determine precisely the
square footage of the improvements (such as buildings, structures and other
impervious areas) on each such parcel. Therefore, all single-family residential
properties in the city shall be charged a flat storm water management fee,
equal the base rate, regardless of the size of the parcel or the improvements.
   (C)   Other developed property fee.
      (1)   The fee for other developed property (i.e., non-single-family
residential property) in the municipality shall be the base rate multiplied by
the numerical factor obtained by dividing the total impervious area (square
feet) of the property by one ERU. The impervious surface area for other
developed property is the square footage for the buildings and other
improvements on the property.
      (2)   The minimum storm water management fee for other developed property
shall equal the base rate for single-family residential property.
   (D)   Exempt property. There shall be no storm water user's fee for exempt
property.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.011 BASE RATE.
   The municipality's Common Council shall, by ordinance or resolution,
establish the base rate for the storm water user's fee. The base rate shall be
calculated to ensure adequate revenues to fund the costs of storm water
management and to provide for the operation, maintenance and capital
improvements of the storm water system in the city.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.012 ADJUSTMENTS TO STORM WATER USER'S FEES.
   The Department of Storm Water Management shall have the right on its own
initiative to adjust upward or downward the storm water user's fees with
respect to any property, based on the approximate percentage on any significant
variation in the volume or rate of storm water, or any significant variation in
the quality of storm water, emanating from the property, compared to other
similar properties. In making determinations of the similarity of property, the
Department of Storm Water Management shall take into consideration the
location, geography, size, use, impervious area, storm water facilities on the
property and any other factors that have a bearing on the variation.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.013 LIABILITY FOR CHARGES.
   The procedures, rates and charges for the use of and the service rendered by
the city's Storm Water Management Department established in this chapter, and
liability therefore, shall be the responsibility of the owner of each and every
non-exempt lot, parcel of real estate, or building, regardless of occupancy. If
the city permits utility bills to be invoiced to an occupant, liability for
payment shall be the joint and several liability of the occupant and owner. In
addition, it shall be the owner's responsibility to verify payments are timely
made by an occupant. Failure on the part of the owner to pay or cause payment
for such services and other city services included on the utility bill
referenced in §

this chapter as well as that set forth in §§
50.40 and
50.41.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.014 BILLING PROCEDURES AND PENALTIES FOR LATE PAYMENT.
   (A)   Rate and collection schedule. The storm water user's fee must be set
at a rate, and collected on a schedule, established by ordinance or resolution.
   (B)   Delinquent bills. The storm water user's fee shall be paid in person
or by mail at Decatur city hall, 172 N. 2nd Street, Decatur, IN 46733 and shall
become delinquent as of 17 days following the billing date. Any unpaid storm
water user's fee shall bear interest at the legal rate if it remains unpaid
after the due date.
   (C)   Penalties for late payment. Storm water user's fees shall be subject
to a late fee established by ordinance or resolution. The municipality shall be
entitled to recover attorney's fees incurred in collecting delinquent drainage
fees. Any charge due under this chapter which shall not be paid may be
recovered at law by the municipality.

§ 52.015 APPEALS OF FEES.
   (A)   Generally. Any person who disagrees with the calculation of the storm
water user's fee, as provided in this chapter, or who seeks a storm water
user's fee adjustment based upon storm water management practices, may appeal
such fee determination to the Department of Storm Water Management within 30
days from the date of the last bill containing storm water user's fees charges.
Any appeal shall be filed in writing and shall state the grounds for the
appeal. The Department of Storm Water Management Director may request
additional information from the appealing party.
   (B)   Adjustments. Storm water user's fee adjustments for storm water
management practices may be considered for: reductions in runoff volume
including discharge to a non-city drainage system; and properly designed
constructed and maintained existing retention facilities (i.e., evaporation and
recharge). Based upon the information provided by the utility and the appealing
party, the Department of Storm Water Management shall make a final calculation
of the storm water drainage fee. The Department of Storm Water Management shall
notify the parties, in writing, of its decision.

§ 52.107 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm
water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof
of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the
Department prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.108 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have storm
water discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
   (B)   Access to facilities.
      (1)   The Department shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities
subject to regulation under this subchapter as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this subchapter. If a discharger has security
measures in force, which require proper identification and clearance before
entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements
to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the Department ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
      (3)   The Department shall have the right to set up on any permitted
facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized
enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's
storm water discharge.
      (4)   The Department has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the Department and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Department access to a
permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this
subchapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to
discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if
the person denies the Department reasonable access to the permitted facility
for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this
subchapter.
      (7)   If the Department has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which storm water is discharged, and he or she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
subchapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
subchapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Department may seek a
court order to access the premises.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.109 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS BY
THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The Department will establish requirements identifying best management
practices for any activity, operation or facility which may cause or contribute
to pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system or waters
of the United States. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial
establishment shall provide, at his, her or their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural
and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions
of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated
with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance
with the provisions of this subchapter. These BMPs shall be part of a storm
water pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with
requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.110 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.111 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system or water of the United
States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the Department in
person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the Department within three business days of the phone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall
also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three
years.

(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.203 RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMINISTRATION.
   The Department shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of
this subchapter.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.204 SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   The provisions of this subchapter are hereby declared to be severable.
   (B)   If any provision, clause, sentence or division of this chapter or the
application thereof to any person, establishment or circumstances shall be held
invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the other provisions or application
of this chapter.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.205 ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY.
   The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this chapter are
minimum standards; therefore, this subchapter does not intend, nor imply, that
compliance by any person will ensure that there will not be a violation of any
state or federal permits.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.206 POLICY ON STORM WATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that most streams and drainage channels serving the
City of Decatur do not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey storm
water runoff resulting from continued urbanization.  Accordingly, the storage
and controlled release of excess storm water runoff as well as compensation for
loss of floodplain storage shall be required for all developments and
redevelopments located within the City of Decatur. Release rate requirements,
downstream restriction considerations, acceptable outlet, adjoining property
impact considerations, policy on dams and levees, policy on fluvial erosion
hazard corridors, and compensatory floodplain storage rates are detailed in the
City of Decatur Storm Water Technical Standards.
   (B)   Due to unknowns regarding the future development patterns and the
associated proposed storm water quantity management systems within a watershed,
it is the policy of the Department to discourage direct release of runoff from
a new development or redevelopment without providing detention. However, in
rare circumstances, where a comprehensive watershed-wide hydrologic study or
watershed plan of a major stream (not a "beat the peak" analysis) adopted by
the Department substantiates the benefits of (or allows for) direct release for
a proposed development located adjacent to a major stream, the detention
requirements set in this chapter may be waived. Other special circumstances
when such a waiver may be considered by Department include situations where the
design of a regional pond has already taken into account the provision of
direct release in certain areas in the watershed.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.207 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of all

conveyance systems, structures and appurtenances, located outside of the right-
of-way shall be placed within a drainage easement. There shall be no trees or
shrubs planted, nor any structures or fences erected in any drainage easement,
unless otherwise accepted by the Department. Additional easement requirements
along storm water conveyance systems are contained in the City of Decatur Storm
Water Technical Standards Manual. All drainage improvements performed relative
to the conveyance of storm water runoff and the perpetual maintenance thereof,
within the latter easements, shall be the responsibility of the owner or
homeowner association.
   (B)   Any outlet to, crossing, and/or encroachment of a county regulated
drainage easement requires application and acceptance from the County Drainage
Board in accordance with the Indiana Drainage Code.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.209 PLACEMENT OF UTILITIES.
   No utility company may disturb existing storm drainage facilities without

§ 52.306 POLICY ON STORM WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION.
   (A)   Effective storm water pollution prevention on construction sites is
dependent on a combination of preventing movement of soil from its original
position (erosion control), intercepting displaced soil prior to entering a
waterbody (sediment control), and proper on-site materials handling.
   (B)   For land disturbance of one acre or more, the developer must submit to
the Department a SWPPP with detailed erosion and sediment control plans as well
as a narrative describing materials handling and storage, and construction
sequencing. The SWPPP and the project management log must be retained for at
least three years from the date the project permit is terminated. For land
disturbances totaling 10,000 square feet or more but less than one acre,
appropriate erosion and sediment control measures that are consistent with the
City of Decatur Storm Water Technical Standards Manual must be designed and
shown on the plans.
   (C)   The required IDEM general and implementation requirements that apply
to all land-disturbing activities are contained in the City of Decatur Storm
Water Technical Standards Manual.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.307 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   In calculating the total area of land disturbance, for the purposes of
determining applicability of this subchapter to a project, the following
guidelines should be used:
   (A)   Off-site construction activities that provide services (for example,
road extensions, sewer, water, offsite stockpiles, and other utilities) to a
land disturbing project site must be considered as a part of the total land
disturbance calculation for the project site when the activity is under the
control of the project site owner.
   (B)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by this
subchapter, the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the
total area of land disturbance for improvements, such as, roads, utilities, or
common areas, and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as
determined by the following:
      (1)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
one-half acre or more, one-half acre of land disturbance must be used as the
expected lot disturbance.
      (2)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
less than one-half acre in size, the total lot must be calculated as being
disturbed.
      (3)   To calculate lot disturbance on all other types of project sites,
such as industrial and commercial projects project sites, a minimum of one acre
of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance, unless the
lots are less than one acre in size, in which case the total lot must be
calculated as being disturbed.
   (C)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all storm water pollution prevention measures for construction sites shall meet
the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the Indiana
Storm Water Quality Manual, the City of Decatur Storm Water Technical Standards
Manual, and the product guidance/specifications of the manufacturer. The
methods and procedures included in these two references are in keeping with the
above stated policy and meet the requirements of the IDEM's CSGP. A copy of the
Indiana Storm Water Quality Manual may be obtained online through IDEM.
   (D)   The design requirements that would apply to all land-disturbing
activities and shall be considered in the selection, design, and implementation
of all storm water quality and management measures contained in the SWPPP are
contained in the City of Decatur Storm Water Technical Standards Manual.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.308 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING, AND REPORTING.
   (A)   Following approval of the storm water management permit or individual
lot plot plan permit by the Department and commencement of construction
activities, the Department has the authority to conduct inspections of the site
to ensure full compliance with the provisions of this subchapter, the approved
storm water pollution prevention plan, the Indiana Storm Water Quality Manual,
and the terms and conditions of the approved permit.
   (B)   A self-monitoring program (SMP) must be implemented by the project
site owner to ensure the storm water pollution prevention plan is working
effectively. A trained individual, acceptable to the Department, shall monitor

   (A)   In addition to the requirements noted in §§
52.300 through
52.308, the storm water pollution prevention plan, which is to be submitted to
the Department as part of the storm water management permit application, must
also include post-construction storm water quality measures. These measures are
incorporated as a permanent feature into the site plan and are left in place
following completion of construction activities to continuously treat storm
water runoff from the stabilized site. Any project located within the corporate
boundaries of the City of Decatur that includes clearing, grading, excavation,
and other land disturbing activities, resulting in the disturbance of one acre
or more of total land area is subject to the requirements of this subchapter.
This includes both new development and re-development, and disturbances of land
less than one acre of total land area that are part of a larger common plan of
development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb one acre
or more of total land area. In addition, regardless of the amount of
disturbance, the Department reserves the right to require pre-treatment BMPs
for proposed hot spot developments in accordance with provisions contained in
the City of Decatur Storm Water Technical Standards Manual.
   (B)   The requirements under this subchapter do not apply to construction
activities associated with a single-family residential dwelling disturbing less
than one acre, when the dwelling is not part of a larger common plan of
development or sale; or individual building lots within a larger permitted
project.

activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 I.A.C. 10;
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34; and
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under
329 I.A.C. 10 that contains equivalent storm water requirements, including the
expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or
outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
   (D)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
storm water permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan
is completed and submitted to the Department in accordance with §§
52.500 through
52.515. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure
proper construction and installation of all storm water BMPs (especially the
protection of post-storm water BMPs during construction phase) in compliance
with this chapter and with the approved storm water management permit, and to
notify the Department upon completion of the project and stabilization of the
site, requesting a termination inspection to be performed by the Department.
However, all eventual property owners of storm water quality facilities meeting
the applicability requirements must comply with the requirements of this
chapter.

   (B)   If any provision, clause, sentence or division of this chapter or the
application thereof to any person, establishment or circumstances shall be held
invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the other provisions or application
of this chapter.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.405 ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY.
   The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this chapter are
minimum standards; therefore, this subchapter does not intend, nor imply, that
compliance by any person will ensure that there will not be a violation of any
state or federal permits.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.406 POLICY ON STORM WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to undeveloped
areas, generally have increased imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates,
increased runoff rates, and increased concentrations of pollutants such as
fertilizers, herbicides, greases, oil, salts and other pollutants. As new
development and re-development continues within the corporate boundaries of the
City of Decatur, measures must be taken to intercept and filter pollutants from
storm water runoff prior to reaching regional creeks, streams, and rivers.
Through the use of appropriate best management practices (BMPs) to treat the
water quality volume (WQv) or the water quality flow (Qwq), storm water runoff
will be filtered and harmful amounts of sediment, nutrients, and contaminants
will be removed.
   (B)   It is also recognized that another major source of pollution in many
Indiana streams, including those within the corporate boundaries of the City of
Decatur, is the streambank erosion associated with urbanizing watersheds.
Stream channels develop their shape in response to the volume and rate of
runoff that they receive from their contributing watersheds. Research has shown
that in hydrologically stable watersheds, the stream flow responsible for most
of the shaping of the channel (called the bankfull flow) occurs between every
one to two years. When land is developed, the volume and rate of runoff from
that land increases for these comparatively small flooding events that are not
normally addressed by the detention practices and the stream channel will adapt
by changing its shape. As the stream channel works to reach a new stable shape,
excess erosion occurs. As new development and re-development continues within
the corporate boundaries of the City of Decatur, measures must be taken to
minimize the impact of such development or re-development on streambank
erosion. Through the use of appropriate best management practices (BMPs) to
retain and/or detain and slowly release the channel protection volume (CPv),
the volume and rate of runoff for channel forming flows will be reduced in an
attempt to minimize increased streambank erosion in the receiving streams and
channels.
   (C)   The project site owner must submit to the Department a storm water
pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) that shows placement of appropriate BMP(s)
from a pre-approved list of BMPs specified in the City of Decatur Storm Water
Technical Standards Manual. The SWPPP submittal shall include an operation and
maintenance manual for all post-construction BMP(s) included in the project and
a notarized maintenance agreement, consistent with the sample agreement
provided in the City of Decatur Storm Water Technical Standards Manual,
providing for the long-term maintenance of those BMPs, both of which shall be
recorded with the deed for the property on which the project is located. The
noted BMP(s) must be designed, constructed, and maintained according to
guidelines provided or referenced in the City of Decatur Storm Water Technical
Standards Manual. Practices other than those specified in the pre-approved list
may be utilized. However, the burden of proof, as to whether the performance
and ease of maintenance of such practices will be according to guidelines
provided in the City of Decatur Storm Water Technical Standards Manual, would
be placed with the applicant. Details regarding the procedures and criteria for
consideration of acceptance of such BMPs are provided in the City of Decatur
Storm Water Technical Standards Manual.
   (D)   Gasoline outlets and refueling areas must install appropriate
practices (as noted under "Hot Spots” provision in the Technical Standards) to
reduce lead, copper, zinc, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in storm water runoff.
These requirements will apply to all new facilities and existing facilities
that replace their tanks, regardless of the size of the facility.
   (E)   Discharges from new development and redevelopment sites will not be
allowed directly into karst features without pre-treatment.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.407 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   Calculation of land disturbance should follow the guidelines discussed
in §
52.307.
   (B)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all storm water quality management measures, or BMPs shall meet the design
criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the City of Decatur Storm
Water Technical Standards Manual. The methods and procedures included in the
referenced standards is in keeping with the above stated policy and meet or
exceed the requirements of IDEM's MS4 GP.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.408 EASEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   All storm water quality management systems, including detention or retention
basins, filter strips, pocket wetlands, in-line filters, infiltration systems,
conveyance systems, structures and appurtenances located outside of the right-
of-way shall be incorporated into permanent easements. For the purposes of
monitoring, inspection, and general maintenance activities, adequate easement
width, as detailed in the City of Decatur Storm Water Technical Standards
Manual, beyond the actual footprint of the storm water quality management
facility as well as a 20-foot wide access easement from a public right-of-way

   (C)   Pursuant to I.C. 13-18-27, an MS4-designated entity or other review
authority such as SWCD (if applicable) must make a preliminary determination as
to whether the construction plan associated with the SWPPP is substantially
complete before the end of the tenth working day (for sites with less than five
acres of land disturbance) after the day on which the SWPPP is submitted to the
review authority or the fourteenth working day (for sites with five acres or
larger of land disturbance) after the day on which the SWPPP is submitted to
the review authority. Note these time limits only apply to the SWPPP portion of
the overall storm water permit submittal and does not affect any official or
non-official permit review timelines set by the entity for other aspects of the
storm water permit application.
   (D)   Once all comments from all reviewers have been received and review
completed, the Department will either approve the project, request
modifications, or deny the project. If the applicant does not agree with or
accept the review findings and wishes to seek an appeal, the Department will
place the project on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the
City of Decatur Board of Public Works and Safety, provided the agenda for the
meeting has not yet been advertised or published. If time for notification does
not allow, the project shall be placed on the following regularly scheduled
meeting of the City of Decatur Board of Public Works and Safety. If the project
must go through a scheduled meeting, the Department will furnish the applicant
a complete list of comments and objections to the plans and accompanying data
prior to the scheduled meeting. After the scheduled meeting, the Department
will either issue a permit, request modifications to the construction plans, or
deny the project.
   (E)   The project site owner must notify the Department and IDEM before
beginning construction. Notification to the Department shall be in the form of
an email while the notification to IDEM shall be in the form of an online IDEM
NOI submittal. Once a permit has been issued and the pending construction
notifications submitted to the Department and IDEM before the beginning of
construction, construction may commence 48 hours after the NOI is submitted to
IDEM. Once construction starts, the project owner shall monitor construction
activities and inspect all storm water pollution prevention measures in
compliance with this chapter and the terms and conditions of the approved
permit. Upon completion of construction activities, a certification of
completion and compliance and as-built plans must be submitted to the
Department.
   (F)   Once the construction site has been stabilized and all temporary
erosion and sediment control measures have been removed, a notification shall
be sent to the Department, requesting a termination inspection. The Department,
or its representative, shall inspect the construction site to verify that the
completed project is fully stabilized and meets the requirements of chapter and
the City of Decatur technical standards and that the terms and conditions of
the permit. Once the applicant receives a signed copy of the termination
inspection checklist confirming compliance, they must forward a copy to IDEM
along with the required IDEM NOI form. Permits issued by the Department under
this scenario will expire five years from the date of issuance. If construction
is not completed within five years, an updated permit application must be
submitted to the Department and an updated NOI must be resubmitted to IDEM at
least 90 days prior to expiration.

§ 52.512 REQUIRED ASSURANCES.
   This subchapter shall apply to all projects whether the storm water
management system or portions thereof will be dedicated to the City of Decatur
or retained privately. As a condition of approval and issuance of the permit,
the Department shall require the applicant to provide assurance in form of an
irrevocable letter of credit or a bond when the storm water management plan has
been accepted and before construction begins. Said assurance will guarantee a
good faith execution of the storm water drainage plan, the storm water
pollution prevention plan, the storm water quality management plan, and any
permit conditions. The assurance shall be for an amount equal to 125% of the
total costs of all storm water management measures for the entire project. The
above-mentioned costs shall be based on an estimate as prepared by a registered
engineer or land surveyor. Said costs shall be for the installation and ongoing
monitoring and maintenance of erosion control measures and the construction and
ongoing monitoring and maintenance of storm drainage infrastructure, detention/
retention facilities, and storm water quality BMPs, as regulated under this
chapter, until the construction is completed, the site is stabilized, and as-
built plans are accepted by the Department. Assurances shall be for a minimum
of $5,000. All other performance bonds, maintenance  bonds or other assurances
required by the Department in accordance with any and all other ordinances
shall also apply and so be required. Local governmental jurisdictions may
require additional performance and/or maintenance assurances. The intent of
this assurance is not only to complete the installation of storm drain
infrastructure for the project, but also to assure that adequate storm water
pollution prevention measures are properly installed and maintained. If
adequate assurances are set aside by the project site owner for the overall
project, proof of total assurance can be submitted in place of an individual
storm water assurance.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.513 TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PERMITS.
   (A)   In granting a storm water management permit, the Department may impose
such terms and conditions as are reasonably necessary to meet the purposes of
this chapter. The project site owner shall ensure compliance with such terms
and conditions. Non-compliance with the terms and conditions of permits will be
subject to enforcement as described in §§
52.600 through
52.609.
   (B)   The project site owner shall inform all general contractor,
construction management firms, grading or excavating contractors, utility
contractors, and the contractors that have primary oversight on individual
building lots of the terms and conditions of the storm water management permit
and the schedule for proposed implementation.
   (C)   In the event that a project site is determined to impact or discharge
to a sensitive area or is located in an impact drainage area, the Department
may require more stringent storm water quantity and quality measures than
detailed in this chapter or in the Indiana Storm Water Quality Manual.
   (D)   Determination of sensitive areas. Sensitive areas include highly
erodible soils, wetlands, karst areas, threatened or endangered species
habitat, outstanding waters, impaired waters, recreational waters, and surface
drinking water sources. Any discharge from a storm water practice that is a
Class V injection well shall meet the Indiana groundwater quality standards and
registered with US EPA as required by the IDEM. If wetlands are suspected on a
site, a wetland delineation should be completed in accordance with the
methodology established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE). The need for
the applicant to check for the presence of threatened or endangered species
habitat will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Special terms and
conditions for development determined to impact or discharge to any sensitive
area shall be included in the storm water management permit.
   (E)   Determination of impact drainage areas.
      (1)   The following areas shall be designated by default as impact
drainage areas unless good reason for not including them is presented to the
Department.
         (a)   A floodway or floodplain as designated by the most updated FEMA
Code dealing with floodplain regulation and/or by the best available data
through IDNR ;
         (b)   Land within 25 feet of each bank of any ditch within the City of
Decatur's system;
         (c)   Land within 15 feet of the centerline of any storm water
infrastructure or enclosed conduit within the City of Decatur's system;
         (d)   Land within 75 feet of each bank of a county open regulated
drain;
         (e)   Land within 50 feet of a natural drainageway;
         (f)   Land within 75 feet of the centerline of any tiled regulated
drain;
         (g)   Land within the fluvial erosion hazard (FEH) corridor; and
         (h)   Land within the expected breach inundation zone of an existing
or proposed new dam, and areas protected from flooding by a levee.
      (2)   The Department is authorized, but is not required, to classify
certain geographical areas as impact drainage areas. In determining impact
drainage areas, the Department may consider such factors as topography, soil
type, capacity of existing drains, and distance from adequate drainage
facility.
      (3)   Land that does not have an adequate outlet, taking into
consideration the capacity and depth of the outlet, may be designated as an
impact drainage area by the Department. Special terms and conditions for
development within any impact drainage area shall be included in the storm
water management permit.
   (F)   Determination of designated drainage areas served by regional
facilities. The Department is authorized, but is not required, to classify
certain geographical areas as designated drainage areas that are or will be
served by regional facilities, such as a regional pond. In such cases, an
infrastructure development fee (IDF) rate may be established for the designated
drainage area. The basis for determining such a fee for a proposed development
or re-development within a designated drainage area will be as detailed in the
City of Decatur Storm Water Technical Standards Manual.

not to exceed 25% of the cost of the storm water management system located
outside the public road rights-of-way, and in a form satisfactory to the
Department in order to assure that such storm water system installation was
done according to standards of good workmanship, that the materials used in the
construction and installation were of good quality and construction, and that
such project was done in accordance with the accepted plans and this chapter
and that any off-site drainage problems that may arise, whether upstream or
downstream of such project, will be corrected if such drainage problems are
determined by the Department to have been caused by the development of such
project. The bond or other acceptable guarantee shall be in effect for a period
of two years after the date of the release of required performance assurances
referenced in §
52.512. The beneficiary of all maintenance bonds shall be the Department.
   (B)   To verify that all storm water infrastructure is functioning properly,
visual recordings (via closed circuit television) of such infrastructure,
including all subsurface drains, shall be required twice, once following the
completion of installation of the storm water management system and submittal
of as-builts, and the second time before release of maintenance bonds. These
visual recordings will be scheduled by the Department and paid for by the
developer. Notices shall be provided to the Department within 72 hours
following the completion of installation and again at least 60 days prior to
the expiration date of the maintenance bond so that the noted recordings may be
scheduled. Reports summarizing the results of the noted visual recordings shall
be reviewed and accepted by the Department before the plat is recommended for
recording and again before the maintenance bond shall be recommended to be

Offence #       Type of Response Anticipated
First offense   Verbal telephone notice, letter of violation or written warning
                and administrative penalty
Second offense  Letter of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit
Third offense   Letter of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit

Fifth offense   Agreed order, administrative penalty and/or site visit
Sixth offense   Administrative order, administrative penalty and/or site visit

      (4)   Likewise, in order to standardize the approach that the Department
may, in its discretion, employ in the imposition of administrative penalties,
the Department has established the following schedule of administrative
penalties. Again, the penalty for the first offense would apply to the
violation itself, while  the subsequent penalties two through four (as
necessary) would apply to failures of compliance. In its discretion, the
Department may impose penalties up to the amount specified in this schedule.
 
Offence #      Penalty
First offense  $250
Second offense $500
Third offense  $1,000
Fourth offense $2,500
 
   (D)   Stop work order.
      (1)   In addition to the penalties listed above, if land disturbance
activities are conducted contrary to the provisions of this chapter or accepted
final storm water management plans, the Department may order the work stopped
by notice in writing served on any person engaged in the doing or causing of
such work to be done, and any such persons shall forthwith stop such work until
authorized by the Department to proceed with the work. A stop work order will
be posted on the site by the Department and it is unlawful for any person to
remove the notice or continue any work on the site without permission from the
Department. The Department may also undertake or cause to be undertaken, any
necessary or advisable protective measures to prevent violations of this
chapter or to avoid or reduce the effects of noncompliance herewith. The cost
of any such protective measures shall be the responsibility of the owner of the
property upon which the work is being done and the responsibility of any person
carrying out or participating in the work.
      (2)   The Department may bring an action under I.C. 34-28-5-1(b), to be
read together with I.C. 34-6-2-86(1)(B) and 13-21-3-12(4), to enforce a stop
work order against any person who neglects or fails to comply with a stop work
order.
      (3)   For construction projects that are operating under a SWPPP approved
by the Department, if a stop work order is issued on the grounds that the
erosion and sediment control measures included in the construction plan are not
adequate, the project site owner must be notified in writing of the
inadequacies in the erosion and sediment control measures and the project site
owner has 72 hours after receiving written notice to resolve the identified
inadequacies before the stop work order can take effect.
      (4)   The 72 hour period to resolve identified inadequacies on a
construction project does not apply if the stop work order is issued to a
construction project where the project site owner is creating a public health
hazard or safety hazard.
   (E)   Withhold certificate of occupancy. The Department may refuse to issue
a certificate of occupancy for the building or other improvements constructed
or being constructed on the site until the applicant or other responsible
person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or
has otherwise satisfied the requirements of this chapter as determined by the
Department.
   (F)   Suspension, revocation, or modification of permits. The Department may
suspend, revoke, or modify any existing permit that the violator may also have
been previously granted. A suspended, revoked, or modified permit may be
reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the
remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured
the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated upon
such conditions as the Department may deem necessary to enable the applicant or
other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such
violations.
   (G)   Suspension of access to the storm water drainage system; emergency
cease and desist orders.
      (1)   When the Department finds that any person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued
hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to recur, and that
the person's violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or
threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably
appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons or to the environment, the Department may issue an order to
the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations
and directing the violator to immediately comply with all chapter requirements
and take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly
address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
      (2)   Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this
subchapter shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering
discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the emergency order, the Department may commence court action
against such person under I.C. 34-28-5-1(b), to be read together with I.C. 34-
6-2-86(1)(B) and 13-21-3-12(4), to enforce a stop work order.
      (3)   The Department may allow the person to recommence its discharge
when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Department that the period
of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are
initiated against the discharger under this chapter. A person that is
responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes
of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence, to the Department within five days of receipt of the emergency
order. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator.
   (H)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The
Department may, without prior notice, suspend storm water drainage system
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons,
or to the storm water drainage system or waters of the state. If the violator
fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the Department
may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the
storm water drainage system or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to
persons.
   (I)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the storm water drainage system in violation of this chapter may
have their storm water drainage system access terminated if such termination
would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The Department will notify a
violator of the proposed termination of its storm water drainage system access.
The violator may petition the Department for a reconsideration and hearing. A
person commits an offense if the person reinstates storm water drainage system
access to premises terminated pursuant to this subchapter, without the prior
approval of the Department.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.608 COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION.
   (A)   In addition to any other remedies, should any owner fail to comply
with the provisions of this chapter, the Department may, after giving notice
and opportunity for compliance, have the necessary work done, and the owner
shall be required to promptly reimburse the Department for all costs of such
work.
   (B)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Department from taking such
other lawful action as may be necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. All
costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.
Costs include, but are not limited to, repairs to the storm water drainage
system made necessary by the violation, as well as those penalties levied by
the EPA or IDEM for violation of the City of Decatur's NPDES permit,
administrative costs, attorney fees, court costs, and other costs and expenses
associated with the enforcement of this chapter, including sampling and
monitoring expenses.
   (C)   If the amount due for abatement of the violation is not paid within a
timely manner as determined by the decision of the Department or by the
expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the Department may commence
a court action to recover the costs assessed under I.C. 34-28-5-1(b), to be
read together with I.C. 34-6-2-86(1)(B) and 13-21-3-12(4).
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 8-1-2023)
§ 52.609 APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeal of notice of violation.
      (1)   Any person to whom any provision of this chapter has been applied
may appeal in writing, not later than 30 days after the action or decision
being appealed from, to the Board of Public Works and Safety of the City of
Decatur the action or decision whereby any such provision was so applied. Such
appeal shall identify the matter being appealed, and the basis for the appeal.
The Board of Public Works and Safety of the City of Decatur shall consider the
appeal and make a decision whereby it affirms, rejects or modifies the action
being appealed. In considering any such appeal, the Board of Public Works and
Safety of the City of Decatur may consider the recommendations of the
Department staff and the comments of other persons having knowledge of the
matter. In considering any such appeal, the Board of Public Works and Safety
may grant a variance from the terms of this chapter to provide relief, in whole
or in part, from the action being appealed, but only upon finding that the
following requirements are satisfied:
         (a)   The application of the provisions of this chapter being appealed
will present or cause practical difficulties for a development or development
site; provided, however, that practical difficulties shall not include the need
for the developer to incur additional reasonable expenses in order to comply
with this chapter; and
         (b)   The granting of the relief requested will not substantially
prevent the goals and purposes of this chapter, nor result in less effective
management of storm water runoff.
      (2)   Any person who has appealed a violation to the Board of Public
Works and Safety may appeal an adverse decision of the Board to the Adams
County court within 60 days of the Boards order, all pursuant to I.C. 36-1-6-9
(e) and (f).
   (B)   Enforcement measures after appeal. If the violation has not been
corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation,
or, in the event of an appeal, within five days of the decision of the Board of
Public Works and Safety upholding the decision of the Department, then
representatives of the Department shall enter upon the subject private property
and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the
violation and/or restore the property, including the commencing of a court
action under I.C. 34-28-5-1(b),to be read together with I.C. 34-6-2-86(1)(B)
and 13-21-3-12(4), to enforce the order of the Board of Public Works and
Safety.

§ 53.003 RULES AND REGULATIONS ON FILE.
   A copy of all rates, rules and regulations, and material specifications

water service is to be provided.
(Prior Code, § 51.02)
§ 53.004 WRITTEN APPLICATION OF CONTRACT REQUIRED.
   A written application for the service or a contract properly executed will
be required from a prospective customer (including contractors and builders)
before the utility will supply service; however, the utility shall have the
right to reject an application for any valid reason. Where unusual construction
or equipment expenses will be involved in furnishing the service, the utility
may require the contract to be for an appropriate period of time specified by
the utility when the contract is executed.
(Prior Code, § 51.03)
§ 53.005 MODIFICATION OF CONTRACT.
   No promise, agreement or representation by any agent of the utility shall be

on behalf of the utility.
(Prior Code, § 51.04)
§ 53.006 ASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACT.
   The benefits and obligations under any contract for the supply of water by
the utility shall begin when the utility commences to supply water service
thereunder and shall so inure and be binding upon the successors, assigns,
survivors, executors or administrators, that no assignment thereof shall be
made by the customer or by any successor, assign, survivor, executor or
administrator, unless the utility’s written consent to any such assignment is
first obtained.
(Prior Code, § 51.05)
§ 53.007 TURNING ON WATER SERVICE.
   (A)   (1)   Until a request for water service has been executed and a meter
has been installed, water shall not be turned on at any premises by anyone but
a water utility representative.
      (2)   No person, except an authorized employee of the water utility, Fire
and Street Departments or any other authorized person, shall open, operate or
remove the nozzle cap from any fire hydrant to which water is supplied by
utility.
      (3)   When water is required to test plumbing before a water contract has
been executed and a meter installed, a water utility employee shall be called
to make the turn-on and turn-off. It is a violation of this chapter for anyone,
except a water utility employee to make such turn-on.

   (B)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge.
   (C)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the Superintendent,
using the procedures prescribed in §
54.115 of this chapter, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the
report.
(Prior Code, § 50.20(6.4))
§ 54.109 REPORTS OF CHANGED CONDITIONS.
   (A)   Each user must notify the Superintendent of any planned significant
changes to the user’s operations or system which might alter the nature,
quality or volume of its wastewater at least 90 days before the change.
   (B)   The Superintendent may require the user to submit such information as
may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §
54.069 of this chapter.
   (C)   The Superintendent may issue a wastewater discharge permit under §
54.071 of this chapter or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under
§
54.088 of this chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed
conditions.
   (D)   For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are
not limited to, flow increases of 20% or greater, and the discharge of any
previously unreported pollutants.
(Prior Code, § 50.20(6.5))
§ 54.110 REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.
   (A)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-
customary batch discharge or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for
the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the Superintendent of
the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge,
type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken
by the user.
   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the Superintendent, submit a detailed written report describing the
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, natural resources or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
discharge described in division (A) above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
(Prior Code, § 50.20(6.6))
§ 54.111 REPORTS FROM UNPERMITTED USERS.
   All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the Superintendent as the Superintendent may require.
(Prior Code, § 50.20(6.7))
§ 54.112 NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING.
   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
the Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user
shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the Superintendent within 30 days after becoming aware of
the violation. The user is not required to resample if the Superintendent
monitors at the user’s facility at least once a month, or if the Superintendent
samples between the user’s initial sampling and when the user receives the
results of this sampling.
(Prior Code, § 50.20(6.8))
§ 54.113 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Region V Waste Management Division Director and state
hazardous waste authorities (IDEM Office of Solid and Hazardous Waste), in
writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise
disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. part 261. Such
notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40
C.F.R. part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge
(continuous, batch or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of
such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain
the following information to the extent such information is known and readily
available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents
contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such
constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month and an
estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be
discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no
later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this
division (A) need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged.
However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under §
54.109 of this chapter. The notification requirement in this section does not
apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
54.105, 54.107 and 54.108 of this chapter.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A) above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of
non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires
a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges
more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Superintendent, the
EPA Region V Waste Management Waste Division Director and the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) of the discharge of such
substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder or any applicable federal or state law.
(Prior Code, § 50.20(6.9))
§ 54.114 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. part 136, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40
C.F.R. part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance
with procedures approved by EPA.
(Prior Code, § 50.20(6.10))
§ 54.115 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (A)   Except as indicated in division (B) below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In
the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the Superintendent may
authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab
samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative
sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease (O&G), temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
(Prior Code, § 50.20(6.11))
§ 54.116 TIMING.
   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
(Prior Code, § 50.20(6.12))
§ 54.117 RECORD KEEPING.
   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include
the date, exact place, method and time of sampling, and the name of the person
(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the
analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such
analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three
years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any
litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been
specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Superintendent.
(Prior Code, § 50.20(6.13))
COMPLIANCE MONITORING
§ 54.130 RIGHT OF ENTRY; INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (A)   (1)   The Superintendent shall have the right to enter the premises of
any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of
this chapter and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder.
      (2)   Users shall allow the Superintendent ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
   (B)   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Superintendent or his or her agent will be
permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific
responsibilities.
   (C)   The Superintendent or his or her agent shall have the right to set up
on the user’s property, or require installation of, such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user’s operations.
   (D)   The Superintendent may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user
at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated at a minimum of once per year to ensure their accuracy.
   (E)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the Superintendent and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
   (F)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Superintendent or his or her agent
access to the user’s premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 50.20(7.1))
§ 54.131 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the Superintendent has been refused access to a building, structure or
property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need
to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, then the Superintendent may seek issuance of a search
warrant from the County Circuit Court.
(Prior Code, § 50.20(7.2))
ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
§ 54.145 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within
30 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a
plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the
Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
Superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(Prior Code, § 50.20(9.1))
§ 54.146 AGREED ORDERS.
   The Superintendent may enter into agreed orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for non-compliance. Such documents will include specific action to
be taken by the user to correct the non-compliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §
54.999 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Prior Code, § 50.20(9.2))
§ 54.147 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   The Superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear
before the Superintendent and show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and
place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such
action and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at
least 15 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized
representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Prior Code, § 50.20(9.3))
§ 54.148 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the
user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may
be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may
contain other requirements to address the non-compliance, including additional
self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Prior Code, § 50.20(9.4))
§ 54.149 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   (A)   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or
that the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the Superintendent may
issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations
and directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   (B)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Prior Code, § 50.20(9.5))
§ 54.150 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
   (A)   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent may fine such user in an amount less than $1,000 and not to
exceed $2,500 as provided by I.C. 36-1-3-8. Such fines shall be assessed on a
per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average
discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of
violation.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after 60 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance, and interest shall
accrue thereafter at a rate of 1.8% per month. A lien against the user’s
property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines and penalties.
   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the Superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine
amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit,
the Superintendent may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user’s
appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto,
shall be returned to the user. The Superintendent may add the costs of
preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to
the fine.
   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Prior Code, § 50.20(9.6))
§ 54.151 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)   The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after
formal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after notice
and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of
the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the
environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent may
allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to
the satisfaction of the Superintendent that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings in this chapter are initiated
against the user.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Superintendent prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under §
54.999 of this chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Prior Code, § 50.20(9.7))
§ 54.152 TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.
   (A)   In addition to the provisions in §
54.090 of this chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
      (1)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§
54.030 through
54.035 of this chapter.
   (B)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under §
54.999 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of
this option by the Superintendent shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.

(Prior Code, § 50.34) (Ord. 1983-2, passed 2-15-1983)
§ 54.170 ONE OR MORE LOTS OR DWELLING UNITS SERVED BY A SINGLE METER.
   (A)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings discharging wastewater into the city’s sewage system, either directly
or indirectly, are consumers of water, and the quantity of water is measured by
a single water meter, then in such case, for billing purposes, the quantity of
water used shall be the average for each user and the minimum charge and the
sewage rates and charges shall apply to each of the number of residential lots,
parcels of real estate, or buildings served through the single water meter.
   (B)   In the event two or more dwelling units such as trailers, apartments,
or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other liquids into
the city’s sanitary sewage system either directly or indirectly, are users of
water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in
such case billing shall be for a single service in the manner set out elsewhere
herein, except that an additional charge shall be added thereto in the amount
as set forth in §
54.177 per month for each dwelling unit over one served through the single
water meter if the property of the user is situated within the corporate limits
of the city. For each dwelling unit over one served through the single water
meter, if the property of the user is situated outside the corporate limits of
the city, a surcharge shall be assessed monthly as set forth in §
54.177. In the case of trailer parks the number of dwelling units shall be
computed and interpreted as the total number of trailers located and installed
in the park plus any other dwelling units served through the meter. A dwelling
unit shall be interpreted as a room or rooms or other living space or spaces in
which cooking facilities are provided.
(Prior Code, § 50.35) (Ord. 1995-8, passed 6-30-1995; Ord. 2012-12, passed 10-

§ 54.171 PORTION OF WATER NOT ENTERING SEWAGE SYSTEM.
   (A)   In the case of a user utilizing more than 1,000 cubic feet of water
per month, who can substantiate to the city that a portion of the water does
not and cannot enter the sewerage system, the Board of Public Works and Safety
shall either determine the portion of the measured water to be used in
determining the appropriate sewer charges, or approve the manner and technique
of flow measurement provided by the user for determining wastewater discharged
to the sewerage system.
   (B)   Facilities utilized to accomplish this shall be installed and
maintained in a serviceable condition by the user at his or her expense. The
city shall have the right to access to such flow measurement equipment at all
times in order to verify the accuracy of the equipment and obtain samples.
(Prior Code, § 50.36) (Ord. 1983-2, passed 2-15-1983)
§ 54.172 SWIMMING POOL CHARGE.
   The owner of any residential swimming pool shall pay to the city in addition
to other charges provided herein, an amount set forth in §
54.177 per 100 cubic feet of water capacity of the pool per annum provided
that, if the pool is filled with water that has been measured by a water meter
that is acceptable to the city, payment shall not be applicable. Such payment
shall be billed by the city in June of each year, and shall be collected as
other sewage service charges are collected.
(Prior Code, § 50.37) (Ord. 1995-8, passed 10-3-1995; Ord. 2012-12, passed 10-

§ 54.173 SPRINKLING RATES.
   In order that the domestic and residential users of sewage service shall not
be penalized for sprinkling lawns during the months of June, July and August,
the billing for sewage service for residences or domestic users for the months
of June, July and August shall be based upon 100% of the water usage for the
previous months of December, January and February. In the event 100% of the
water usage for the previous months of December, January and February is
greater than the water usage for the months of June, July and August, then the
billing for sewage services shall be computed on the actual water used in the
month for which the sewage service bill is rendered. Domestic or residential
sewage service as applicable to the sprinkling rate shall apply to each lot,
parcel of real estate or building which is occupied and used as a residence.
The sprinkling rate shall not apply to any premises which are partially or
wholly used for commercial or industrial purposes. In the event a portion of
the premises shall be used for commercial or industrial purposes, the owner
shall have the privilege of separating the water services so that the
residential portion of the premises is served through a separate meter and in
such case the water usage as registered by the water meter serving that portion
of the premises used for residential purposes would qualify under the
sprinkling rate.
(Prior Code, § 50.38) (Ord. 1983-2, passed 2-15-1983)
§ 54.174 BILLING PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Sewer billings and invoices shall be rendered and collected
approximately monthly.
   (B)   The Board of Public Works and Safety shall make and enforce such
bylaws and regulations as may be deemed necessary for the regulation,
collection, rebating and refunding of the sewer charges prescribed by this
section of this subchapter.
   (C)   The Board may, on proper cause being shown by the applicant that in a
singular occurrence, metered water did not reach the sewerage system, adjust
the user’s sewer charge with respect to such occurrence.
   (D)   Major contributors with a flow in excess of 50,000 gallons per average
workday shall have billing determined on the basis of wastewater discharged as
monitored, with the following exception.
   (E)   At its option, the city may accept monitoring data and information
from such a major contributor to substantiate billing determination on a more
frequent basis than as established. Such allowance, however, does not exempt
the major contributor from the surveillance survey fee set by the city.
   (F)   In the event there is a difference in analytical results that is not
explainable by normal variation in the testing procedure, the user may, within
30 days of billing, appeal to the Board.

§ 54.175 LIABILITY FOR CHARGES.
   The procedures, rates and charges for the use of and the service rendered by
the city's Wastewater/Sewage Department established in

of each and every lot, parcel of real estate, or building connected to the
sewage collection system, regardless of occupancy. In the case of a commercial
property, if the city permits utility bills to be invoiced to an occupant,
liability for payment shall be the joint and several liability of the occupant
and owner. In addition, it shall be the owner's responsibility to verify
payments are timely made by an occupant. Failure on the part of the owner to
pay or cause payment for such services and other city services included on the
utility bill referenced in §
50.40 shall result in the exercise of remedies against the owner set forth in
this chapter as well as that set forth in §§
50.40 and
50.41.

users and user classes; generate sufficient revenues to pay the total operation
and maintenance costs necessary to the proper operation and maintenance,
including replacement, of the treatment works; and apply excess revenues
collected from a class of users to the costs of operation and maintenance

discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Superintendent may petition the County Circuit Court
through the city’s Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent
injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance
of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement imposed by this
chapter on activities of the user. The Superintendent may also seek such other
action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a
requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for
injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against a user.

   (B)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of

      (2)   The Superintendent may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court
costs and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the city.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(Prior Code, § 50.20(10.2))
   (C)   Remedies non-exclusive. The remedies provided for in this chapter are
not exclusive. The Superintendent may take any, all, or any combination of
these actions against a non-compliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment
violations will generally be in accordance with the city’s enforcement response
plan. However, the Superintendent may take other action against any user when
the circumstances warrant. Further, the Superintendent is empowered to take
more than one enforcement action against any non-compliant user.

   (A)   The Fire Chief, Fire Marshal, and/or designee, shall conduct fire and

or the elimination of any hazardous condition by the methods specified in this
code or by any other appropriate remedy or procedure provided by law. The
failure of the Fire Department to inspect or to issue a notice of violation or
order in accordance with this chapter shall not constitute approval of any
violation or non-compliance. Any notice of violation or order issued pursuant
to this section shall be conveyed upon the owner, operator, occupant, or the
other person responsible for the building or property. Conveyance of such order
shall be by one of the following methods: Personal service (by affixing a copy
thereof in a conspicuous place at the entrance of said building or premises),
by mailing a copy thereof to such responsible person by first-class mail to his
or her known address, by fax, or electronic mail pursuant to I.C. 4-21.5-3.
   (C)   The Fire Chief, Fire Marshal, and/or his/her designee may stop an
operation or require the evacuation of any Class 1 structure or portion thereof

injury to any person other than a trespasser;
      (2)   Is prohibited without a permit, registration, certification,

another Indiana statute or rule of the Commission; or
      (3)   Will conceal a violation of the law.
   (D)   The Fire Chief, Fire Marshal, and/or his/her designee shall state in
the notice a time in which the means prescribed by the Fire Chief, Fire
Marshal, and/or his/her designee shall be complied with.
   (E)   The first violation shall be given at the time of the inspection.
Approximately 30 days after the first notice is issued, a second inspection
shall occur. In the event the violation is not corrected, a second violation
notice shall be issued and a third inspection shall be necessary. The third
inspection shall occur approximately 15 days after the second violation notice
is issued. If the violation is not corrected upon the third inspection, a third
violation notice shall be issued. Inspections shall occur approximately every
five days until the violation is corrected. In the event that the recipient of
the notice does not take the necessary action to correct the dangerous
condition or code violation as set out in the notice, the recipient shall be in
violation of this section and shall result in a citation. If a violation is not
corrected due to extenuating circumstances, a committee of the Fire Chief, Fire
Marshal, and the Superintendent of Building and Zoning may grant an extension.
   (F)   Violation classifications. Violations occurring during inspections
shall be determined from one of three violations. Immediate danger to life

(Prior Code, § 92.01) (Amended 8-26-2008) (Ord. 2010-5, passed 7-6-2010; Ord.
2011-3, passed 5-3-2011)
§ 92.02 COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY NUISANCES.
   In addition to what is declared in §
92.01 of this chapter to be a public nuisance, those offenses which are known
to the common law and the statutes of the state as public nuisances may, in
case any exist within the city limits, be treated as such and be proceeded
against as is provided in this chapter, or in accordance with any other
provisions of law. Wherever the word “nuisance” is used in this chapter, it
refers to a public nuisance.
(Prior Code, § 92.02)
§ 92.03 ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES.
   (A)   In any case where public complaints have been received by the City
Police Department or the Building and Planning Department, or where a city
official or employee has observed a situation, condition or circumstance which
may constitute a nuisance identified in §§
92.01 or
92.02 of this chapter, it shall be the duty of the City Building Inspector and/
or City Police Department to investigate whether a nuisance exists. If such
investigation leads the person investigating such situation, condition or
circumstance to believe a nuisance exists, such person shall report such
findings to the City Building and Planning Department, whereupon the Building
Inspector shall issue a notice to abate a public nuisance to the offending
party or parties. In addition, if such circumstance, condition or situation
constitutes a violation of other provisions of this code, the current
circumstance, condition or situation may also be cited as a separate violation.
While a notice to abate shall allow the owner, occupant or responsible party or
parties a reasonable amount of time to remove or eliminate the nuisance, the
notice shall identify the date by which the nuisance must be abated. It shall
not be necessary for the notice to identify the manner in which any nuisance
shall be abated unless it is deemed advisable to do so.
   (B)   If the owner, occupant or responsible party or parties so notified to
abate a nuisance shall refuse or neglect to abate such nuisance within the
designated time after such notice is given, such person shall be subject to the
penalties provided in §
92.99 of this chapter. In addition, such failure or refusal shall be reported
to the City Board of Public Works and Safety which may authorize city personnel
or a city contractor to enter upon the property where the nuisance exists to
abate such nuisance in any manner authorized by law including, but not limited
to, impoundment, removal and disposal, spraying, cutting or mowing, demolition
and the institution of litigation against the offending party or parties for
the purpose of obtaining an appropriate court order and/or for the purpose of
collecting the costs of abatement. For nuisances pertaining to weeds and
neglected vegetation described in § 92.0, the enforcement authority is
authorized to act in accordance with this section, without first bringing the
failure or refusal to abate before the Board of Works and Public Safety. In
addition, the city may take steps to file a lien against the property with the
County Recorder, after the city has abated a nuisance, and the city may enforce
the lien as allowed in division (C) below.
   (C)   (1)   Pursuant to I.C. 36-1-6-2, if the city, by its employees or
contractors, has taken action to abate a nuisance and bring real property into
compliance with this chapter, the city may issue a bill to the owner of the
real estate for the costs incurred by the city in bringing the property into
compliance with this chapter, including administrative costs and removal costs.
Subject to division (E) below, if the owner fails or refuses to pay the billed
amount with 30 days after the date of the issuance of the bill, the bill shall
be considered delinquent.
      (2)   Thereafter, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall prepare a list or an
instrument listing the name or names of the owner or owners of each lot or
parcel of real property on which fees are delinquent, a description of the
premises, as shown on the records of the County Auditor, and the amount of the
delinquent fees and the penalty.
      (3)   Such list or instrument shall be recorded with the County Recorder
and shall constitute a lien against the real property listed. The amount of the
lien shall be placed on the tax duplicate by the County Auditor. The total
amount, including accrued interest, shall be collected in the same manner as
delinquent taxes are collected and shall be disbursed to the city's General
Fund.
   (D)   The requirement for service of notice under the provisions of
divisions (A) and (B) above shall be deemed met by posting a copy of the notice
to abate a public nuisance in a prominent place or location on a residence,
building or vacant lot where such nuisance exists. The notice shall also be
served upon the record owner of the real estate, where a nuisance exists, at
the last known address of the record owner as shown in the County Assessor’s
office, by first class U.S. mail, postage prepaid and by certified mail, return
receipt requested.
   (E)   Any person notified to abate a nuisance may dispute same by appealing
such notice to the City Board of Public Works and Safety on or before the
deadline to abate the nuisance. In the case of an appeal of a demand for
reimbursement of abatement costs, such appeal shall be made on or before the
date on which reimbursement is due. An appeal shall be in writing and filed
with the City Building and Planning Department, which shall cause the matter to
be heard at the first available City Board of Public Works and Safety meeting.
At the hearing, the Building Inspector shall present the facts relied upon in
determining a nuisance existed or shall present evidence regarding costs of
abatement and the method utilized to abate the nuisance, depending upon the
nature of the appeal. The party appealing a notice to abate or a notice to
reimburse costs of abatement shall then be given an opportunity to present
evidence in support of such appeal. At the conclusion of such hearing, the City
Board of Public Works and Safety shall deliberate and determine whether such
notice appealed should be upheld or reversed. The decision of the City Board of
Public Works and Safety shall be final, subject only to filing for judicial
review with the Circuit Court within 30 days of the decision of the City Board
of Public Works and Safety.
(Prior Code, § 92.03) (Ord. 2010-5, passed 7-6-2010; Ord. 2012-6, passed 7-3-

§ 92.04 INSPECTION OF PREMISES.
   For the purpose of carrying the provisions of this chapter into effect, it
is made the duty of all officers and employees of the city to report the
existence of nuisances to the Building and Planning Department and/or the City
Police Department for their investigation. Other city department officials
including, but not limited to, a City Engineer, Zoning Enforcement Officer,
Street Commissioner and Fire Department personnel may assist in the
investigation of a possible nuisance and shall be authorized hereunder to
visit, enter into or upon any building, lot, grounds or premises, within the
city limits to ascertain and discover any such nuisances and/or to make
examination thereof or abatement efforts.
(Prior Code, § 92.04) (Ord. 2010-5, passed 7-6-2010)
§ 92.05 TEST FOR NUISANCE.
   Whether or not a particular annoyance, as listed in §
92.01 of this chapter, constitutes a nuisance shall depend on its effect upon
persons of ordinary health and average sensibilities, and not its effect upon
persons who are delicate or super-sensitive, or whose habits, tastes or
conditions are such that they are never sensible of any annoyance.
(Prior Code, § 92.05)
§ 92.06 NUISANCES CREATED BY OTHERS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, it shall not be essential that the nuisance
be created or contributed to by the owner or tenants, or their agents or
representatives, but merely that the nuisance be enacted or contributed to by
licensees, invitees, guests or other persons for whose conduct the owner or
operator is responsible, or by persons for whose conduct the owner or operator
is not liable, but of which, by the exercise of reasonable care, the owner or
operator ought to have become aware.
(Prior Code, § 92.06)
§ 92.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever creates or maintains any nuisance defined in this chapter and who
fails or refuses to abate such nuisance when so ordered, shall be fined not
less than $50, nor more than $500, pursuant to a schedule established by the
City Board of Public Works and Safety. A separate offense shall be deemed
committed upon each day during or on which the violation occurs or continues
beyond the date fixed for abatement of such nuisance. The action against any
person to enforce a penalty by the city shall constitute a separate and
additional legal remedy, and the fact that any proceedings by way of an
injunction or for the abatement of any such nuisance has been or may be
instituted by the city and may be pending or concluded, shall not affect this
chapter or be considered in any way as a defense to such action for the penalty
herein prescribed. In the case of a violation of § 92.01 of this chapter, an
owner’s failure or refusal to abate or cause to abate a nuisance when ordered,
and failure of an owner to reimburse the city for costs of abatement as fixed
by the City Clerk-Treasurer, shall result in the city certifying such costs,
including administrative costs, to the County Auditor who shall cause such
costs, together with interest, to be added to the property’s tax duplicate to
be collected as delinquent real estate taxes, pursuant to I.C. 36-7-10.1-1 et
seq., which upon collection shall be deposited into the city’s General Fund.

Inc. v. City of Gary (7th Cir. 2006), 466 F. 3d 550.
      (2)   The Council finds:
         (a)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the
operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to
make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that
occur on their premises;
         (b)   Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses, defined in
this chapter as adult theaters and adult cabarets, engage in higher incidence
of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments;
         (c)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos and live sex shows;
         (d)   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities,
which creates unhealthy conditions;
         (e)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually oriented businesses;
         (f)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to:
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, Non-A, Non-B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella
infections;
         (g)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome) caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United
States: 600 in 1982; 2,200 in 1983; 4,600 in 1984; 8,555 in 1985; and 253,448
through 12-31-1992;
         (h)   As of February 2012, there have been thousands of reported cases
of AIDS in the state;
         (i)   Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing
cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in the
city and the surrounding area;
         (j)   The number of cases of early (less that one year) syphilis in
the United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in
1982, and 45,200 through November, 1990;
         (k)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over 1,000,000 cases being reported in
1990;
         (l)   In his report of 10-22-1986, the Surgeon General of the United
States has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn;
         (m)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV
infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by
sexual acts;
         (n)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities;
         (o)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view “adult”
oriented films;
         (p)   The findings noted in divisions (B)(2)(a) through (B)(2)(o)
above raise substantial governmental concerns;
         (q)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns;
         (r)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business
is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its
patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate
to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of
the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises
and activities occurring therein;
         (s)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient
lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial government
interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in
adult theaters;
         (t)   Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments;
         (u)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons
ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the
sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to
the significant government interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases;
         (v)   In the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases, it is
desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent, or who
are likely to be witnesses to such conduct;
         (w)   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been
convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the
applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter;
         (x)   The barring of such individuals from the management of adult
uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to, and prevents conduct which
leads to, the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases; and
         (y)   The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens
of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

may be necessary to accommodate some models within the required yard setbacks.
Therefore, suitable provisions shall be made by the developers of the
manufactured home development in their advance planning to provide for such
homes in their design.
         (b)   Based upon this guideline, the fact that the size of a
particular home would create a violation of any of the yard requirements of
this ordinance when applied to a specific lot, shall not, in itself’, be
considered an adequate basis for the granting of a variance from such
requirements.

secondary access points with suitable signage place in a landscaped setting.
      (15)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks not less than four feet in width shall be
required on both sides of all interior streets; In those instances where the
mobile home development borders one side of an arterial or collector street,
sidewalks conforming to this requirement shall only be required upon that side
of the street.
      (16)   Utilities. All electric, telephone, and other utilities extended
within the mobile home development to each lot shall be constructed
underground. All water and sanitary sewer service connections shall not exceed
ten feet in length above ground directly beneath the mobile home, and shall be
suitably protected against freezing.

In no case shall that portion of the paved area designated for the off-street
parking encroach upon the street right-of-way.
   (C)   Mobile home standards.
      (1)   The permitted use of such parks shall be limited to the following:
manufactured homes, mobile homes and modular homes.
      (2)    Minimum living space. No mobile or modular home shall be placed,
erected, or altered so that its ground floor area is less than 720 square feet,
exclusive of porches, terraces, garages, and exterior stairs.
      (3)   Height requirements. The height of structures within the park shall
not exceed 25 feet or two stories. Accessory structures shall not exceed 16
feet.
      (4)   Compliance. Within 30 days after location, the wheels of the mobile
home shall be removed and a skirting of wood or metal shall be affixed.
      (5)   No mobile home site shall be rented in any park, except for periods
of 30 days or longer.
      (6)   Recognizing that a variety of manufactured buildings exist not
specifically designed for residential purposes, each manufactured home placed,
erected or located within a manufactured home development shall contain, at a
minimum, a flush toilet, sleeping accommodations, a tub or shower bath, kitchen
facilities, and plumbing and electrical connections designed for attachment to
appropriate external systems.
      (7)   Permanent foundation/perimeter enclosure required. All manufactured
homes located within an approved manufactured home development shall be placed
upon a permanent foundation and provided with a perimeter enclosure. For the
purposes of this ordinance, placement of a manufactured home upon uniform jacks
or blocks, upon a concrete pad, skirted with sheet metal, aluminum, wood, or
other temporary material, and secured by tie downs, shall not be considered a
permanent foundation and perimeter enclosure meeting this requirement.
      (8)   All improvements within the mobile home park shall conform to the
standards delineated in
Chapter 154 of this code of ordinances.

   (B)   To hear and decide by granting or denying an exception to the
provisions of this chapter including, but not limited to, the following
instances:
      (1)   A request for the extension of a district, where the boundary line
of a district divides a lot or tract held in single ownership at the time of
passage of this chapter;
      (2)   Interpret the provisions of this chapter in such a way as to carry
out the intent and purpose of the zoning plan, as shown on the zoning map,
where the street layout actually existing on the ground varies from the street
layout as shown on the map;
      (3)   Permit the reconstruction of a non- conforming building which has

actual value, where the Board finds that the public interest will be best
served by permitting a continuance of the non-conforming use; and
      (4)   Waive or reduce the parking and loading and unloading berth
requirements in any of the districts, whenever the character or use of the
building is such as to make unnecessary the full provision of parking or
loading and unloading berth facilities, or whenever the regulations would

from merely granting an advantage or a convenience.
   (C)   To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of this chapter
upon which the Board is required to pass under this chapter; and
   (D)   Except as may otherwise be specifically provided in this chapter, the

variances from the terms of this chapter, when the following is made to appear
by the property owners:
      (1)   A strict compliance with the terms of this chapter relating to the
use, construction or alteration of buildings or structures, or the use of land,
will impose upon the owner unusual and practical difficulties or particular
hardships;
      (2)   The variance would be in harmony with the general purpose, intent
and spirit of this chapter; and
      (3)   By granting the request for a variance substantial justice will be
done and the granting of the requested variance will not serve merely as a
convenience to the applicant, but will alleviate a demonstrable hardship, and
at the same time surrounding property will be reasonably protected.

§ 150.374 FINDINGS AND ACTION.
   In its consideration of a specific case, the Board must determine that the
granting of a variance from the terms of this chapter will not be contrary to
the public interest, where owing to special conditions, fully demonstrated on
the basis of the facts presented, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship, and that the spirit of this
chapter shall be observed and substantial justice done.

this chapter the Board, before making any exception or variance in a specific
case, shall first determine that:

which would be in conflict with the permitted uses of the district under the
terms of this chapter;
      (2)   It will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent
property;
      (3)   It will not unreasonably increase the congestion in public streets;
      (4)   It will not increase the danger of fire or of the public safety;
      (5)   If will not unreasonably diminish or impair established property
values within the surrounding area; and
      (6)   It will not in any other respect impair the public health, comfort,
safety, morals or welfare of the inhabitants of the city.
   (B)   The concurring vote of three members of the Board shall be necessary
to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Building
Inspector, or to decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon which the
Board is authorized by this chapter to render a decision.
   (C)   In exercising its powers, the Board may, in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify
the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and make the
order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made and, to that
end, shall have all the powers of the Building Inspector from whom the appeal
is taken.
   (D)   Nothing herein contained shall be construed to give or grant to the
Board the power or authority to alter or change the zoning ordinance or the
zone map, the power and authority being reserved to the Common Council in the
manner hereinafter provided in §

requires immediate action to protect the public health, he may, without notice
or hearing, issue an order reciting the existence of such
an emergency and require that such action be taken as he deems necessary to
meet the emergency. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter, such
order shall be effective immediately. Any person to whom such an order is
directed shall comply therewith immediately, but upon petition to the Health
Officer shall be afforded a hearing as soon as possible in the manner provided
in division (B) above. After such hearing, depending upon the findings as to

subdivider in the primary plat and the secondary plat. Within 30 days from the
receipt of the notice, the City Engineer shall deliver the cost estimate to the
City Building Inspector, who shall refer the cost estimate to the Board of
Works.
   (B)   Determination of amount of bond. The Board of Works shall, within 30
days from the date of receipt of the cost estimate by the City Building
Inspector, meet and determine the amount of the bond which shall be filed by
the subdivider based upon the City Engineer’s cost estimate and any other
relevant factors. The determination of the amount of the bond shall be recorded
in the minutes of the Board of Works and a copy of the minutes shall be mailed
to the subdivider. The subdivider shall then file a final plat and a bond, in
satisfactory form, in the amount determined by the Board of Works, together
with surety thereon satisfactory to the Board of Works, in the office of the
City Building Inspector, who shall refer the bond and surety to the Board of
Works for approval of the surety on the bond.
   (C)   Approval of surety on bond. If the Board of Works determines that the
surety on the bond filed by the subdivider is satisfactory, a certification
shall be endorsed on the surety document or shall be appended thereto and the
approval shall be recorded in the minutes of the Board of Works. The bond and
surety shall be filed by the City Building Inspector in the office of the City
Clerk-Treasurer. If the Board of Works disapproves the surety, its action shall
be recorded in the minutes of its meeting together with a statement in clear
and concise language specifying the reason or reasons for the disapproval and
what, if anything, can remedy the defect of the surety as submitted. A copy of
such minutes, in the event the surety is disapproved, shall be mailed by the
City Building Inspector to the subdivider, who shall cure such defects and
resubmit the surety for approval by the Board of Works. In the event the Board
of Works disapproves the surety, the City Building Inspector shall not consider
the final plat until such time as the surety on the bond is approved. In the
event the Board of Works approves the surety on the bond, the City Building
Inspector shall proceed with consideration of the final plat. No final plat
shall be considered or approved by the Plan Commission until the required bond
has been filed by subdivider and the surety has been approved by the Board of
Works.
   (D)   Approval of final plat. In the event the Board of Works approves the
surety on the subdivider’s bond, the Plan Commission shall commence its

event that a subdivider does not complete work included under a surety bond
within two years of the approval of the final plat, the Board of Works may
notify the subdivider of its intention of proceeding with the work. The
subdivider shall within 180 calendar days of said notice, install all of the
improvements and execute all dedications required by his or her covenants. In
the event the subdivider fails to install such improvements, the city shall
proceed upon the subdivider’s bond and shall install such improvements. In the
event that the subdivider’s bond is insufficient to pay the cost of all of such
improvements, the subdivider shall be responsible for the payment of the cost
for such improvements in excess of that amount covered by the proceeds of the
bond.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES
§ 155.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4-11 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Common Council of the City of Decatur does hereby adopt the following
floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 2017-7, passed 8-15-2017; Ord. 2022-10, passed 6-21-2022)
§ 155.002 FINDINGS OF FACTS.
   The flood hazard areas of the City of Decatur are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 2017-7, passed 8-15-2017; Ord. 2022-10, passed 6-21-2022)
§ 155.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters.
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage.
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (F)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2017-7, passed 8-15-2017; Ord. 2022-10, passed 6-21-2022)
§ 155.004 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health.
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains.
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas.
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained.
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain.
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible.
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood

§ 155.010 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual
chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been
performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   ZONE AE and A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent
annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations
are shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of
Zones A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance
shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths
are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance
shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between
one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic
analyses are shown within this zone.
      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood  protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual
chance flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of
an under-construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of
special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of
a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete
for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood
protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion.
No base flood elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure; an accessory structure specifically excludes structures
used for human habitation.
      (1)   Accessory structures are considered walled and roofed where the
structure includes at least two outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof.
      (2)   Examples of accessory structures include but are not necessarily
limited to two-car detached garages (or smaller), carports, storage and tool
sheds, and small boathouses.
      (3)   The following may have uses that are incidental or accessory to the
principal structure on a parcel but are generally not considered to be
accessory structures by the NFIP:
         (a)   Structures in which any portion is used for human habitation,
whether as a permanent residence or as temporary or seasonal living quarters,
such as a detached garage or carriage house that includes an apartment or guest
quarters, or a detached guest house on the same parcel as a principal
residence;
         (b)   Structures used by the public, such as a place of employment or
entertainment; and
         (c)   Development that does not meet the NFIP definition of a
structure for floodplain management purposes. Examples includes, but are not
necessarily limited to, a gazebo, pavilion, picnic shelter, or carport that is
open on all sides (roofed but not walled).
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   ALTERATION OF WATERCOURSE. A dam, impoundment, channel relocation, change in
channel alignment, channelization, or change in cross-sectional area of the
channel or the channel capacity, or any other modification which may alter,
impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water
during conditions of the base flood.

         (b)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
         (c)   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by
flooding and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of
normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and
deposited along the path of the current.
      (2)   FLOOD OR FLOODING also includes the collapse or subsidence of land
along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion or
undermining caused by waves or current of water exceeding anticipated cyclical
levels that result in a flood as defined above.
   FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Areas subject to the 1% annual chance flood (see SPECIAL
FLOOD HAZARD AREA).
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available
digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion
control ordinance), and other applications of police power which control
development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local
regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing
and reducing flood loss and damage.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulative increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use in which cannot perform its intended
purpose unless it is  located or carried out in close proximity to water. The
term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for
the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship
repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related
manufacturing facilities.
   HARDSHIP. (As related to variances of this chapter) means the exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
City of Decatur Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is
exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or
financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of
one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship.
All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally
intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURES. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a

determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by (a)
an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of Interior; or (b)
directly by the Secretary of Interior in states without approved programs.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. Analyses performed by a
professional engineer licensed by the State of Indiana, in accordance with
standard engineering practices that are accepted by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and FEMA, used to determine the base flood, other frequency
floods, flood elevations, floodway information, and boundaries, and flood
profiles.
   INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL-EVALUATION SERVICE (ICC-ES) REPORT. A document
that presents the findings, conclusions, and recommendations from a particular
evaluation. ICC-ES reports provide information about what code requirements or
acceptance criteria were used to evaluate a product, and how the product should
be identified, installed.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR), Conditional
Letter of Map Revisions Based on Fill (CLOMR-F), Letter of Map Amendment
(LOMA), Letter of Map Amendment Out as Shown (LOMA-OAS), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
      (1)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). FEMA’s comment on a
proposed project that would, upon construction, result in modification of the
SFRA through the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
      (2)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (CLOMR-F). A
letter from FEMA stating that a proposed structure that will be elevated by
fill would not be inundated by the base flood.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a building or land is not
located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A
LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
      (4)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT OUT AS SHOWN (LOMA-OAS). An official
determination by FEMA that states the property or building is correctly shown
outside the SFRA as shown on an effective NFIP map. Therefore, the mandatory
flood insurance requirement does not apply. An out-as-shown determination does
not require elevations.
      (5)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (6)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). FEMA’s modification
of the SFRA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill outside the
existing regulatory floodway.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement

below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters. Designs for meeting the flood opening
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following criteria:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and
         (c)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.

replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or
adjusted assessed values.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.
   NATURAL GRADE. For floodplain management purposes means the elevation of the
undisturbed natural surface of the ground. Fill placed prior to the date of the
initial identification of the flood hazard on a FEMA map is also considered
natural grade.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for which the start of construction
commenced after the effective date of the community's first floodplain
ordinance.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK or SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88). As adopted in 1993 is a
vertical control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations
within the floodplain.
   OBSTRUCTION. Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization,
bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,

any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. See REGULATORY FLOOD.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community's FEMA
map to effect changes to base (one-percent annual chance) flood elevations,
floodplain boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric
features. These changes typically occur as a result of structural works or
improvements, annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or
correction to base flood elevations or SFHAs.
   PREFABRICATED BUILDING. A building that is manufactured and constructed
using prefabrication. It consists of factory-made components or units that are
transported and assembled on-site to form the complete building.
   PRINCIPALLY ABOVE GROUND. At least 51% of the actual cash value of the

   REGULATORY FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable
to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is
as defined in §
155.021. The REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the term BASE FLOOD, ONE-PERCENT
ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD, and 100 YEAR FLOOD.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   RIVERINE. Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
   SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITY. Any facility involved in the storage or
disposal of non-liquid, non-soluble materials ranging from municipal garbage to
industrial wastes that contain complex and sometimes hazardous substances.
Solid waste also included sewage sludge, agricultural refuse, demolition

   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA).  Those lands within the jurisdiction of
the city subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the City
subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood
hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood
Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A99, or
VE. The SFHA includes areas that are flood prone and designated from other
federal, state or local sources of data including but not limited to best
available flood layer maps provided by or approved by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources, historical flood information reflecting high water marks,
previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a
watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual start means either the first placement of  permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 155.020 LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all SFHAs and known flood prone areas within the
jurisdiction of the City of Decatur, Indiana as in §
155.021, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
City of Decatur, Indiana.
(Ord. 2017-7, passed 8-15-2017; Ord. 2022-10, passed 6-21-2022)
§ 155.021 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING REGULATORY FLOOD DATA.
   This chapter's protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best
available regulatory flood data is listed below.
   (A)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the City of Decatur shall be as
delineated as an AE Zone on the Adams County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas
Flood Insurance Rate map dated September 29, 2010 shall be determined from the
one-percent annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Adams
County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas dated September 29, 2010 and the
corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map dated September 29, 2010 as well as any
future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency with the most recent date. Should the floodway limits not be
delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map for a studied SFHA designated as an
AE Zone, the limits of the floodway will be according to the best available
flood layer as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
   (B)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each
of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the City of Decatur, delineated as an A
Zone on the Adams County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate
Map dated September 29, 2010 as well as any future updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage area
from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace existing
data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and subsequently approved.
   (C)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification
on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of
any watercourse in the community’s known flood prone areas shall be according
to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater
than one square mile.
   (D)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.
(Ord. 2017-7, passed 8-15-2017; Ord. 2022-10, passed 6-21-2022)
§ 155.022 ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   A Floodplain Development Permit shall be required in conformance with the
provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development
activities in areas of special flood hazard.
(Ord. 2017-7, passed 8-15-2017; Ord. 2022-10, passed 6-21-2022)
§ 155.023 COMPLIANCE.
   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally
altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. Where an existing or proposed structure or
other development is affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood
elevations, or both, the development activity must comply with the provisions
of this chapter applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the most
conservative (highest) base flood elevation affecting any part of the existing
or proposed structure; or for other developments, affecting any part of the
area of the development. No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be

PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 155.044 STATUS STANDARDS.
   (A)   Floodways (riverine). Located within SFHAs, established in §
155.021, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. Under the provisions of the
Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1) a permit for construction in a floodway from
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance
of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or
obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation
activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving undertaken before the
actual start of construction of the structure. General licenses and exemptions
to the requirements of the Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1 and 312 I.A.C. 10)
may apply to qualified additions/improvements to existing lawful residential
structures, rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland restoration, utility line
crossings, outfall projects, creek rock removal, and prospecting.
      (1)   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in §
155.021, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward
the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for approval for construction
in a floodway, provided the activity does not qualify for a general license or
exemption (I.C. 14-28-1 or 312 I.A.C. 10).
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act The Floodplain
Development Permit shall meet the provisions contained in this subchapter.
      (3)   The Floodplain Development Permit cannot be less restrictive than
an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to qualify for
a general license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site/
project. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
      (4)   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development shall cause
no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge
without first obtaining a Conditional Letter of Map Revision and meeting
requirements of §
155.037(B)(28)(a). A Conditional Letter of Map Revision cannot be issued for
development that would cause an increase in flood levels affecting a structure
and such development should not be permitted.
      (5)   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet identified on the
effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity
of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation
of the regulatory flood of at least fifteen hundredths of a foot as determined
by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that
under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
      (6)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
   (B)   Fringe (riverine). If the site is in the fringe (either identified on
the FIRM or identified by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources through
detailed or approximate studies and not identified on a FIRM), the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit provided the
provisions contained in this subchapter have been met.
   (C)   SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/
fringes (riverine).
      (1)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the one-percent annual chance flood elevation and the recommended Flood
Protection Grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, a Floodplain Development Permit may be
issued, provided the conditions of the Floodplain Development Permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
      (2)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and one-percent annual chance flood elevation for the
site.
         (b)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in this
article have been met.
   (D)   SFHAs not identified on a map.
      (1)   If a proposed development site is near a waterway with no SFHA
identified on a map, the Floodplain Administrator shall verify the drainage
area upstream of the site. If the drainage area upstream of the site is
verified as being greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the one-percent annual chance flood elevation and the recommended Flood
Protection Grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper written
approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain analysis/
regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, a Floodplain Development Permit may be issued,
provided the conditions of the Floodplain Development Permit are not less
restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and the provisions contained in this article have been met.
(Ord. 2022-10, passed 6-21-2022)

§ 155.049 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
155.021, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. General licenses and exemptions to the requirements of the Flood
Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1 and 312 I.A.C. 10) may apply to qualified additions/
improvements to existing lawful residential structures, rural bridges, logjam
removals, wetland restoration, utility line crossings, outfall projects, creek
rock removal, and prospecting.
   (B)   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in §
155.021, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward
the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for approval for construction
in a floodway, provided the activity does not qualify for a general license or
exemption (I.C. 14-28-1 or 312 I.A.C. 10).
   (C)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. The Floodplain
Development Permit shall meet the provisions contained in this chapter.
   (D)   The Floodplain Development Permit cannot be less restrictive than an
approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department
of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to qualify for a general
license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site/project.
However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall take
precedence.
   (E)   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development shall cause no
increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge
without first obtaining a Conditional Letter of Map Revision and meeting
requirements of §
155.037. A Conditional Letter of Map Revision cannot be issued for development
that would cause an increase in flood levels affecting a structure and such
development should not be permitted.
   (F)   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet identified on the
effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity
of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation
of the regulatory flood of at least fifteen-hundredths of a foot as determined
by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that
under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (G)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.

§ 155.050 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
155.045 through
155.052 have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of
any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.

§ 155.051 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the one-
percent annual chance flood elevation and the recommended Flood Protection
Grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in §§
155.045 through
155.052 have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and one-percent annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
155.045 through
155.052 have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development shall not adversely affect
the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This
adverse affect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory
flood of at least 0.15 of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory
flood elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-
floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.

§ 155.052 SFHAS NOT IDENTIFIED ON A MAP.
   (A)   If a proposed development site is near a waterway with no SFHA
identified on a map, the Floodplain Administrator shall verify the drainage
area upstream of the site. If the drainage area upstream of the site is
verified as being greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until written
approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the one-percent annual chance flood elevation and the recommended Flood
Protection Grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
   (C)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper written
approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain analysis/
regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, a Floodplain Development Permit may be issued,
provided the conditions of the Floodplain Development Permit are not less
restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and the provisions contained in this article have been met.

      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship as defined in §
155.010; or
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
   (B)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §
155.049 and §
155.051(A) may be granted.
   (C)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §
155.049 and §

   (D)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §

one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with

improvements, and other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use.
   (G)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic
structures” upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation
will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historical
structure” and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character
and design of the structure.
   (H)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation. (See §
155.064.)
   (I)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request. (See §

floor of a structure to be built below the flood protection grade shall be
given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the flood
protection grade will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   Such construction below the flood protection grade increases risks
to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the County Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
   (B)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance.
