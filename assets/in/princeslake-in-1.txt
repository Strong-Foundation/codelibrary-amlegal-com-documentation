§ 10.01 TITLE OF CODE.
   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the town, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered, and consolidated into component codes,
titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the “Town
Code,” for which designation “Code of Ordinances,” “Codified Ordinances” or
“Code” may be substituted. Code title, chapter, and section headings do not
constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.
§ 10.02 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.03 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation, shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.04 CONSTRUCTION OF CODE.
   (A)   This code is a codification of previously existing laws, amendments
thereto, and newly enacted laws. Any previously existing law or amendment
thereto reenacted by this code shall continue in operation and effect, as if it
had not been repealed by this code. All rules and regulations adopted under
laws reenacted in this code shall remain in full force and effect unless
repealed or amended subsequent to the enactment of this code.
   (B)   Any appropriation repealed and reenacted by this code is continued
only for the period designated in the original enactment of that appropriation.
   (C)   The numerical order and position of sections in this code does not
resolve a conflict between two or more sections.
   (D)   Any irreconcilable conflict between sections shall be resolved by
reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or subsection.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters or sections of this code, as
originally enacted, or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered
by the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only, and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only, and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)
§ 10.05 RULES OF INTERPRETATION; DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Rules of interpretation. This code shall be construed by the following
rules unless such construction is plainly repugnant to the legislative intent
or context of the provision.
      (1)   Words and phrases shall be taken in their plain, ordinary, and
usual sense. Technical words and phrases having a peculiar and appropriate
meaning in law shall be understood according to their technical import.
      (2)   Words imputing joint authority to three or more persons shall be
construed as imputing authority to a majority of such persons, unless otherwise
declared in the section giving such authority.
      (3)   Where a section requires an act to be done which, by law, an agent
or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.
      (4)   Words denoting the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the
feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,
and words in the plural shall include the singular; the use of a verb in the
present tense shall include the future, if applicable.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this code of ordinances, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.

politic and corporate, or any other group acting as a unit as well as to

penalty, the terms PERSON or WHOEVER as applied to any unincorporated entity
shall mean the partners or members thereof, and as applied to corporations, the
officers or agents thereof.

code, refer to the sections or divisions next following or next preceding that
in which the words occur, unless some other section is designated.

of permanently representing words and letters. Where the written signature of a

(I.C. 1-1-4-5)
§ 10.06 SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   If any section of this code now enacted or subsequently amended or its
application to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid section
or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is severable.
If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of
whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
(I.C. 1-1-1-8)
§ 10.07 REFERENCE TO OTHER SECTIONS.
   Whenever in one section, reference is made to another section hereof, such
reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified, or renumbered unless the subject matter is
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OFFICES; NAME DESIGNATIONS.
   (A)   Reference to offices. Reference to a public office or officer shall be
deemed to apply to any office, officer, or employee of this municipality
exercising the powers, duties, or functions contemplated in the provision,
irrespective of any transfer of functions or change in the official title of
the functionary.
   (B)   Name designations. Whenever any ordinance or resolution of the Council
refers to any board, bureau, commission, division, department, officer, agency,
authority, or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; or at the time of the effective date of that ordinance or
subsequent thereto, the rights, powers, duties, or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then such named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date
or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which such duties,
liabilities, powers, and rights were transferred.
(I.C. 1-1-6-1)
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express such intent, such spelling shall be corrected and such word
or words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
such error.
§ 10.10 REASONABLE TIME.
   (A)   In all cases where an ordinance requires an act to be done in a
reasonable time or requires reasonable notice to be given, reasonable time or
notice shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of such act or the giving of such notice.
   (B)   The time within which an act is to be done, as herein provided, shall
be computed by excluding the first day and including the last. If the last day
be a Saturday, Sunday, or a state holiday, it shall be excluded.
§ 10.11 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under
such section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. Such section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture,
or liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code shall not be affected by
the repeal and reenactment; but all suits, proceedings, and prosecutions for
causes arising or acts committed prior to the effective date of this code may
be commenced and prosecuted with the same effect as if this code had not been
enacted.
Statutory reference:
   Periods of limitation, see I.C. 1-1-1-7
§ 10.13 ORDINANCES UNAFFECTED.
   All ordinances of a temporary or special nature and all other ordinances
pertaining to subjects not embraced in this code shall remain in full force and
effect unless herein repealed expressly or by necessary implication.
§ 10.14 ORDINANCES WHICH AMEND OR SUPPLEMENT CODE.
   (A)   If the legislative body shall desire to amend any existing chapter or
section of this code, the chapter or section shall be specifically repealed and
a new chapter or section, containing the desired amendment, substituted in its
place.
   (B)   Any ordinance which is proposed to add to the existing code a new
chapter or section shall indicate, with reference to the arrangement of this
code, the proper number of such chapter or section. In addition to such
indication thereof as may appear in the text of the proposed ordinance, a
caption or title shall be shown in concise form above the ordinance.
   (C)   When preparing a supplement of this code, the codifier (meaning the
person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make
formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included
in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a
unified code. For example, the codifier may:
      (1)   Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions;
      (2)   Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections
and other subdivisions of the code printed in the supplement, and make changes
in such catchlines, headings and titles;
      (3)   Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be
inserted in the code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change
existing section or other subdivision numbers;
      (4)   Change the words “this ordinance” or words of the same meaning to
“this chapter”, “this article”, “this division”, and the like, as the case may
be, or to “sections              to           ” (inserting sections numbers to
indicate the sections of this code which embody the substantive sections of the
ordinance incorporated into the code); and
      (5)   Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the
original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the code; but in no case
shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance
material included in the supplement or already embodied in the code.
§ 10.15 SECTION HISTORIES; STATUTORY REFERENCES.
   (A)   As histories for the code sections, the specific number and passage
date of the original ordinance, and the most recent three amending ordinances,
if any, are listed following the text of the code section. Example: (Ord. 10,
passed 5-13-60; Am. Ord. 15, passed 1-1-70; Am. Ord. 20, passed 1-1-80; Am.
Ord. 25, passed 1-1-85)
   (B)   (1)   If a statutory cite is included in the history, this indicates
that the text of the section reads substantially the same as the statute.
Example: (I.C. 36-5-2-2) (Ord. 10, passed 1-17-80; Am. Ord. 20, passed 1-1-85)
      (2)   If a statutory cite is set forth as a “statutory reference”
following the text of the section, this indicates that the reader should refer
to that statute for further information.
§ 10.16 PRESERVATION OF PENALTIES, OFFENSES, RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES.
   All offenses committed under laws in force prior to the effective date of
this code shall be prosecuted and remain punishable as provided by those laws.
This code does not affect any rights or liabilities accrued, penalties
incurred, or proceedings begun prior to the effective date of this code. The
liabilities, proceedings and rights are continued; punishments, penalties, or
forfeitures shall be enforced and imposed as if this code had not been enacted.
In particular, any agreement granting permission to utilize highway right-of-
ways, contracts entered into or franchises granted, the acceptance,
establishment or vacation of any highway, and the election of corporate
officers shall remain valid in all respects, as if this code had not been
enacted.
§ 10.17 TOWN CODES AS PROPERTY OF THE TOWN.
   All copies of the town code, except those which are purchased by the general
public, shall be the property of the town, and such copies delivered over to
elected and/or appointed officials, or other officials of the town, shall not
be retained and shall be returned to the town after the expiration of their
term or terms of office or appointment. The Clerk-Treasurer shall maintain a
record of all the persons or offices having a copy of the town code, other than
those persons purchasing the town code, and the Clerk-Treasurer shall be
responsible for securing the return of the codes in accordance with this
section.
§ 10.18 EFFECTIVE DATE AND REPEAL OF PRIOR ORDINANCES.
   All of the provisions of this code shall be in full force and effect from
the date of passage and publication pursuant to I.C. 36-5-2-10, and all
ordinances of a general and permanent nature in force at that time that include
the subject matter of the chapters denominated herein, are repealed from and
after the date.
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Any person, firm, or corporation who violates any provision of this code for
which another penalty is not specifically provided shall, upon conviction, be
subject to a fine not exceeding $2,500. A separate offense shall be deemed
committed upon each day during which a violation occurs or continues.

at least three persons known to deal in the lines or classes of personal
property to be purchased by mailing an invitation to quote to the persons at
least seven days before the time fixed for receiving quotes. If the Purchasing
Agency or the purchasing agent receives a satisfactory quote, the purchasing

§ 32.19 PROCEDURAL RULES.
   (A)   Procedural rules. The following are procedural purchasing rules
applicable to the town:
      (1)   Publication of notices. All notices of invitation for bids shall be
published in accordance with I.C. 5-3-1 as amended. The purchasing agent shall
schedule the publication of notice to provide a reasonable amount of time for
preparation and submission of bids. The notice will be published two times, at
least one week apart. The second publication must occur at least ten days prior
to the date the bids will be opened.
      (2)   Receiving offers. Bids received in response to an invitation for

policies as it deems necessary to supplement these rules on either a purchase
by purchase basis or for all of its purchases.
(Ord. 256, passed 6-22-98)
§ 32.20 CREDIT CARD USE BY DESIGNATED OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE TOWN.
   (A)   The use of credit cards for town purchases not to exceed $2,000 is
hereby authorized subject to the relevant criteria of the State Board of
Accounts, this section, and all other applicable policies and procedures
adopted by the Town Council.
   (B)   Credit cards will be issued to the Clerk-Treasurer and town department
heads, who will maintain them in their possession, except when they are checked
out by a town employee for purchases preapproved by the Clerk-Treasurer or
department head, as the case may be.
   (C)   Credit cards may be used only for day-to-day purchases of necessary
supplies, materials, and equipment that are not subject to any statutory
bidding process or formal pre-purchase approval. Credit cards may also be used
to make online purchases, including enrollment fees, accommodations, and other
costs related to seminars, and instructional classes for town officials and
employees.
   (D)   When the purpose for which a credit card has been “checked out” has
been accomplished, the card, along with a receipt, invoice, or other proof of
the purchase(s) for which it was used, must be returned to the custody of the
Clerk-Treasurer or department head to whom it was issued and in whose
possession it is regularly kept.
   (E)   Credit cards shall not be used to bypass the accounting system. One
reason that purchase orders are issued is to provide the Clerk-Treasurer with
the means to encumber and track appropriations to provide the Town Council with
timely and accurate accounting information and monitoring of the accounting
system. Payment may not be made on the basis of the account statement or a
credit card slip only. Procedures for payments should be no different than for
any other claim. Department heads shall provide the Clerk-Treasurer with
supporting documents, such as purchase orders, paid bills, and receipts, in the
same manner as any other claim is supported.
   (F)   Annual fees for credit card use may be paid.
(Ord. 353, passed 3-19-12; Am. Ord. 2020-2, passed 9-21-20)

be determined and approved by the Town Council as part of its annual budget
adoption.

expenses incurred to promote the best interests of the town, including, without
limitation: rental of meeting places, meals, decorations, memorabilia, awards,
expenses incurred in promotion industrial, commercial, or residential
development and investment; expenses incurred in developing relations with

(Ord. 386, passed 7-18-16)
§ 32.32 CAPITAL ASSET POLICY.
   (A)   Definitions. As used in this section:
      CAPITAL ASSETS.
         (a)   Land and/or land improvements, including monuments, buildings,
building improvements, construction in progress, machinery and equipment,
vehicles and infrastructure. All land will be capitalized but not depreciated.
All items with a useful life of more than one year, and having a unit cost of
$5,000 or more shall be capitalized (including acquisitions by lease-purchase
agreements or donated items). A capital asset meeting the criteria will be
reported and depreciated in the government-wide financial statements.
         (b)   Assets that are not capitalized (items having a unit cost of
less than $5,000) are expensed in the year of acquisition. An inventory will be
kept on all computers and other equipment with a capitalized cost of less than
$5,000. Exceptions are:
            1.   Items costing less than the above-described limits which are
permanently installed as a part of the cost of original construction or
installation of a larger building or equipment unit will be included in the
cost of the larger unit;
            2.   Modular equipment added subsequent to original equipment
construction of a larger building or equipment unit which may be put together
to form larger units costing more than the prescribed limits will be charged to
capital assets even though the cost of individual items is less than such
limits; and
            3.   Cabinets, shelving bookcases, and similar items added
subsequent to original construction, which are custom-made for a specific place
and adaptable elsewhere will be capitalized.
      CAPITAL OUTLAYS. Expenditures which benefit both the current and future
fiscal periods. This includes costs of acquiring land or structures,
construction or improvement of buildings, structures or other fixed assets and
equipment purchases having an appreciable and calculable period of usefulness.
These are expenditures resulting in the acquisition of or addition to the
town's general fixed assets.
      FIXED ASSETS. Tangible assets of a durable nature employed in the
operating of activities of the town and that are relatively permanent and are
needed for the production and sale of goods or services are termed property,
plant and equipment or fixed assets.
      HISTORICAL COST. The cash equivalent price exchanged for goods or
services at the date of acquisition. Land, buildings, equipment and most
inventories are common examples of items recognized under the historical cost
attribute.
      LAND. Specified land, lots, parcels, or acreage.
      MACHINERY and EQUIPMENT. An apparatus, tool or conglomeration of pieces
to form a tool. The tool will stand alone and not become part of a basic
structure or building. This category also includes any other asset or type of
physical property not otherwise classified in this section.
      TANGIBLE ASSETS. Assets that can be observed by one or more of the
physical senses. These assets may be seen and touched and, in some
environments, heard and smelled.
   (B)   Specific capitalization provisions.
      (1)   Land.
         (a)   The town will capitalize all land purchases, regardless of cost.
Exceptions to land capitalization are land purchased outright, as easements, or
right-of-way for infrastructure. Examples of infrastructure include roads and
streets, street lighting systems, curbs, parking meters, street signs,
viaducts, wharfs and storm water collection.
         (b)   Original cost of land will include the full value given to the
seller, including relocation, legal services incidental to the purchase
(including title work and legal opinion), appraisal and negotiation fees,
surveying and costs for preparing the land for its intended purpose (including
contractors and/or town employees (salary and benefits)), such as demolishing
buildings, excavating, clean up and/or inspection. Land is not depreciated
under generally accepted accounting principles.
      (2)   Machinery and equipment.
         (a)   The town will capitalize items with an individual value equal to
or greater than $5,000. Machinery combined with other machinery to form one
unit with a total value greater than the above-mentioned limit will be one
unit.
         (b)   Improvement or renovations to existing machinery and equipment
will be capitalized only if the result of the change meets all of the following
conditions:
            1.   The total costs exceed $5,000;
            2.   The useful life is extended two or more years; and
            3.   The total cost will be greater than the current book value and
less than the fair market value.
         (c)   Salvage value of machinery or equipment will be determined on an
asset-by-asset basis. Depreciation will be calculated at year-end.
      (3)   Buildings.
         (a)   The town will capitalize buildings at full cost with no
subcategories for tracking the cost of attachments. Examples of attachments are
roofs, heating, cooling, lighting or sprinkler systems, or any part of the
basic building. The department will include the cost of items designed or
purchased exclusively for the building.
         (b)   A new building will be capitalized only if it meets the
following conditions:
            1.   The total cost exceeds $5,000; and
            2.   The useful life is greater than two years.
         (c)   Improvements to an existing building will be capitalized only if
the result meets all of the following conditions:
            1.   The total cost exceeds $5,000;
            2.   The useful life is extended two years or more; and
            3.   The total cost will be greater than the current book value and
less than the fair market value.
         (d)   Any land, building, improvements, or equipment that has been
donated will be recorded at fair market value on the date of transfer.
      (4)   Improvements other than buildings. These assets are defined as
improvements to land for better enjoyment, attached or not easily removed, and
which will have a life expectancy of greater than two years. Examples are
walkways, parking areas and drives, golf cart paths, fencing, retaining walls,
pools, outside fountains, planters, underground sprinkler systems, water supply
mains, collection sewers, wells, dams, intake pipes, manholes, fire hydrants,
and other similar items. Improvements do not include roads, streets, or assets
that are of value only to the public. Roads or drives upon town-owned land that
provide support to town facilities are assets. A sidewalk down the road for
public enjoyment is an infrastructure improvement and is not capitalized.
However, sidewalks installed upon the town-owned land for use by the public and
for the support of town facilities are capital assets.
      (5)   Recording and accounting. The town shall classify capital
expenditures as capital outlays within the fund from which the expenditure was
made in accordance with the Chart of Accounts of the Cities and Towns
Accounting Manual. The cost of the property, plant and equipment includes all
expenditures necessary to put the asset into position and ready for use. For
purposes of recording fixed assets of the town, the valuation of assets shall
be based on historical costs, or where the historical cost is indeterminable,
by estimation for those assets in existence.
      (6)   Composite/group network. A network of assets is composed of all
assets that provide a particular type of service for government. A subsystem of
a network of assets is composed of all assets that make a similar portion or
segment of a network of assets.
            (a)   "Composite depreciation" refers to calculation of
depreciation for a collection of similar assets. A single composite rate is
applied annually to the acquisition cost of the collection as a whole. At year-
end, an adjustment will be made to the total cost to account for any additions/
disposals throughout the year. The accumulated depreciation associated with it
will also be adjusted. A gain or loss will never be reported on the asset when
using the composite method. A full year's depreciation will be taken when the
asset is placed in service and no depreciation will be recorded in the year it
is sold or disposed of. Dissimilar assets will be grouped by useful lives.
            (b)   To determine the appropriate depreciation rate for the
composite rate, divide one by the number of years the assets are depreciated.
For instance, a group of assets with a 25 year life will be depreciated at 4%
each year (1/25).
      (7)   Useful life schedule. The "useful life" of an asset, as set by the
Indiana State Board of Accounts ("SBOA"), shall be the "useful life" applied by
the town. For assets with regard to which the SBOA has not set a useful life,
the town shall assign its own. As the date of adoption of this section, and for
purpose of illustration, the current useful lives for various fixed asset are
as follows:

by reference and made a part of this code the same as if set forth in full
herein.
(Ord. 302, passed 5-21-01; Am. Ord. 309, passed 8-19-02; Am. Res. 2011-2,

§ 33.02 TOWN EMPLOYEES PERFORMING VOLUNTEER SERVICES.
   An employee may perform volunteer services in compliance with the guidelines
of I.C. 35-44-2-4,* if the employee's supervisor approves and the employee does
not spend more than 500 hours in a calendar year performing the volunteer
services.
(Ord. 264, passed 12-28-98)
* Editor’s note:
   The statute cited in this section, I.C. 35-44-2-4, has been repealed.
§ 33.03 DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE.
   (A)   Overview. The town makes a commitment to provide employees a safe
working environment, to ensure that employees, equipment, and operating
practices comply with health and safety standards, and to maintain public
confidence in the town and its employees. Since the town values each employee,
the town offers employees assistance in dealing with alcohol and drug abuse
problems.
   (B)   Policy.
      (1)   The town requires all employees to report for work in a condition
that allows them to perform their duties in a safe and efficient manner.
Employees will not be permitted to work under the influence of alcohol or with
prohibited drugs in their systems thereby affecting job performance.
      (2)   Violation of any provision of this section will be considered just
cause for disciplinary action up to and including discharge, even for a first
offense. In addition, refusal to adhere to any part of the policy may be
considered an act of insubordination and also may lead to disciplinary action
up to and including discharge.
      (3)   This section and related procedures may be modified by the town at
any time in order to comply with any applicable federal, state, or local laws
or to better serve the needs of the town.
   (C)   Prohibited drugs.
      (1)   Prohibited drugs are defined as illegal substances, including
controlled substances as defined in the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. §
812) and the Code of Federal Regulations (21 C.F.R. § 1308.11-1308.15) and
prescription controlled substances which have not been prescribed by a licensed
physician or dentist for specific treatment purposes for the employee. Abuse of
prescription or over-the-counter drugs will also be treated as a substance
abuse problem under this section.
      (2)   This section prohibits the illegal use, sale, transfer,
distribution, possession, or unlawful manufacture of narcotics, drugs, or other
controlled substances while on the job or on town premises (including vehicles
used for town business). These include but are not limited to marijuana,
cocaine, crack, PCP, heroin, LSD, amphetamines, hallucinogens, and
barbiturates. Any illegal substances found on such premises will be turned over
to the state police and may lead to criminal prosecution.
   (D)   Alcohol.
      (1)   The use of alcohol on the job or on town premises is prohibited,
unless such use is non-abusive and is part of an authorized official event held
off town premises. The use of alcohol in vehicles used for town business is
strictly prohibited.
      (2)   Alcohol possession applies to all open or unsealed alcoholic
beverage containers. Such containers are not allowed on the job or on town
premises, unless their possession is part of an authorized official event.
Possession of such containers in vehicles used for town business is never
authorized.
   (E)   Reporting violations.
      (1)   Employees must as a condition of employment abide by the terms of
this section and report any conviction to the town under a criminal drug
statute for violations occurring on or off town premises when conducting Town
business. Report of a conviction must be made to the town within five business
days after the conviction. The town will then notify the appropriate
contracting officer within ten days after receiving notice from either the
employee or from another source. (These requirements are mandated by the Drug-
Free Workplace Act of 1988.)
      (2)   An employee who is involved with off-the-job illegal drug activity
may be considered in violation of this section. In determining whether
disciplinary action will be imposed for this activity, the town will consider
the circumstance of each incident, including but not limited to any adverse
effect the employee's actions may have on its customers, other employees, the
public, or the town's reputation and image.
      (3)   Any questions regarding the reporting of violations should be
directed to the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (F)   Employee rehabilitation.
      (1)   Health maintenance is primarily a personal responsibility and it is
the individual's responsibility to correct unsatisfactory job performance or
behavioral problems caused by alcohol or drug abuse. In an effort to assist
employees, the town will provide various means for employees and their family
members to remain aware of the dangers of substance abuse in the workplace and
to overcome drug and alcohol related problems.
      (2)   Employees with a personal alcohol or drug-related problem are
encouraged to volunteer to participate in an approved rehabilitation program
upon referral from the Employee and Family Assistance Program before work
performance becomes affected.
      (3)   Participation in a rehabilitation program will not be considered a
barrier to employment nor a cause for disciplinary action. Employees will not
be disciplined merely because of participation in a rehabilitation program or
excused from the disciplinary consequences of conduct which is in violation of
this section or any other town policies or job requirements.
      (4)   Any employee identified through a town investigation as having a
substance abuse problem also may not avoid disciplinary action by requesting to
participate in an approved rehabilitation program.
      (5)   Circumstances in each case will be evaluated to determine the
course of action to be taken (that is, whether the employee will be offered the
opportunity to participate in a rehabilitation program and/or will be subject
to discipline.)
   (G)   Testing.
      (1)   The town will ask employees to submit to random alcohol or drug
tests.
      (2)   Alcohol or drug tests may be required for employees in the
following circumstances:
         (a)   When unsatisfactory job performance or other employee behavior
is reasonably indicative of substance abuse.
         (b)   During and after participation in a drug or alcohol
rehabilitation program for a reasonable period of time as determined by the
town.
         (c)   When required by law.
      (3)   If a supervisor identifies an employee with a behavior pattern and/
or job performance reasonably indicative of substance abuse, the supervisor
(with the concurrence of the next level of supervision) may recommend that the
employee have a fitness for duty examination by a physician designated by the
town. The physician will determine whether a fitness for duty examination is
necessary and whether alcohol or drug tests will be required.
      (4)   Pre-employment drug testing is part of the pre-employment physical.
The method of testing will be determined by the town. Applicants who test
positive for prohibited drugs in their systems will not be offered employment.
Any questions regarding reapplication opportunities should be directed to the
Clerk-Treasurer.

by a private wastewater disposal system, as provided in § 50.02(D), a direct
connection shall be made to the public sewer within 90 days in compliance with
this chapter. At such time, the private wastewater disposal system shall be
abandoned, which in the case of aseptic system means that the septic tank must

§ 50.06 UTILITY POLICY AND PROCEDURE RELATING TO CUSTOMER SOCIAL SECURITY
NUMBERS.
   (A)   Applicants for utility services, to be provided by the town’s water
utility and/or sewage works, will be asked and expected to provide, on their
application, their complete social security number, along with valid contact
information and other information needed by the town in order to identify the
applicant and the property for which they are requesting service.
   (B)   An applicant for utility services, to be provided by the town’s water
utility and/or sewage works, as an alternative to providing their social
security number, may instead: 1) provide their driver’s license number; and 2)
pay a deposit in the amount of $125 for sewer service and $125 for water
service. Those deposits shall be in addition to all other deposits required by
the town. Those deposits shall be held by the town for as long as the applicant
remains a customer of the town’s water utility and/or sewage works and will be
returned when service is terminated and all utility charges paid in full. If a
customer fails to pay to the town, on time, any recurring or nonrecurring
utility charges, the town may apply the amounts on deposit against the
customer’s past due balance and that customer will be required to replenish
(deposit again) the amount applied as a condition of continued service.

be connected with the treatment works, or otherwise discharges sanitary sewage,
industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either directly or indirectly, into
the treatment works of the town. If a lot, parcel of land, or building is
occupied by someone other than the owner, the owner shall be jointly and
severally liable for the charges incurred by the occupant. Such rates and
charges shall be payable as hereinafter provided and shall be in an amount
determined as hereinafter provided.
   (B)   Except as herein otherwise provided, each user shall pay for the
services provided by the treatment works based on the amount of water used on
the property as determined by water meter readings (or other appropriate
methods) acceptable to the Town Council, plus a user and debt service charge as
hereinafter set forth.
   (C)   For industrial, institutional and commercial users, monthly user
charges will be based on either actual water usage or a flat monthly charge, or
a combination thereof. If a commercial, institutional, or industrial user has
an unusually high amount of consumptive use of water, or, in some other manner,
uses an unusually high amount of water which is not discharged into the
wastewater collection system, the user may request that the Town Council
authorize the user charge for that user to be based on readings of a wastewater
meter(s) or separate water meter(s) installed and maintained at the user's
expense.
   (D)   (1)   Each user shall pay a user charge rate for operation and
maintenance, replacement and debt service, according to schedule that follows.
The monthly volume charge shall be based upon the quantity of water used per
month, as measured by the water meter there in use and as applied in 1,000
gallon increments. For users inside the town limits, charges shall be effective
upon connection of the property to the treatment works or expiration of the
time period provided in the notice to connect, whichever first occurs.
      (2)   The rates and charges shown on the schedule set forth in
subdivision (D)(3) of this section are just and equitable fees as required to
maintain the sewage works in the sound physical and financial condition
necessary to render adequate and efficient service and sufficient to:
         (a)   Pay all expenses incidental to the operation of the works,

      (4)   Credits. Water that is used to irrigate or sprinkle yards or to
fill swimming pools is not discharged into the town's sanitary sewer system.
Accordingly, the town makes available to customers of its sewage works the
flowing credits:
         (a)   Yard sprinkling credit.
            1.   The current owner or occupant of real estate served by the
town's sewage works must apply for a sprinkling credit prior to May 1 of the
calendar year for which the credit is sought. If application for the sprinkling
credit is not made prior to May 1st, the credit will not apply until the
following calendar year. Applications for subsequent years will not be required
unless ownership or possession of the property changes.
            2.   For those customers who apply for a sprinkling credit
(eligible customers), the monthly water usage recorded for their property for
the prior months of October through April will be averaged (the winter
average). For eligible customers who have not owned or occupied their property
beginning with the prior October 1, the winter average shall be deemed to be
6,000 gallons for the following year.
            3.   Then, for the months of May through September (bills for which
are printed and mailed in June through October), eligible customers will be
billed for water usage equal to their winter average plus 2,000 gallons. This
amendment shall be effective as of May 1, 2008.
            4.   New or existing sewage works customers may apply for a “sod
credit” against their monthly sewer charge. The sod credit shall be for a
maximum of 60 days or two billing cycles. To be eligible for the sod credit,
customers must apply in writing, and the customer must state they are
installing new sod for a new home or are replacing their entire yard with new
sod. Credit can be made for usage in excess of 9,000 gallons during a 60-day
period or two billing cycles, unless customer history supports a normal usage
greater than 9,000 gallons during such billing cycle, in which event, no credit
shall be given.
         (b)   Pool credit. Customers shall make yearly written application for
a “pool credit.” Such application shall include the dimensions of the pool to
be filled and the month in which the pool will be filled. The customer's
average usage shall be checked to verify that the pool was actually filled and
the calculated amount of water was used. If not, the pool credit is disallowed.
      (5)   Effective immediately after a contract for the construction of
sewage works has been let and actual work has commenced, each user inside the
corporate limits shall pay an interim charge for interest on the revenue bonds
and other expenses payable before the completion of the work on a flat fee
basis, according to the following schedule:
 
Interim Charge                Monthly Charge
Users inside corporate limits $3.50
 
      (6)   Connection fee. Based on the town’s utility superintendent’s
estimates of costs incurred by the town to make a physical connection to the
town’s sewage works collection system, the Council hereby sets the new
connection fee for all future sewage works connections, made after December 31,
2022, at $1,800.
   (E)   For those users whose wastewater has a greater strength than normal
domestic sewage, a surcharge in addition to the normal user charge, will be
collected. The surcharge for operation and maintenance including replacement
is:
      $ 0.20 per pound BOD, in excess of 250 mg/l
      $ 0.20 per pound SS, in excess of 250 mg/l
      $ 0.60 per pound Ammonia, in excess of 40 mg/l
   (F)   Any user which discharges any toxic pollutants (as defined in the
Sewer Use Ordinance) which cause an increase in the cost of managing the
effluent of the sludge from the treatment works, or any user which discharges
any substance which singly or by interaction with other substances causes
identifiable increases in the cost of operation, maintenance or replacement of
the treatment works, shall pay for such increased costs. The charge to each
such user shall be as determined by the appropriate financial personnel and
approved by the Town Council.
   (G)   The user charge rates established in this section apply to all users
of the treatment works.
   (H)   In the event a property served by the town's treatment works is
transferred to a new owner between meter readings, the user charges shall be
pro-rated to the date of transfer as shown in the records of the County
Auditor.
   (I)   New service deposits.
      (1)   As a condition of establishing new service, after December 31,
2022, the user of property to be served by the town’s sewage works shall be
required to deposit $75. The deposit, less any outstanding penalties and
service fees, shall be refunded to the depositor after a notarized statement
from the depositor that as of a certain date the property being served:
         (a)   Has been conveyed or transferred to another person; or
         (b)   No longer uses or is connected with any part of the town’s
sewage works.
      (2)   Any such statement must include the name and address of the person
to whom the property is conveyed or transferred.
      (3)   If a depositor, within 60 days after the termination of the
depositor’s use or ownership of the property served, fails to pay to the town’s
sewage works all costs and fees owed, the depositor forfeits the depositor’s
deposit and all accrued interest. The forfeited amount shall be applied to the
depositor’s outstanding fees. Any excess that remains due after application of
the forfeiture may be collected by the town as permitted by I.C. 36-9-23-31 and
I.C. 36-9-23-32. A deposit may be used to satisfy all or part of any judgment
awarded the municipality. As a condition of maintaining service, any customer
whose deposit is applied by the town toward any past due amounts owed, shall,
immediately, replenish their deposit.

§ 50.59 BILLING PROCEDURES; DELINQUENCY.
   (A)   All users shall be billed monthly. Billings for any particular month
shall be made within five days after the end of the month. Payments are due
within 15 days after the end of the month. Any payment not received within 15
days after the end of the month shall be delinquent. If the last day of the 15-
day period is a Saturday, a Sunday, a legal holiday under state statute, or a
day the billing office is closed during regular business hours, the period runs
until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday, a legal
holiday, or a day on which the billing office is closed.
   (B)   The town will assess a late payment penalty of 10% of the amount of
the delinquent rates and charges. Rates and charges not received by the town
within 15 days after they become due are delinquent. The amount of the fee, the
penalty, and a reasonable attorney's fee may be recovered by the town in a
civil action in the name of the town.
   (C)   If a fee is not paid within one monthly billing cycle after it is due,
the utility shall send notice to the delinquent user stating:
      (1)   The delinquent amount due, together with any penalty;
      (2)   That water service may be disconnected if the user continues not to
pay the delinquency and any penalty; and
      (3)   The procedure for resolving disputed bills.
   (D)   Sewer fees assessed against real property, under I.C. 36-9-23,
constitute a lien against the property assessed. A lien attaches against real
property occupied by someone other than the owner only if the town notifies the
owner not later than 20 days after the time the utility fees become 60 days
delinquent. A notice sent to the owner must be sent by first class mail or by
certified mail, return receipt requested (or an equivalent service permitted
under I.C. 1-1-7-1) to: (1) the owner of record of real property with a single
owner; or (2) at least one of the owners of real property with multiple owners;
at the last address of the owner for the property as indicated in the records
of the County Auditor on the date of the notice of the delinquency, or to
another address specified by the owner, in a written notice to the utility, at
which the owner requests to receive a notice of delinquency under this
division. The cost of sending notice under this division is an administrative
cost that may be billed to the owner.
   (E)   Payment of a disputed bill and penalties by a user does not constitute
a waiver of rights to subsequently claim and recover from the town sums
improperly charged to the user.
   (F)   If the user fails to pay the delinquent amount or otherwise resolve
the charges, the utility of the town shall give written notice to the water
utility serving the user to discontinue water service to the premises
designated in the notice until notified otherwise. The notice shall identify
the delinquent sewer user in enough detail to enable the water utility to
identify the water service connection that is to be terminated. Upon receipt of
the notice, the water utility shall disconnect water service to the user.
   (G)   Water service may not be shut off under this section if a local board
of health has found and certified to the town that the termination of water
service will endanger the health of the user and others in the town.
   (H)   Except as provided in the following divisions (1) and (2) hereof, the
utility shall enforce the payment of the charges and penalties assessed under
this chapter.
      (1)   The utility may defer enforcing the collection of unpaid fees and
penalties assessed under this chapter until the unpaid fees and penalties have
been due and unpaid for at least 90 days;
      (2)   The Town Council may write off a fee or penalty that is for less
than $40.
   (I)   Fees and charges for sewer services assessed against real property
constitute a lien against the property assessed.
   (J)   The utility shall at least once each calendar year prepare a lien list
of the delinquent charges and penalties that are enforceable under this
section, which must include:
      (1)   The name or names of the owner or owners of each lot or parcel of
real property on which fees are delinquent;
      (2)   The description of the premises, as shown by the records of the
County Auditor; and
      (3)   The amount of the delinquent fees, together with the previously
assessed penalty, a service charge of $5, the applicable recording fee, and the
applicable release fee.
   (K)   The utility shall record a copy of each lien list with the County
Recorder and shall pay the applicable recording fee. The utility shall then
mail to each property owner on the lien list a notice stating that a lien
against the owner's property has been recorded.
   (L)   Using the lien lists prepared under division (J) and recorded under
division (K), after September 1 of the preceding calendar year and before
September 1 of the current calendar year, the utility shall before December 15
of each year certify to the County Auditor a list of the liens that remain
unpaid for collection in the next May.
   (M)   The utility shall release any recorded lien when the delinquent fees,
penalties, service charges, and recording and release fees have been fully
paid.
   (N)   After the date of certification in each year, the utility shall not
collect or accept delinquent fees, penalties, service charges, recording fees,
or certification fees from property owners whose property has been certified to
the County Auditor.

§ 50.60 REPORT OF WASTEWATER CHARACTERISTICS; REVISION OF RATES.
   All users contributing more than 20,000 gallons per month and whose waste
strength is greater than 250 mg BOD/1 or 250 mg SS/1 shall prepare and file
with the Town Council a report that shall include pertinent data relating to
the wastewater characteristics, including the methods of sampling and
measurement to obtain these data, and these data shall be used to calculate the
user charge for that user. The Town Council shall have the right to gain access
to the waste stream and take its own samples. Should the Town Council do so and
should the results be substantially different as determined by Town Council
from the data submitted by the user, the user charge for that user shall be
revised for the next billing cycle/period.
(Ord. 249, passed 5-11-98)
§ 50.61 DISPUTE OF CHARGES.
   (A)   If a user disputes charges contained in a bill, the user may present
such dispute in writing to the utility which is authorized to correct incorrect
charges. In order to be eligible for a correction under this section a user
must present supporting written information indicating that the charges
contained on the bill do not fairly reflect the amount of water used on the
property. A verified leak of water that does not enter the town's treatment
works is considered good cause for an adjustment if the user has otherwise
satisfied the requirements for an adjustment or correction of their bill,
including satisfying minimum water volume requirements. If a request for
correction is rejected by the utility, the user may make written application to
the Town Council requesting a review of his or her user charge pursuant to
divisions (B) and (C) of this section. In order to be eligible for
consideration under this section, billing disputes must be presented to the
utility within 12 months of the date the disputed bill was issued by the town.
   (B)   Any user who believes the volume portion of their user charge is
unjust and inequitable may make written application to the Town Council
requesting a review of the volume portion of their user charge. The written
request shall, where necessary, show the actual or estimated average flow of
water used on the property and/or strength of the user’s wastewater in
comparison with the values upon which the charge is based, including how the
measurements or estimates were made.
   (C)   Review of the request shall be made by the Town Council and if the
Town Council determines that the charges appealed by the user are unjust and
inequitable, the user charges for that user shall be recomputed based on the
revised flow and/or strength data as determined by the Town Council, and the
new charges shall be reflected in the bill for the next billing cycle/period.

§ 50.62 ANNUAL REVIEW OF CHARGES.
   (A)   The Town Council shall review the user charges at least annually and
revise the rates as necessary to ensure that adequate revenues are generated to
pay the costs of operation and maintenance including replacement and that the
system continues to provide for the proportional distribution of operation and
maintenance including replacement costs among users and user classes.
   (B)   In order to comply with the requirements contained in Federal
Regulation number 40 CFR 35.2140(c) “User Charge System,” the Town Council will
notify each user annually of the rate or the portion of the total charge for
wastewater treatment that is attributable to operation, maintenance and
replacement.

§ 51.10 PROTECTION OF PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM FROM CONTAMINATION DUE TO BACKFLOW.
   (A)   A cross connection shall be defined as any physical connection or
arrangement between two otherwise separate systems, one of which contains
potable water from the town's water system, and the other, water from a private
source, water of unknown or questionable safety, or steam, gases, or chemicals,
whereby there may be a flow from one system to the other, the direction of flow
depending on the pressure differential between the two systems.
   (B)   No person, firm, or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established or maintain or permit to be maintained any cross connection. No
interconnection shall be established whereby water from a private, auxiliary,
or emergency water supply may enter the town's distribution system, unless such
private, auxiliary, or emergency water supply and the method of connection and
use of such supply shall have been approved by the town and by the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management in accordance with 327 IAC 8-10.
   (C)   The town may, at any time and from time to time, cause inspections to
be made of all properties where cross connections with the public water system
are deemed possible.
   (D)   The town may discontinue water service to any property where any
connection in violation of this section exists, and to take such other
precautionary measures deemed necessary to eliminate any danger of
contamination of the public water system. Water service to such property shall
not be restored until the cross connection(s) has been eliminated in compliance
with the provisions of this section. If a cross connection is deemed to be an
emergency, endangering public health, safety, or welfare and requires immediate
action, and a written finding to that effect is filed with the Prince's Lakes
Public Works Superintendent and delivered to the consumer's premises, service
may be immediately discontinued.
   (E)   All consumers using toxic or hazardous liquids, all hospitals,
mortuaries, wastewater treatment plants, laboratories, and all other hazardous
users install and maintain a reduced pressure principal backflow preventer in
the main water line serving each building on the premises. The backflow
preventer must be installed in an easily accessible location not subject to
flooding or freezing.
   (F)   The reduced pressure principle backflow preventers shall not be
installed below ground level.
   (G)   This section does not supersede the Indiana Plumbing Code, the IDEM
Rule 327 IAC 8-10 or any other applicable town ordinances, but is supplementary
to them.
   (H)   In addition to IDEM Rule 327 IAC 8-10-4(c), the following customer
facilities need a backflow prevention device:
      (1)   All carbonated drink mixers and dispensers that use CO2.
      (2)   All irrigation systems that are connected, at any point, directly
or indirectly, with the public water supply.
   (I)   If, in the judgment of the town's Utility Superintendent, an approved
backflow prevention device is necessary for the safety of the public water
system, the Superintendent will give notice to the water consumer to install
such an approved device immediately.

      (1)   As a condition of establishing new service, after December 31,
2022, the user of property to be served by the town’s water utility shall be
required to deposit $75. The deposit, less any outstanding penalties and
service fees, shall be refunded to the depositor after a notarized statement
from the depositor that as of a certain date the property being served:
         (a)   Has been conveyed or transferred to another person;
         (b)   Is no longer occupied or under the control of the depositor; or
         (c)   No longer uses or is connected with any part of the town’s water
utility.

depositor’s use, control, or ownership of the property served, fails to pay to
the town’s water utility all costs and fees owed, the depositor forfeits the
depositor’s deposit and all accrued interest. The forfeited amount shall be
applied to the depositor’s outstanding fees. Any excess that remains due after
application of the forfeiture may be collected by the town as permitted by
applicable Indiana law. A deposit may be used to satisfy all or part of any
judgment awarded the municipality. As a condition of maintaining service, any
customer whose deposit is applied by the town toward any past due amounts owed,
shall, immediately, replenish their deposit.

   To secure the proper enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, the
appropriate authorities of the town may pursue any or a combination of the
following remedies as they deem appropriate:
   (A)   Taking into custody and impounding any animal found to be kept in
violation of any provision applicable under this chapter;
   (B)   If the violation is a violation only of this chapter, and is not
concurrently a violation of a state statute, citing the owner of the animal for
a town ordinance violation;
   (C)   If the violation constitutes an infraction or crime under state
statute, citing or arresting the owner of the animal accordingly; and/or
   (D)   Seeking an injunction in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to
I.C. 36-1-6-4.
(Ord. 402, passed 11-20-17)
§ 91.13 IMPOUNDED ANIMALS.
   (A)   The town may retain or cause to be retained an impounded animal,
either in town facilities or the facilities of a cooperating state or county
agency, for a period of time deemed necessary and appropriate under the
circumstances. If the animal is a wild animal, of a species indigenous to
Indiana, that no person has a lawful right to possess, is deemed to pose no
unusual threat to humans or livestock, and is sufficiently mature to care for
itself in the wild, the town may, as permitted by applicable federal, state,
and county laws and regulations, release the animal back into the wild.
   (B)   Upon the expiration of applicable time periods, the town or a
cooperating agency may humanely destroy or otherwise lawfully dispose of an
impounded animal. An impounded domestic animal shall be kept for at least five
days. If the owner of an impounded domestic animal is known, the town shall, as
soon as is practicable, notify that owner of the animal's impoundment.
   (C)   Unless a court, or a state or county officer having proper authority
orders the continued detention of an animal, the owner of an impounded domestic
animal, other than an animal impounded for violation of I.C. 35-46-3, may
reclaim the animal, prior to its destruction or other disposition as set forth
herein, by paying to the town the following fees:
      (1)   A charge of $25 for initial capture of the animal; and
      (2)   A charge of $10 per day for boarding and feeding the animal.
   (D)   If the town delivers the animal to a cooperating agency, the above
charges shall nevertheless apply for the time that the animal is in the town's
custody, and an additional fee of $25 for transporting the animal shall apply.
These charges and fees are in addition to any penalties or costs assessed under
this chapter. Any cooperating agency into whose custody an animal is delivered
may charge and collect its own usual and standard fees from the person
reclaiming the animal for the period of time the animal was in its custody. An
animal impounded by reason of a suspected violation of I.C. 35-46-3 shall be
deemed in protective custody and may not be released to its owner except as
permitted by and in compliance with the provisions of I.C. 35-46-3.
(Ord. 402, passed 11-20-17)
§ 91.14 AUTHORITY TO DESTROY VICIOUS ANIMALS.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the town, acting by and
through its Town Marshal and Police Department may immediately destroy any
vicious animal that cannot be safely captured or kept in custody by usual and
customary means or which is observed attacking a person or other animal.
(Ord. 402, passed 11-20-17)
§ 91.99 PENALTY.
   Any person violating this chapter may be fined by the town up to $300 per
occurrence, in addition to penalties imposed by Indiana state statute.

   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this subchapter shall be to set standards for
residences and other structure numbering and road naming in the town, and
establish the authority and numbering and road naming in the town, and
establishing the authority and methods to be used when assigning addresses to
properties in the town. These standards shall be used in the implementation of

(Ord. 236, passed 6-23-97)
§ 94.34 PROPERTY ADDRESS NUMBERING SYSTEM.
   (A)   Advantages of a property address numbering system. A street numbering
system and corresponding property addresses provide individual structure with
an exact geographic location in the town. Town-type street/road addresses are
necessary in order to provide a structure with a specific and more accurate
identification for efficient mail delivery; to provide an easily identifiable
geographic reference point for quick dispatch of police, fire, and emergency
rescue equipment; and to provide ease of location identification for friends,
service vehicles or other individuals trying to locate a specific structure or
town road. A numbering system should make it easy for anyone to find the
location of a town road residential property in a short period of time and
allow for a systematic expansion of address numbers as community growth occurs.
   (B)   The system employed. The town will structure the naming of its road
system and the issuance of property address based on the system and method
approved by the Plan Commission.
   (C)   Property numbering intervals. Street addresses will be assigned in
order and frequency as determined by the Plan Commission.

commercial, industrial, and public structures located in the town shall be

been assigned by the Plan Commission, it shall be the responsibility of the
property owner to provide visible and current address numbers on both the
structure and the mailbox. Also, if the structure is not visible from the road
and the mailbox is not by the drive, a 4x4 post must be staked at the entrance
to the drive with three-inch numbers on it. The letters and numbers on the
mailbox must all be in compliance with U.S. Postal Service regulations and
recommendations. The lettering shall be in contrast to its background. The
address shall be placed on both sides of the mailbox, when possible. The
letters and numbers placed on structure shall be at least three inches in
height. The letters and numbers shall be placed on the mail level in a location
which faces the street upon which it is addressed.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Town Council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 334, passed 7-16-07; Am. Ord. 393, passed 3-20-17)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 334, passed 7-16-07; Am. Ord. 393, passed 3-20-17)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood
damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
   (F)   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and
their contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 334, passed 7-16-07; Am. Ord. 393, passed 3-20-17)
§ 151.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains;
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood-blight
areas; and,
   (G)   To ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in
a flood area.
(Ord. 334, passed 7-16-07; Am. Ord. 393, passed 3-20-17)
§ 151.05 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snow melt, or a combination of both. In A zones,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1 -
A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM or FHBM. The definitions
are presented below:
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply.
      (2)   ZONES AE and A1 - A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements
apply. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1 - A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% chance shallow flooding
(usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one
and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses
are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements
apply.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.
      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection. Mandatory flood insurance
purchase requirements apply.
      (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99  may only be used when the flood protection system
has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements
apply.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE or APPURTENANT STRUCTURE. A structure that is located on
the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory
structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay
sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular
program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   DEVELOPMENT.
      (1)   Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate including
but not limited to:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any

operations;
         (f)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
         (g)   Storage of materials; or
         (h)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
      (2)   DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the maintenance of
existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing
roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent
structures.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE.  A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter
walls, pilings, or columns (posts and piers).
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE.  A certified statement that verifies a structure's
elevation information.
   EMERGENCY PROGRAM.  The first phase under which a community participates in
the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first-layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   ENCROACHMENT. The advance or infringement of uses, fill, excavation,
buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may
impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION.  Any structure for which the “start of construction”
commenced before the effective date of the community's first floodplain
ordinance.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FIVE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD (500-YEAR FLOOD).  The flood that has a 0.2% chance
of being equaled or exceeded in any year.

of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM).  An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration
(FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). An official map of a community, issued by
FEMA, where the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been
identified as Zone A.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM).  An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. FLOODPLAIN includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to
as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention
ordinance, and floodplain management requirements.
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See also FREEBOARD.)
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT FACILITY. A facility which cannot be used for its
intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to
water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and
unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood
processing facilities. The term does not include long-term storage,
manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   HARDSHIP (as related to variances of this chapter). The exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Town
Council requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the
property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment to the currently effective FEMA
map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA. A LOMA is only
issued by FEMA.
   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the currently
effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations,
and elevations.
   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision by
letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.
   LOWEST FLOOR means the lowest of the following:
      (1)   The top of the lowest level of the structure;
      (2)   The top of the basement floor;
      (3)   The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of
the structure;
      (4)   The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or
pillars;
      (5)   The top of the first floor of a structure constructed with a crawl
space, provided that the lowest point of the interior grade is at or above the
BFE and construction meets requirements of division (6)(a) below; or
      (6)   The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement,
below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters,
by providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows)
having a total net area of one square inch for every one square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding. The bottom of all such openings shall be no
higher than one foot above grade; and
         (b)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. MANUFACTURED HOME
does not include a recreational vehicle.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MAP AMENDMENT. A change to an effective NFIP map that results in the
exclusion from the SFHA of an individual structure or a legally described
parcel of land that has been inadvertently included in the SFHA (i.e. no
alterations of topography have occurred since the date of the first NFIP map
that showed the structure or parcel to be within the SFHA).
   MAP PANEL NUMBER. The four-digit number followed by a letter suffix assigned
by FEMA on a flood map. The first four digits represent the map panel, and the
letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised.
(The letter A is not used by FEMA, the letter B is the first revision.)
   MARKET VALUE. The building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or
adjusted assessed values.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation
is two-fold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD). As corrected in 1929, is a vertical
control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within
the floodplain.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for which the “start of construction”
commenced after the effective date of the community's first floodplain
ordinance.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   OBSTRUCTION. Including, but not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization,
bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD (100-YEAR FLOOD). The flood that has a 1% chance of
being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with
the letter A is subject to the 1% annual chance flood. See also REGULATORY
FLOOD.
   ONE-PERCENT (1%) ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD.  The flood that has a 1% chance of
being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with
the letter A is subject to the 1% annual chance flood. See also REGULATORY
FLOOD.
   PARTICIPATING COMMUNITY. Any community that voluntarily elects to

manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projections;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light

quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGULAR PROGRAM. The phase of the community's participation in the NFIP
where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and
higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations
determined in a FIS.
   REGULATORY FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable
to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is
as defined in §
151.07. REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the terms BASE FLOOD, ONE-PERCENT
ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD, and 100-YEAR FLOOD.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period ending on the date of the event for

structure at the time of each such flood event.
   SECTION 1316. That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided
for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly
constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to
be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that
intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood-prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdictions
(including extraterritorial jurisdictions) of the town subject to inundation by
the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the town are generally identified as such on
the Flood Insurance Rate Map of Johnson County and Incorporated Areas dated
March 20, 2017, as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions,
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date.
(These areas are shown on a FIRM as Zones A, AE, Al - A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual start means the first placement or permanent construction of a
structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of
slabs or footing, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation for placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds

the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred substantial
damage or repetitive loss regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any
alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structures continued designation as a “historic structure.”
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.

Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1929 (or other datum here specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas.
   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FHBM or FIRM that reflects the severity
or type of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A.  (See A ZONE.)
   ZONE B, C, and X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)

the structure before sloping below the FPG.
      (3)   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during
flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulkheading. If vegetative cover is
used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
      (4)   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties.
      (5)   The top of the lowest floor including basements shall be at or
above the FPG.
   (F)   Standards for structures constructed with a crawlspace. A residential
or nonresidential structure may be constructed with a crawlspace located below
the flood protection grade provided that the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;

(Ord. 334, passed 7-16-07; Am. Ord. 393, passed 3-20-17)
§ 151.33 CRITICAL FACILITY.
   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities
shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and
sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be
displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above
the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. 334, passed 7-16-07; Am. Ord. 393, passed 3-20-17)
§ 151.34 IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
151.07, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential.
   (B)   If the site is in an identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway.
   (C)   Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for construction in a
floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to
the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit,
construction or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes
land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving etc.
undertaken before the actual start of construction of the structure. However,
it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to existing (lawful)
residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26 allows
construction of non-substantial additions/improvements to residences in a non-
boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in a
floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if
fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval
(construction in a floodway permit) for the fill is required from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.)
   (D)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit (when applicable) has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources granting approval for construction in a floodway.
   (E)   Once a permit for construction in a floodway has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue
the local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in
§§
151.30 through
151.36 have been met.
   (F)   The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than the
permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any)
shall take precedence.
   (G)   No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, will increase the regulatory flood more
than 0.14 of one foot; and
   (H)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data.
(Ord. 334, passed 7-16-07; Am. Ord. 393, passed 3-20-17)
§ 151.35 IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
151.30 through
151.36 have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of
any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.
(Ord. 334, passed 7-16-07; Am. Ord. 393, passed 3-20-17)
§ 151.36 SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR FLOODWAYS/
FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway or a floodplain analysis/
regulatory assessment citing the 100-year flood elevation and the recommended
flood protection grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment
approving the proposed development, a floodplain development permit may be
issued provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in §§
151.30 through
151.36 have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodway, fringe and 100-year flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
151.30 through
151.36 have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and will not increase flood damages
or potential flood damages.
(Ord. 334, passed 7-16-07; Am. Ord. 393, passed 3-20-17)
§ 151.37 AO ZONES.
   AO Zones have flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to
three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path
of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate with respect to AO Zones that
may exist in the town:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at two
feet greater than the flood depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate
Map above the highest adjacent grade.
   (B)   Drainage paths must be provided to guide floodwaters around and away
from proposed structures to be constructed on slopes.
   (C)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated two feet
greater than the flood depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
above the highest adjacent grade; and
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely floodproofed to the specified flood level so that any space below
that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is
required as per §
151.31(C).
(Ord. 393, passed 3-20-17)

   ZONING DISTRICTS AND OFFICIAL MAP
§ 152.020 ZONING DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED AND DEFINED.
   (A)   To classify, regulate, and restrict the use of land and structures,
the town is hereby divided into, or provisions are hereby made for future
division into, the following zoning districts. Furthermore, these districts
have been established to encourage the most appropriate use of land within the
town, to protect property values, to regulate the intensity of land use, and to
promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the public.
   (B)   Single-Family Residential Districts. The Residential Districts are
intended to be limited to dwellings and public or semi-public uses which are
normally associated with residential neighborhoods. The only uses permitted in
residential districts are those which would not detract from the residential
character of the neighborhood. The purpose of these two districts is to create
an attractive, stable and orderly residential environment. However, the
property development regulations vary among the districts in order to provide
for the various housing needs and designs of citizens.
   (C)   General Business District. The General Business District is created to
provide for local or neighboring business uses that will be compatible with
adjoining residential areas. The GB District is designed to provide for
commercial, office, public and semi-public structures which are to be typically
much less commercial in appearance and architecturally harmonious with
residential structures. This district is intended to provide for the services
necessary to support local neighborhoods and their residents.
   (D)   Flood Hazard District (FH). Flood hazard zoning has been created to
protect the public health and to reduce the financial burdens which may be
imposed on the community, its governmental units and its citizens as a result
of improper use of lands which are subject to periodic flooding. Construction
or development of the flood hazard areas of the town could result in the
potential loss of life and property, create health and safety hazards and lead
to extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief. Since
development of these areas is not essential to the orderly growth of the
community these lands are to be reserved for suitable open space uses that do
not require structures or fill.

adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.
   (B)   The official zoning map shall be identified by the Chairperson of the
Plan Commission with the date of the adoption of this chapter.
   (C)   No changes of any nature shall be made in the official zoning map or
matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this
chapter. Any unauthorized change of whatever kind by any person or persons
shall be considered a violation of this chapter and punishable as provided
under
§ 152.999.
   (D)   The official zoning map shall be located in the Town Hall and shall be
the final authority as to the current zoning status of land and water areas,
building, and other structures in the town.
   (E)   In the event that the official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed,
lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature and number of changes and
additions, the Plan Commission may by resolution adopt a new official zoning
map. The new official zoning map may correct drafting or other errors or
omission in the prior official zoning map. The new official zoning map shall be
identified by the signature of the Chairperson of the Plan Commission under the
following words:
   “This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map of the Town of
Prince's Lakes, adopted this        day of             , and hereby supersedes
and replaces any and all previous zoning maps.
                        
   Plan Commission Chairman

§ 152.022 RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the
official zoning map, the following rules shall apply:
   (A)   Center lines of streets. Boundaries indicated as approximately
following the center lines of streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed
to follow such center lines; and
   (B)   Platted lot lines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following
platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines; and
   (C)   Town limits. Boundaries indicated as approximately following town
limits shall be construed as following such town limits; and
   (D)   Railroad lines.  Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines
shall be construed to be midway between the main tracks; and
   (E)   Conflicts to official zoning map. Where physical or cultural features
existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the official zoning
map, or in other circumstances not covered by divisions (A) through (D) above,
the Board of Zoning Appeals shall interpret the district boundaries.
   (F)   Lots divided by district boundaries. Where a district boundary line
divides a lot which was in single ownership at the time of passage of this
chapter, the Board of Zoning Appeals may permit, as a special exception, the
extension of the regulations for either portions of the lot not to exceed 50
feet beyond the district line into the remaining portion of the lot.

   DISTRICT REGULATIONS
§ 152.035 PERMITTED USES AND SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
   The permitted uses for each district are listed in the following Table A. A
proposed use not specifically listed shall not be permitted, unless the Plan
Commission determines, in its discretion, that it is similar enough to a listed
use that it should be permitted and deems it to be a permitted use. In which
case, the proposed use will be permitted only in those zoning classifications
in which the use to which it is deemed to be most similar is permitted. The
special exceptions for each district that may be permitted by the Board of
Zoning Appeals are also shown in Table A. The Board shall follow provision of
this and other applicable sections when considering any application for a
special exception.

Notes to Table B:
1.   Setback lines: Setback dimensions given are based upon the
requirements for a local street. Other more stringent setbacks shall be
required if adjacent to a higher type of thoroughfare (see
§ 152.036(C)).
2.   Open space not to be counted for two structures: An open space or
lot area required for an existing building or structure shall not be
counted as open space for any other building or structure.
3.   Eaves, cornices, sills, porches: Open eaves, cornices, window
sills, and belt courses may project into any required yard a distance
not to exceed four feet. Open uncovered porches or open fire escapes may
project into a front or rear yard a distance not to exceed five feet.
4.   Minimum lot size, cover, and street frontage: A street or alley
shall form the direct and primary means of ingress and egress for all
dwelling units. Accessory buildings which are not a part of the main
building may be built in the rear yard but shall not cover more than 20%
of the rear yard.
5.   Attached or detached garages: An attached or detached private
garage which faces on a street shall not be located closer than 25 feet
to the edge of the street.
6.   Lakeside yard restrictions: The location of buildings or structures
erected in the lakeside yard shall be governed by
§ 152.068 of this chapter.
 
   (B)   Lot and yard requirements. The minimum lot area, width of frontage,
width of lot, width of side yards, depth of front and rear yards, maximum
building heights, floor area ratio and minimum floor areas for each district
shall be as shown in Table B (some district development standards may vary from
the standards defined herein - see district requirements and notes to Table B).
   (C)   Setback requirements. The below shown setbacks are considered to be
minimums. The Plan Commission may prescribe greater setbacks if either the
proposed use or the condition of the area, in the discretion of the Plan
Commission, warrant such greater setbacks. Yards, having a minimum depth in
accordance with the following setback requirements, shall be provided along al
public street right-of-way lines, and building setback lines shall be as
follows:
      (1)   Collector streets. As designated on the comprehensive plan of the
town.
      (2)   Local streets or cul-de-sacs. No part of any structure shall be
built closer than 25 feet to any right-of-way line of a local street or cul-de-
sac, except where more restrictive requirements are otherwise provided for in
this chapter. Additionally, it shall be further provided, that in any block in
which an existing yard depth is established (by existing legally established
structures within the same district) for more than 25% of the frontage of the
block (or a distance of 400 feet, whichever is the lesser), the required yard
depth and setback for any new building shall be the average of such established
yards.
      (3)   Established setbacks. 
         (a)   If 25% or more of the lots on one side of the street between two
intersecting streets are improved with buildings all of which have observed an
average setback line greater than the minimum setback requirements for that
specific zoning district, and no building varies more than six feet from this
average setback line, then no building shall be erected closer to the street
line than the minimum setback so established by the existing buildings.
         (b)   If 25% or more of the lots on one side of the street between two
intersecting streets are improved with buildings all of which have observed an
average setback line less than the minimum setback requirements for that
specific zoning district, and no building varies more than six feet from this
average setback line, then it shall be permissible to erect a building as close
to the street line as the average setback line so established by the existing
building; provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to corner lots
or lots having frontage on more than one street.
   (D)   Height restrictions. The following requirements are intended to
provide exception to or qualify and supplement as the case may be, the specific
district regulations set forth in division (B) above and in each of the
individual district's developmental regulations.
      (1)   Measurements. In measuring heights, a habitable basement or attic
shall be counted as a story. A story in a sloping roof, the area of which story
at a height of four feet above the floor does not exceed two-thirds of the area
of the story immediately below it and which does not contain an independent
apartment, shall be counted as half story. Height shall be measured from ground
level to the highest point of the building.
      (2)   Projections not for human occupancy. Chimneys, elevators, poles,
spires, tanks, towers, and other projections not used for human occupancy may
extend above the height limit.
      (3)   Public and semi-public buildings. Houses of worship, schools,
hospitals, sanatoriums and other public and semipublic buildings may exceed the
height limitation of the district if the minimum depth of rear yards and the
minimum width of the side yards required in district are increases one foot for
each two feet by which the height of such public or semi-public structure
exceeds the prescribed height limitation.

such square feet requirements, provided the average size of all lots within the
approved plat shall then be at least equal to the minimum lot area requirements
for the district involved provided the lots are served by sanitary sewers.
         (b)   When not serviced by a public sanitary sewer system the minimum
lot area for a single-family dwelling shall be increased to a minimum of 40,000
square feet for those areas with an RS1 zoning classification. The minimum lot
area for a single-family dwelling shall be increased to 80,000 square feet for
those areas with a zoning classification of RR. The Plan Commission shall

      (1)   Within the districts established by this chapter or by amendments
that may be adopted later, there exist:
         (a)   Nonconforming uses; and
         (b)   Nonconforming structures; and
         (c)   Nonconforming uses of land and structures in combination, which
were lawful before the effective date of this chapter, but which would be
prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter.
      (2)   It is the purpose of this chapter to prohibit the enlargement,
expansion, or extension of such nonconforming lots, structures, and uses.
   (B)   Existing uses. Any lawful lot, structure, or use of land existing at
the effective date of this chapter which will become a nonconforming use by the
terms of this chapter shall not be considered to be in violation of this
chapter. However, any such lot, structure, or use shall be subject to their
continuance, change, or discontinuance.
   (C)   Buildings under construction. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this
chapter shall be interpreted to require a change in the plans, construction, or
designated use of any building on which a valid building permit was issued
prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
   (D)   Nonconforming uses of land. Any use of land having lawful existence at
the effective date of adoption or amendment to this chapter which does not
conform to the provisions of this chapter may be continued, subject to the
following provisions:
      (1)   Nonconforming uses shall not be extended to occupy a greater land
area or replaced by another use not specifically permitted in the zoning
district;
      (2)   If any nonconforming uses of land are discontinued or abandoned for
more than six months, any subsequent use of land shall conform to the
requirements specified by this chapter for the district in which the land is
located;
      (3)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
chapter shall be erected in connection with the nonconforming land use.
   (E)   Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that could not now be
built under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot
coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, bulk, or other requirements
concerning the structure, such a structure may be continued so long as it
remains lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   The nonconforming structure may not be enlarged or altered in any
way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may
be altered to decrease its nonconformity;
      (2)   A non residential, nonconforming structure damaged to the extent of
more than 50% of its fair market value shall not be reconstructed except in
conformity with all then current provisions of this chapter. With regard to a
non-residential, nonconforming structure damaged to the extent of less than 50%
of its fair market value and all residential nonconforming structures damaged
to any extent, the provisions of this chapter that were applicable at the time
of original construction of the nonconforming use shall apply. This exception,
however, relates only to this chapter and does not except or affect any other
applicable town ordinances, federal, state, or county laws, rules, codes, and
regulations that may apply;
      (3)   If a structure is moved for any reason for any length of distance,
it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is
located after the move.
   (F)   Nonconforming uses of structure and land in combination. If a lawful
use involving individual structures, or if a structure and land use in
combination, exist at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this
chapter, the lawful use may be continued subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   No existing structures devoted to a use not permitted by this
chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, constructed,
reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered, except in changing the use to a
use permitted in the district.
      (2)   A non-conforming use may be extended throughout any part of the
building which was arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or
amendment of the regulations of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended
to occupy land outside such a building.
      (3)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and land, may upon appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more
appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting
such a change, the Board of Zoning Appeals may require appropriate conditions
and safeguards in accordance with other provisions of this chapter;
      (4)   Any structure or combination of structures and land where
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not be resumed;
      (5)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, combination of structure
and land is discontinued or abandoned for more than six months, the structure
or structure and land combination, shall thereafter only be used on conformity
with the regulations of the district in which it is located;
      (6)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
   (G)   Repairs and maintenance. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted
to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building
or part thereof declared to be unsafe by an official charge with protecting the
public safety. On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure
containing a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, provided
that the area of the nonconforming use is not increased.
   (H)   Uses under special exception provision are not nonconforming use. Any
use which is a permitted use as a special exception in district under the terms
of this chapter shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but
shall without further action be considered a conforming use.

   FLOOD HAZARD DISTRICT (FH)
§ 152.080 PURPOSE.
   Flood hazard zoning has been created to protect the public health and to
reduce the financial burdens which may be imposed on the community, its
governmental units and its citizens as a result of improper use of lands which
are subject to periodic flooding. Construction or development of the flood
hazard areas of the town could result in the potential loss of life and
property, create health and safety hazards and lead to extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief. Since development of these areas
is not essential to the orderly growth of the community these lands are to be
reserved for suitable open space uses that do not require structures or fill.
(Ord. 172, § 8-100, passed 4-5-90)
§ 152.081 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate
including, but not limited to, buildings, and other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operation.
   FLOOD HAZARD AREAS. Any flood plain district, floodway district, floodway
fringe district, or any combination thereof which is subject to inundation by
the regulatory flood or any flood plain district as delineated by Zone A on a
flood hazard boundary map.
   FLOOD or FLOODWATER. The water of any lake or watercourse which is above the
banks and/or outside the channel and banks of such watercourse.
   FLOOD PLAIN. The area adjoining the river or stream or other such body of
water which has been or may hereafter be covered by floodwaters.
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE. The lowest elevation of the lowest point in a
building at which flood waters may enter the interior of the building. This
lowest point is defined by the following:
      (1)   The lowest floor of the building (if a basement is included, the
basement floor is the lowest floor);
      (2)   The garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of the
building;
      (3)   The first floor of a building elevated on pilings or constructed on
a crawl space;
      (4)   The floor level of any enclosure below an elevated building where
the walls of the enclosure provide some resistance to the flow of flood waters;
         (a)   Unless the walls are designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on the walls by allowing entry and exit of floodwater,
through providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and
windows) having a total area one square foot for every two square feet of
enclosed floor area subject to flooding. The bottom of all such openings shall
be no higher than one foot above the enclosed area's floor;
         (b)   Such enclosed space shall be usable for nonresidential purposes
and building access;
      (5)   The level of protection provided to a nonresidential building below
which the building is designed to be water tight. The design and construction
shall be certified by a professional engineer registered under I.C. 25-31-1 or
an architect registered under I.C. 25-4-1, as being adequate to withstand the
flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors
associated with the regulatory flood.
   FLOODWAY DISTRICT That area designated as “Commission Floodway” by the
Department of Natural Resources.
   FLOODWAY FRINGE DISTRICT. Those portions of flood hazard areas lying outside
the floodway district.
   NATURAL RESOURCES. The Indiana Natural Resources Commission.
   REGULATORY FLOOD. That flood having a peak discharge which can be expected
to be equaled or exceeded on the average of once in a 100-year period, as
calculated by a method and procedure which is acceptable to and approved by the
Indiana Natural Resources Commission. This flood is equivalent to a flood
having the probability of occurrence of 1% in any given year.
   STRUCTURE. Anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the
ground, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, shed, detached
garages, cabins, mobile homes, and other similar items.

   EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
§ 152.100 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to minimize the amount of sediment and other
pollutants, resulting from soil erosion due to land disturbing activities, from
being transported off-site to adjacent public or private lands including
ditches, streams, lakes, wetlands and reservoirs.
(Ord. 172, § 9-100, passed 4-5-90)
§ 152.101 DESIGN CRITERIA, STANDARDS, AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR EROSION CONTROL
MEASURES.
   All erosion control measures including, but not limited to those required to
comply with this chapter shall meet the design criteria, standards and
specifications for erosion control measures similar to or the same as those
outlined in the Field Office Technical Guide of the USDA Soil Conservation
Service.
(Ord. 172, § 9-200, passed 4-5-90)
§ 152.102 CONTROL OF EROSION AND SEDIMENT DURING LAND DISTURBING ACTIVITIES.
   Control of erosion and sediment is the responsibility of an applicant.
Applicability and requirements are defined as follows:
   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to the following sites with land
disturbing activities:
      (1)   Those requiring a subdivision plat approval or local improvement
location permit for the construction of commercial, residential, or
institutional buildings on lots of approved subdivision plats;
      (2)   Those involving grading, removal of protective ground cover or
vegetation, excavation, land filling or other land disturbing activity
affecting a surface area of 10,000 square feet or more;
      (3)   Those involving excavation, filling, or a combination both
affecting 400 cubic yards or more of soil, sand, gravel, stone, or other
material;
      (4)   Those involving street, highway, road, or bridge construction,
enlargement, relocation, or reconstruction; and
      (5)   Those involving the laying, repairing, replacing, or enlarging of
an underground pipe or utility for a distance of 300 feet or more.
   (B)   Erosion and other sediment control requirements. The following
requirements shall be met on all sites.
      (1)   Site drainage. Sediment-laden water flowing from the site shall be
detained by temporary sediment basins. Also, water shall not be discharged in a
manner that causes erosion in the receiving channel.
      (2)   Tracking. Sediment being tracked from a site onto public or private
roadways shall be minimized. This can be accomplished initially by a well
planned layout of roads, access drives, and parking areas of sufficient width
and length. However, protective covering also may be necessary.
      (3)   Sediment removal. Public or private roadways shall be kept cleared
of accumulated sediment. If appreciable sedimentation occurs after a storm
event, the sediment shall be deposited on the parcels of land, if in the site,
from where it likely originated.
      (4)   Drain inlet protection. All storm drain inlets shall be protected
against sedimentation with straw bales, filter fabric, or equivalent barriers
meeting accepted design criteria, standards, and specifications.
      (5)   Site erosion control. The following items apply only to the time
period when land disturbing activities are taking place.
         (a)   Runoff passing through a site from adjacent areas shall be
controlled by diverting it around disturbed areas. Alternatively, the existing
channel may be improved to prevent erosion or sedimentation from occurring.
         (b)   Runoff from a disturbed area shall be controlled by one or more
of the following measures.
            1.   Barring unforeseeable weather conditions, all disturbed ground
left inactive for seven or more days shall be stabilized prior to insert
applicable date here, by seeding, sodding, mulching, covering, or by other
equivalent erosion control measures.
            2.   With disturbed areas within a site of ten acres or more, where
drainage is in the same direction or where runoff will result in loss of soil,
an abatement or recovery program is required. Where feasible, one or more
sediment basins shall be constructed. Each sediment basin shall have a depth of
at least three feet and have sufficient surface area to trap the sediment. The
size of sedimentation basin should be at least 1% of its drainage area.
Sediment shall be removed from time to time to maintain a minimum three-foot
depth. When the disturbed area is stabilized, the sediment basin can be
removed. However, if erosion is likely to continue, the sediment basin shall be
maintained by the existing or subsequent landowners. The discharge rate from a
sediment basin shall not cause scouring in the receiving channel.
            3.   With disturbed areas within a site of less than ten acres,
filter fences, straw bales, or equivalent erosion control measure, placed along
all sideslope and downslope sides of the site, shall be required. Also, if
concentrated runoff passes through the site, filter fences shall be placed
along the edges of the concentrated flow area to reduce the amount of sediment
removed from the site. However, if these measures are not sufficient to control
off-site sedimentation, a sediment basin may still be required.
         (c)   Erosion from all soil storage piles shall be controlled by
placing straw bales, filter fence, or other appropriate barriers around the
piles. Adjacent storm drain inlets shall be protected using similar filter
barriers. Moreover, any soil storage pile containing more than ten cubic yards
of material shall be located at least 25 feet upslope from a roadway or a
drainage channel. Furthermore, if remaining in existence for more than seven
days, the storage pile shall a stabilized by mulching, vegetative cover, tarps,
or other means. Storage piles containing less than ten cubic yards of material
may be located closer than 25 feet to a roadway or a drainage channel but shall
be covered with tarps or a suitable alternative if in existence for less than
seven days. However, if a pile is in existence for more than seven days,
barriers also shall be placed around the pile.
(Ord. 172, § 9-300, passed 4-5-90)
Penalty, see § 152.999
§ 152.103 MAINTENANCE OF EROSION CONTROL MEASURES.
   During the period of land disturbance at a site, all sediment basins and
other erosion control measures necessary to meet the requirements of this
chapter shall be applied by the applicant or subsequent landowner. If
sedimentation is likely to be a problem after land disturbing activities have
ceased, some or all of the sediment basins and other erosion control measures
shall be maintained by the applicant or subsequent landowner for as long as the
problem exists.
(Ord. 172, § 9-400, passed 4-5-90)
§ 152.104 PERMIT APPLICATION, EROSION CONTROL PLAN, AND PERMIT ISSUANCE.

or an irrevocable letter of credit when the erosion control plan has been
approved to guarantee a good faith execution of the erosion control plan and
any permit conditions.
      (2)   Permit conditions. The applicant is required to:
         (a)   Notify the building inspector at least 24 hours before
commencing with any land disturbing activity;
         (b)   Notify the building inspector of the completion of erosion
control measures within seven days after their installation;

         (e)   Maintain all road drainage systems, storm water drainage
systems, erosion control measures, and other facilities identified in the
erosion control plan until the project has been terminated (see
§ 152.103 for continuing maintenance responsibility);
         (f)   Where access may be legally obtained, remove sediment resulting
from land disturbing activities from adjacent surfaces and drainageways and/or
repair erosion damage to adjacent surfaces and drainages.
(Ord. 172, § 9-500, passed 4-5-90)
§ 152.105 INSPECTION.
   To ensure compliance with the erosion control plan, the administering
authority shall inspect the sites having ongoing land disturbing activities at
least once a month during the period between March 1 and November 30 and at
least twice during the period between December 1 and February 28. If land
disturbing activities are being carried out without a permit, the administering
authority shall issue a stop-work order.
(Ord. 172, § 9-600, passed 4-5-90; Am. Ord. 320, passed 5-17-04)
§ 152.106 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   The Building Inspector shall post a stop-work order if:

(Ord. 172, § 9-700, passed 4-5-90)
§ 152.107 PROJECT TERMINATION.
   (A)   An orderly and timely termination of a project with land disturbing
activities should be planned between all persons involved with a site.
   (B)   Nearing the end of the project, but prior to final land grading,
seeding, and mulching, the person holding the permit should petition, in
writing, the Building Inspector to allow the installation of utility lines on
the site. Those persons involved in the installation of utility lines shall
perform their work promptly to minimize the time period during which some of
the land may be left in a relatively unprotected state. After the utility lines
have been installed, the person holding the permit shall promptly complete all
erosion control activities.
   (C)   When a project has been completed, the person holding the permit shall
petition, in writing, the Building Inspector for approval of erosion control
measures which agree to remain on the site. The Building Inspector shall
subsequently inspect site to evaluate the adequacy of these control measures.
      (1)   If the erosion control measures are approved, any surety bonds and/
or letters of credit shall be released forthrightly. However, maintenance
responsibilities (see § 152.103) shall remain with the person owning the land.
      (2)   If the erosion control measures are not approved because they are
not in line with either the erosion control plan or the general principles of
this chapter, the Building Inspector shall notify, in writing, the person
holding the permit of unacceptable features. After a minimum period of two
weeks during which corrective measures are taken, a petition, again in writing,
may be sent asking the Building Inspector to evaluate the adequacy of the
erosion control measures. If, in good faith, the Building Inspector again
decides that the erosion control measures are inadequate, the Building
Inspector may delay the release of any surety bonds and/or letters of credit
for tip to two months. After an agreed upon time period of two months or longer
has elapsed without correct measures being taken, the Building Inspector may
use the surety bonds to finance changes or additions to the erosion control
measures needed to complete the project.

Ord. 311, passed 2-18-02)
§ 152.121 EFFECT OF ANNEXATION.
   All land annexed to the town subsequent to the adoption of this chapter
shall automatically be zoned RR low density single family residential unless
otherwise requested in the annexation ordinance or until such time as the
official zoning map is amended according to the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 172, § 4-200, passed 4-5-90)
§ 152.122 VARIANCES.
   (A)   General. The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize upon appeal in
specific cases variances from the terms of this chapter when because of special
conditions a literal enforcement of this chapter would result in unnecessary
hardship upon a specific property. No conforming use of neighboring lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district, and no permitted nonconforming
use of lands, structures, or buildings in other districts shall be considered
grounds for issuance of a variance.
   (B)   Definitions of variance. Two types of variances may be granted by the
Board of Zoning Appeals. They are as follows:
      (1)   Dimensional variance. Designed to adjust the regulations of the
zoning ordinance to the land for which the variance is granted. Generally
speaking, a dimensional variance applies to a bulk, height, area, or space
requirement of the zoning ordinance. The primary basis for granting a
dimensional variance is the showing by the applicant that a “practical
difficulty” exists if the letter of the law is strictly applied. Once granted,
a dimensional variance shall run with the land. A dimensional variance shall
not be required to obtain a building permit for a residential accessory
building or structure (such as a garage or carport) where a principal
residential structure already exists and is in use, but that all other terms
and conditions of this chapter shall apply.
      (2)   Use variance. Serves a different function than a dimensional
variance. If a zoning ordinance is valid in general, but confiscatory as
applied to a specific property, the traditional remedy is a use variance. A use
variance grants permission for a prohibited use in a given zoning district. The
primary basis for granting a use variance is the showing by the applicant that
an “unnecessary hardship” exists if the letter of the law is strictly applied.
When granted, a use variance runs with the applicant (tenant or landlord), not
with the land itself.
   (C)   Revocation of a dimensional variance. A dimensional variance shall be
deemed automatically null and void if the property, building, or structure for
which the variance was granted is for any reason demolished or destroyed. Thus,
a new replacement building or structure may be required to conform to
regulations in effect at that time. The granting of a dimensional variance
becomes official only upon issuance of an improvement location permit for the
subject property. The issuance of the permit must occur within 90 days from the
date that the improvement location permit is obtained or the permit shall
become null and void.
   (D)   Revocation of a use variance. A use variance shall be deemed
automatically null and void under any or all of the following conditions:
      (1)   If the use for which the variance was granted ceases for any
continuous period greater than six months in length;
      (2)   If the property or structures for which the variance was granted
change ownership or occupancy;
      (3)   If the applicant to whom the variance was granted fails to comply
with any of the conditions made a part of the variance;
      (4)   If the Board of Zoning Appeals discovers at some future date that
the variance has created some previously unforeseen problem, nuisance, or
hazard that is adversely affecting the health, safety, or welfare of adjacent
properties or the general public.
   (E)   Revocation procedures. Procedures for revocation of a variance shall
be as follows:
      (1)   Upon determination by the Zoning Administrator that possible
grounds for revocation of a variance exists, the mater shall be placed on the
Board of Zoning Appeals agenda for a public hearing;
      (2)   The original applicant to whom the variance was granted or his or
her successor shall be notified by certified mail of the reasons for the
possible revocation at least 30 days prior to the public hearing;
      (3)   Notice of the public hearing shall also be given as set out in
§ 152.124.
   (F)   Application standards for a variance. A variance from the terms of
this chapter shall not be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals unless and
until a written application for a variance is submitted to the Zoning
Administrator and the Board of Zoning Appeals containing:
      (1)   Name, address, and phone number of applicant;
      (2)   Any application filed by any person other than the legal owner of
the real estate involved shall be accompanied by a written statement of such
legal owner consenting to the filing of such application;
      (3)   Legal description of nature of variance requested;
      (4)   Description of nature of variance requested;
      (5)   A narrative statement demonstrating that the requested variance
conforms to each of the following standards:
         (a)   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure, or buildings in the same district;
         (b)   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this chapter;
         (c)   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
action of the applicant;
         (d)   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands,
structures, or buildings.
      (6)   There shall accompany such application for a variance a verified
statement (affidavit) by the applicant that adjoining property owners were
notified in writing at least 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing of
such application as required by
§ 152.124;
      (7)   Any applicant shall furnish a verified proof (affidavit) of at
least one publication of a notice in at least one newspaper having general
circulation within the town consistent with the requirements of
§ 152.124;
      (8)   The cost of legal advertising any required notice to affected
property owners shall be borne by the petitioners.
   (G)   Considerations prior to granting a variance. Prior to granting a
variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider the following conditions:
      (1)   The variance must not be injurious to the public health, safety,
and welfare of the town;
      (2)   The use or value of adjacent property must not be adversely
affected by the variance;
      (3)   The need for a variance must arise from some condition peculiar to
the property involved and must not exist in similar property in the same
district;
      (4)   Undue hardship as a result of strict application of the chapter
must be proven. Literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter must
be shown to deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other
properties in the same zoning district;
      (5)   The hardship must not be self-imposed from previous actions. It
should not be a purely financial hardship or a matter of convenience;
      (6)   The variance granted is the minimum variance that will make it
possible to reasonable use the land or structure.
   (H)   Supplementary conditions and safeguards. Under no circumstances shall
the Board of Zoning Appeals grant an appeal or variance which allows a use not
permissible under the terms of this chapter in the district. The Board of
Zoning Appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in
conformity with this chapter. Violations of these conditions and safeguards
when made a part of the terms under which the appeal or variance is granted,
shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and punishable under
§ 152.999.
   (I)   Public hearing for appeal and variance. The Board of Zoning Appeals
shall hold a public hearing within a reasonable length of time after a receipt
of an application for an appeal or variance for the applicant, but only after
assuring itself that legal advertisement and interested party notification
requirements as set out in § 152.124(B) and (C) have been met. However, the
public hearing shall not be held sooner than 15 days after its receipt.
   (J)   Action by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Within a reasonable length of
time after the public hearing required in division (I) above, the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall either approve, approve with conditions and safeguards, or
disapprove the request for an appeal or variance. Furthermore, the Board shall
demonstrate that the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting
of a variance to make a reasonable use of the land or buildings possible.
(Ord. 172, §§ 4-300 - 4-309, passed 4-5-90; Am. Ord. 216, passed 5-8-95)
§ 152.123 SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   General. Special exceptions or conditional uses are uses which have
unique characteristics and cannot be properly classified in any particular
zone. In each case, the impact of those uses upon neighboring land must be
given individual consideration. Special exceptions, while requiring special
consideration by the Board of Zoning Appeals, shall be deemed permitted uses in
the district in which they are provided.
   (B)   Application for a special exception. An application for a special
exception permit shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator and the Board of
Zoning Appeals by at least one owner or lessee of the property for which the
special exception is proposed. At a minimum, the application shall contain the
following information:
      (1)   Name, address, and phone number of applicant;
      (2)   Any application filed by any person other than the legal owner of
the real estate involved shall be accompanied by a written statement of such
legal owner consenting to the filing of such application;
      (3)   Legal description of the property;
      (4)   Description of existing uses;
      (5)   Zoning district;
      (6)   Description of the proposed special exception;
      (7)   A plan of the proposed site for the special exception showing the
location of all buildings, parking and loading areas, traffic access and
traffic circulation, open space, landscaping, refuse, and service areas,
utilities, signs, yards, and other information as the Board may require to
determine if the proposed special exception meets the intent and requirements
of this chapter and is appropriate for the location at which it is proposed;
      (8)   There shall accompany such application for a special exception a
verified statement (affidavit) by the applicant that adjoining property owners
were notified in writing at least 15 days prior to the date of the public
hearing of such application as required by § 152.124(C);
      (9)   Any applicant shall furnish a verified proof (affidavit) of at
least one publication of a notice in at least one newspaper having general
circulation within the town consistent with the requirements of § 152.124(B);
      (10)   The cost of legal advertising and any required notice to affected
property owners shall be borne by the petitioner.
   (C)   Considerations prior to granting a special exception. The Board of
Zoning Appeals may grant a special exception after consideration of the
appropriateness of the specific property for the use, congestion of public
streets, availability of public facilities, and impact on surrounding property.
The Board shall review the particular facts and circumstances of each proposed
use in terms of the following standards and shall find adequate evidence that
such use at the proposed locations:
      (1)   Is in fact a special exception as established under the provisions
of this chapter and appears on the official schedule of uses for the zoning
district involved;
      (2)   Will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in a manner
which is harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing character
of the area and shall not change the essential character of the area;
      (3)   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment,
and conditions of operation that will be hazardous or disturbing to any persons
or property;
      (4)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall not
create an interference with traffic on surrounding public thoroughfares;
      (5)   Will not create excessive additional requirements for public
facilities and services;
      (6)   Will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of natural,
scenic, or historic features.
   (D)   Supplementary conditions and safeguards. In granting any special
exceptions, the Board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in
conformity with this chapter. When the conditions and safeguards are made part
of the terms upon which the special exception is granted, violations shall be
deemed a violation of this chapter and punishable under
§ 152.999.
   (E)   Expiration of special exception. A special exception authorized by the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall become void if the use for which the special
exception was granted has not commenced within one year.
   (F)   Revocation of a special exception.
      (1)   Special exceptions may be revoked or modified by the Board of
Zoning Appeals after a public hearing for any one or more of the following
reasons:
         (a)   The approval was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation of the
facts;

or conditions of approval or in violation of any statute, ordinance, law, or
regulation.
      (2)   Procedure for revocation of a special exception shall be as
follows:
         (a)   Upon determination by the Zoning Administrator that possible
grounds for revocation of a special exception exists, the matter shall be

§ 153.001 TITLE.
   These regulations shall hereafter be known and cited as the Subdivision
Regulations of the Town of Prince's Lakes, Indiana.
(Ord. 174, § 100, passed 6-11-90)
§ 153.002 POLICY.
   (A)   Conformance to applicable rules and regulations.  In addition to the
requirements established herein, all subdivision plats shall comply with the
following laws, rules, and regulations:
      (1)   All applicable state and local statutory provisions;
      (2)   The town zoning ordinance, building code, and all other applicable
laws of the town;
      (3)   The comprehensive plan and official map, including all streets,
drainage systems, and parks shown on the official map or comprehensive plan as
adopted;
      (4)   The special requirements of these regulations and any rules of the
state or county health departments and/or other appropriate state agencies;
      (5)   Plat approval may be withheld if a subdivision is not in conformity
with the above guides and requirements or with the policies and purposes of
these regulations established in
§ 153.003 and
153.004 of this chapter.
   (B)   Self-imposed restrictions. If the owner places restrictions on any of
the land contained in the subdivision greater than those required by the zoning
ordinance or these regulations, such restrictions or reference thereto may be
required to be indicated on the subdivision plat, or the Commission may require
that restrictive covenants be recorded with the County Recorder in the form to
be approved by the Town Attorney.
(Ord. 174, § 101, passed 6-11-90)
§ 153.003 PURPOSES.
   The following are the purposes of these regulations:
   (A)   To protect, promote and provide for the public health, safety and
general welfare of the town;
   (B)   To guide the future development of the town in accordance with the
comprehensive plan and related policies;
   (C)   To provide for the safety, comfort, and soundness of the built
environment and related open spaces;
   (D)   To protect the compatibility, character, economic stability and
orderliness of all development through reasonable design standards;
   (E)   To guide public and private policy and action to provide adequate and
efficient public and private facilities;
   (F)   To preserve the natural beauty and topography of the town and to
insure appropriate development with regard to these natural features.
(Ord. 174, § 102, passed 6-11-90)
§ 153.004 AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION.
   (A)   This chapter, which was enacted pursuant to Indiana Home Rule and
Planning Enabling Legislation (I.C. Title 36-1-3-4 and the 36-7-4-700 series,
as amended) authorized the Plan Commission to review and approve or disapprove
plats for subdivision throughout the town, which show lots, blocks, or sites
with or without new streets or highways. This authority extends to the
development or re-subdivision of undeveloped portions of already recorded
plats.
   (B)   No improvement location permit or certificate of occupancy shall be
issued for any parcel or plat of land which was created by subdivision after
the effective date of, and not in conformity with, the provisions of these
subdivision regulations, and no excavation of land or construction of any
public or private improvements shall take place or be commenced except in
conformity with the regulations contained herein and in conformity with
construction standards adopted by the town.
(Ord. 174, § 103, passed 6-11-90)
§ 153.005 INTERPRETATION, CONFLICT AND SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   Minimum requirements. The provisions of this chapter shall be
interpreted and applied as minimum requirements.
   (B)   Conflict with public provisions. These regulations are not intended to
interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule, or regulation,
statute, or other provision of law. Where any provision of these regulations
impose restrictions different form those imposed by any ordinance, rule, or
regulation, or other provisions of law, whichever provisions are more
restrictive or impose higher standards shall control.
   (C)   Conflict with private provisions. These regulations are not intended
to abrogate any easement, covenant or any other private agreement or
restriction, provided that where the provisions of these regulations are more
restrictive the higher standards shall govern. Where such easement, covenant or
private agreement or restriction, impose duties and obligations that are more
restrictive, or higher standards than the requirements of these regulation,
then such private provisions shall be operative and supplemental to these
regulations and determinations and made thereunder.
   (D)   Severability. If any provision of this chapter or application to
particular circumstances is held invalid, the remainder of the chapter or the
application of such provision to other circumstances shall not be affected.
(Ord. 174, § 104, passed 6-11-90)
§ 153.006 SAVING PROVISION.
   These regulations shall not be construed as abating any action now pending
under, or by virtue of, prior existing subdivision regulations, or as
discontinuing, abating, modifying, or altering any penalty accruing or about to
accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm, or corporation, by
lawful action of the town except as shall be expressly provided for in these
regulations.
(Ord. 174, § 105, passed 6-11-90)
§ 153.007 RE-SUBDIVISION OF LAND.
   (A)   Procedure for re-subdivision. For any change in a map of an approved
or recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on
such map, or area reserved thereon for public use, or any lot line, or if it
affects any map or plan legally reached prior to the adoption of any
regulations controlling subdivisions, such parcel shall be approved by the
Commission by the same procedures, rules, and regulations as for subdivision.
   (B)   Procedure for subdivision where future re-subdivision is indicated.
Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or
more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are indications that
such lots will eventually be re-subdivided into smaller building sites, the
Commission may require that such parcel of land allow for the future opening of
streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. Easements providing for
the future opening and extension of such streets may be made a requirement of
the plat.
(Ord. 174, § 106, passed 6-11-90)
§ 153.008 VACATION OF PLATS.
   (A)   Any recorded plat or any part of any recorded plat may be vacated by
the owners of the premises, at any time before the sale of any lot therein, by
a written instrument, to which a copy of such plat shall be attached, declaring
the same to be vacated.
   (B)   Such an instrument shall be approved by the Commission in like manner
as plats of minor subdivisions. The town may reject any such instrument which
abridges or destroys any public rights in any of its public uses, improvements,
streets, or alleys.
   (C)   Such an instrument shall be executed, acknowledged or approved, and
recorded in the same manner as a deed to land and being duly recorded, shall
operate to terminate the effect of the plat so vacated, and to terminate all
public rights in the public ways and public grounds, and all dedications laid
out or describe in the plat or part of the plat.
(Ord. 174, § 107, passed 6-11-90)
§ 153.009 VARIANCES.
   (A)   General. Where the Commission finds that extraordinary hardships or
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations
or that justice may be served or the public interest may be served to a greater
extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve variances to these
regulations, provided that such variances to these regulations, provided that
such variances shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose
of these regulations; and further provided the Commission shall not approve
variances unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it
in each specific case that:
      (1)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other nearby property;
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property;
      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these regulations are carried out;
      (4)   The variance will not in any manner contravene the provisions of
the zoning ordinance, comprehensive plan, or official map as interpreted by the
Commission.
   (B)   Conditions. In approving variances, the Commission may require such
conditions as will, in its judgement, secure substantially the objectives of
the standards or requirements of these regulations.
   (C)   Procedures. A petition for any such variance shall be submitted in
writing by the subdivider at the time when the primary plat is filed for the
consideration of the Commission. The petition shall state fully the grounds for
the application and all of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.
(Ord. 174, § 108, passed 6-11-90)

notice and public hearing.
   (E)   Approval of construction plans.
      (1)   Submission procedure and requirements. Following the review of the
sketch plan and prior to submission of the final plat for secondary approval,
the applicant shall file three sets of detailed plans and specifications with
the Administrator.
      (2)   Review process. The Administrator shall immediately refer the plans
to the appropriate agencies for their review. If the agencies approve the
construction plans, or 14 working days elapse following their distribution
without a written response, the Administrator shall mark the plans approved and
return one set to the applicant. In no event shall secondary approval (of the
final plat) be given prior to approval of the construction plans.
      (3)   Installation of improvements. No work shall proceed on the
installation of improvements prior to approval of the construction plans. The
installation of improvements shall be inspected by a representative of the town
as directed by the Plan Commission. Such inspections are required in all
instances regardless of whether the work is performed before or after secondary
approval.
   (F)   Final plat procedure (secondary approval).
      (1)   Submission requirements. Following approval of the preliminary plat
and construction plans, the applicant shall file a request for secondary
approval of the final plat with the Administrator. The application shall:
         (a)   Be submitted on forms available at the Office of the Town Clerk-
Treasurer;
         (b)   Include the entire subdivision, or section thereof which derives
access from an existing county, or town roadway;
         (c)   Be accompanied by five copies of the final plat as described in
this chapter;
         (d)   Comply with this chapter and the terms and conditions of primary
approval;
         (e)   Be accompanied by a performance bond, if required, in a form
satisfactory to the Town Attorney. The bond shall be in an amount equivalent to
110% of the estimated cost of installing public improvements and shall
guarantee the completion of all required subdivision and off-site public
improvements;
         (f)   Be accompanied by any restrictive covenants in a form approved
by the Commission, where they have been proposed by the subdivider or required
by the Commission.
      (2)   Determination of conformance (secondary approval). In order to
secure secondary approval, a final plat must conform with the preliminary plat
approved by the Plan Commission. If the final plat deviates from the
preliminary plat that received primary approval, the plat shall be submitted to
the Commission at a public meeting for a new primary approval. The Plan
Commission may delegate authority to grant secondary approval to the
Administrator.
         (a)   If the Administrator is delegated authority to grant secondary
approval, the Administrator shall review the items submitted as per division
(F)(1) above within ten work days and shall determine conformance with all
conditions and requirements imposed as part of the primary approval. If the
plat is found to be in conformance and complete, the Administrator shall
recommend the signing of the certificate granting secondary approval.
         (b)   If the Plan Commission reviews a plat for secondary approval,
the subdivider shall request Commission review in writing no less than 30
calendar days prior to the date of the public meeting at which the final plat
is to be reviewed. The matter shall be placed on the agenda of the next regular
meeting of the Plan Commission. The Administrator shall review the proposal and
submit a written report and recommendations to the Commission and the
applicant. The Commission shall approve or disapprove the final plat. If
granted secondary approval it shall be signed by the designated officials. If
not granted secondary approval, then the subdivider shall be informed as to the
insufficiency of his submittal.
      (3)   Sectioning plats. Prior to granting secondary approval of a major
subdivision, the Commission may permit the plat to be divided into two or more
sections and may impose such conditions upon the filing of the sections as it
may deem necessary to assure the orderly development of the plat. Such sections
must contain at least 20 lots or 10% of the total number of lots contained in
the approved plat, whichever is less. The approval of all remaining sections
not filed with the Administrator shall automatically expire after five years
from the date of primary approval of the preliminary plat, unless the
expiration date has been extended.
   (G)   Signing a plat. 
      (1)   When a performance bond is required, the designated officials of
the Commission shall endorse secondary approval of the plat by signing the
certificate of approval after the bond has been approved, and all the
conditions of the primary approval have been satisfied. The certificate of
approval shall be part of the tracing cloth or reproducible mylar of the
subdivision plat. The subdivider shall provide the Town Clerk a mylar print of
the approved and fully executed plat.
      (2)   When, at the discretion of the Plan Commission, installation of
improvements is permitted in lieu of performance bonds the designated officials
of the Commission shall endorse secondary approval of the plat by signing the
certificate after all conditions of the primary approval have been satisfied
and all improvements satisfactorily completed. The developer shall provide
certified as built drawings of completed public improvements and such other
written evidence as necessary to verify that the required public facilities
have been installed in a manner satisfactory to the town.
      (3)   If the subdivider is permitted to install all improvements before
the secondary approval and it is shown that the conditions of this chapter have
been met, and if the final plat completely conforms to the primary approval,
the Commission shall have no other recourse than to grant secondary approval.
   (H)   Recording a plat. It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider in
the presence of the Administrator or his or her designate to file the plat with
the County Recorder within 30 days of the date of signature.

   STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPROVEMENTS
§ 153.040 GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Boundary improvements.
      (1)   The subdivider shall have placed, under the supervision of a
registered land surveyor, concrete monuments four inches square or four inches
in diameter and 40 inches long with an iron pole cast in the center, at each
corner or angle of the ultimate outside boundary. They shall be set following
grading of each phase of the subdivision.
      (2)   The subdivider shall have placed, under the supervision of a
registered land surveyor, pipes or steel rods, ¾ of an inch in diameter by 30
inches in length at the corners of each lot. They shall be set prior to the
issuance of any improvement location permit.
   (B)   Character of the land. Land which the Commission finds to be
unsuitable for subdivision or development because of flooding, improper
drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or
topography, utility easements, or other features which might reasonably be
harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of the present or future
inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding areas, shall not be
subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer
and approved by the Commission, to solve the problems created by the unsuitable
land conditions. Such land shall be set aside for such uses permitted by the
zoning ordinance as shall not involve any such danger.
   (C)   Subdivision name. The proposed name of the subdivision shall not
duplicate, or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other
subdivision in the area covered by these regulations. The Commission shall have
final authority to designate the name of the subdivision which shall be
determined at the time of primary approval.
(Ord. 174, § 400, passed 6-11-90)
Penalty, see § 153.999
§ 153.041 LOT IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Lot arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulties for reasons of topography or other conditions in
securing building permits to build on each of the created lots in compliance
with the zoning ordinance and health regulations and in providing driveway
access to buildings on such lots from the appropriate approved street.
   (B)   Lot dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards
in the zoning ordinance. Where lots are more than double the minimum required
area for the zoning district, the Commission may require that such lots be
arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets
where they would be necessary to serve all such potential lots in compliance
with the zoning ordinance and these regulations. In general, side lot lines
shall be at right angles to the street lines (or radial to curving street
lines) unless a variation from this rule will give a better street or lot plan.
Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for erection of
buildings, observing the minimum front-yard setback from both streets. Depth
and width of properties reserved or laid out for business or commercial
purposes shall be adequate to provide for all of the off-street parking and
loading facilities required for the type of use and development contemplated,
as established in the zoning ordinance.
   (C)   Double frontage lots. Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall
be avoided except where necessary to overcome specific disadvantages of
topography and orientation affecting the subdivision lots.
   (D)   Access collector roads. Lots shall not, in general, derive access from
a collector road. If the area proposed to be platted abuts upon or contains an
existing or proposed collector, the street plan shall provide vehicular access
to each lot abutting upon the collector by one of the following means:
      (1)   A parallel street, supplying frontage for lots backing onto, but
separated from the collector right-of-way by a screen planting or buffer strip;
      (2)   A cul-de-sac, or series of cul-de-sacs, entered from a street
paralleling the collector with the terminal lots of the cul-de-sac backing onto
the collector right-of-way by a screen planting or buffer strip;
      (3)   A marginal access street separated from the thoroughfare by a
screen planting or a buffer strip, access to the collector being provided at
points suitably spaced;
      (4)   Any other reasonable means necessary to control the number and
location of intersections with such thoroughfare and provide adequate
separation of through and local vehicular traffic.

wherever necessary, for utility easements. As a general principle, such
easements shall be centered on rear or side lot lines and shall be at least
seven feet wide on both sides of the property lines. Easements shall be
continuous to the street.
   (B)   If any stream or necessary surface drainage course is located in the
area proposed to be platted, adequate areas for easements along the sides of
such stream or surface drainage course shall be allocated for the purpose of
widening, deepening, sloping, improving or protecting the stream or surface
drainage course. (See § 153.052(C)(2)).

zoning ordinance applicable to the area proposed to be platted, with the
exception that front building setback lines shall be as follows:
   (A)   Collector road. No part of any structure (except an eave or cornice
overhang not exceeding four feet) shall be built closer than 40 feet to any
right-of-way line of any collector street.
   (B)   Local access road. No part of any structure (except an eave or cornice
overhang not exceeding four feet) shall be built closer than 25 feet to any
right-of-way line of any local street, marginal access street or cul-de-sac.

§ 153.044 NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISION.
   (A)   General. If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for
commercial purposes the layout of the subdivision shall meet such special
provisions as the Commission finds appropriate and may require. A non-
residential subdivision shall also be subject to all the requirements set forth
in the zoning ordinance. Site plan approval and non-residential plat approval
may precede simultaneously at the discretion of the Plan Commission. A non-
residential subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements of these
regulations, as well as such additional standards required by the Commission
and shall conform to the proposed land use and standards established in the
comprehensive plan, official map, and zoning ordinance. All shopping centers
and other nonresidential subdivisions of buildings for leasehold shall be
subject to the relevant provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in these
regulations the applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Commission that the street and parcel pattern proposed are appropriate for the
uses anticipated and adequately take into account other uses in the vicinity.
The following principles and standards shall be observed:

plans or as may be otherwise approved in accordance with these standards. Such
portions shall be known as “Sub-grades.”
      (2)   Unless otherwise provided, the upper six inches of all sub-grade
shall be uniformly compacted to at least 95% standard density as determined by
the provisions of AASHO, T99, Compaction and Density of Soils. During sub-grade
preparation and after its completion, adequate drainage shall be provided at
all times to prevent water from standing on the sub-grade. Sub-grades shall be
so constructed that it will have as nearly as possible uniform density
throughout. After compaction and final grading, the sub-grade shall be finished
with a three-wheel roller weighing not less than ten tons. At areas not
accessible to the roller, the required compaction shall be obtained with
mechanical tamps or vibrators.

sub-grade surface. No placement of pavement shall be permitted on uninspected
or unapproved sub-grade and at no time when the sub-grade is frozen or muddy.
No hauling shall be done not equipment moved over the subgrade when its
condition is such that undue distortion results. If these conditions are
present the sub-grade shall be protected with adequate plank runways, mats or
other satisfactory means if hauling is done thereon. The sub-grade shall be
prepared sufficiently in advance to permit proper inspection so that the final
elevation may be checked with a scratch template and compaction checked. All
utility excavations under the pavement shall be back-filled with Grade “B”
borrow and construction shall conform to Section 211 of the Standard
Specifications or compacted thoroughly by other means. These locations shall be
shown on the construction drawings as submitted to the Plan Commission.
   (C)   Rigid (plain concrete) pavement construction.
      (1)   At the time of placement of the concrete, the sub-grade shall be
properly dampened just prior to the placement where it has become dry, where
the surface has been removed by final grading or for any other reason it has
not been properly dampened. Plain cement pavement shall be in accordance with
Section 501 of the Standard Specifications or any subsequent amendments
thereto.
      (2)   Materials shall comply with requirements of the Standard

placed not to exceed 20 foot spacing. Closer spacing to average 15' will be
encouraged. Transverse contraction joints may either be formed or sawed dummy
grove, ribbon or pre-molded strip type, and shall be ¼ the pavement depth.
      (4)   When transverse joints are to be formed by sawing, care must be
taken to saw the grooves soon after placing the concrete to prevent the
formation of cracks due to contraction of the slab. All transverse joints shall
be sawed within eight hours after the placing of the concrete unless
authorization is given for sawing at a later time. One of the above named
joints shall be placed at every catch basin and manhole in line of pavement.
The location of manholes, etc., in the pavement shall determine the exact
location of the joints. All joints shall extend throughout curbs to fill width
of pavement.
      (5)   Transverse expansion joints shall be placed at tee intersections
and wherever else shown on the plans.
      (6)   Whenever the width between forms of the pavement under construction
is greater than 13½ feet each, this may be accomplished by sawing or by
constructing a slot or groove as herein described for dummy construction
joints, or by a deformed key plate installed prior to the depositing of the
concrete.
      (7)   Curing with white membrane curing compound AASHO Number type 2 - M
- 14B will be properly applied to give complete coverage.
   (D)   Flexible pavement construction.

Penalty, see § 153.999
§ 153.052 DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS.
   (A)   General requirements. The Commission shall not recommend for approval
any subdivision plat which does not make adequate provision for storm or flood
water runoff channels or basins. The storm water drainage system shall be
separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where
required, shall be designed by the rational method, or other methods as
approved by the Commission and a copy of all computations shall be submitted
along with the plans. All computations shall be based upon a ten year frequency
storm. Surface water drainage patterns shall be shown for each and every lot
block.
   (B)   Nature of storm water facilities.
      (1)   Location. The applicant may be required by the Commission to carry
away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist, either
previously to, or as result of the subdivision. Such drainage facilities shall
be located in the street right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual,
unobstructed easements of appropriate width.
      (2)   Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert or other
drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential
run-off from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
subdivision. The applicant with subsequent approval of the Plan Commission
shall determine the necessary size of the facility based on the provisions of
the required constructions standards and specifications assuming conditions of
maximum potential watershed development permitted by the zoning ordinance.
      (3)   Effect on downstream drainage areas.  The Plan Commission shall
require the applicant to adequately determine the effect of each proposed
subdivision on existing drainage facilities outside the area of the
subdivision. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the
development of the subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage
facility, the Commission may withhold secondary approval of the subdivision
until provision (such as a storage facility) has been made for the improvement
of said potential condition in such sum as the Commission shall determine. No
subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage from it will be provided
to an adequate drainage water course or facility.
      (4)   Areas of high seasonal water tables. In areas characterized by
soils having a high seasonal water table as determined by the Johnson County
Soil and Water Conservation District, lots shall be limited to slab type
construction unless the Commission determines that appropriate engineering
techniques will be applied to alleviate the subsurface problem.
      (5)   Floodway areas. If a subdivision of land is proposed within the
flood plain, floodway shall be preserved and not diminished in capacity by
filling or obstruction, except as approved by the Natural Resources Commission
in writing. No residential building site may be located within the floodway.
      (6)   Floodway fringe areas. Where a subdivision is proposed in an area
of the flood plain designated as a floodway fringe, the Commission may approve
such subdivision provided that: all lots for residential usage have a flood
protection grade three feet above the regulatory flood elevations; where
provided, water and sanitary sewer contamination of or by, flood water; and,
approval to fill the area from the Natural Resources Commission has been
obtained in writing. Lands below the regulatory flood elevation shall not be
used for computing the area requirement for any lot.
      (7)   Flood plain areas. Where a subdivision is proposed within an area
of the flood plain for which floodway and floodway fringe designations have not
been made, and Commission shall not approve such a subdivision unless all
streets are raised sufficiently to be above the regulatory flood elevation; all
lots for residential usage have a flood protection grade of three feet above
the regulatory flood elevation; where provided, public water and sanitary sewer
facilities are constructed to eliminate contamination of or by flood water;
and, filling to achieve the above will not raise the level of the regulatory
flood elevation more than 1/10 of one foot for that reach of the stream. All
filling in the flood plain must be approved in writing by the State Natural
Resources Commission. Lands below the regulatory flood elevation shall not be
used for computing the area requirement for any lot.
      (8)   Recording of plats in the flood plain and floodway fringe. All
final plats having within their boundaries areas whose elevation is below that
of the regulatory flood elevation shall show and label the regulatory flood
boundary and elevation, as of the date the final plat is drawn, on the final
plat for recording.
   (C)   Dedication of drainage easements.
      (1)   General requirements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a
drainage course, drainage way, channel, or stream, a storm water easement or
drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such
watercourse, and of such width and construction or both as will be adequate for
the purpose shall be provided. Wherever possible, it is desirable that the
drainage be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate
width for maximum potential volume of flow.
      (2)   Drainage easements.
         (a)   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within street right-of-ways,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for such drainage
facilities shall be provided across property outside the right-of-way lines and
with satisfactory access to the street. Easements shall be indicated on the
plat. Drainage easements shall be carried from the street to a natural
watercourse or to other drainage facilities.
         (b)   The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or
conservation easement land on both sides of existing watercourses of a width to
be determined by the Commission and the County Drainage Board in the case of
legal drains.
         (c)   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the plat.
         (d) Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as drainage
ways. Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be included in
the computations for determining the number of lots allowable under average
density procedures nor for computing the area requirement for any individual
lot.

Penalty, see § 153.999
§ 153.053 WATER FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements.
      (1)   Where a public water main is accessible (within 200 feet of any
boundary of the proposed subdivision) the subdivider shall install adequate
water facilities (including fire hydrants) subject to the specifications of the
state or town authorities. All water mains shall be at least six inches in
diameter.
      (2)   Water main extensions shall be approved by the Commission or its
officially designated representative.
      (3)   To facilitate the above, the location of all fire hydrants, water
supply improvements, and the boundary lanes of proposed subdivision, indicating
all improvements proposed to be served, shall be shown on the preliminary plat,
and the cost of installing same shall be included in the performance bond to be
furnished by the subdivider.
      (4)   The design of all water facilities shall conform to or exceed the
standards described in the latest edition of Recommended Standards for Water
Works as published by Health Education Service, Inc., Albany, New York.
   (B)   Individual wells and central water systems.
      (1)   Where a public water system is not available, (within 200 feet of
any boundary of the proposed subdivision) at the discretion of the Commission,
individual wells may be used or a central water system provided in such a
manner that an adequate supply of potable water will be available to every lot
in the subdivision. Water sample test results shall be submitted to the Indiana
State Board of Health for its approval, and individual wells and central water
systems shall be approved by the appropriate state health authorities. Orders
of approval shall be submitted to the Commission.
      (2)   If the Commission requires that a connection to a public water main
be eventually provided as a condition for approval of an individual well or
central water system, the applicant shall make arrangements for future water
service at the time the plat receives secondary approval. Performance or cash
bond may be required to insure compliance.
      (3)   Fire hydrants should be provided at each street intersection and at
intermediate points between intersections as recommended by the State Insurance
Services Office and the Nineveh Township Fire Department. Generally, hydrant
spacing may range from 350 to 600 feet depending on the area being served.

Penalty, see § 153.999
§ 153.055 UTILITIES.
   All utility lines, including but not limited to gas, electric power,
telephone and CATV cables shall be located underground throughout the
subdivision. Wherever existing lines are located above ground, except on public
roads and right-of-ways, they shall be removed and placed underground. All
utility lines and other facilities existing and proposed throughout the
subdivision shall be shown on the preliminary plat or sketch plan in the case
of a minor subdivision. Underground service connections to the street property
line of each platted lot shall be installed at the subdivider's expense. At the
discretion of the Commission, the requirement for service connections to each
lot may be waived in the case of adjoining lots to be retained in single
ownership intended to be developed for the same primary use.
(Ord. 174, § 416, passed 6-11-90)
Penalty, see § 153.999
§ 153.056 PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES AND AMENITIES.
   Existing features which would add value to the type of intended development
or to the town as a whole, such as trees, as herein defined, watercourses and
falls, historic spots, and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved in
the design of the subdivision. No tree shall be removed from any subdivision
nor any change of grade of the land affected until primary approval of the
preliminary plat has been granted. All trees in the plat which are required to
be retained shall be preserved, and all trees, where required, shall be welled
and protected against change of grade. The trees, as required by these
regulations and shall further indicate all those marked for retention, and the
location of all proposed shade trees required by these regulations.

   ASSURANCE FOR COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS
§ 153.070 IMPROVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (A)   Completion of improvements. Before the plat is signed by the
designated officials all applicants shall be required to completed, in
accordance with the Commission's decision and to the satisfaction of the
Administrator, all the streets, sanitary, and other public improvements
including lot improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision as
required in this chapter, specified in the approved construction plans and on
the final subdivision plat, and as approved by the Commission and to dedicate
the public improvements to the town, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances on the property and public improvements thus dedicated.
   (B)   Performance bond.
      (1)   The Commission at its discretion may waive the requirement that the
applicant complete all public improvements prior to the approval of the final
subdivision plat, and that in lieu thereof, the applicant shall post bond
securable to the town hereinafter referred to as performance bond, in an amount
equivalent to 110% of the estimated cost of completion of the required public
improvements, which shall be sufficient to secure to the town the satisfactory
construction and installation of the uncompleted portion of required public
improvements.
      (2)   In lieu of such a bond the subdivider may submit a certified check
made payable to the town in an amount equivalent to 110% of the estimated cost
of completion of the uncompleted portion of required public improvements. Any
such check shall be held by the Clerk-Treasurer.
      (3)   In lieu of such a bond the subdivider may submit irrevocable
letters of credit in behalf of the subdivider and securable by the town in an
amount equivalent to 110% of the estimated cost of completion of the
uncompleted portion of required public improvements. In the event an
irrevocable letter of credit is used it shall be written for a maximum length
of two years and the Commission, two months prior to the expiration of the
letter of credit, shall determine if the public improvements have been accepted
for maintenance by the town, and if they have not been accepted shall so notify
the subdivider of intent to secure the funds pledged by such letter of credit,
or at the discretion of the Commission, to grant an extension for such period
fixed by the Commission not to exceed one year, and the subdivider filing with
the Commission a new letter of credit for the period so fixed.
      (4)   In lieu of such a bond the subdivider may submit a certificate of
deposit made out to either the town and/or the subdivider, to be held by the
Clerk-Treasurer and in an amount equivalent to 110% of the cost of completion
of the uncompleted portion named singly or jointly on such certificate, then
the subdivider must endorse it before submitting it to the Commission so that
the town may secure the funds.
      (5)   Such performance bond shall comply with all statutory requirements
and shall be satisfactory to the Town's Attorney as to form, sufficiency, and
manner of execution as set forth in this chapter. The period within which
required public improvements must be completed shall be specified by the
Commission in the primary approval of the preliminary plat and shall be
incorporated into the bond and shall not in any event exceed two years from
date of secondary approval. Such bond shall be approved by the Commission as to
amount. The Commission may upon proof of difficulty, grant an extension of the
completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum period of one additional
year, provided that the bond submitted for this extension period meets all
other requirements herein. The Commission may at any time during the period of
such bond accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond.
   (C)   Temporary public improvements. The applicant shall build and pay for
all costs of temporary public improvements required by the Commission and shall
maintain same for the period specified by the Commission. Prior to construction
of any temporary public facility or improvement, the subdivider shall file with
the Commission a separate suitable bond for temporary facilities, which bond
shall insure that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed,
maintained, and removed (except for turnaround intended for connection into
adjacent future subdivisions).
   (D)   Cost of public improvements. All required public improvements shall be
made by the applicant at his expense without reimbursement, unless sharing of
expenses is agreed upon by the town.
   (E)   Failure to complete public improvements. For subdivisions for which no
performance bond has been posted, if the public improvements are not completed
within the period specified by the Commission in the primary approval of the
preliminary plat, or the sketch plan in the case of a minor subdivision, the
approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where a performance
bond has been posted and the required public improvements have not been
installed within the terms of such performance bond, the town may declare the
bond to be in default and cause all public improvements to be the extent of the
building development at the time the bond is declared to be in default.
   (F)   Acceptance of dedication offers. The approval by the Commission of a
subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by
the town of any street, easement, or other improvement shown on said plat. The
Commission may require the plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this
effect. Public improvements shown on the plat, or otherwise, must be presented
to and accepted by the Council.

   (A)   General procedure. If the Administrator finds upon inspection per §
153.022(F)(2)(a) and § 153.023(G)(2)(a) that any of the improvements have not
been constructed in accordance with the approved construction plans, the
applicant shall be responsible for completing the public improvements according
to such plans. Where the cost of the public improvements is covered by a
performance bond, the applicant and the bonding company shall be severally and
jointly liable for completing the public improvements according to
specifications.
   (B)   Release or reduction of performance bond.
      (1)   Certificate of satisfactory completion. The town shall not accept
required public improvements, nor the Commission release nor reduce a
performance bond, until the town has submitted a certificate stating that all
required public improvements or a pro rate parti in the case of a reduction
have been satisfactorily completed. The applicant engineer or surveyor shall
