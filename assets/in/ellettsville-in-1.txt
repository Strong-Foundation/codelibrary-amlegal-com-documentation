   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to

items to Town Council.

State Board of Accounts as published in the Uniform Internal Control Standards

Vehicle Marking Policy

34.03   Vehicle branding standards
   
34.04   Public safety services
VEHICLE MARKING POLICY
§ 34.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this policy is to set the guidelines under which town
vehicles and equipment will be branded. In order for any government entity to
cultivate lasting confidence within its constituencies it must build a unique
and positive image of itself. This image is the entity's brand, the central
defining image or idea of what it is and does. Vehicles are the most visible
and often seen carriers of the town brand and logo. Therefore, the town's
supervisors have developed the following vehicle marking policies.
(Ord. 2016-01, passed 2-8-2016)
§ 34.02 VEHICLE DETAILS.
   (A)   Vehicle decals are defined as a sticker, marking, license plate
holder, front license plate, or any other emblem that is placed on a Town
vehicle in any location.
   (B)   Permitted decals are town logos, department logos, public safety
markings (e.g. emergency vehicle), department program logos (e. g. D. A. R.
E.), professional organizations, and professional memorial programs (e. g.
September 11, 2001).
   (C)   Decal location on vehicle is determined and approved by the department
head.
   (D)   It is the department head's responsibility to ensure compliance with
vehicle use policy guidelines found in §
36.136.
   (E)   No decal shall be placed on any Town vehicle not in compliance with
vehicle use policy guidelines and approved by the department Head and Town
Manager.
   (F)   No decals shall be removed from vehicles unless approved by the
department head and the Town Manager.
   (G)   Any vehicle owned by the town and used by an employee will display a
town decal except for those vehicles designated by the department head and
approved by the Town Manager.
   (H)   Any proposed changes or variations from the pictorial examples shown
in this policy shall be presented by the Supervisor of the Department to the
Town Manager. After the Supervisor and the Town Manager concur on the proposed
changes those changes shall be submitted to the Council for their review.
   (I)   Markings and logos shall not apply to undercover police vehicles, the
Town Marshal and the Operations Chief Deputy Marshal if approved by the
department head.
(Ord. 2016-01, passed 2-8-2016)
§ 34.03 VEHICLE BRANDING STANDARDS.
   (A)   Vehicles are frequently the most visible and often seen carriers of
the town logo.
   (B)   Here are several examples how to treat the logo on a variety of
vehicle styles. It is important to note that vehicle models may change but the
location and application of the logo will be consistent.
      (1)   Only the logo, ID numbers and chevrons are to be placed on any town
vehicles.
      (2)   On white vehicles the logo should be placed in full color on both
front door panels. The logo should be no smaller than eight inches high and as
large as possible. The logo must never be placed over any ridges in the door
nor over the handle. The ID numbers should be placed on both front fenders and
the back or tailgate of the vehicle as shown three inches high.
      (3)   With the scale, color and variety of so many vehicles, the first
consideration is in identifying the size appropriate and visibly prominent area
on which to place the logo. As with most heavy equipment, chances are the
possibility of effectively utilizing the color version will be limited. For
vehicle colors which are stronger in tone value, an entire white version of the
logo is required. For colors which could be considered softer (in tone) a one
color (black) application of the logo is required. If the base color will
effectively support the two color version of the identity, then it should be
considered before the use of black.
      (4)   The logo should be placed towards the front of the vehicle on the
most prominent, flat, protruding surface.
      (5)   The logo should be no smaller than eight inches high and must never
be placed over any ridges in the door nor over the handle.
(Ord. 2016-01, passed 2-8-2016)
§ 34.04 PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES.
   (A)   Emergency vehicles require identification and retro reflective
markings that adhere to strict provincial standards for fire vehicles and are
also compliant with the National Fire Protection Association requirements for
fire vehicles. The town emergency vehicles have unique markings that have been
designed not only to identify the vehicles as being town vehicles, but to also
enhance their maximum visibility and emergency status in traffic.
   (B)   Identification specifications include: Public Safely Services crest in
full color repeated on each side of the vehicle cab, as shown in examples.
White or gold vinyl stripe graphic on the sides of fire vehicles as mirror
images of each other. White or red reflective placed at rear of vehicle on both
sides in a clear and unobstructed location similar to example shown.
   (C)   On some fire vehicles there are additional decals and graphics that
may appear. These decals are for public information and education and are
related to Fire and Emergency Services initiatives only.
   (D)   The following are recognized examples of approved logos and striping
for each department.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 36.001 PERSONNEL POLICY HANDBOOK.
   Use and revision of the town’s Personnel Policy Handbook.
   (A)   The town’s Personnel Policy Handbook is designed to provide employees
with information about working conditions, employee benefits and some of the
policies affecting employment. Employees should read, understand and follow all
provisions of the Personnel Policy Handbook. These policies describe many
employee responsibilities and outline the programs developed by the town to
benefit our employees. One of our objectives is to provide a work environment
that is conducive to both personal and professional growth.
   (B)   Nothing in these policies is intended to, in any sense, constitute a
contract of employment or an expectation of continued employment. The town is
an AT-WILL employer, which means the employee may resign at any time and the
town may discharge an employee at any time with or without cause providing it
is not an unlawful reason. This Personnel Policy Handbook is not a contract of
employment.
   (C)   No Personnel Policy Handbook can anticipate every circumstance or
question about policy. As the town continues to grow, the need may arise to
change policies. The town, therefore, reserves the right to revise, supplement
or rescind any policies or portion of the Personnel Policy Handbook from time
to time as it deems appropriate, at its sole and absolute discretion. Employees
will, of course, be notified of such changes as they occur.
   (D)   Although the town believes the descriptive materials contained in the
Personnel Policy Handbook are accurate, such sections regarding insurance and
Indiana Public Retirement System (INPRS) are only summaries. Any discrepancies
between these summaries and the terms of the actual plans will be governed by
the terms of the underlying policies and procedures, if applicable and any
discrepancies between them should be directed to the insurance carrier or to
the INPRS Office. The employee shall consult the supervisor if changes in the
employee’s insurance status would create an increase in the insurance budget
line.

§ 36.030 POLICY PROHIBITING HARASSMENT.
   The town does not tolerate harassment of employees or volunteers. It is the

prohibit all forms of harassment at work, including harassment based on age,
color, disability, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, national origin,
race, religion, veteran status or any other legally protected classification.
Employees and volunteers have the right to raise the issue of harassment.

§ 36.032 RESERVED
§ 36.033 HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The town's policy prohibiting harassment applies to all full-time,
part-time and temporary employees, and to elected officials, supervisors and
volunteers.
   (B)   It is a violation of the town's policy to use an individual's
submission to or rejection of harassing conduct as the basis for any employment
decision affecting the individual. Retaliation towards an employee who reports
harassment is strictly prohibited.
   (C)   Employees who believe they have been subjected to harassment shall
promptly report the harassment to their supervisor and file a written complaint
with the employee's supervisor. The best time to register a complaint is
immediately after the act occurs.
      (1)   If the supervisor is the subject of the harassment complaint, the
employee shall submit the completed form to the Town Manager.
      (2)   If the elected official is the subject of the harassment complaint,
the employee shall submit the completed complaint to the supervisor or other
Town Council member. The supervisor must be provided a copy of each completed
complaint. When feasible, the town will make a representative of each gender
available to receive complaints.
   (D)   All employees are responsible for complying with the town's policy
prohibiting harassment. The town will investigate every complaint, respond and
take corrective action. All employees who observe or otherwise learn of, or
have reason to suspect, any conduct that may violate this policy shall promptly
report such facts to their supervisor, and shall cooperate fully in any
investigation or disciplinary action undertaken pursuant to this policy.
Failure to comply with this section shall be grounds for appropriate
disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
   (E)   The supervisor shall conduct a prompt and careful investigation. The
investigation may include interviews with all persons having direct knowledge
of the unwelcome behavior, including the person who made the complaint, the
person accused of sexual or other harassment, and other potential witnesses.
   (F)   At the conclusion of the investigation, the investigator will review
the findings with the person(s) who made the complaint. If the investigation
reveals that the complaint is factual, appropriate corrective action will be
taken to prevent the harassment from occurring again, up to and including
discharge of any employee believed to be guilty of harassment. In any case,
particularly in situations where the facts uncovered during the investigation
are inconclusive or unclear, the town will ensure that all parties are
reacquainted with the policy prohibiting sexual or other harassment at work.
   (G)   The town will take reasonable steps to keep the complaint
confidential, and, to the extent possible, maintain the privacy of the persons
involved. The town, however, cannot guarantee confidentiality.
   (H)   The town takes its harassment policy very seriously and will make all
reasonable efforts to educate its employees about this policy. Every new
employee will be provided a copy of the policy when hired, which may be
reviewed during orientation by the supervisor. If the policy is amended, copies
of the amendments will be given to all employees.
   (I)   The town also recognizes that careful consideration must be given to
questions regarding whether a particular action is purely personal or social
without any discriminatory effect. Actions that may constitute harassment will
be determined from the facts, on a case-by-case basis. The record as a whole,
as well as the context in which the alleged misconduct occurred, will be
reviewed. False accusations of sexual harassment can have devastating effects
on the careers, lives and reputations of individuals. Therefore, the town may
discipline those employees who are proved to have intentionally, maliciously
and wrongly accused others of sexual harassment. The discipline may include
termination of employment with the town.
   (J)   Prevention is the best policy for the elimination of harassment.
Employees shall be aware of this harassment policy at all times and seek to
avoid creating conditions that encourage such activity.
   (K)   Sexual and other forms of harassment by any employee may result in
personal legal and financial responsibility for the employee offender.

employee, or the safety of other individuals in the workplace. Employees may
keep prescription drugs on town premises when prescribed by a medical
physician. Over-the-counter medications may also be kept on town premises on an
as-needed basis. Employees who operate vehicles or equipment in the course of

DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY
§ 36.060 PURPOSE.
   It is the policy of the town that federally regulated employees and
employees in safety-sensitive positions are free of substance abuse and alcohol
abuse. Consequently, the use of illegal drugs by employees is prohibited.
Further, employees shall not use alcohol or engage in “prohibited conduct” as
defined herein. The overall goal of this policy is to ensure a drug- and
alcohol-free environment, and to reduce accidents, injuries and fatalities. A
copy of this policy and information regarding the harmful effects of drugs and
alcohol is available to all employees.
(1985 Code, § 299-5) (Ord. 95-22, passed 12-27-1995; Am. Ord. 05-04, passed 2-
28-2005; Am. Ord. 2012-04, passed 1-23-2012)
§ 36.061 SAFETY-SENSITIVE FUNCTION; DEFINITION.
   A SAFETY-SENSITIVE FUNCTION is all time spent either waiting to be
dispatched; inspecting equipment or otherwise inspecting, servicing and/or
conditioning any town-owned motor vehicle or equipment; driving or being in or
upon a town-owned vehicle or equipment; loading or unloading a town-owned
vehicle or equipment; supervising or assisting in the loading or unloading of a
town-owned vehicle or equipment; attending a town-owned vehicle or equipment
being loaded or unloaded; remaining in readiness to operate a town-owned
vehicle or equipment; or giving or receiving receipts for  shipments loaded or
unloaded; performing accident-related duties; or repairing, obtaining
assistance, or remaining in attendance upon a disabled vehicle. Any town
employee who is on call to perform safety-sensitive functions may be tested at
any time they are on call or ready to be dispatched while on duty.

§ 36.062 RESERVED
§ 36.063 TYPES OF TESTS.
   (A)   Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Department of
Transportation, the town has implemented six circumstances for drug and alcohol
tests.
   (B)   The above-mentioned circumstances are:
      (1)   Pre-employment testing;
      (2)   Post-accident testing;
      (3)   Random testing;
      (4)   Reasonable suspicion testing;
      (5)   Return-to-duty testing; and
      (6)   Follow-up testing.

§ 36.064 DRIVER’S REFUSAL TO TEST.
   (A)   Consequences of refusal to test. The substitution of, adulteration of,
or refusal to submit to, the types of drug and alcohol tests employed by the
town will be grounds for refusal to hire employees/applicants, and to terminate
employment of existing employees.
   (B)   Definitions.
      (1)   A REFUSAL TO TEST is defined to be conduct that would obstruct the
proper administration of a test. A delay in providing a urine or breath sample
could be considered a REFUSAL. If an employee cannot provide a sufficient urine
specimen or adequate breath sample, a physician of the town's choice will
evaluate him or her. If the physician cannot find a legitimate medical
explanation for the inability to provide a specimen (either urine or breath),
it will be considered a REFUSAL TO TEST. In such circumstances, the employee
has violated one of the prohibitions of the regulations.
      (2)   A REFUSAL TO SUBMIT TO AN ALCOHOL OR CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE TEST
means:
         (a)   Failure to appear for any test (except a pre-employment test)
within a reasonable time, as determined by a town supervisor, consistent with
DOT regulations, after being directed to do so by the town supervisor;
         (b)   Failure to remain at the testing site until the testing process
is complete;
         (c)   Failure to provide a urine specimen for any drug test required
by the town;
         (d)   In the case of a directly observed or monitored collection in a
drug test, failure to permit the observation or monitoring of the employee's
provision of a specimen;
         (e)   Failure to provide a sufficient amount of urine when directed,
and it has been determined, through a required medical examination, that there
was no adequate medical explanation for the failure;
         (f)   Failure or declining to take a second test the town has directed
the employee to take;
         (g)   Failure to undergo a medical examination or evaluation as
directed;
         (h)   Failure to cooperate with any part of the testing process.

   Any driver who becomes unqualified or engages in prohibited conduct as
defined by this policy may be subject to termination of employment.
(Ord. 95-22, passed 12-27-1995; Am. Ord. 05-04, passed 2-28-2005)
§ 36.066 PRE-EMPLOYMENT TESTING.
   Before an employee performs any safety-sensitive functions for the town, the
employee must submit to testing for drugs. The employer must receive a negative
test result prior to allowing the employee to drive or perform other safety-
sensitive functions.
(Ord. 95-22, passed 12-27-1995; Am. Ord. 05-04, passed 2-28-2005: Am. Ord.

§ 36.067 RANDOM TESTING.
   (A)   The town conducts random drug/alcohol testing for all employees
performing safety-sensitive functions for the town. The town or its agents will
submit all mandated employees to a computerized random selection system. The
random selection system provides an equal chance for each employee to be
selected each time random selection occurs. Random selection will be reasonably
spread throughout the year. The town will drug test a minimum 50% of the
average number of safety-sensitive/mandated positions in each calendar year.
The town will select at a minimum 10% of the average number of safety-
sensitive/mandated positions for random alcohol testing. Random selection, by
its very nature, may result in employees being selected in successive
selections or more than once a calendar year. Alternatively, some employees may
not be selected in a calendar year.
   (B)   If an employee is selected at random for either drug or alcohol
testing, the Town Manager will notify the employee. Once notified, every action
the employee takes must lead to a collection. If the employee engages in
conduct that does not lead to a collection as soon as possible after
notification, such conduct may be considered a refusal to test.

§ 36.068 POST-ACCIDENT, RETURN-TO-DUTY AND FOLLOW-UP TESTING.
   (A)   Both drug and alcohol testing is performed on any “on duty” employee
performing a safety-sensitive function for the town, following any accident
involving a fatality; or any accident in which the employee receives a citation
under state or local law for a moving traffic violation arising from the
accident.
      (1)   An ACCIDENT is defined as an incident involving a vehicle in which
there is a fatality, an injury treated away from the scene, or where a vehicle
is towed from the scene. After any accident, the employee must contact his or
her supervisor, who in turn shall contact the Town Manager as soon as possible.
      (2)   The FMCSA/DOT requires that any time a post-accident drug or
alcohol testing is required, it must be performed as soon as possible following
the accident. If no alcohol collection can be made within eight hours of the
accident, attempts to collect a breath sample shall cease. If no urine
collection can be obtained for purposes of post-accident drug testing within 32
hours, attempts to make such a collection shall cease. All attempts to collect
shall be documented by a supervisor.
      (3)   In the event that federal, state or local officials conduct breath
or blood tests for the use of alcohol and/or urine tests for the use of
controlled substances following an accident, these tests shall be considered to
meet the requirements of this section. The employee agrees to sign a release
allowing the town to obtain the test results from federal, state or local
officials.
      (4)   In the event that the employee is so seriously injured that the
employee cannot provide a urine specimen or breath sample at the time of the
accident, the employee must provide necessary authorizations or releases for
the town to obtain hospital records, medical records or other documents that
would indicate whether there were controlled substances or alcohol in the
employee's system at the time of the accident.
   (B)   Return-to-duty testing is required for employees who want to return to
work after being unqualified for a safety-sensitive function. The return-to-
duty testing can be done once the referral/evaluation has been completed. All
return-to-duty testing requires a negative result prior to the employee
returning to a safety-sensitive function.
   (C)   Follow-up testing is required after rehabilitation for a drug or
alcohol misuse problem and a return-to-duty test. Six unannounced follow-up
tests are required within one year of evaluation and treatment by a substance
abuse counselor.

§ 36.069 REASONABLE SUSPICION TESTING.
   (A)   A covered employee's supervisor will refer him or her for testing for
alcohol misuse when the town has reasonable suspicion to believe that the
employee has violated the rules regarding the use of alcohol. A determination
that reasonable suspicion exists must be based on specific, contemporaneous,
articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or body
odors of the employee.
   (B)   Reasonable suspicion testing is authorized only if the required
observations are made during, just preceding, or just after the period of the
workday that the covered employee is performing a safety-sensitive function. A
supervisor must make the observation and determination that a reasonable
suspicion exists. However, the supervisor making the determination is not to
conduct the reasonable suspicion test on that employee; the employee must be
referred to hospital or immediate care facility for testing. A supervisor's
written record of the observations leading to a controlled substance reasonable
suspicion test must be made and signed by the supervisor who made the
observations. This record must be made within 24 hours of the observed behavior
or before the results of the controlled substance test are released, which is
earlier.

§ 36.070 PROHIBITED CONDUCT.
   (A)   The following shall be considered “prohibited conduct” for purposes of
this policy.
      (1)   No employee shall report for duty or remain on duty while having a
blood alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater.
      (2)   No employee shall be on duty or operate a town-owned vehicle or
equipment, or a commercial motor vehicle while in possession of alcohol.
      (3)   No employee shall use alcohol while performing safety-sensitive
functions.
      (4)   No employee shall perform safety-sensitive functions within eight
hours after using alcohol.
      (5)   No employee required to take a post-accident test shall use alcohol
for eight hours following the accident, or until he or she undergoes a post-
accident test, whichever occurs first.
      (6)   No employee shall refuse to submit to a post-accident, a random, a
reasonable suspicion, return-to-duty, follow-up or a post-injury breath alcohol
or urine drug test.
      (7)   No employee shall report for duty or remain on duty when the
employee uses any controlled substance, except when use is pursuant to the
instructions of a physician who has advised the employee that the substance
does not adversely affect the employee’s ability to operate a town-owned
vehicle or equipment, or a commercial vehicle, or to a perform a safety-
sensitive function.
   (B)   If the town has actual knowledge or reason to believe that an employee
has engaged in prohibited conduct, the town may require the employee to submit
to drug and/or alcohol testing.
   (C)   If the employee engages in prohibited conduct, the employee is not
qualified to drive a town-owned vehicle or equipment, a commercial vehicle, or
to perform a safety-sensitive function, and shall be immediately removed from
service. The town may, at its discretion and at the request of the employee,
keep the employee’s position open while that employee attempts to become
requalified. At its discretion, the town may also take action against the
employee, up to and including termination.

§ 36.071 SUBSTANCE ABUSE EVALUATION.
   Any driver who engages in prohibited conduct shall be provided with the
names, addresses, and telephone numbers of qualified substance abuse
professionals. If the driver desires to become requalified, the driver must be
evaluated by a substance abuse professional (SAP) and submit to any treatment
prescribed by the SAP. Following evaluation and treatment, if any, in order to
become requalified, the driver must submit to, and successfully complete, a
return-to-duty drug and/or alcohol test. This driver is also subject to follow-
up testing. Follow-up testing is separate from and in addition to the town’s
reasonable suspicion, post- accident, and random testing procedures. Follow-up
testing shall be on a random basis and in accordance with the instructions of
the substance abuse professional. Follow-up testing may continue for a period
of up to 60 months following the driver’s return to duty. No fewer than six
tests shall be performed in the first 12 months of follow-up testing. The costs
of any SAP evaluation or prescribed treatment shall be borne by the driver. The
town does not guarantee or promise a position to the driver should he or she
regain qualified status.

§ 36.072 AUTHORIZATION FOR PREVIOUS TEST RECORDS.
   Within 30 days of performing a safety-sensitive function, federal
regulations require that the town obtain certain drug and alcohol testing
records from the employee’s previous employers for the previous three years of
employment. As a condition to employment, an applicant shall provide the town
with a written authorization for all previous employers within the past three
years to release such drug and alcohol testing records, and those required
under federal regulations.

§ 36.073 DRUG URINALYSIS.
   (A)   Drug testing will be performed through urinalysis. Urinalysis will
test for the presence of drugs and/or metabolites of the following controlled
substances:
      (1)   Marijuana;
      (2)   Cocaine;
      (3)   Opiates;
      (4)   Amphetamines; and
      (5)   Phencyclidine (PCP).
   (B)   The urinalysis procedure starts with the collection of a urine
specimen. Urine specimens will be submitted to a SAMHSA-certified laboratory
for testing. As part of the collection process, the specimen provided will be
split into two vials: a primary vial and a secondary vial. The SAMHSA-certified
laboratory will perform initial screenings on all primary vials. In the event
that the primary specimen tests positive, a confirmation test of that specimen
will be performed before being reported by the laboratory to the medical review
officer (MRO) as a positive.
   (C)   All laboratory results will be reported by the laboratory to a medical
review officer (MRO) designated by the town. Negative test results shall be
reported by the MRO to the town. Before reporting a positive test result to the
town, the MRO will attempt to contact the driver to discuss the test result. If
the MRO is unable to contact the driver directly, the MRO will contact the
President of the Town Council, who shall in turn contact the driver and direct
the driver to contact the MRO. Upon being so directed, the driver shall contact
the MRO immediately or, if after the MRO’s business hours and the MRO is
unavailable, at the start of the MRO’s next business day. In the MRO’s sole
discretion, a determination will be made as to whether a result is positive or
negative.
   (D)   Pursuant to Department of Transportation regulations, individual test
results for driver applicants and drivers will be released to the town and will
be kept strictly confidential unless consent for the release of the test
results has been obtained. Any individual who has submitted to drug testing in
compliance with this policy is entitled to receive the results of that testing
upon timely written request.
   (E)   An individual testing positive may make a request of the MRO to have
the secondary vial tested. The driver may request that the secondary vial be
tested by a different SAMHSA-certified lab than tested the primary specimen.
The individual making the request for a test of the second specimen must prepay
all costs associated with the test. The request for testing of a second
specimen is timely if it is made to the MRO within 72 hours of the individual
being notified by the town of a positive test result.

§ 36.074 ALCOHOL TESTS.
   The town will perform alcohol tests using an evidential breath testing
device. The town may provide use of an evidential breath testing device through
a vendor or agent. The driver shall report to the site of an evidential breath
testing device as notified by the town. The evidential breath testing device
will be operated by a breath alcohol technician. The driver shall follow all
instructions given by the breath alcohol technician. In the event that a
driver, on the basis of the evidential breath test, has a blood alcohol content
of .02 to .0399 gram of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood, the driver shall
be removed from duty for 24 hours or until the driver’s next scheduled on-duty
time, whichever is longer. Applicants are not medically qualified until after
the 24-hour time frame expires. Drivers with tests indicating a blood alcohol
concentration of .04 gram of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or greater
are considered to have engaged in prohibited conduct which may result in
disciplinary action up to and including termination. All alcohol tests shall be
performed just prior to, during, or just after duty.

reasonable suspicion exists to require a driver to undergo testing under 49
C.F.R. 382.603 receive at least 60 minutes of training on alcohol misuse and
receive at least an additional 60 minutes of training on controlled substances
use. The training shall cover the physical, behavioral, speech, and performance
indicators of probable alcohol misuse and use of controlled substances.
   (B)   The town shall provide educational materials that explain the
requirements of 49 C.F.R. 382.603, consequences of violating the regulations,
and the employer policies and procedures with respect to meeting these
requirements. The materials supplied to the drivers may include information on
additional employer policies with respect to the use or possession of alcohol
or controlled substances, for example, the consequences of a driver found to
have a specified alcohol or controlled substances level based upon the
employer’s authority, independent of 49 C.F.R. 382.601. The town shall ensure
each driver to sign a statement certifying that he or she has received a copy
of these materials as described in 49 C.F.R. 382.601.

§ 36.090 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE FOR EMPLOYEE COMPLAINTS.
   (A)   Policy. It shall be the policy of the Town of Ellettsville to provide
all employees the opportunity to air complaints, clarify misunderstandings and
seek redress where the employee feels he or she has been unfairly treated
regarding his or her employment with the town.
   (B)   Procedure. Whenever an employee feels that he or she has been
aggrieved or otherwise treated unfairly, the employee shall follow the
grievance procedure as delineated herein. It should be noted that failure to
comply with the specific time limitations noted herein shall be grounds to
dismiss the grievance due to lack of procedural compliance hereto. All written
documentation shall be made a part of the employee's personnel file.

successfully settled at this point, no further action shall be forthcoming.
   (E)   Appeal to Town Council.
      (1)   If no satisfactory settlement is reached at the appeal to the Town

§ 36.108 NEPOTISM IN EMPLOYMENT.
   (A)   Establishment of a nepotism and contracting with a unit policy.
      (1)   The town finds that it is necessary and desirous to adopt a policy
of conduct with regard to nepotism in the employment with the town and in
contracting with the town in order to continue to be able to provide local
government services to its residents and to comply with the new laws effective
July 1, 2012 known as I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21, respectively.
      (2)   On July 1, 2012 the town shall have a nepotism and a contracting
with a unit policy that complies with the minimum requirements of I.C. 36-1-

specifically allow a unit to adopt requirements that are "more stringent or
detailed" and that more detailed are necessary.
      (6)   The town further finds that a single member of the legislative body
cannot act for the body to make work assignments, compensation, grievances,
advancement or a performance evaluation without prior authority of a majority
of the body and therefore without such authority by the majority he or she will
not be in the direct line of supervision.
      (7)   The town finds that a single member of governing bodies with
authority over employees in the town cannot act for the governing body to make
work assignments, compensation, grievances, advancement or a performance
evaluation without prior authority of a majority of the body, when a statute
provides that a majority is needed to act, and therefore, without such
authority by the majority the single member will not be in the direct line of
supervision.
      (8)   All elected and appointed officials and employees of the town are
hereby directed to cooperate fully in the implementation of the policies
created by this section and demonstrating compliance with these same policies.
      (9)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation,
compliance and certifications connected with the nepotism policy is a violation
and may result in the discipline, including termination, of an employee or a
transfer from the direct line of supervision or other curative action. An
elected or appointed official of the town who fails to abide by or cooperate
with the implementation, with the compliance and with mandated certifications
of either the nepotism policy may be subject to action allowed by law.
      (10)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation,
compliance and certifications connected with the contracting with unit by a
relative policy is a violation and may result in the discipline, including
termination, of an employee or a curative action. An elected or appointed
official of the town who fails to abide by or cooperate with the
implementation, with the compliance and with mandated certifications of either
the nepotism policy or the contracting with unit by a relative policy may be
subject to action allowed by law.

effective July 1, 2012 are annexed to Ordinance 2013-06, passed August 12,

36.114(B). Calculating compensatory time is based on actual hours worked. Time
off on compensatory time will not be considered as hours worked.
   (B)   Scheduling the use of compensatory time off shall be at the request of
the employee and at the discretion of the supervisor. Use of compensatory time
must be determined in advance of submission of the payroll.
   (C)   Supervisors shall provide the Clerk-Treasurer with an accurate and
current record of accrued compensatory time simultaneously with the current
payroll. Supervisors shall provide documentation showing compensatory hours
calculated in accordance with this policy. Employees may accumulate up to 240
hours of compensatory time with the approval of the supervisor.
   (D)   All compensatory time earned should be taken off within the year
earned or no later than the December 31 of the following year with the approval
of the supervisor or it shall be paid in full to the employee by the end of
that year.

§ 36.116 JOB CLASSIFICATION/PAY SYSTEM MAINTENANCE.
   The Town Council oversees maintenance of the job classification and pay
plan. All town employees will be compensated in accordance with the current
year salary ordinance. The annual salary ordinance, including the designation
of supervisors or other administrative employees as exempt is hereby
incorporated by reference into this Personnel Policy. Any compensation that is
not within the salary ordinance must first get approval of the Town Council.
When a supervisor wishes to create a new position not currently classified,
reorganize jobs within a department, review seniority, abolish a position, or
review an employee’s job classification, it must be submitted to the Town
Council for consideration. The Town Council reviews such requests and makes
final action on these requests.

§ 36.117 RECORD KEEPING.
   (A)   It is the responsibility of the supervisor to keep records of all time
owing to or taken by an employee, of all work days when an employee was absent,
of all days when an employee was late in arriving at work (actual time a tardy
employee arrives at work) and of all hours worked by the employee. All
employees are required to submit day off request forms to the supervisor and
notify him or her of any other incidences of overtime, late time or half shift
off days. Unless appropriately specified by the supervisor, when an employee is
absent from work, the supervisor shall subtract from existing benefit time in
the following order: accrued overtime or compensatory time, P.T.O., sick leave.
Pursuant to principles of public accountability, if an employee has no existing
leave time as described above, any hours short of the employee's regular weekly
hours shall be deducted from the employee's wages or salary. The supervisor
shall sign each time sheet and present them to the Clerk-Treasurer’s Office for
processing.
   (B)   In the unlikely event of an error in the time sheet, the Clerk-
Treasurer’s Office shall bring the discrepancy to the attention of the
supervisor of the Department so corrections can be made. The supervisor’s
approval of the corrected time sheet is required.
   (C)   If a supervisor knowingly approves the falsification of a time sheet,
it could result in disciplinary action against the supervisor.
(Ord. 05-04, passed 2-28-2005; Am. Ord. 10-10, passed 6-28-2010; Am. Ord. 2012-

§ 36.118 PAY PERIODS.
   (A)   Generally. Employees are paid bi-weekly.
   (B)   Pay corrections.  The town takes all reasonable steps to ensure that
employees receive the correct amount of pay in each paycheck and that employees
are paid promptly on the scheduled payday. In the unlikely event an employee
reports to the supervisor an error in the amount of pay, the supervisor should
promptly bring the discrepancy to the attention of the Clerk- Treasurer so
corrections can be made.
   (C)   Pay deductions/garnishments.
      (1)   The town is legally required to make certain deductions from each
employee’s paycheck, including federal, state and local income taxes. The town
must also deduct Social Security taxes on each employee’s earnings. The town
matches the amount of Social Security taxes paid by each employee.
      (2)   The town offers programs and benefits beyond those required by law.
Eligible employees may voluntarily authorize deductions from their paychecks.
      (3)   When the town is served a writ of garnishment requiring payment of
a portion of the employee’s compensation, a processing fee, as allowed by law,
may be deducted from the employee’s pay and retained by the town.
      (4)   Questions concerning paycheck deductions and/or methods of
calculation should be directed to the supervisor who will discuss it with the
Clerk-Treasurer to make necessary adjustments.
(Ord. 04-05, passed 2-28-2005; Am. Ord. 10-10, passed 6-28-2010)
§ 36.119 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.
   The town provides a wide range of benefits to eligible employees. Programs
such as Social Security, Worker’s Compensation and unemployment insurance cover
all employees in the manner prescribed by law. Eligibility for additional
benefits depends on a variety of factors, many of which are described elsewhere
in the Personnel Policy Handbook. The supervisor can identify the programs for
which employees are eligible.

see Fire and Police Supplemental Policies for Firefighter and Police Officer
benefits.

§ 36.120 OVERTIME AND FLSA REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Each employee is designated as professional exempt, exempt or non-
exempt from federal and state wage and hour laws.
      (1)   (a)   Professional exempt employees include those employees whose
position is classified as professional exempt from overtime requirements of the
Fair Labor and Standards Act. The Town Council shall determine which employees
are classified as professional exempt. Professional exempt status shall also be
identified in the job description. However, these employees shall receive
compensatory time for all hours worked over 85 in a two-week pay period at the
rate of one and one half times.
         (b)   Professional exemption. To qualify for the learned professional
employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met: the employee must
be compensated on a salary or fee basis (as defined in the regulations) at a
rate not less than $455 per week. The employee’s primary duty must be the
performance of work requiring advanced knowledge, defined as work which is
predominantly intellectual in character and which includes work requiring the
consistent exercise of discretion and judgment. The advanced knowledge must be
in a field of science or learning; and the advanced knowledge must be
customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual
instruction.
      (2)   Exempt employees include employees whose position is classified as
exempt from overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Town
Council shall determine which employees are classified as exempt. Exempt status
shall also be identified in the job description.
      (3)   Non-exempt employees include those employees whether hourly or
salaried whose position is classified as non- exempt and therefore are subject
to the overtime requirements of the fair labor and standards act. The Town
Council shall determine which employees are classified as non-exempt. Non-
exempt status shall also be identified in the job description.
   (B)   Employees may be required to work overtime when operating requirements
or other needs cannot be met during regular working hours. Overtime assignments
will be made to best meet the operational needs of the town. All overtime work
must receive the supervisor’s prior authorization. Employees who work overtime
without receiving prior authorization form the supervisor may be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
   (C)   Overtime work (work beyond 40 hours per week or eight hours per day)
must always be approved by the supervisor or their designee before it is
performed.
   (D)   Non-exempt employees working in excess of 40 hours in a workweek may
receive FLSA compensatory time off at a rate of one and one-half hours per hour
worked. Overtime compensation in the form of overtime pay at a rate of one and
one-half times and employee’s hourly wage for all approved hours worked in
excess of 40 hours in a work week or eight hours per day.
   (E)   Calculating overtime is based on actual hours worked. Time off for
paid sick leave, vacation leave, personal leave or emergency closings will be
considered as hours worked for purposes of calculating overtime compensation.
Time off on compensatory time will not be considered as hours worked for
purposes of calculating overtime compensation.
(Ord. 05-04, passed 2-28-2005)
§ 36.121 P.T.O HOURS.

completed from the date of most recent hire. Partial months shall be credited
as a whole month.
         (b)   For the purpose of this section, the term of employment begins
from the date of most recent hire. Prior periods of employment are not
considered, and there is no accumulation of P.T.O. hours from such prior

disciplinary measure or rescind a P.T.O. request for disciplinary reasons.
         (a)   Minimum usage after a one hour notice. The minimum amount of
P.T.O. time taken at any one time shall be no less than one hour and no more

Hours   
 
         (b)   Maximum usage after a 24 notice.  The maximum amount of P.T.O.
time taken at any one time shall be eight hours after a 24-hour notice has been
given to the supervisor for approval.
         (c)   Notice required for all other requests. All other requests for
P.T.O. hours taken shall require a two-week notice. Unless the Town Council
approves such extended period in advance of the time it is taken, no more than
two consecutive weeks can be taken at one time and no two consecutive week
periods may be taken within 90 days of each other. This means that the last day
of one consecutive two-week P.T.O. period may not occur within 90 days of the
first day of another consecutive two-week P.T.O. period. These limitations also
apply to supervisors.
         (d)   Exceptions. No allowance will be made for sickness during
scheduled P.T.O. unless a doctor’s statement is provided. No employee will be
required to charge P.T.O. for a holiday observed by the town that falls during
the employee’s scheduled P.T.O.
      (3)   Payroll check. Up to two weeks of P.T.O. pay may be paid to an
employee before the start of P.T.O. to receive advance P.T.O. hours pay. An
employee must request it on the time sheet that would result in the warrant
being issued on a regular payroll date prior to the P.T.O. leave.
      (4)   Carryover and banking of P.T.O. hours. Unused paid time off hours
that were credited and earned during the year and remaining at the end of a
year may be carried over into the next year with the approval of the Supervisor
subject to the following:
         (a)    No more than 50% of the employee's total P.T.O. hours credited
and earned for a year may be carried over as P.T.O. for the following year.
         (b)   Carry over requests must be submitted to the supervisor during
December of the year in which the time was earned on the form provided by the
supervisor.
         (c)   Any unused P.T.O. hours which are carried over into the next
year and which are not used during that year will automatically be placed into
the employee's sick bank.
         (d)   Unused P.T.O. hours may be converted to the employee's sick bank
provided the supervisor approves the conversion. There is no maximum number of
hours that may be converted to the employee's sick bank. The conversion request
must be submitted to the supervisor on the form provided by the supervisor, and
the conversion request may be made at any time of the year during which the
P.T.O. hours were earned.
      (5)   Pay for unused P.T.O. upon written notification of intent to
separate (resign or retire) from employment. If an employee who is vested in
the town’s retirement plan should separate and leave in good standing after
giving proper notice, the employee shall be paid for unused P.T.O. up to a
maximum of 336 hours. If the employee terminates employment before June 30 of a
given year, P.T.O. hours shall be prorated for the first six months. To
calculate: take the total earned P.T.O. hours for the year and divide by 12 to
get the monthly rate, take that rate times the number of months or portion of
months employed to determine the number of P.T.O. hours paid to the employee
less any P.T.O. hours that have been taken off prior to June 30. If more P.T.O.
hours were taken before June 30 than earned, the employee shall owe the
difference to the town. After June 30 all remaining credited P.T.O. hours and
unused holidays shall be paid to the employee in a lump sum payment. One check
shall be provided to the employee after the last day of paid status on the next
regular payroll day.
   (B)   Regular part-time. All part-time employees shall receive one hour
P.T.O. for every 24 hours worked.
      (1)   Scheduling and payroll check. Part-time employees shall comply with
§
36.121(A)(1)(a), (A)(2) and (A)(3) listed above.
      (2)   Carryover. Employees do not have the option to carryover P.T.O.
hours into the next year. However, supervisors may credit employees for
accumulated P.T.O. hours that are earned in the last quarter of the year.
      (3)   Pay for unused P.T.O. upon separation from employment. No pay will
be received for any unused P.T.O. hours.

it shall be observed on the preceding Friday. When a paid holiday falls on a
Sunday, it shall be observed on the following Monday.

§ 36.123 LONGEVITY.
   The longevity pay policy provides additional salary increments to all full-
time employees based on years of service with the town. Longevity pay accrues
on the employee’s first anniversary date of hire and shall be paid with the
first pay period in November of each year. If employment is terminated by
either the employee or the town prior to the employee’s anniversary date of
hire, the employee shall not receive longevity pay for that year. Vacation and
other benefit days may not be used to extend the time of employment in an
effort to gain longevity pay.
(Ord. 05-04, passed 2-28-2005; Am. Ord. 2021-02, passed 3-8-2021)
§ 36.124 LONGEVITY PAY.
   (A)   Each regular full-time employee shall receive a longevity payment,
commencing on the first year anniversary date of hire of continuous
uninterrupted employment. Payments will occur only once a year. This payment is
contingent upon the employee having received a favorable evaluation in the year
that the payment is to be made. Any employee on disciplinary probation on the
anniversary date will not be eligible for the longevity payment, unless the
employee files a written request with the employee’s supervisor requesting a
hearing with the supervisor and the Town Manager to discuss this issue. If the
supervisor and the Town Manager concur that the longevity payment should be
made, they shall submit a finding in writing to the Council, who will then vote
on that finding at the next Council meeting.
   (B)   Longevity payments shall be made as follows:
      (1)   Full time employees shall receive $100 in longevity pay after the
employee has completed one year of employment, and shall receive an additional
$100 for each additional full year of continuous uninterrupted employment, with
payments capped at 20 years of employment with the town.
      (2)   Longevity pay will be paid with the first pay in November of each
year.
      (3)   Longevity pay will be added to the current year's pay of the full
time employees for the purpose of calculating overtime.

§ 36.125 FAMILY EMERGENCY OR ILLNESS.
   Absence necessitated by a family emergency or illness of a member of the
immediate family shall be approved, providing the total absence does not exceed
two days within a payroll period. These two days shall be chargeable to the
employee’s sick leave account.
(Ord. 05-04, passed 2-28-2005)
§ 36.126 PAID SICK LEAVE.
   (A)   Earned sick leave. Employees shall be credited with one sick day for
each calendar month of paid status. This credit will be made on the first day
of the month following each month of paid status. Sick leave shall accumulate
while on newly hired status and may be used after 120 days of full-time
employment with the town. Overtime hours are not to be included in the
calculation of sick leave. A sick day equals eight hours pay.
   (B)   Sick leave used. Sick days are intended for use only when the employee
is medically ill or injured. Employees shall not be paid for sick days unless
they notify their supervisor at home or the appropriate office before
commencement of the employee’s shift. If the illness extends beyond two
consecutive days, the employee must request, in writing from the supervisor, an
extended sick leave and support such request with a written statement from the
employee’s physician. An employee may not return from an extended sick leave
without submitting to the supervisor a written release from the employee’s
physician permitting the employee to return to work. Sick leave will be granted
with no less than a one hour minimum requested per occurrence, provided the
employee has accumulated the requested amount of sick time.
   (C)   Sick leave accumulation. Sick leave shall be allowed to accumulate
forever.
   (D)   Absenteeism and abuse of sick leave.  The following shall be grounds
for discipline up to and including termination:
      (1)   Wrongful use. Use of sick leave for reasons other than illness,
doctor appointments or injury, except as expressly permitted by these policies
and procedures.
      (2)   Pattern of sick leave abuse.  This includes recurring use of sick
days on Fridays or Mondays, days before or after town holidays or days before
or after scheduled time off such as P.T.O. days or compensatory days off. This
also includes repeated use of sick days on days, which the employee reasonably
should know to be important to the department by reason of workload, deadlines
or other causes rendering absences particularly deleterious to the department.
Any combination of the above may constitute a pattern of abuse of sick leave.
      (3)   Exceeding accumulated sick leave. If it is determined the employee
has abused employee’s sick leave then the employee will be subject to the
following disciplinary action:
         (a)   First offense shall result in a written warning to be placed in
the employee’s personnel file.
         (b)   Second offense within one year of the first offense shall result
in a written warning and may receive one to three days suspension without pay.
In addition, the employee may be placed on disciplinary probation.
         (c)   Third offense within one year of the second offense may result
in immediate termination.
   (E)   Transferring days.  An employee may transfer accumulated sick days to
another employee with the supervisor’s approval providing the employee
receiving the sick days has expended all time off due to illness or injury.
Those days transferred shall be deducted from the employee who agrees to
transfer the sick days and shall be credited to the employee who accepts such
sick days. All transfers shall be in writing on forms prepared by the Town
Clerk- Treasurer and shall be signed by the individual employee transferring
the sick days and the employee receiving the sick days.
   (F)   Non-payment for accumulated sick leave.
      (1)   Employees shall not be allowed to use a combination of sick leave
and P.T.O. to reach a known or pending date of separation from employment.
      (2)   Accumulated sick leave shall not be converted to wages upon
separation from employment. An employee shall not receive cash or check for any
remaining accumulated sick leave.
      (3)   Likewise, due to death of the employee, the employee's spouse or
estate shall not be entitled to receive the monetary compensation.

§ 36.127 OTHER LEAVES.
   (A)   Leave of absence. Leaves of absence without pay may be granted to an
employee after one
year of employment with the town, subject to the following conditions:

the Town Council must prepare a statement to certify the employee medically
disabled.
      (4)   During a leave of absence benefits shall not accrue. An employee

States, in accordance with the Uniformed Services Re-Employment Rights Act of
1994 (USERRA) and I.C. 10-2-4-3. While on such leave, he or she shall be paid
his or her regular salary for a maximum of 15 working days in any calendar
year. He or she shall retain all employee benefits during the leave. To receive
payment of salary during military leave, an employee must, prior to the leave,
file a copy of his or her official orders with the Clerk/Treasurer. Upon
return, certification from the employer's commanding officer of performance of
duty in accordance with terms of the orders must also be filed. In addition, in
accordance with I.C. 10-2-4-4, any regular full-time employee who is called to
active duty by the Governor in case of war, invasion, insurrection, public
disaster, breach of peace or imminent danger, shall be entitled to an unpaid
leave of absence. While on such leave, the employee shall retain, but not
accrue, all employee benefits.
   (C)   Bereavement leave.  
      (1)   If there is a death in the employee’s immediate family (spouse,
child, brother, sister, parent, parent of spouse, or step equivalents thereof,
grandparents and grandchildren) necessary time off for the attendance of
funeral matters will be approved with pay providing the total absence does not
exceed three days. In the case of the death of an employee’s brother-in-law,
sister-in-law, mate or step equivalents thereof, absence with pay will be
approved providing the total absence does not exceed one day. For purposes of
this provision, a day equals the number of hours the employee would regularly
have been scheduled to work on the day taken off. 24/48 firemen shall receive
one 24-hour shift off for any of the above family members.
      (2)   In recognition of the varying relationships between employees and
their loved ones, employees may be permitted up to one additional day off with
pay in the event of the death of a loved one, provided the employee request
this leave in writing to his or her supervisor. By necessity, the supervisor
shall consider each request on a case-by-case basis and the supervisor’s
decision will be final.
   (D)   Civic leave. An employee who is required to serve as a juror, or to
attend court or a coroner’s inquest as a witness, shall be excused from work
for the days on which he or she serves and shall receive for each day of this
type of service on which he or she otherwise would have worked the difference
between his or her regular straight time rate and the payment he or she
receives for that service. The employee shall present proof of service
(subpoena) and of the amount of payment received therefore from the clerk of
the court or coroner. If an employee is released from jury duty by the court
any time prior to noon, he or she shall report to work within one hour after
being released by the court.
   (E)   Family military leave.
      (1)   Eligibility. An ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE (an employee who has been
employed by the town for at least 12 months and worked 1,250 hours withing the
previous 12-month-period, who is a spouse, son, daughter or parent of a person
who is on or ordered to active duty in the armed forces) may take family
military leave in the following circumstances:
         (a)   A QUALIFYING EXIGENCY occurs, arising out of the fact that the
spouse, son, daughter or parent of the employee is on active duty, or has been
notified of an impending call to active duty status, in support of a
“contingency operation” as determined by the Secretary of Defense.
         (b)   To care for a covered service member, when the employee is the
spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin of a covered service member who
has incurred an injury or illness in the line of duty while on active duty in
the armed forces, which may render the service member medically unfit to
perform duties of the service member's grade, rank or rating. COVERED SERVICE
MEMBER means a member of the armed forces who is receiving medical treatment,
recuperation or therapy, or is otherwise in outpatient status or on the
temporary disability retired list, for a serious illness or injury. NEXT-OF-KIN
is defined as the nearest blood relative of the injured or recovering service
member.
      (2)   Maximum amount of leave.
         (a)   Leave due to a “qualifying exigency”. An eligible employee may
take up to 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period. This type of leave
will be counted toward the employee's 12-week maximum of Family and Medical
Leave in a 12-month period.
         (b)   Leave to care for an injured or ill service member. An eligible
employee may take up to 26 workweeks of leave during a single 12-month period
to care for the service member. Leave to care for an injured or ill service
member, when combined with other FMLA-qualifying leave, may not exceed 26 weeks
in a single 12 month period.
         (c)   Husband and wife both employed by the town.
            (1)   A husband and wife who are both employed by the same
department within the town may both take leave due to a “qualifying exigency”,
and are jointly entitled to a combined total of 12 workweeks of leave. If
spouses are both employed by the town, but work in separate departments, they
are each entitled to 26 workweeks of leave.
            (2)   A husband and wife who are both employed by the same
department with the town may both take leave to care for an injured or ill
service member, and are jointly entitled to a combined total of 26 weeks of
leave. If spouses are both employed by the town, but work in separate
departments, they are each entitled to 26 workweeks of leave.
      (3)   Documentation.
         (a)   When leave is due to a qualifying exigency, employees requesting
this leave must provide proof of the qualifying service member's call-up or
active military service paperwork. This documentation may be a copy of the
military orders or other official armed forces communication.
         (b)   When leave is to care for an injured or ill service member,
employees requesting this leave must provide documentation of the service
member's illness, injury and need for care. This documentation may be in the
form of a copy of the military medical information orders for treatment, or
other official armed forces communication pertaining to the service member's
injury or illness incurred on active military duty that renders the service
member medically unfit to perform his or her military duties. Employees will
also need to complete and submit form DOL WH-380 to the payroll clerk.
      (4)   Advance notice.
         (a)   When an employee plans to take family military leave, the
employee must complete a request for leave form.
         (b)   The employee is required to file the request with the employee's
supervisor 30 days in advance of the need to take family military leave, unless
the activation orders are issued less than 30 days before the requested leave
is to begin, in which case the employee shall provide such notice as is
reasonable and practicable.
         (c)   Activation orders must be forwarded to the supervisor with the
request for leave form. All completed request for leave forms and copies of
orders must be forwarded to the payroll clerk.
      (5)   Intermittent leave.
         (a)   Leave taken because of a qualifying exigency may be taken
intermittently or on a reduced-schedule basis.
         (b)   Leave taken to care for an ill or injured service member may be

§ 36.128 FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE.
   (A)   The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (“Act”) provides eligible
employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for their own serious health
condition which makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of
his or her job, the birth or care of a newborn child, the placement with the
employee of an adoptive child or a foster care child, or the care of the
employee’s child, spouse or parent with a serious health condition.
   (B)   All requests for Family and Medical Leave Act leave must be submitted
in writing to the supervisor for determination. Such requests shall be
supported by medical certification on FMLA forms provided by the town.
   (C)   For an employee to be eligible for Family and Medical Leave, the
employee must have been employed by the town for at least 12 months, and to
have worked 1,250 hours within the previous 12-month period. For purposes of
time worked, the town will follow the IRS guidelines, which currently state
that any time employed prior to a seven-year break in service will not be
counted toward the 12 months employed.
   (D)   The town requires medical certification to support a claim for leave
for an employee’s serious illness or the serious illness of a child, spouse or
parent. For an employee’s own medical leave, the certification must include a
statement that the employee is unable to perform the functions of their
position. For leave to care for a seriously ill child, spouse or parent the
certification must include an estimate of the amount of the employee’s time
that will be needed to care for the child, spouse or parent. The town reserves
the right to require a second medical opinion from an independent medical
provider. The town will pay for the second opinion and will designate a
provider who is not an employee of the town. If the two opinions conflict, the
town will pay for a third opinion. The opinion of the third provider is final
and binding on both the town and the employee.
   (E)   When an employee plans to take family or medical leave under the Act,
the employee is required to give the employee’s supervisor 30 days written
notice or if this is not possible, as much notice as is practical.
   (F)   An employee undergoing planned treatment is required to make a
reasonable effort to schedule the treatment to minimize disruptions to the town
operations.
   (G)   The town may require an employee to report periodically during the
leave period on the employee’s leave status and the employee’s intention to
return to work. The town may consider an employee failure to report to work at
the end of the leave period as an employee resignation.
   (H)   The employee may choose or the supervisor may require the employee to
use any sick leave, compensatory leave, paid time off, or regularly scheduled
holidays for any part of the 12-week period of FMLA leave.
   (I)   Sick leave shall not continue to accrue during the period of the
employee’s FMLA leave; however, the employee remains responsible for their
share of any benefits costs. Any health plan, including self-insured plans,
provided by the town will be continued for the employee on Family and Medical
Leave on the same terms as such coverage would have been provided if the
employee had continued their work during the period that they were on leave
covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act; provided that, if the employee
fails to return to work, the employee must repay the premium costs, unless the
employee’s failure to return to work is beyond the employee’s control.
   (J)   An employee who completes a period of leave will be returned either to
the same position the employee was in prior to the leave or to a position
equivalent in pay, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment.
   (K)   For purposes of calculating an employee’s entitlement to subsequent
FMLA leave, the “12-month period” is measured forward from the date when the
employee’s previous FMLA leave began. For example, under this method an
employee would be entitled to 12 weeks of leave during the year beginning on
the first date FMLA is taken (such as March 5, 2003); the next 12-month period
would begin the first time leave is taken after completion of that 12-month
period ending (such as March 4, 2004).
2015 S-10
   (L)   FMLA leave to care for a newborn child or a newly adopted child must
be taken within 12 months from the date of birth or the date of placement. If
both the husband and wife work for the town, their combined total leave is
limited to 12 weeks.

§ 36.129 EXTENDED NON-PAID LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
   (A)   Definition. A planned leave of absence is scheduled leave from
employment duties for a reason, which serves the best interest of the town.
   (B)   Eligibility. Only full-time and part-time employees who have completed
one year of continuous town employment are eligible to apply for a planned
leave of absence.
   (C)   Duration. A planned leave of absence shall be for a period of not less
than one month and not more than six months; however, leave for an elected
official may not extend beyond the term of the official.
   (D)   Application. Employees desiring to take a planned leave of absence
shall submit an application for extended, non-paid leave of absence form to
their supervisor. The request shall be forwarded to the supervisor for
consideration.
   (E)   Approval. The decision as to whether to grant a leave and the terms
thereof lies entirely with the supervisor. However, if it is an appointed
supervisor who is requesting such leave, the decision to approve or deny lies
with the supervisor’s supervising authority.
   (F)   Compensation. Employees will not be paid during their leave of
absence.
   (G)   Benefits.  Employees will not accrue any benefits while on leave.
However, an approved leave does not constitute a break in continuous service.
Accordingly, eligibility for benefits that require continuous service will not
be affected during the period that an employee is on approved leave. The
employee on leave will remain on INPRS but no additional INPRS contributions by
the town will be made during the leave. The employee on leave will continue to
have medical insurance benefits, if eligible under the terms of the insurance
policy. However, the employee must make arrangements with the Clerk- Treasurer
to pay the full amount of the premium unless the supervisor approves the leave
for medical reasons, which are verified by a physician’s statement (in which
case, the employee must pay only the employee portion of the premium).
   (H)   Return from leave. Thirty days before returning work, they must
provide written notice to their supervisor of the employee’s intention to
return to work. Within seven days thereafter, the employee shall make an
appointment with the supervisor to discuss the return or the employee forfeits
any right to return which may have previously been granted by the town.
(Ord. 05-04, passed 2-28-2005)
§ 36.130 WORKER’S COMPENSATION.
   On-the-job injury. Accidents on the job, regardless of how minor, must be
reported at once to the employee’s supervisor. Prompt notification is necessary
to obtain coverage under the Worker’s Compensation Policy. Employees medically
disabled on the job shall receive benefits in accordance with Indiana law,
specifically I.C. 22-3-3-7, provided a physician acceptable to the town
certifies that the employee was unable to work.
   (A)   Employees medically disabled on the job shall receive their normal
rate of pay for the first five days they were scheduled to work following the
beginning of the medical disability, provided a physician acceptable to the
town certifies that the employee was unable to work.
   (B)   Benefit days, except for holidays, continue to accrue during the time
off due to an on-the-job injury; such time off shall not be charged against the
employee’s sick leave account nor shall such time off constitute a break in
service.
   (C)   An employee who receives Worker’s Compensation benefits for the first
five days of normally scheduled work and who has already been paid for those
days shall be required to immediately reimburse the town for five days of
Worker’s Compensation benefits.
   (D)   Neither the town nor the insurance carrier will be liable for the
payment of Worker’s Compensation benefits for off-duty injuries or injuries
that occur during an employee’s voluntary participation in any off-duty
recreational, social or athletic activity sponsored by the town.
   (E)   On the day of the incident or as soon as possible thereafter, the
injured employee’s supervisor must complete a Supervisor’s Incident
Investigation Report and all other necessary forms. The forms are available
from the Clerk-Treasurer and must be returned to the Clerk-Treasurer for
processing.
(Ord. 05-04, passed 2-28-2005; Am. Ord. 2012-01, passed 1-9-2012)
§ 36.131 MEDICAL BENEFITS AND LIFE INSURANCE.
   (A)   Benefits. The town has established a medical benefits and life
insurance plan for regular full-time employees and their families who choose to
participate. A portion of the cost of this plan is paid by the town, which
includes a $20,000 term life insurance policy to each full-time employee. The
terms and conditions specified in such plans govern coverages. Information
about how to enroll, change or continue coverage may be obtained from the
supervisor. Forms may be obtained from, and filed at, the Clerk Treasurer's
Office.
   (B)   Initial enrollment period-new employees. Eligible new employees may
enroll in the health benefits plan within 30 days of being hired. Insurance
coverage will begin on the first day of the month following 30 days of full-
time employment with the town. Employees who do not elect to participate in the
plan will be asked to sign a waiver of this benefit.
   (C)   Newly eligible persons.
      (1)   Spouse. A new spouse may be enrolled if the application for
coverage is received and enrollment fees are paid within 31 days of marriage.
      (2)   Newborn and adopted children. Newborn and adopted children are
eligible for coverage. The child may be enrolled for coverage in the plan if
the employee submits an application to the insurance company within 31 days of
the date of the child's birth or placement.
   (D)   Special enrollment. Under some circumstances, a special enrollment may
occur if an employee waived coverage for himself or herself or dependants at
the time of initial enrollment. Refer to the insurance plan contracts for
details for qualifying events.
   (E)   Dropping dependents or canceling coverage. If an employee participates
in a Section 125 TaxSaver Plan, the employee may not drop dependents or cancel
coverage until the end of the plan year, unless the employee experiences a
qualifying event as determined by the IRS.
   (F)   Section 125 TaxSaver Plan.
      (1)   The Section 125 TaxSaver Plan (FlexSystem) can save money for any
employee who pays for insurance coverage or establishes a flexible spending
account for unreimbursed medical expenses through payroll deductions. Premiums
for insurance coverages or flexible spending accounts are deducted from the
paycheck before federal, FICA, state and local taxes are calculated. Taxes are
computed on the reduced amount. Taxes on the lesser amount result in fewer
taxes and more take home pay, but will affect total earnings for Social
Security purposes.
      (2)   To participate in the TaxSaver Plan (flexible spending account),
employees must sign a salary redirection agreement each year. Employees cannot
change or revoke this agreement with respect to pre-tax deductions before the
next anniversary date of the Plan unless a “change of status”, as defined by
IRS regulations, occurs.
   (G)   Supplemental insurance programs.  Supplemental medical, disability and
life insurance (including policies on family members) programs are available.
The costs of such supplemental policies are paid entirely by the participating
employee through payroll deductions.

§ 36.132 RESERVED.
§ 36.133 BENEFITS CONTINUATION (COBRA).
   (A)   The Federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA)
gives employees and their qualified beneficiaries the opportunity to continue
health insurance coverage under the town’s health plan when a “qualifying
event” would normally result in the loss of eligibility. Common qualifying
events include but are not limited to resignation, termination of employment,
death of an employee, a reduction in an employee’s hours or a leave of absence;
an employee’s divorce or legal separation and a dependent child no longer
meeting eligibility requirements.
   (B)   Under COBRA the employee or beneficiary pays the full cost of coverage
at the town’s group rates, plus an administration fee. The town, through a
third-party administrator, provides each eligible employee with a written
notice describing rights granted under COBRA when the employee becomes eligible
for coverage under the town’s health insurance plan. The notice contains
important information about the employee’s rights and obligations. Supervisors
must notify the Clerk- Treasurer immediately after an employee is terminated.
   (C)   Specific details regarding eligibility and coverage are available from
the Clerk-Treasurer.
(Ord. 05-04, passed 2-28-2005)
§ 36.134 INDIANA PUBLIC RETIREMENT SYSTEM (INPRS).
   (A)   The town employees are eligible for enrollment in the Indiana Public
Retirement System (INPRS). INPRS funds consist of an employee contribution and
employer contribution. Currently, the town pays the employees’ contribution as
part of the employee’s benefit package. Retirement benefit eligibility is
determined by age and creditable service. The employee will become eligible for
normal retirement with full benefits if he or she is age 65 and have ten or
more years of creditable service with INPRS. Early retirement benefits are also
available provided that the employee are between the ages of 50 and 65 and have
15 or more years of creditable service.
   (B)   If the employee terminates employment before completing ten years of
creditable service, the employee is entitled to receive a refund of his or her
employee contribution plus all accumulated interest credited to his or her
account regardless of whether it is employee paid or employer paid. The
employer paid portion and the interest will be taxable.
(Ord. 05-04, passed 2-28-2005)
§ 36.135 DEFERRED COMPENSATION.
   (A)   The town offers a voluntary deferred compensation program to eligible
employees.
   (B)   Full-time employees may participate in a deferred compensation
program. This program is a way to set aside part of an employee’s income
through voluntary payroll deductions that defer tax liabilities on this income
until retirement. Different investment options are available and may be
discussed with a representative of the company, which administers the deferred
compensation program.
(Ord. 05-04, passed 2-28-2005)
§ 36.136 USE OF TOWN PROPERTY.
   (A)   Use of telephones and town mail.
      (1)   Personal telephone calls shall be limited in frequency and
duration. Personal use of telephones and FAX machines for long-distance and
toll calls at the town’s expense are not permitted. Employees making long-
distance and toll calls shall notify their Supervisor of this use and shall
reimburse the town for the calls.
      (2)   To ensure effective telephone communications, employees shall
always use the approved greeting and speak in a courteous and professional
manner. The mail system is reserved for business purposes only. Employees shall
refrain from sending or receiving personal mail at the workplace.
   (B)   Use of computers, e-mail and the internet.
      (1)   Purpose. Employees are provided with information technology
(computers, computer software and the e-mail system) as a tool to support the
business of the town. The effective performance of the town’s computer and
telecommunications network depends upon users adhering to established standards
of proper conduct. In general, this requires efficient, ethical and legal
utilization of network resources. This resource, as with any other public
resource, demands those entrusted with the privilege of its use to be
accountable. The following guidelines and policies define the responsibilities
of employees and volunteers using network and internet resources. USE OF THE
TOWN OF ELLETTSVILLE’S NETWORK RESOURCES IS A PRIVILEGE, NOT A RIGHT.
      (2)   Monitoring of internet use. Town computers, the town internet
connection and the electronic mail (e-mail) system are town assets and are
subject to review or monitoring at any time without notice. Because the
computers, internet connections and the e-mail system belong to the town and
not to the employees, employees should have no expectation of privacy regarding
these items. Users should be aware that information contained on town
computers, including their e-mail messages, is subject to public disclosure. If
a user violates any of the provisions contained in this policy, his or her
access to the town resources may be denied and disciplinary action may be
taken.
      (3)   Internet use policy. All users of town provided internet services,
including e-mail, must abide by state, federal and local laws. Internet and e-
mail use must comply with town policies and regulations, including town’s Equal
Opportunity Employment policies as well as the policies prohibiting harassment
in the workplace.
      (4)   Software duplication prohibited. The town purchases and licenses
the use of various computer software for business purposes and does not own the
copyright to this software or its related documentation. Unless authorized by
the software developer, the town does not have the right to reproduce this
software for use on more than one computer. Employees may only use software on
multiple machines according to software license agreements. The town prohibits
the illegal duplication of software and its related documentation. No licensed
software may be installed on town computers that has not been authorized by the
town and/or is not properly licensed to the town.
      (5)   Acceptable use. The following are acceptable uses of the town
computer resources:
         (a)   Work related use. The internet and e-mail are to be used for the
town’s business purposes. Using appropriate web sites for work-related purposes
is unrestricted as long as it is reasonable.
         (b)   Personal use. The internet is a powerful communications tool
that can provide a great deal of useful information. Unfortunately, it can also
be a distraction from productive work when browsing non-work related sites.
While personal use of the internet and e-mail is permitted, it is to be kept to
a minimum. Personal use must be non- commercial, that is, not related to any
for-profit business or activity or any use for which the employee will receive
remuneration. Extensive use of network resources for personal use is
prohibited.
            1.   E-mail. Personal e-mail shall be sent or received as seldom
and be as brief, as possible. Use of personal e-mail, which unduly disrupts the
employee’s work or is deemed to be excessive by the employee’s Supervisor, may
result in the employee being disciplined or terminated.
            2.   Internet. Exploring the internet for non-work related purposes
shall be done before or after work or during the lunch break.
            3.   Time sheets. Time spent or personal internet or e-mail use
shall not be included as time worked on daily time sheets.
            4.   Common sense. Use common sense with open web sites, especially
with visitors in the area. For example, if the employee is searching the
internet during his or her lunch hour, be sensitive to the fact that the
general public may view his or her computer screen and see that he or she are
on a non-work related web site; the public will no be aware that the employee
is utilizing his or her lunch hour for this internet activity and could assume
that he or she is “surfing the net” while “on the clock”.
      (6)   Security. Employees shall not allow unauthorized access to the town
computer network. Allowing unauthorized access includes, but is not limited to:
sharing passwords with other individuals, making authentication items such as
passwords easily available, failing to log off when leaving a computer and
allowing unauthorized persons physical or electronic access to the town’s
systems. Individual users may be held accountable for their account’s use by
other people.
      (7)   Passwords. The password feature of the town computer network is the
foundation for maintaining the confidentiality of the communication system.
Confidentiality of passwords and user accounts must be protected. Passwords,
system telephone numbers and similar information may not be disseminated to the
public and must be retained as confidential information by the user. For
privacy reasons, employees may not attempt to gain access to another employee’s
personal file of e-mail messages without the latter’s express permission.
Internet accounts are to be accessed only by the authorized user of the
account.
      (8)   Security issues.  All security issues shall be communicated
immediately upon discovery to the Supervisor.
      (9)   Direct internet access prohibited.  Employees may only access the
internet through an approved internet firewall. Accessing the internet
directly, by modem, is strictly prohibited unless such access is approved by
the Supervisor.
      (10)   Receiving unsolicited offensive material.  If an employee receives
files, messages or information which violates the restrictions outlined in this
policy or which makes the employee feel uncomfortable or offended, the employee
shall immediately call the matter to the attention of the employee’s immediate
Supervisor. The Supervisor should contact a representative of the town to
investigate the matter.
      (11)   Use of private software prohibited. No private software,
“shareware” or other unauthorized products may be run on town systems.
      (12)   Downloading programs. Employees shall not install or execute
software or hardware that could damage the town’s systems. Such software
includes, but is not limited to, files that have been downloaded from the
internet or sent as an attachment to e-mail.
      (13)   Virus protection. All material downloaded from the internet or
from computers or networks that do not belong to the town must be scanned for
viruses and other destructive programs before being placed onto the computer
system. All employees will be expected to follow the instructions from their
supervisor for this scanning process. Any problems noted by the Supervisor must
be resolved prior to the downloaded material being placed on the computer
system. As with all security issues, the discovery of a virus shall be
communicated immediately to the Supervisor.
      (14)   Receiving e-mail with an attachment. If the employee receives non-
departmental, external e-mail with an attachment, DO NOT TOUCH THE ATTACHMENT;
DO NOT OPEN IT; DO NOT VIEW IT, DO NOT SAVE IT TO DISK REGARDLESS OF WHO SENT
THE E-MAIL. Many viruses attach to address books and can give the appearance of
being sent to the employee by loved ones or legitimate professional contacts.
Contact the person who sent the e-mail to the employee, verify they actually
sent it to the employee and ask them what is specifically contained in the e-
mail. If the employee is at all unsure about whether or not to open an e-mail,
contact the Supervisor.
      (15)   Downloading programs from the internet. Intentional use of
internet resources to access, view or process files dangerous to the integrity
of the network is prohibited. Only software and programming services authorized
by the Supervisor(s) may be used in conjunction with the town’s computer or
communications systems.
      (16)   Privacy and confidentiality. Information transmitted through the
town’s electronic communications resources are NOT privileged communications.
EMPLOYEES ARE CAUTIONED OT TO COMMUNICATE ANY MATERIALS OR LANGUAGE THAT THEY
WOULD NOT COMMUNICATE IN A PUBLIC ARENA. Employees do not retain any right to
privacy in any documents, messages or images they create, store, send or
received on the computer or the internet under the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act and any other state or federal law regarding e-mail and internet

all vehicle purchases or acceptance of donations.
      (2)   Please notify the Supervisor if any equipment, machines, tools or
vehicles appear to be damaged, defective or in need of repair. Prompt reporting

      (3)   Employees operating town vehicles shall maintain the ability to
legally operate assigned vehicles. Employees who operate town vehicles are

drive safely. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to circumstances in
which the employee is temporarily unable to operate a vehicle safely or legally
because of illness, medication or intoxication.
      (5)   The driver of a town vehicle shall obey all traffic and safety
laws, except for fire and law enforcement personnel engaged in the performance

business stops) are permissible. The town follows the regulations set forth by
the Internal Revenue Service regarding taxable fringe benefits. Employees shall
contact their supervisors with questions about the manner in which those
regulations are applied. Each employee assigned a take home vehicle should make
sure he or she knows and understands the regulations and how they apply to the
employee.
      (7)   A town vehicle may be used only by the employee to whom it is
issued or by other employees of the town who use it for departmental business.

Accordingly, employees shall not use cellular or mobile phones if such conduct
is prohibited by law, regulation or other ordinance.

PERSONAL CONDUCT
§  36.150 ATTENDANCE AND PUNCTUALITY.
   (A)   To maintain a safe and productive work environment, the town expects
employees to be reliable and to be punctual in reporting for scheduled work.
Absenteeism and tardiness place a burden on other employees and on the town. In
the rare instance when an employee cannot avoid being late to work or is unable
to work as scheduled, the employee shall notify their supervisor at least one
half hour before the time the employee would normally begin their shift.
   (B)   Supervisors are to keep accurate records on town payroll forms of all

§ 36.151 EMPLOYEE CONDUCT AND APPEARANCE.
   Employees are expected to maintain high standards of personal appearance,
conduct, cooperation and efficiency in their work. Employees shall avoid any
actions, which conflict with town policies. Dress, grooming and personal
cleanliness standards contribute to the morale of all employees and affect the
image we present to our citizens and visitors. During business hours, employees
are expected to present a clean and neat appearance and to dress according to
the job requirements. The employee should consult his or her supervisor if he
or she has questions regarding what constitutes appropriate attire.
(Ord. 05-04, passed 2-28-2005)
§ 36.152 GIFTS AND GRATUITIES.

   (A)   The town recognizes and respects the right of individual employees to
engage in private activities outside of the workplace that do not conflict with
or reflect poorly on the town. The town also recognizes its right and
obligation to determine when an employee’s activities present a conflict of
interest with the town. At such times the town must take whatever action is
necessary to resolve the situation, including but not limited to, terminating
employment.
   (B)   Supervisors and employees having a financial interest in company or a
substantial investment in a corporation that might benefit from their dealings
with the town must file a conflict of interest statement with the Town Council,
which will be reviewed at a public meeting.
   (C)   An employee who knowingly or intentionally obtains a pecuniary
interest in or derives a profit from a contract or purchase connected with an
action by the town commits a Class D felony, unless a financial disclosure form
is approved in advance and filed as required by state law. A financial interest
of the spouse or dependent of a supervisor or employee is also covered by this
law. Employees must file a conflict of interest statement with the Town Council
whenever an employee’s outside business activities are directly or indirectly
linked to the town in a business relationship, such as vendor, supplier,
contractor or independent subcontractor. The Clerk-Treasurer has conflict of
interest forms available upon request.
   (D)   Employees with questions concerning a potential conflict of interest
must immediately contact their supervisor.
(Ord. 05-04, passed 2-28-2005)
§ 36.154 SECURITY OF PREMISES.

controlled substances, unless the employee possessing them has valid
prescriptions for such substances, alcohol, firearms, explosives or other
dangerous materials. To this end, the town prohibits the control, possession,
transfer, sale or use of these materials on its premises. The town requires the
cooperation of all employees in administering this policy.
   (B)   Desks, lockers and other storage devices are provided for the
convenience of the employees, but remain the sole property of the town.
Accordingly, these storage devices and any articles found within them can be

§ 36.155 CONFIDENTIALITY/REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION.

information, which could be confidential or privileged by law. It is a
violation of state law for a public servant to knowingly or intentionally
disclose information classified as confidential.
   (B)   Occasionally, outsiders contact employees for information about
current or former employees or about the organization’s policies, practices or
projects. All such requests shall be referred to the Supervisor. If a
supervisor has a question about what information should be released the town’s
attorney should be contacted.

impropriety or the appearance of impropriety. Public funds must never be used
for personal gain. This policy has been developed to simplify compliance.

combines business travel with personal travel, the employee will not be
considered to be in travel status during that portion of the trip, which is not
reasonably necessary for the business portion of the trip.

be reimbursed.
      (5)   Expenses for personal items and personal services will not be
reimbursed.

holidays in order to reduce the total cost of travel. The savings must be
documented and approved in advance by the Supervisor. Lodging may be claimed if
the employee is using vacation, holiday or personal leave time.
   (G)   Reimbursement for transportation.
      (1)   Air, rail or bus travel cost may be reimbursed. Whichever form of
travel the employee chooses, the employee shall attempt to obtain the least
expensive rate for that form of travel and shall make transportation
arrangements accordingly. The employee shall consult their supervisor prior to
booking transportation. Evidence, which satisfies division (D), must be
included with the accounts payable voucher.
      (2)   If a town-owned vehicle is available to the employee, it should be
used instead of a personal vehicle.
      (3)   An employee using a personal vehicle shall be reimbursed at the
prevailing state rate per mile. Employees are encouraged to share vehicle
transportation when practical, with one person designated to receive the

status for a maximum of two full driving days each way. Driving instead of
flying will be approved only where the total costs of driving (including any
reimbursed mileage, meal allowance and lodging en route) do not exceed the

      (4)   Carryover and banking of P.T.O. hours. Unused Paid Time Off hours
that were credited and earned during the year and remaining at the end of a

take the total earned P.T.O. hours for the year and divide by 12 to get the
monthly rate, take that rate times the number of months or portion of months
employed to determine the number of P.T.O. hours paid to the employee less any
P.T.O. hours that have been taken off prior to June 30. If more P.T.O. hours
were taken before June 30 than earned, the employee shall owe the difference to

§ 36.222.1 SHIFT BIDDING PREFERENCE.
   (A)   Full-time Deputy Marshals shall shift bid based on their seniority
with the most senior Deputy Marshal having preference on shift selection and
normal days off preference as posted or presented by the Town Marshal or a
designee. Then shift preference shall be decided in descending order of full-
time seniority with the police department. For the purposes of shift bidding
preference in the rank of Deputy Marshal, only the current term of
uninterrupted full-time employment with the Town of Ellettsville Police
Department shall be considered. The current term of full-time employment shall
be measured from last start date the employee was hired for a full-time
position with the Ellettsville Police Department. In the case of sergeants,
time in rank is the deciding factor for shift preference. Part-time employment
with the police department or other employment for the Town of Ellettsville
does not count toward seniority for shift bidding preference within the police
department.
      (1)   The Town Marshal shall be regularly assigned to work first shift to
perform the necessary functions of the Department Administrator.
      (2)   The Chief Deputy Marshal shall be assigned to first shift to
function as department head in the absence of the Town Marshal.
      (3)   The sergeants shall shift bid amongst themselves based on seniority
in the position of sergeant. In this instance, seniority in the rank of
sergeant takes preference over department seniority. One sergeant shall be
assigned to second shift (evening) and one sergeant shall be assigned to third
shift (late night) based on shift bid preference.
      (4)    Shift choices will be posted or presented by the Town Marshal or a
designee in November of each year. Once shift bidding preferences have been
submitted, the Town Marshal or a designee shall sort them by seniority and let
each individual employee know what shift assignment they will have at the start
of the coming year. The Town Marshal or a designee shall make these shift
assignments known as soon as is practical to accommodate the effected employees
efforts to make adjustments in their personal lives.  
   (B)   This policy does not preclude the Town Marshal or his or her designee
from using any sworn employee, non-ranking or ranking alike, in various shifts
during their work week to cover shift shortages created by time off requests,
or special assignments as the Town Marshal deems necessary. This policy also
does not encompass any future full-time specialized positions that may be
created, such as, but not limited to: School Resource Officer, Detective, and
the like.
(Ord. 2014-17, passed 11-10-2014)
§ 36.223 OVERTIME.

supervisor.
   (B)   Overtime pay will conform to the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. –
207(k). For purposes of computing overtime, a work period shall consist of 14
days for all police department employees.
   (C)   For regular full-time and part-time employees, all hours worked in
excess of 86 hours during a 14-day work period shall be computed as time and a
half. For 40-hour employees, all hours worked in excess of 80 hours during a
14-day work period shall be computed as time and a half. All other hours worked
will be paid at a straight time rate.
   (D)   For purposes of determining when to pay overtime, only those hours
actually worked during the work period will be considered. P.T.O. time,
vacation time, sick time or any time off for any reason, shall not be included
in the hourly calculation. This applies to part-time, regular full-time, and
regular 40 hour employees.

and a half for non- scheduled hours for attendance at court or for other legal
proceedings related to department business providing a subpoena has been issued
requiring the presence of the Deputy. The original subpoena must be attached to
the Deputy's time sheet in order to receive pay.
(Ord. 05-04, passed 2-28-2005)
§ 36.225 CALL-OUT TIME.
   All off duty police department employees who are called back to duty for

§ 36.226 COMPENSATORY TIME.
   (A)   Pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), full-time non-exempt
employees hired by the Department may earn compensatory time off as a condition
of their employment.
   (B)   In accordance with the FLSA, the Department may grant to police
employees compensatory time off in lieu of compensation for hours worked in
excess of their normal scheduled hours. Compensatory time shall be calculated
in the same manner as §
36.223. Calculating compensatory time is based on actual hours worked. Time off
on compensatory time will not be considered as hours worked.
   (C)   Police employees may accumulate up to 480 hours of compensatory time
with the Town Marshal’s approval. Once the accrual limit has been reached, all
additional eligible overtime hours shall be paid to the employee.
   (D)   Employees may use accumulated compensatory time within a reasonable
time after making a request to the Town Marshal, providing the request does not
unduly disrupt the operations of the Department. This request has to be given
an eight-day notice.
   (E)   All compensatory time earned should be taken off within the year
earned or no later than the December 31 of the following year with the approval
of the Supervisor or it shall be paid in full to the employee by the end of
that year.
   (F)   Pursuant to the FLSA, the Department may, at its option, substitute
cash overtime payments to any employee, in whole or in part, in lieu of
granting compensatory time off.
   (G)   Upon termination of employment, the employee shall be paid for all
accumulated and unused hours of compensatory time at the average regular rate
received by the employee during the last three years of employment or the
employee's final regular rate, whichever is higher.
   (H)   In the event any portion of this policy is in conflict with the FLSA
or its regulations, any conflicting portion shall be stricken, and the
remainder of this policy shall remain in full force and effect as supplemented
by applicable provisions of the FLSA.

least one year. The new hire status may be extended for no more than six
additional months or a total of 18 months. All newly hired police employees
must attend the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy located in Plainfield, Indiana
within the first year of employment. If the newly hired employee fails a
portion or all of the training, that employee has the opportunity to pass the
training course(s) a second time. If, however, the employee fails any portion
of the training after the second time, the employee will be dismissed from
employment.
      (2)   All newly hired police employees shall meet the qualifications as
set forth in Indiana Code 5-2- 1. All persons appointed as law enforcement
officers on or after July 6, 1972 were/are mandated to complete basic training
within one year of the date they are originally sworn in as a law enforcement
officer. Failure to do so results in the loss of arrest powers. Extensions of
the one-year time limit can only be granted for military or other authorized
leave of absence. In such cases an aggregate of time before and after the leave
of absence shall be used to determine when law enforcement authority expires.
   (B)   Training.  The Academy’s Basic course for new police officers consists
of over 600 hours of training in a variety of areas. Criminal and traffic law,
firearms, emergency vehicle operations, physical tactics, EMS awareness and
human behavior are some of the major areas of instruction during this course. A
variety of other police related subjects such as accident investigation,
criminal investigation, domestic violence and sexual assault, water rescue
training, Standardized Field Sobriety Test, crime prevention and drug and
narcotics are included in the areas an officer must study before graduating.
The course of study is designed to incorporate practical as well as classroom
exercises so the officers have a better idea of how they will react to

* On election years, eight additional hours be added to the yearly figure.
Note: Forty hour a week police employees shall follow the General Policies
concerning their P.T.O. hours.
      (2)   Scheduling of P.T.O. hours.  All P.T.O. time off shall be approved
by the supervisor in accordance of the needs of the department. Supervisors
shall make every effort to respect the requests of employees consistent with
the need of the department.
         (a)   Minimum usage after a one-hour notice. The minimum amount of
P.T.O. time taken at any one time shall be no less than one hour and no more
than seven hours and 15 minutes after a one-hour notice has been given to the
supervisor for approval.
         (b)   Maximum usage notice. Maximum usage after a 24 notice. The
maximum amount of P.T.O. time taken at any one time shall be eight hours and 15
minutes after a 24-hour notice has been given to the supervisor for approval.
         (c)   Notice required for all other requests. All other requests for
P.T.O. hours taken shall require a two-week notice. Unless the Town Council
approves such extended period in advance of the time it is taken, no more than
two consecutive weeks can be taken at one time and no two consecutive week
periods may be taken within 90 days of each other. This means that the last day
of one consecutive two-week P.T.O. period may not occur within 90 days of the
first day of another consecutive two-week P.T.O. period. These limitations also
apply to supervisors.
         (d)   Exceptions. No allowance will be made for sickness during
scheduled P.T.O. unless a doctor’s statement is provided.
      (3)   Payroll check. Up to two-weeks of P.T.O. pay may be paid to an
employee before the start of P.T.O. to receive advance P.T.O. hours pay. An
employee must request it on the payroll claim that would result in the warrant
being issued on a regular claim date prior to the P.T.O. leave.
      (4)   Carryover and banking of P.T.O. hours.  Unused Paid Time Off hours
that were credited and earned during the year and remaining at the end of a
year may be carried over into the next year with the approval of the Supervisor
subject to the following:
         (a)   No more than 50% of the employee's total P.T.O. hours credited
and earned for a year may be carried over as P.T.O. for the following year.
         (b)   Carry over requests must be submitted to the Supervisor during
December of the year in which the time was earned on the form provided by the
supervisor.
         (c)   Any unused P.T.O. hours which are carried over into the next
year and which are not used during that year will automatically be placed into
the employee's sick bank.
         (d)   Unused P.T.O. hours may be converted to the employee's sick bank
provided the Supervisor approves the conversion. There is no maximum number of
hours that may be converted to the employee's sick bank. The conversion request
must be submitted to the supervisor on the form provided by the supervisor, and
the conversion request may be made at any time of the year during which the
P.T.O. hours were earned.
      (5)   Pay for unused P.T.O. upon written notification of intent to
separate (resign or retire) from employment. If an employee who is vested in
the town’s retirement plan should separate and leave in good standing after
giving proper notice, the employee shall be paid for unused P.T.O. up to a
maximum of 594 hours. If the employee terminates employment before June 30 of a
given year, P.T.O. hours shall be prorated for the first six months. To
calculate: take the total earned P.T.O. hours for the year and divide by 12 to
get the monthly rate, take that rate times the number of months or portion of
months employed to determine the number of P.T.O. hours paid to the employee
less any P.T.O. hours that have been taken off prior to June 30. If more P.T.O.
hours were taken before June 30 than earned, the employee shall owe the
difference to the town. After June 30 all remaining credited P.T.O. hours
earned for the year shall be paid to the employee in a lump sum payment on the
next regular payroll date after the date of separation has passed.
   (B)   Regular part-time. All part-time employees shall receive one hour
P.T.O. for every 24-hours worked.
       (1)   Scheduling and payroll check. Part- time employees shall comply
with §
36.228(A)(1)(a), (A)(2) and (A)(3) listed above.
      (2)   Carryover. Employees do not have the option to carryover P.T.O.
hours into the next year. However, supervisors may credit employees for
accumulated P.T.O. hours that are earned in the last quarter of the year.
      (3)   Pay for unused P.T.O. upon separation from employment. No pay will
be received for any unused P.T.O. hours.

§ 36.229 PAID SICK LEAVE.
   (A)   Earned sick leave.  Regular full- time and regular 40-hour employees
shall be credited with one sick day for each calendar month of paid status.
This credit will be made on the first newly hired probationary status and may
be used after 120 days of full-time employment with the town. Overtime hours
are not to be included in the calculation of sick leave. A sick day equals
eight and one quarter hours’ pay for regular full-time employees and eight
hours’ pay for regular 40-hour employees.
   (B)   Sick leave used. Sick days are intended for use only when the employee
is medically ill or injured. Employees shall not be paid for sick days unless
they notify their supervisor at home or the appropriate office before
commencement of the employee’s shift. If the illness extends beyond two
consecutive days, the employee must request, in writing from the supervisor, an
extended sick leave and support such request with a written statement from the
employee’s physician. An employee may not return from an extended sick leave
without submitting to the supervisor a written release from the employee’s
physician permitting the employee to return to work. Sick leave will be granted
with no less than a one hour minimum requests per occurrence, provided the
employee has accumulated the requested amount of sick leave.

and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods of the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided or upon suitable samples
taken at the control manhole, except for applications for NPDES permits and
reports thereof, which shall be conducted in accordance with the rules and
regulations adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and published
in the Federal Register on October 16, 1973 (40 C.F.R. 136.1 et seq.) and any
subsequent revisions, subject to approval by the town.
   (F)   In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control
manhole shall be considered to be the downstream manhole in the public sewer
nearest to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall
be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of
constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to
life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine
whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of the premises is appropriate or
whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD
and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all
outfalls, whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples.)

§ 52.113 DETERMINING WATER USAGE; SPECIAL RULES.
   (A)   The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewerage system and
obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the town shall be
determined by the town in the manner as the town shall reasonably elect; and
the sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates, except as is
hereinafter provided in this section. The town may make proper allowances in
determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be
consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the town that those
quantities do not enter the sanitary sewerage system.
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the town and the water used thereon or
therein is not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not
acceptable to the town, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise
measured or determined by the town. In order to ascertain the rate or charge
provided for in this chapter, the owner or other interested party shall, at his
or her expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring
devices, or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the
town for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (C)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the town, and in addition, is a user of
water from another source which is not measured by a water meter, or is
measured by a water meter not acceptable to the town, then the amount of water
used shall be otherwise measured or determined by the town. In order to
ascertain the rate or charge provided for in this chapter, the owner or other
interested party shall, at his or her expense, install and maintain meters,
weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any adequate and approved method of
measurement acceptable to the town for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (D)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water
supplied by the water utility serving the town and the quantity of water is
measured by a single water meter, then in each such case, for billing purposes,
the quantity of water used shall be averaged for each user. The base charge and
the flow rates and charges shall apply to each of the number of residential
lots, parcels of real estate, or buildings served through the single water
meter.
   (E)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water, or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in
excess of 10,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of
the town that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does
not and cannot enter the sanitary sewerage system, then the owner or other
interested party shall, at his or her expense, install and maintain meters,
weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any adequate and approved method of
measurement acceptable to the town for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (F)   In the event two or more dwelling units such as mobile homes,
apartments, or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other
liquids into the town’s sanitary sewerage system, either directly or
indirectly, are users of water supplied by the water utility serving the town
and the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each
such case, billing shall be for a single service in the manner set out
elsewhere in this chapter, except that the minimum bill shall not be less than
the number of these dwelling units multiplied by $7.06 per month. In the case
of mobile home courts, the number of dwelling units shall be computed and
interpreted as the total number of mobile home spaces available for rent plus
any other dwelling units served through the meter. A dwelling unit shall be
interpreted as a room or rooms or any other space or spaces in which cooking
facilities are provided.

§ 52.114 EXCESSIVE STRENGTH SURCHARGE.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges may reflect the costs of providing
services rendered to users, the town shall base its charges not only on the
volume, but also on the strength and character of the stronger-than-normal
domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose. The town
shall require the user to determine the strength and content of all sewage and
wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly, into the sanitary sewerage
system, in the manner and by that method as the town may deem practicable in
order to determine the proper charge. The user shall furnish a central sampling
point available to the town at all times.
   (B)   Normal domestic sewage and waste strength should not contain BOD in
excess of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid, S.S. in excess of 250 milligrams
per liter of fluid, NH3N in excess of 25 milligrams per liter of fluid, or
Phosphorus in excess of 8 milligrams per liter of fluid. The excessive strength
surcharge shall be made on the following basis:
      (1)   Rate of surcharge based upon BOD. There shall be an additional
charge of $0.38 per pound of BOD for BOD received in excess of 250 milligrams
per liter of fluid;
      (2)   Rate of surcharge based upon S.S. There shall be an additional
charge of $0.13 per pound of S.S. for S.S. received in excess of 250 milligrams
per liter of fluid;
      (3)   Rate of surcharge based upon NH3N. There shall be an additional
charge of $1.26 per pound of ammonia for NH3N received in excess of 25
milligrams per liter of fluid; and
      (4)   Rate of surcharge based upon Phosphorus. There shall be an

(Ord. 06-26, passed 1-22-2007)
§ 52.132 STORMWATER SYSTEM USER FEE STRUCTURE.
   For the purposes stated herein, there is hereby assessed a stormwater system
user fee to each stormwater user within the sewage works system service area of
the Town of Ellettsville, Monroe County, Indiana, in an amount as determined
below. For purposes of imposing the stormwater system user fee, all lots and
parcels within the sewage works system service area are classified as either:
residential, non-residential, or undeveloped.
   (A)   Residential properties.  Monthly fees for residential properties
located within the sewage works system service area are hereby established as
one ERU multiplied by the base rate.
   (B)   Non-residential properties.  Monthly fees for non-residential
properties located within the sewage works system service area are hereby
established as the number of ERU each contains multiplied by the base rate. The
number of ERU is determined by dividing the total amount of impervious area by
3,720 square feet, rounding the resulting calculated ERU to the next whole
number, with one being the lowest whole number for such purpose.
   (C)   Undeveloped properties.  No fees will be charged for undeveloped
properties.
(Ord. 06-26, passed 1-22-2007)
§ 52.133 FEE ESTABLISHMENT PROCEDURE.
   The stormwater system user fee shall be based on the relative contribution
of surface and stormwater runoff from a given parcel to the town's stormwater
system. This stormwater user fee rate is designed to recover and be able to pay
the cost of rendering stormwater service to the users of the stormwater system,
and shall be the basis for assessment of the town's stormwater system user fee.
This rate is established so as to maintain adequate fund reserves to provide
for reasonably expected variations in the cost of providing services, as well
as variation in the demand for services. This rate shall be evaluated annually
as to its sufficiency to satisfy the needs of the stormwater. The following
methods may be used to determine the non-residential factors:
   (A)   Computation of the parcel size or impervious area using on-site
measurements of the apparent outside boundaries of the parcel or impervious
area in or on such developed parcel, respectively, made by the town or on its
behalf;
   (B)   Computation of the parcel size or impervious area using the dimensions
of the parcel or impervious area in or on the parcels which are set forth and
contained in the records of the Office of the Monroe County Assessor;
   (C)   Estimation, calculation and computation of the parcel size or
impervious area using aerial photography or photogrammertry, or using the
information and data from on-site measurements of like or similar property or
features or as contained in the records of the town or county; or
   (D)   Computation of parcel size or impervious area using data provided by
the owner, tenant or developer. The authorized official may require additional
information as necessary to make the determination.

§ 53.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the Town of Ellettsville through the
regulation of non-storm water discharges to the storm drainage system to the
maximum extent practicable as required by federal and state law. This chapter
establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the
Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) in order to comply with
requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit. The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the MS4 by storm water
discharges by any user;
   (B)   To prohibit illicit connections and discharge to the town's separate
storm sewer system; and
   (C)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance
and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.
(Ord. 05-20, passed 10-24-2005)
§ 53.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPs).   Structural or nonstructural practices,
or a combination of practices, designed to act as effective, practicable means
of minimizing the impacts of development and human activities on water quality.
Traditional structural BMPs, including extended detention dry ponds, wet ponds,
infiltration trenches, and sand filtration systems, are now common elements of
most new development projects. Structural BMPs rely heavily on gravitational
settling and/or the infiltration trenches, and sand filtration systems, are now
common elements of most new development projects. Structural BMPs rely heavily
on gravitational settling and/or the infiltration of soluble nutrients through
a porous medium for pollutant removal. Nonstructural BMPs, which may be used
independently or in conjunction with structural BMPs, rely on a much wider
breadth of mechanisms to prevent or control non point source (NPS) pollution.
Nonstructural BMPs range from programs that increase public awareness to
prevent pollution, to the implementation of control-oriented techniques (such
as bio retention and storm water wetlands) that utilize vegetation to enhance
pollutant removal and restore the infiltrative capacity of the landscape.
   CLEAN WATER ACT (CWA). The federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C.
1251 et seq.), any subsequent amendments thereto; and all rules and regulations
promulgated pursuant to said Act.
   CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY. Activities subject to NPDES construction permits.
These include construction projects resulting in land disturbance of one acre
or more, as defined in the Indiana Annotated Code (IAC) by 327 IAC 15-5-1:12
(Rule 5). Such activities include but are not limited to clearing and grubbing,
grading, excavating, and demolition.
   FACILITY. Any FACILITY, including construction sites, required by the
Federal Clean Water Act to have a permit to discharge storm water associated
with industrial activity.
   HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. Any material, including any substance, waste, or
combination thereof, which because of its quantity, concentration, or physical,
chemical, or infectious characteristics may cause, or significantly contribute
to, a substantial present or potential hazard to human health, safety,
property, or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported,
disposed of, or otherwise managed.
   ILLICIT CONNECTIONS. An illicit connection is defined as either of the
following:
      (1)   Any drain or conveyance, whether on the surface or subsurface which
allows an illicit discharge to enter the storm drainage system including but
not limited to any conveyances which allow any non-storm water discharge
including sewage, process wastewater, and wash water to enter the storm
drainage system and any connections to the storm drainage system from indoor
drains and sinks, regardless of whether said drain or connection had been
previously allowed, permitted, or approved by the Town of Ellettsville's
Planning Department; or
      (2)   Any drain or conveyance connected from a commercial or industrial
land use to the storm drainage system which has not been documented in plans,
maps, or equivalent records and approved by the Town of Ellettsville's Planning
Department.
   ILLICIT DISCHARGE. Any direct or indirect non-storm water discharge to the
storm drainage system, except as exempted in §
53.07 of this chapter.
   INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY. Activities subject to NPDES industrial permits as
defined by 327 IAC 15-6-1:12 (Rule 6).
   MAXIMUM EXTENT PRACTICABLE (MEP). The statutory standard that establishes
the level of pollutant reductions that operators of regulated MS4s must
achieve. The CWA requires that NPDES permits for discharge from MS4s "shall
require controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent
practicable, including management practices, control techniques and system,
design and engineering methods." This standard applies to all MS4s regulated
under the Phase I and Phase II (Rule 13) storm water rules. Compliance with the
conditions of Rule 13 and the series of steps associated with implementation of
the required six minimum control measures will satisfy the MEP standard.
Compliance with the six minimum control measures requires the development and
implementation of BMPs. Implementation of the BMPs includes not only the
actions necessary to initiate and continue the use of specific control
measures, but also the enforcement actions, as applicable, to ensure that the
implementation of the control measures occurs.
   MUNICIPAL SEPARATE STORM SEWER SYSTEM (MS4).  A conveyance or system of
conveyances (including roads with drainage systems, municipal streets, catch
basins, curbs, gutters, ditches, man-made channels, or storm drains), which are
owned or operated by a state, town, county, tribe, district, association, or
other public body or a designated and approved management agency under § 208 of
the Clean Water Act that discharges into water of the United States (40 C.F.R.
122.26(b)(8)).
   NATIONAL POLLUTANT DISCHARGE ELIMINATION SYSTEM (NPDES) STORM WATER
DISCHARGE PERMIT. A permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management (IDEM) that authorizes the discharge of pollutants to waters of the
United States, whether the permit is applicable to an individual, a group, or a
general area-wide basis.
   NON-STORM WATER DISCHARGE. Any discharge to the storm drainage system that
is not composed entirely of storm water.
   NOTICE OF INTENT (NOI). A written notification indicating a person's
intention to comply with the terms of a specified general permit rule in lieu
of applying for an individual NPDES permit and includes information as required
under 327 IAC 15-3 and the applicable general permit rule.
   PERMIT HOLDER. Any person, partnership, corporation, or landowner who holds,
or has been issued an NPDES storm water discharge permit.
   PERSON. Any individual, association, organization, partnership, firm,
corporation or other entity recognized by law and acting as either the owner or
as the owner's agent.
   POLLUTANT. Anything which causes or contributes to pollution. Pollutants may
include, but are not limited to: paints, varnishes, and solvents; oil and other
automotive fluids, non-hazardous liquid, solid wastes, yard wastes, refuse,
rubbish, garbage, litter, or other discarded or abandoned objects, ordinances,
and accumulation, so that some may cause or contribute to pollution;

      (2)   To discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or
privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or
facilities in connection therewith, because of race, color, religion, sex,

status, or national origin, or an intention to make any such preference,
limitation, or discrimination;
      (4)   To represent to any person because of race, color, religion, sex,

      (5)   For profit, to induce or attempt to induce any person to sell or
rent any dwelling by representations regarding the entry or prospective entry
into the neighborhood of a person or persons of a particular race, color,
religion, sex, disability, familial status, or national origin; or
      (6)   (a)   To discriminate in the sale or rental, or to otherwise make

the person has been convicted under federal law or the law of any state of the
illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance.
   (C)   For the purpose of division (A)(6) of this section, the following
definition shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      DISCRIMINATION. Includes:
         (a)   A refusal to permit, at the expense of the person with a
disability, reasonable modifications of existing premises occupied or to be
occupied by that person if those modifications may be necessary to afford the
person full enjoyment of the premises, except that, in the case of a rental,
the landlord may, where it is reasonable to do so, condition permission for a
modification on the renter agreeing to restore the interior of the premises to
the condition that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear
excepted;
         (b)   A refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies,
practices, or services, when those accommodations may be necessary to afford
the person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling; or
         (c)   In connection with the design and construction of covered multi-
family dwellings for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, a failure to design
and construct those dwellings in such a manner that:
            1.   The dwellings have at least one building entrance on a
handicapped-accessible route, unless it is impractical to do so because of the
terrain or unusual characteristics of the site;
            2.   The public use and common use portions of the dwellings are
readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities;
            3.   All doors designed to allow passage into and within all

with disabilities in wheelchairs; and
            4.   All premises within the dwellings contain the following
features of adaptive design:
               a.   An accessible route into and through the dwelling;
               b.   Light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats, and other
environmental controls in accessible locations;

installation of grab bars; and
               d.   Usable kitchens and bathrooms so that an individual in a
wheelchair can maneuver about the space.
   (D)   Compliance with the appropriate requirements of the Americans With
Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. § 12101) and of the American National
Standard for buildings and facilities providing accessibility and usability for
people with physical disabilities (commonly cited as “ANSI A117.1”) suffices to
satisfy the requirements of division (C)(c)3.
   (E)   Nothing in divisions (A)(6) and (C) requires that a dwelling be made
available to an individual whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to
the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in
substantial physical damage to the property of others.

respondent by service of a notice on the person under division (H)(3) of this
section within ten days of the identification. If the person is not named in
the complaint, but is being joined as an additional or substitute respondent,
the notice will explain the basis for the Commission’s belief that the joined
person is properly joined as a respondent.
   (I)   Not later than ten days after the receipt of the notice and copy of
the complaint, a respondent may file an answer to the complaint. An answer must
be:
      (1)   In writing;
      (2)   Signed under oath; and
      (3)   In the form prescribed by the Commission.
   (J)   An answer may be reasonably and fairly amended at any time with the
consent of the Commission.
   (K)   An answer does not inhibit the investigation of a complaint.
   (L)   The Commission shall determine based on the facts whether reasonable
cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or
is about to occur. The Commission shall make this determination not later than
100 days after a complaint is filed unless:
      (1)   The Commission has approved a conciliation agreement relating to
the complaint; or
      (2)   It is impracticable to make the determination within that time
period, in which case the Commission shall notify the complainant and
respondent in writing of the reasons for the delay.
   (M)   If the Commission determines that no reasonable cause exists to
believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to
occur, the Commission shall promptly issue a short and plain statement of the
facts upon which the Commission has based the no reasonable cause
determination, dismiss the complaint, and notify the aggrieved person and the
respondent of the dismissal (including the written statement of the facts). The
fact of the dismissal, including the names of the parties, shall be public
information available on request.
   (N)   The Commission may not issue a finding of reasonable cause under this
chapter regarding an alleged discriminatory housing practice after the
beginning of the trial of a civil action commenced by the aggrieved party under
federal or state law seeking relief with respect to that discriminatory housing
practice.
   (O)   If the Commission determines that reasonable cause exists to believe
that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the
Commission shall immediately issue a finding of reasonable cause consisting of
a short and plain statement of the facts on which the Commission found
reasonable cause on behalf of the aggrieved person.
   (P)   Not later than 20 days after the Commission issues a finding of
reasonable cause, the Commission shall send a copy of the finding of reasonable
cause to each respondent and each aggrieved person with the following
information:
      (1)   A complainant, a respondent, or an aggrieved person on whose behalf
the complaint was filed may elect to have the claims asserted in a finding of
reasonable cause decided in a civil action;
      (2)   The election must be made not later than 20 days after the date of
receipt of the reasonable cause notice by the electing person; and
      (3)   The person making the election shall give notice to the Commission
and to all other complainants and respondents to whom the finding of reasonable
cause relates.
   (Q)   If a timely election is made under division (P)(1) above, the
Commission shall, not later than 30 days after the election is made, file and
maintain a civil action on behalf of the aggrieved person in a circuit or
superior court that is located in the county in which the alleged
discriminatory housing practice occurred. If a timely election is not made, the
Commission shall provide for a hearing on the finding of reasonable cause.

§ 90.31 TOWN COUNCIL AS HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION.
   (A)   To assist in the elimination of discrimination in the town, the Town
Council shall serve as the Human Rights Commission composed of five members.
   (B)   The members of the Commission shall serve without compensation, but
they may be reimbursed for all expenses necessarily incurred in the performance
of their duties in accordance with appropriations made by the Town Council.
   (C)   The expenses for carrying on the Commission’s activities shall be
budgeted for and paid out of the Town Council treasury and appropriated by the
Town Council for those purposes; however, the Commission shall also have the
authority to accept grants or other payments to help finance its activities.
The Commission may receive federal or state funds by work sharing or
cooperative agreements or grants with those funds deposited in designated non-
reverting funds.
   (D)   At its first meeting in January of each year, the Commission shall
select from its membership a chairperson and vice chairperson. These officers
elected at the January meeting shall assume their offices immediately.
   (E)   The Commission shall meet on the second Monday of each quarter (in
January, April, July, and October) prior to a regularly scheduled Town Council
meeting and shall hold special meetings as the chairperson deems necessary or
at the call of a majority of its members. Three members of the Commission shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. No official action shall
be taken by the Commission except by an affirmative vote of an absolute
majority of a quorum of members of the Commission; provided that a majority of
the entire Commission shall be required for a finding of a violation of this
chapter.
(1985 Code, § 900-10) (Ord. 95-7, passed 3-13-1995)
§ 90.32 COMMISSION POWERS AND DUTIES.
   The Commission shall have the following powers and duties:
   (A)   To establish and maintain in the town a permanent office to be
provided by the Town Council;
   (B)   To appoint staff as it may deem necessary and prescribe their duties;
   (C)   To adopt, promulgate, amend, and rescind rules and regulations,
procedural and substantive, as are consistent with the provisions of this
chapter or its intent and purpose as the Commission may deem necessary. These
rules and regulations shall be adopted, amended, or rescinded by the Commission
only after a public hearing thereon, notice of which shall be given by two
publications in the two newspapers of general circulation printed in the
county, these publications to be one week apart. The first publication is to be
not more than 30 days nor less than 15 days before the date of the hearings;
   (D)   (1)   To receive and investigate the merits, allegations, and factual
basis of complaints of discriminatory practices under this chapter, and to hold
hearings on the complaints. All investigations of complaints shall be
investigated by staff members or Commission members. The investigations shall
be impartial and shall be limited in each instance to the discriminatory
practices alleged in the complaint. At the end of each investigation, the
Commission or a staff member of the Commission will prepare a final
investigative report. The investigative report will contain:
         (a)   The names and dates of contacts with witnesses, except that the
report will not disclose the names of witnesses that request anonymity. The
Commission, however, may be required to disclose the names of those witnesses
in the course of an administrative hearing under this chapter or a civil action
under the Federal Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3601, et seq.) or the State
Fair Housing Act (I.C. 22-9.5-1-1, et seq.);
         (b)   A summary and the dates of correspondence and other contacts
with the aggrieved person and the respondent;
         (c)   A summary description of other records;
         (d)   A summary of witness statements; and
         (e)   Answers to interrogatories.
      (2)   A final investigative report may be amended at any time, if
additional evidence is discovered. Notwithstanding the prohibitions and
requirements with respect to disclosure of information contained in division
(J)(9) of this section, the Commission will make information derived from an
investigation, including the final report, available to the aggrieved person
and the respondent. Following the completion of investigation, the Commission
shall notify the aggrieved person and the respondent that the final
investigative report is complete and will be provided upon request.
   (E)   To initiate complaints, except that no member of the Commission who
initiates a complaint or is a respondent of a complaint may participate as a
member of the Commission in the hearing or disposition of the complaint;
   (F)   To prevent any person from discriminating or retaliating against any
other person because he or she filed a complaint with the Commission, has
testified in any hearing before the Commission, or has in any way assisted the
Commission in any matter under investigation;
   (G)   To seek prompt judicial action. If the Commission concludes at any
time following the filing of a complaint that prompt judicial action is
necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter, the Commission may file a
civil action for appropriate temporary or preliminary relief pending final
disposition of the complaint in a circuit or superior court that is located in
the county in which the alleged discriminatory housing practice has occurred.
      (1)   A temporary restraining order or other order granting preliminary
or temporary relief under this subsection is governed by the State Rules of
Trial Procedure.
      (2)   The filing of a civil action under this division does not affect
the initiation or continuation of administrative proceedings under this
chapter.
   (H)   To hold hearings, subpoena witnesses, administer oaths, take the
testimony of any such person under oath, and require the production for
examination of any books and papers relating to any matter under investigation
or in question before the Commission. All hearings shall be held within the
town at a location determined by the Commission. The Commission shall have the
authority to institute actions for appropriate legal or equitable relief in a
circuit or superior court to obtain enforcement of any Commission order or
subpoena. All subpoenas and orders emanating from the Commission shall be
served pursuant to the State Rules of Civil Procedure applicable to service in
civil actions;
   (I)   To appoint hearing officers, other than Commissioners, when an
appointment is deemed necessary by a majority of the Commission. The hearing
officers shall be members in good standing before the state bar and shall be
appointed by the chairperson of the Commission. A hearing officer appointed
under this division shall have the same powers and duties as a Commissioner
sitting as a hearing officer, except the power to issue subpoenas;
   (J)   To attempt reconciliation between the parties, including, but not
limited to, reconciliation through the process of mediation. The Commission
shall have the right to appoint a mediator who is qualified under the
Alternative Dispute Resolution Rules of the state to provide mediation services
to the complainant and the respondent. If the reconciliation efforts fail, the
Commission shall conduct hearings to find facts, reach conclusions, and issue
orders.
      (1)   During the period beginning with the filing of the complaint and
ending with the reasonable or no reasonable cause determination, the Commission
will, to the extent feasible, attempt to conciliate the complaint.
      (2)   In conciliating the complaint, the Commission will attempt to
achieve a just resolution of the complaint and to obtain assurances that the
respondent will satisfactorily remedy any violations of the rights of the
aggrieved person, and take action as will assure the elimination of
discriminatory housing practices, or the prevention of their occurrence in the
future.
      (3)   Generally, members of the Commission or the staff of the Commission
engaged in the investigation of a complaint will not participate or advise in
the conciliation of the same complaint or in any factually related complaint.
Where the rights of the aggrieved party and the respondent can be protected and
the prohibitions with respect to disclosure of information can be observed, the
investigator of the complaint may suspend fact-finding and engage in efforts to
resolve the complaint by conciliation.
      (4)   The terms of a settlement of a complaint will be reduced to a
written conciliation agreement. The conciliation agreement shall seek to
protect the interests of the aggrieved person, other persons similarly
situated, and the public interest. The types of relief that may be sought are:
         (a)   For the aggrieved person:
            1.   Monetary relief in the form of damages, including damages
caused by humiliation or embarrassment, and attorney’s fees;
            2.   Other equitable relief, including, but not limited to, access
to the dwelling at issue, or to a comparable dwelling, the provision of
services or facilities in connection with a dwelling, or other specific relief;
or
            3.   Injunctive relief appropriate to the elimination of
discriminatory housing practices affecting the aggrieved person or other
persons.
         (b)   The conciliation agreement may provide for binding arbitration
of the dispute arising from the complaint. Arbitration may award appropriate
relief as described in division (J)(4)(a). The aggrieved person and the
respondent may, in the conciliation agreement, limit the types of relief that
may be awarded under binding arbitration.
         (c)   For the public interest:
            1.   Elimination of discriminatory housing practices;
            2.   Prevention of future dis- criminatory housing practices;
            3.   Remedial affirmative activities to overcome discriminatory
housing practices;
            4.   Reporting requirements; or
            5.   Monitoring and enforcement activities.
      (5)   The agreement must be executed by the respondent and the
complainant. The agreement is subject to approval by the Commission. The
Commission will indicate approval by having a majority of the Commission sign
the agreement. The Commission will approve an agreement and, if the Commission
is the complainant, will execute the agreement, only if:
         (a)   The complainant and the respondent agree to the relief accorded
to the aggrieved person;
         (b)   The provisions of the agreement will adequately vindicate the
public interest; and
         (c)   If the Commission is the complainant, all aggrieved persons
named in the complaint are satisfied with the relief provided to protect their
interests.
      (6)   The Commission may issue a reasonable cause determination if the
aggrieved person and the respondent have executed a conciliation agreement that
has not been approved by the Commission.
      (7)   The Commission may terminate its efforts to conciliate the
complaint if: the respondent fails or refuses to confer with the Commission;
the aggrieved person or the respondent fails to make a good faith effort to
resolve any dispute; or the Commission finds, for any reason, that voluntary
agreement is not likely to result.
      (8)   Where the aggrieved person has commenced a civil action under
federal or state law seeking relief with respect to the alleged discriminatory
housing practice, and the trial in the action has commenced, the Commission
will terminate conciliation unless the court specifically requests assistance
from the Commission.
      (9)   Except as provided in divisions (J)(10) and (D) of this section,
nothing that is said or done in the course of conciliation may be made public
or used as evidence in a subsequent administrative hearing under this chapter
or in civil actions under the Federal Fair Housing Act or the State Fair
Housing Act without the written consent of the persons concerned.
      (10)   Conciliation agreements shall be made public unless the aggrieved
person and respondent request non-disclosure and the Commission determines that
disclosure is not required to further the purposes of this chapter.
Notwithstanding a determination that disclosure of a conciliation agreement is
not required, the Commission may publish tabulated descriptions of the results
of all conciliation efforts.
      (11)   The Commission may, from time to time, review compliance with the
terms of any conciliation agreement. Whenever the Commission has reasonable
cause to believe that a respondent has breached a conciliation agreement, the
Commission may file a civil action under division (H) of this section for the
enforcement of the terms of the conciliation agreement.
   (K)   To state findings of fact and conclusions of law after a hearing. If
the Commission determines, after a hearing, that the respondent has engaged in
a discriminatory practice in violation of this chapter, the Commission may
order the appropriate relief, including actual damages, reasonable attorney’s
fees, court costs, and other injunctive or equitable relief. To vindicate the
public interest, the Commission may assess a civil penalty against the
respondent in an amount that does not exceed the following:
      (1)   $1,500 if the respondent has not been adjudged by order of the
Commission or a court to have committed a prior discriminatory housing
practice;
      (2)   Except as provided by division (K)(1) above, $2,500 if the
respondent has been adjudged by order of the Commission or a court to have
committed one other discriminatory housing practice during the five-year period
ending on the date of the filing of the finding of reasonable cause; or
      (3)   Except as provided by division (K)(1) above, $2,500 if the
respondent has been adjudged by order of the Commission or a court to have
committed two or more discriminatory housing practices during the seven-year
period ending on the date of the filing of the finding of reasonable cause.
   (L)   If the acts constituting the discriminatory housing practice that is
the object of the finding of reasonable cause are committed by the same
individual who has been previously adjudged to have committed acts constituting
a discriminatory housing practice, the civil penalties in divisions (K)(2) and
(K)(3) above may be imposed without regard to the period of time within which
any other discriminatory housing practice occurred. The Commission may sue to
recover a civil penalty due under this section;
   (M)   If after the hearing the Commission shall find that the respondent has
not engaged in any practice in violation of this chapter, the Commission shall
state its findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall issue an order
dismissing the complaint;
   (N)   Judicial review of Commission orders shall be obtained in accordance
with the provisions of I.C. 4-21.5-5; and
   (O)   To prepare and submit to the Town Council once each year a detailed
report of the Commission’s activities, including the investigations,
reconciliations, and hearings it has conducted and their outcome.

§ 90.33 ENFORCEMENT BY PRIVATE PERSONS.
   (A)   An aggrieved person may file a civil action in the circuit or superior
court located in the county in which the alleged discriminatory practice
occurred, not later than one year after the occurrence of the termination of an
alleged discriminatory housing practice or the breach of a conciliation
agreement entered into under this chapter, whichever occurred last, to obtain
appropriate relief with respect to the discriminatory housing practice or
breach.
   (B)   The one-year period does not include any time during which an
administrative hearing under this chapter is pending with respect to a
complaint or finding of reasonable cause under this chapter based on the
discriminatory housing practice. This division does not apply to actions
arising from a breach of a conciliation agreement.
   (C)   An aggrieved person may file an action under this section whether or
not a complaint has been filed under this chapter and without regard to the
status of any complaint filed under this chapter.
   (D)   If the Commission has obtained a conciliation agreement with the
consent of an aggrieved person, the aggrieved person may not file an action
under this section with respect to the alleged discriminatory housing practice
that forms the basis for the complaint except to enforce the terms of the
agreement.
   (E)   An aggrieved person may not file an action under this section with
respect to an alleged discriminatory housing practice that forms the basis of a
finding of reasonable cause issued by the Commission if the Commission has
begun a hearing on the record under this chapter with respect to the finding of
reasonable cause.
   (F)   If the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred
or is about to occur in an action under this section, the court may award to
the prevailing party the following:
      (1)   Actual and punitive damages;
      (2)   Reasonable attorney’s fees;
      (3)   Court costs; and
      (4)   Subject to division (G) of this section, any permanent or temporary
injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, including an order
enjoining the defendant from engaging in the practice or ordering appropriate
affirmative action.
   (G)   Relief under this section does not affect the contract, a sale, an
encumbrance, or a lease that:
      (1)   Was consummated before the granting of the relief; and
      (2)   Involved a bona fide purchaser, an encumbrancer, or a tenant who
did not have actual notice of the filing of a complaint or a civil action under
this chapter.
   (H)   The Commission may intervene in an action under this section if the
Commission determines that the case is of general public importance. The
Commission may obtain the same relief available to the Commission under §
90.34 of this code.

Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 90.34 ENFORCEMENT BY COMMISSION.
   (A)   The Commission may file a civil action for appropriate relief if the
Commission has reasonable cause to believe that:
      (1)   A person is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the
full enjoyment of any right granted by this chapter; or
      (2)   A person has been denied any right granted by this chapter and that
denial raises an issue of general importance.
   (B)   An action under this section may be filed in a circuit or superior
court located in the county in which the alleged pattern, practice, or denial
has occurred. The court may do the following:
      (1)   Award preventive relief, including a permanent or temporary
injunction, restraining order, or other order against the person responsible
for the violation of this chapter, as necessary to assure the full enjoyment of
the rights granted by this chapter;

reasonable attorney’s fees, and other court costs; and

         (b)   $2,500 for a second or subsequent violation.
   (C)   A person may intervene in an action under this section if the person
is:

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 92.01 SNOW AND ICE ON SIDEWALKS; REMOVAL.
   (A)   The occupant of any premises, and the owner of any unoccupied
premises, are required to keep the sidewalks in front of or adjacent to such
premises cleared, to allow safe and reasonable travel on said sidewalk within
24 hours after snow or ice has ceased to fall or in any way accumulate so far
as is practicable and reasonable. The word OCCUPANT, as used in this section,
shall be deemed to mean the person occupying for business, residence or other
purposes the first floor of any building situated on the premises; and if the
first floor of any building is not occupied, then such premises shall be deemed
and held to be unoccupied and the owner or lessee of the entire premises shall
be required to keep the sidewalks in front of or adjacent to the premises
reasonably cleared from snow and ice.
   (B)   Upon the failure of any occupant, or the owner where there is no
occupant, of real estate to so remove the snow and ice within that time, The
Street Department of the town may remove or cause to be removed that snow and
ice.
   (C)   If the work of removal is done or caused to be done by the Street
Department, the cost and expense of the work shall be assessed against the
owner of real estate who fails and refuses to remove that snow and ice as
benefits that property.
   (D)   No person engaged in a commercial enterprise within the town shall
permit to be deposited in any street or thoroughfare, snow or other obstruction
from the sidewalks, parking lots or driveways of said commercial enterprise.
   (E)   Any person who shall violate this section commits a Class E ordinance
violation and in addition to the fine be assessed the cost of the removal of
such snow or other obstruction of natural origin from the street or
thoroughfare so obstructed. The owner may make payment within ten business days
of issuance of the notice in full satisfaction of the penalty. In the event
payment is not made within the time designated, court proceedings may be

§ 151.03 HISTORIC DISTRICTS, CONSERVATION DISTRICTS AND GUIDELINES.
   (A)   All recommendations for the establishment of a historic district shall
be in the form of a written report and must be based on the criteria outlined
in this section. A recommendation for establishing a historic district may be
initiated from either of the following two sources.
      (1)   Based on its survey, the Commission may draw and submit historic
district maps for Town Council approval.
      (2)   Owners of property in fee simple wishing to establish a historic
district which includes their property may petition the Commission to consider
drawing and submitting a map or maps of the property to the Town Council for
its approval. The Commission may establish in its rules criteria to be met
before it considers a petition.
   (B)   The Commission may recommend, and the City Council may provide that
the establishment of a historic district shall occur in two phases. During the
first phase, which continues for a period of three years from the date the
ordinance is adopted, a certificate of appropriateness is required for the
following activities: the demolition of any building; the moving of any
building; and any new construction of a principal building or accessory
building or structure subject to view from a public way.
      (1)   At the expiration of the initial three-year period, the first phase
of a conservation district continues and the second phase does not become
effective if a majority of the property owners in the district object to the
Commission, in writing, to the requirement that certificates of appropriateness
be issued for the following activities:
         (a)   A conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of historic
buildings by additions, construction, alteration, or maintenance involving
exterior color changes;
         (b)   A change in walls and fences or construction of walls and
fences, if along public ways; and/or
         (c)   A conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of non-historic
buildings subject to view from a public way by additions, reconstruction,
alteration, or maintenance involving exterior color change.
      (2)   The objections of a majority of the property owners must be
received by the Commission not earlier than 180 days or later than 60 days
before the third anniversary of the adoption of this chapter.
   (C)   Commission preparation of historic district maps: in order to
establish a historic district, the Commission shall first prepare a map
describing the district in accordance with the following.
      (1)   The map shall be based on a survey conducted by the Commission
which identifies historic buildings, structures, and sites located within the
town.
      (2)   A district may be limited to the boundaries of a property
containing a single building, structure, or site.
      (3)   The map may divide the district into primary and secondary areas as
follows:
         (a)   Primary area, the principal area of historic and architectural
significance.
         (b)   Secondary area, an area adjacent to a primary area which has a
visual relationship to the primary area and could affect the preservation of
the primary area. The purpose of designating a secondary area is to assure its
compatibility and harmony with an adjacent primary area.
   (D)   (1)   The Commission shall classify and designate on the map all
buildings, structures, and sites within each historic district described on the
map. Buildings, structures and sites shall be classified as historic or non-
historic. Historic buildings, structures, and sites must possess identified

Commission shall further classify and designate all buildings and structures
within a proposed historic district as follows:
         (a)   Outstanding;
         (b)   Notable; or
         (c)   Contributing.
      (2)   Non-historic buildings, structures, and sites are those not
classified on the map as historic. In lieu of other classifications, the
Commission may devise its own system of further classification of historic
buildings, structures, and sites.
   (E)   Town Council approval of maps of historic districts: before a historic
district is established and the building classifications take effect, the map
setting forth the districts boundaries and building classifications must be
submitted to, and approved in an ordinance by, the Town Council.
   (F)   Recording the fact of designation: the map establishing boundaries of
a historic district may be recorded in the office of the Monroe County
Recorder.

appropriateness for the demolition of a building, structure, or site, a
demolition permit may be issued by other agencies and a building, structure, or
site may be demolished, but only after the property owner has demonstrated to
the Commission that the historic building, structure, or site is incapable of
earning an economic return on its value, as appraised by a licensed real estate
appraiser.
   (C)   Notice of the proposed demotion must be given for a period fixed by
the Commission, based on the Commissions classification on the approved map,
but not less than 60 days nor more than one year. Notice must be posted on the
premises of the building or structure proposed for demolition in a location
clearly visible from the street. In addition, notice must be published in a

FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT
§ 152.100 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Statutory authorization.
      (1)   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 and I.C. 14-28-4 granted
the power to local government units to control land use within their
jurisdictions.
      (2)   Therefore, the Town Council does hereby adopt the following
floodplain management regulations.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of Ellettsville are subject to periodic
inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities,
and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this subchapter to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas, by provisions
designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers that are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development that may
increase erosion or flood damage;
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
      (6)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (D)   Objectives. The objectives of this subchapter are:
      (1)   To protect human life and health;
      (2)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges,
located in floodplains;
      (6)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood-
blight areas.

§ 152.101 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this subchapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage,
and to give this subchapter its most reasonable application.
   A ZONE. Portions of the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) in which the
principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In A Zones, flood waters may move slowly or rapidly, but
waves are usually not a significant threat to buildings. These areas are
labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone
A99 on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The definitions are presented below:
   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent-annual-chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
   ZONE AE AND ZONES A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent-
annual-chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations
are shown within these zones. (ZONE AE is on new and revised maps in place of
ZONES A1-A30.)
   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by one-percent-annual-chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by one-percent-annual-chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent-annual-chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE).  A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure, and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and shall be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (to an existing structure). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the ADDITION is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed ADDITION, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this subchapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
FIRM, with base flood depths from one to three feet, where a clearly defined
channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and
indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a one- percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the one-percent-annual-chance
flood.

ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the Regular
Program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, and installations that produce, use or store hazardous materials
or hazardous waste.
   D ZONE. Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding
is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is
not required by regulation in this zone.
   DEVELOPMENT.  
      (1)   Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction or placement of a building or any

of roads or similar projects;
         (d)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements and the like;
         (e)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavating or drilling
operations;
         (f)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;

      (2)   DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the maintenance of
existing buildings and facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing
roads; or gardening, plowing and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation or the construction of permanent
structures.

elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid-foundation perimeter
walls, filled stem-wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings or
columns (posts and piers).
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. A certified state-ment that verifies a structure's
elevation information. This certification must be signed and sealed by a land
surveyor, engineer, or architect authorized by law to certify elevation
information.
   EMERGENCY PROGRAM. The first phase under which a community participates in
the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). It is intended to provide a first
layer amount of insurance at subsidized rates on all insurable structures in
that community before the effective date of the initial FIRM.
   ENCROACHMENT. The advance or infringe-ment of uses, fill, excavation,
buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may
impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, and
the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA. See FREEBOARD.
   FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area acknow-ledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. See FLOOD.
   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake or
watercourse that have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory flood.
The FLOODPLAIN includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This subchapter and other zoning ordi-
nances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special
purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power that control
development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local
regulations, in any combination thereof, that provide standards for preventing
and reducing flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also
referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage
prevention ordinance, and floodplain management requirements.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation, with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural components of
these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces,
including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris-impact forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG, This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, that
is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP (as related to variances of this subchapter). The
EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP that would result from a failure to grant the requested
variance. The Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is
exceptional, unusual and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or
financial hardship alone is not EXCEPTIONAL. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of
one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP.
All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or to put the parcel to a different use than
originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE.  The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a
structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost, and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,1997,
will include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment to the currently
effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA
through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is only
issued by FEMA.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations and elevations.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision
by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement

the structure;
      (4)   The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or
pillars;
      (5)   The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement,
below an elevated structure, where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters, unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters,
by providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in
a minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed
area, each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and
         (c)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, trans-portable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation, when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a RECREATIONAL VEHICLE.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE. The building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a

replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or
adjusted assessed values.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of MITIGATION
is two-fold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD) OF 1929. As corrected in 1929, a
vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within
the floodplain.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for which the “start of construction”
commenced after the effective date of the community's first floodplain
ordinance.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   NON-BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of any river or stream other than
a boundary river.

any watercourse that may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-PERCENT-ANNUAL-CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a one-percent chance of
being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with
the letter A is subject to the one-percent-annual-chance flood. See REGULATORY
FLOOD.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community's FEMA
map to effect changes to base (one-percent-annual-chance) flood elevations,
floodplain boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric
features. These changes typically occur as a result of structural works or
improvements, annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or
correction to base flood elevations or SFHAs.
   PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE. Anything injurious to the safety or health of an
entire community, neighborhood or any considerable number of persons, or
unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any
navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal or basin.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle that is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less, when measured at the largest
horizontal projections;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light

   REGULAR PROGRAM. The phase of the community's participation in the NFIP
where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and
higher amounts of insurance are available, based upon risk zones and elevations
determined in a FIS.
   REGULATORY FLOOD. The flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is
acceptable to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and
the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any
location is as defined in §
152.102(B) of this subchapter. The REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the terms
“base flood, “one-percent-annual-chance flood”, and “100-year flood”.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SECTION 1316. That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended, that states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for
any property that the Administrator finds has been declared, by a duly
constituted state or local zoning authority, or other authorized public body,
to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations or ordinances that
intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood-prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA).  Those lands within the jurisdiction of
the town subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of
Ellettsville are generally identified as such on the Monroe County and
Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated December 17, 2010, as well as
any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM
as Zones A, AE, A1-A30, AH, AR, A99 or AO.)
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION,
repair, reconstruction or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
PERMANENT CONSTRUCTION does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A STRUCTURE that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured home or a prefabricated building. The term also includes
recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred “repetitive loss”
or “substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary or safety code requirements.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this subchapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this subchapter, where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this subchapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this subchapter is presumed to be in VIOLATION until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X Zones shown on recent FIRMs (B Zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X Zones (C Zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE.  A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or
type of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. See A ZONE.
   ZONES B, C AND X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities, but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(ZONE X is used on new and revised maps in place of ZONES B AND C.)

§ 152.102 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Lands to which this subchapter applies. This subchapter shall apply to
all SFHAs and known flood-prone areas within the jurisdiction of the Town of
Ellettsville.
   (B)   Basis for establishing regulatory flood data. This subchapter's
protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory
flood data is listed below.
      (1)   The regulatory flood elevation, flood-way and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the town shall be as delineated on the
one-percent annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Monroe
County and Incorporated Areas, and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map
dated December 17, 2010, as well as any future updates, amendments, or
revisions prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date.
      (2)   The regulatory flood elevation, flood-way and fringe limits for
each of the unstudied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the town delineated as
an A Zone on the Monroe County and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map
dated December 17, 2010, as well as any future updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area
from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace existing
data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and subsequently approved.
      (3)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community's known flood-prone areas
shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile.
      (4)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.
   (C)   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain
development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
subchapter prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of
special flood hazard.
   (D)   Compliance.
      (1)   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or
structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of
this subchapter and other applicable regulations.
      (2)   No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered
without full compliance with the terms of this subchapter and other applicable
regulations.
   (E)   Abrogation and greater restrictions.
      (1)   This subchapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions.
      (2)   However, where this subchapter and another ordinance conflict or
overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (F)   Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground elevations.
      (1)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles shall govern.
      (2)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
      (3)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above
the base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site shall
be considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be
applied. The property owner should be advised to apply for a LOMA.
   (G)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this
subchapter, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (H)   Warning and disclaimer of liability.
      (1)   The degree of flood protection required by this subchapter is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available
information derived from engineering and scientific methods of study.
      (2)   Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
      (3)   Therefore, this subchapter does not create any liability on the
part of the Town of Ellettsville, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
this subchapter or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
   (I)   Penalties for violation. Failure to obtain a floodplain development
permit in the SFHA, or failure to comply with the requirements of a floodplain
development permit or conditions of a variance, shall be deemed to be a
violation of this subchapter. All violations shall be considered a Class C
infraction and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of the
zoning code.
      (1)   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the
violation continues to exist.
      (2)   The Floodplain Administrator shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and, therefore,
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      (3)   Nothing herein shall prevent the town from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

all proposed buildings. Elevation should be in NAVD 88 or NGVD;
         (f)   Elevation (in NAVD 88 or NGVD) to which any non-residential
structure will be floodproofed;
         (g)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. A hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering study is required and any watercourse changes submitted
to DNR for approval and then to FEMA as a Letter of Map Revision. (See §
152.103(C)(6) for additional information.)
      (2)   Construction stage.
         (a)   Upon establishment of the lowest floor of an elevated structure
or structure constructed on fill, it shall be the duty of the applicant to
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the NAVD 88 or NGVD
elevation of the lowest floor, as built. Said certification shall be prepared
by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor, professional
engineer or architect and certified by the same. The Floodplain Administrator
shall review the lowest floor elevation survey data submitted. The applicant
shall correct deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is
allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said
corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the
project. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the elevation certification
shall be at the applicant’s risk.
         (b)   Upon establishment of the floodproofed elevation of a
floodproofed structure, it shall be the duty of the applicant to submit to the
Floodplain Administrator a floodproofing certificate. Certification shall be
prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered professional
engineer or architect and certified by same. (The Floodplain Administrator
shall review the floodproofing certification submitted.) The applicant shall
correct any deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is
allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the floodproofing certification or
failure to make correction required shall be cause to issue a stop- work order
for the project.
      (3)   Finished construction. Upon completion of construction, an
elevation certification (FEMA Elevation Certificate Form 81-31 or any future
updates) which depicts the “as-built” lowest floor elevation is required to be
submitted to the Floodplain Administrator. If the project includes a
floodproofing measure, floodproofing certification (FEMA Floodproofing
Certificate Form 81-65 or any future updates) is required to be submitted by
the applicant to the Floodplain Administrator.

structure that is in compliance with the provisions of this subchapter shall
meet the requirements of “new construction” as contained in this subchapter;
      (10)   Parking lots, driveways, and sidewalks within the SFHA shall be
constructed with permeable materials; and
      (11)   Whenever any portion of the SFHA is authorized for use, the volume
of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the
BFE shall be compensated for and balanced by an equivalent volume of excavation
taken below the BFE. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to the
volume of storage lost (replacement ratio of 1 to 1) due to the fill or
structure:
         (a)   The excavation shall take place in the floodplain and in the
same property in which the authorized fill or structure is located;
         (b)   Under certain circumstances, the excavation may be allowed to
take place outside of but adjacent to the floodplain provided that the
excavated volume will be below the regulatory flood elevation, will be in the
same property in which the authorized fill or structure is located, will be
accessible to the regulatory flood water, will not be subject to ponding when
not inundated by flood water, and that it shall not be refilled;
         (c)   The excavation shall provide for true storage or floodwater but
shall not be subject to ponding when not inundated by flood water;
         (d)   The fill or structure shall not obstruct a drainage way leading
to the floodplain;
         (e)   The grading around the excavation shall be such that the
excavated area is accessible to the regulatory flood water;
         (f)   The fill or structure shall be of a material deemed stable
enough to remain firm and in place during periods of flooding and shall include
provisions to protect adjacent property owners against any increased runoff or
drainage resulting from its placement; and
         (g)   Plans depicting the areas to be excavated and filled shall be
submitted prior to the actual start of construction or any site work; once site
work is complete, but before the actual start of construction, the applicant
shall provide to the Floodplain Administrator a certified survey of the
excavation and fill sites demonstrating the fill and excavation comply with
this subchapter.
   (B)   Specific standards. In all SFHAs, the following provisions are
required:
      (1)   In addition to the requirements of §
152.104(A), all structures to be located in the SFHA shall be protected from
flood damage below the FPG. This building protection requirement applies to the
following situations:
         (a)   Construction or placement of any new structure having a floor
area greater than 400 square feet;
         (b)   Addition or improvement made to any existing structure where the
cost of the addition or improvement equals or exceeds 50% of the value of the
existing structure (excluding the value of the land);
         (c)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged structure, where the
costs of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure (excluding the value of the
land) before damage occurred;
         (d)   Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site
for more than 180 days;
         (e)   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new
manufactured home on an existing site. This subchapter does not apply to
returning the existing manufactured home to the same site it lawfully occupied
before it was removed to avoid flood damage;
         (f)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a repetitive loss structure;
and
         (g)   Addition or improvement made to any existing structure with a
previous addition constructed since the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
      (2)   Residential structures.
         (a)   New construction or substantial improvement of any residential
structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) at or above the FPG (two feet above the base flood elevation).
         (b)   Should solid-foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood
waters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of §
152.104(B)(4).
      (3)   Non-residential structures. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or non-residential structure (or
manufactured home) shall either have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above the FPG (two feet above the base flood elevation) or be
floodproofed to or above the FPG. Should solid-foundation perimeter walls be
used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movement of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of
§
152.104(B)(4). Structures located in all A Zones may be floodproofed in lieu of
being elevated, if done in accordance with the following:
         (a)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the structure has been designed so that, below the FPG, the structure and
attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the
effects of the regulatory flood. The structure design shall take into account
flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic pressures, and impacts
from debris or ice. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set
forth in §
152.103(C)(12).
         (b)   Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human
intervention and without an outside source of electricity.
      (4)   Elevated structures.  New construction or substantial improvements
of elevated structures shall have the lowest floor at or above the FPG.
Elevated structures with fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other
exterior walls below the flood protection grade shall be designed to preclude
finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of flood
waters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
Designs must meet the following minimum criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two open-ings located in a minimum of two
exterior walls (having a total net area of not less than one square inch for
every one square foot of enclosed area);
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above the exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath each
opening, whichever is higher;
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of flood waters
in both directions;
         (d)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to
allow for parking for vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator);
         (e)   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms;
         (f)   The interior grade of such enclosed area shall be at an
elevation at or higher than the exterior grade;
         (g)   Openings are to be not less than three inches in any direction
in the plane of the wall. This requirement applies to the hole in the wall,
excluding any device that may be inserted such as typical foundation air vent
device; and
         (h)   Property owners shall be required to execute and record with the
structure’s deed a non-conversion agreement declaring that the area below the
lowest flood (where the interior height of the enclosure exceeds six feet)
shall not be improved, finished or otherwise converted; the community will have
the right to inspect the enclosed area. The non- conversion agreement shall be
recorded in the office of the Monroe County Recorder.
      (5)   Structures constructed on fill. A residential or non-residential
structure may be constructed on a permanent land fill in accordance with the
following:
         (a)   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one-foot deep
before compacting to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with either the
Standard or Modified Proctor Test method. The results of the test showing
compliance shall be retained in the permit file.
         (b)   The fill shall extend ten feet beyond the foundation of the
structure before sloping below the BFE.
         (c)   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during
flooding by vegetative cover, riprap or bulkheading. If vegetative cover is
used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
         (d)   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties.
         (e)   The top of the lowest floor, including basements, shall be at or
above the FPG.
         (f)   Fill shall be composed of clean granular or earthen material.
      (6)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially
improved on a site for more than 180 days must meet one of the following
requirements:
         (a)   These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed
on a site outside a manufactured home park or subdivision; in a new
manufactured home park or subdivision; in an expansion to an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage”
as a result of a flood:
            1.   The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent
foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse and lateral movement.
            2.   Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior
walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated
structures in §
152.104(B)(4).
            3.   Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the frame
or foundation of a manufactured home and are not required to have openings.
         (b)   These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed
on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that has not
been substantially damaged by a flood:
            1.   The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the lowest
floor of the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or
other foundation elevations that are no less than 36 inches in height above
grade, and shall be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
            2.   Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior
walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished living space, and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of flood waters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated
structures in §
152.104(B)(4).
            3.   Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the frame
or foundation of a manufactured home are not required to have openings.
         (c)   Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either:
            1.   Be on site for less than 180 days; and
            2.   Be fully licensed and READY FOR HIGHWAY USE (defined as being
on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick,
disconnect-type utilities and security devices, and having no permanently
attached additions); or
            3.   Meet the requirements for “manufactured homes” as stated
earlier in this section.
      (7)   Accessory structures. Relief to the elevation or dry floodproofing
standards may be granted for accessory structures. Such structures must meet
the following standards:
         (a)   Shall not be used for human habitation;
         (b)   Shall be constructed of flood resistant materials;
         (c)   Shall be constructed and placed on the lot to offer the minimum
resistance to the flow of floodwaters;
         (d)   Shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation;
         (e)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment
shall be elevated or floodproofed to or above the FPG; and
         (f)   Shall be designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as
required for elevated structures in §
152.104(B)(4).
      (8)   Above ground gas or liquid storage tanks. All above ground gas or
liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral
movement.
   (C)   Standards for subdivision proposals.
      (1)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
      (2)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, located and
constructed to minimize flood damage.
      (3)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
      (4)   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions) that is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres.
      (5)   All subdivision proposals shall minimize development in the SFHA
and/or limit density of development permitted in the SFHA.
      (6)   All subdivision proposals shall ensure safe access into and out of
SFHA for pedestrians and vehicles (especially emergency responders).
   (D)   Critical facilities.
      (1)   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent
possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA.
      (2)   Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within
the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available.
      (3)   Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site.
      (4)   Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that
toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into flood waters.
      (5)   Access routes elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all
critical facilities to the extent possible.
   (E)   Standards for identified floodways.
      (1)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
152.102(B), are areas designated as floodways.
         (a)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of flood waters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion
potential.
         (b)   If the site is in an identified floodway, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway.
         (c)   Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1, a permit for construction
in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required
prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit,
construction or obstruction activity located in the floodway.
            1.   This includes land preparation activities, such as filling,
grading, clearing, paving and the like, undertaken before the actual start of
construction of the structure.
            2.   However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/
improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway.
               a.   I.C. 14-28-1-26 allows construction of non-substantial
additions/ improvements to residences in a non-boundary river floodway without
obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the Indiana Department
of Natural Resources.
               b.    Please note that if fill is needed to elevate an addition
above the existing grade, prior approval (construction in a floodway permit)
for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, granting approval for construction in
the floodway.
         (a)   Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in §
152.104 of this subchapter have been met.
         (b)   The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive
than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department
of Natural Resources.
         (c)   However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any)
shall take precedence.
      (3)   No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in
combination with existing or future development, will adversely affect the
efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse
effect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at
least fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by comparing the
regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that under the
natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
      (4)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees), the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
   (F)   Standards for identified fringe. If the site is located in an
identified fringe, then the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
Floodplain Development Permit provided the provisions contained in §
152.104 of this subchapter have been met. The key provision is that the top of
the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or
above the FPG.
   (G)   Standards for SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or
floodways/fringes.
      (1)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile.
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the one-
percent annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection
grade, has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit

STORMWATER RUNOFF
§ 152.170 INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion
by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water
quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other
species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches and the
dredging of lakes. In addition, clearing and grading during construction cause
the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat.
Following the completion of construction activities, dust, dirt, and erosion
will continue to affect the storm water facilities and receiving streams unless
post-construction practices are put in place during the construction and
maintained in perpetuity.
   (B)   As a result, the purpose of this subchapter is to safeguard persons,
protect property, and prevent damage to the environment in the Town of
Ellettsville. This subchapter will also promote the public welfare by guiding,
regulating, and controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of
any development or other activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or
results in the movement of earth in the Town of Ellettsville.
   (C)   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish minimum storm water
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general
health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this
jurisdiction. This subchapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following
objectives:
      (1)   Minimize increases in storm water runoff from any development in
order to reduce flooding, siltation and stream bank erosion and maintain the
integrity of stream channels;
      (2)   Minimize increases in non point source pollution caused by storm
water runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water
quality.
      (3)    Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which
flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the
pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable.
      (4)   Reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and non
point source pollution, wherever possible, through storm water management
controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained
and pose no threat to public safety.
(Ord. 05-21, passed 10-24-2005)
§ 152.171 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
   AGRICULTURAL LAND DISTURBING ACTIVITY. Tillage, planting, cultivation, or
harvesting operations for the production of agricultural or nursery vegetative
crops. The term also includes pasture renovation and establishment, the
construction of agricultural conservation practices, and the installation and
maintenance of agricultural drainage tiles. For the purposes of this
subchapter, the term does not include land disturbing activities for the
construction of agricultural-related facilities such as barns, buildings to
house livestock, roads associated with infrastructure, other infrastructure,
agricultural waste lagoons and facilities that process residential, workshop,

most new development projects. Structural BMPs rely heavily on gravitational
settling and/or the infiltration of soluble nutrients through a porous medium
for pollutant removal. Nonstructural BMPs, which may be used independently or
in conjunction with structural BMPs, rely on a much wider breadth of mechanisms
to prevent or control NPS pollution. Nonstructural BMPs range from programs
that increase public awareness to prevent pollution, to the implementation of
control-oriented techniques (such as bioretention and storm water wetlands)
that utilize vegetation to enhance pollutant removal and restore the
infiltrative capacity of the landscape.

elevation.
   LAND DISTURBANCE OR LAND DISTURBING ACTIVITY. Any man-made change of the
land surface, including removing vegetative cover that exposes the underlying
soil, excavating, filling, transporting, and grading.
   MAXIMUM EXTENT PRACTICABLE. The use of a practice or procedure that attains
the highest result that is economically and technically reasonable under the
circumstances.
   MEASURABLE STORM EVENT. A precipitation event that results in a total
measured precipitation accumulation equal to, or greater than, one-half inch of
rainfall.
   PROJECT SITE. The entire area on which construction activity is to be
performed.

established under I.C. 14-32.
   STORM WATER. Water resulting from rain, melting or melted snow, hail, or
sleet.
   STORM WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN (SWPPP). A plan developed to minimize
the impact of storm water pollution resulting from construction and post-
construction activities. The plan indicates the specific measures and
sequencing to be used to control sediment, soil erosion and other construction
site wastes during and after construction.
   STORM WATER QUALITY MEASURE. A practice or a combination of practices, to
control or minimize pollutants associated with storm water run-off.

§ 152.174 STORM WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN.
   The storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) including erosion and
sediment control measures shall meet the requirements contained in Rule 5, the
Monroe County Drainage Ordinance, and the Indiana Storm Water Quality Manual.
(Ord. 05-21, passed 10-24-2005)
§ 152.175 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   Erosion and sediment control measures shall be designed and installed in
accordance with Rule 5, the Monroe County Drainage Ordinance, and the Indiana
Storm Water Quality Manual. Unless judged by the Town of Ellettsville Planning
Director to be exempt or granted a waiver, the following performance criteria
shall be addressed for storm water management at all sites:
   (A)   All site designs shall establish storm water management practices to
control the peak flow rates of storm water discharge associated with specified
design storms and reduce the generation of storm water. These practices should
seek to utilize pervious areas of storm water treatment and to infiltrate storm
water runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped
areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water
quality and quantity.
   (B)   All storm water runoff generated from new development shall not
discharge directly into a jurisdictional wetland or Waters of the United States
without adequate treatment. Where such discharges are proposed, the impact of
the proposal on wetland functional values shall be assessed using a method
acceptable to the jurisdictional storm water authority. In no case shall the
impact on functional values be any less than allowed by the Army Corp of
Engineers (ACE) or the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
   (C)   Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be maintained by promoting
infiltration through the use of structural and non-structural methods.
   (D)   (1)   For new development, structural Best Management Practices (BMPs)
shall be designed to remove to the maximum extent practicable of the average
annual post development total suspended solids load (TSS). It is presumed that
a BMP complies with this performance standard if it is:
         (a)   Sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume (WQV);
         (b)   Designed according to the specific performance criteria outlined
in the local storm water design manual;
         (c)   Constructed properly; and
         (d)   Maintained regularly.
      (2)   A list of pre-approved post-construction BMPs along with procedures
to be followed for approval of innovative BMPs or BMPs not in the pre-approved
list are provided in the Monroe County standards and specifications.
(Ord. 05-21, passed 10-24-2005)
§ 152.176 INSPECTION.
   (A)   A self-monitoring program by the project site owner is required during
construction of any project described in §
152.172. A trained individual employed or retained by the project site owner
shall prepare and maintain a written evaluation of the project site by the end
of the next business day following each measurable storm event and at a
minimum, one time per week.
   (B)   The evaluation must address the maintenance of existing storm water
quality measures to ensure they are functioning properly; and identify
additional measures necessary to remain in compliance with all applicable
statutes and rules.
   (C)   Written evaluation reports must include the following:
      (1)   The name of the individual performing the evaluation;
      (2)   The date of the evaluation;
      (3)   Problems identified at the project site; and
      (4)   Details of corrective actions recommended and completed.
   (D)   All evaluation reports for the project site must be made available to
the inspecting authority within one business day of a request.
   (E)   All persons engaging in construction activities on a project site must
comply with the storm water pollution prevention plan, this subchapter, Rule 5
and the Town of Ellettsville and Monroe County Drainage standards and
specifications.
   (F)   The Town of Ellettsville Planning Department will perform inspections
and provide recommendations to evaluate the installation, implementation and
maintenance of control measures and management practices at any project site
involved in construction activities. Construction project sites will be
prioritized based on the nature and extent of the construction activity,
topography and the characteristics of soils and receiving water quality. If
after a recommendation is provided to the project site owner, corrective action
is not taken, the Town of Ellettsville Planning Department will pursue
enforcement according to §
152.177 of this subchapter.
(Ord. 05-21, passed 10-24-2005)
§ 152.177 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Written Notification. In the event the Town of Ellettsville Planning
Department, the designated entity's representative, or other regulatory agency
determines the project is not in compliance with this subchapter, Rule 5 or the
Monroe County Drainage Ordinance standards and specifications, the project site
owner will be issued a written notification form. The written notification by
certified mail or in person may be in the form of a warning letter of
noncompliance or violation notice.
   (B)   Penalty. Any site owner who has not corrected a deficiency within five
days after written notification shall be guilty of a Class B infraction and may
be fined not more than $1,000 for each violation. For purposes of this
subchapter each day shall be deemed a separate violation and subject to above
penalty.
   (C)   Stop-Work Order (Revocation of Permit). In the event that any person
holding a site development permit pursuant to this subchapter violates the
terms of the permit or implements site development in such a manner as to
directly or indirectly adversely affect the water quality of the watershed, the
Town of Ellettsville Planning Department may suspend or revoke the site
development permit. In such case the Town of Ellettsville Planning Department
may issue a Stop-Work Order.
   (D)   Restitution. Any agency charged with enforcement of this subchapter,
under division (A) above, may, after a five day notice, enter a construction
site in order to construct, repair or replace any erosion control device to
reduce or remediate storm water runoff from the site. The enforcement agency
may recover the direct cost of such remediation activities, in addition to the
penalties assessed in this section.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
§ 152.275 REQUIREMENTS.
   Land within the town’s jurisdictional area may not be developed as a Planned
Unit Development (PUD), except as authorized and approved under this
subchapter.
(Ord. 03-05, § 860-05, passed 5-27-2003; Am. Ord. 2012-09, passed 5-29-2012)
§ 152.276 DISTRICT INTENT.
   (A)   The purpose of these regulations is to provide greater design
flexibility in the development of land when consistent with the Comprehensive
Plan and intent of the Zoning and Subdivision Control Ordinances. A Planned
Unit Development (PUD) should not be used if the proposed development can be
created using established zoning districts and development standards. The
intent of a PUD is to promote the lands most appropriate use; to encourage a
harmonious and appropriate mixture of uses; to facilitate the adequate and
economic provision of streets, utilities, and town services; to preserve the
natural, environmental and scenic features of the site; to encourage and
provide a mechanism for arranging improvements on sites so as to preserve
desirable features; and to mitigate the problems which may be presented by
specific site conditions.
   (B)   It is anticipated that planned unit developments will offer one or
more of the following advantages:
      (1)   Implement the guiding principles and land use policies of the
Comprehensive Plan; specifically reflect the policies specific to the
neighborhood or zoning ordinances in which the planned unit development is to
be located;
      (2)   Buffer land uses proposed for the planned unit development so as to
minimize any adverse impact which new development may have on surrounding
properties;
      (3)   Enhance the appearance of neighborhoods by conserving areas of
natural beauty, and natural green spaces;
      (4)   Counteract urban monotony and congestion on streets;
      (5)   Promote architecture that is compatible with the surroundings;
      (6)   Promote and protect the environmental integrity of the site and its
surroundings and provide suitable design responses to the specific
environmental constraints of the site and surrounding area; and
      (7)   Provide a public benefit without deviation from the standards of
the established zoning ordinances;
      (8)   Specify uses or a range of uses permitted in the planned unit
development zoning districts;
      (9)   Specify any limitation applicable to the planned unit development
zoning district; and
      (10)   Meet the requirements of I.C. 36-7-4-1500 et seq.

   (A)   Permitted uses.
      (1)   The permitted uses in a planned unit development district ordinance
are subject to the discretion and approval of the Plan Commission and Town
Council.
      (2)   The permitted uses shall be determined in consideration of the
Comprehensive Plan and the existing zoning district designation of the area
being rezoned to a planned unit development, the land use contiguous to the
area being rezoned to a planned unit development and the development standards
and design standards of the Ellettsville Municipal Code.
   (B)   Development standards.
      (1)   The development standards in a planned unit development district
ordinance are subject to the discretion and approval of the Plan Commission and
Town Council.

being rezoned to a planned unit development, and the development and design
standards of the Ellettsville Municipal Code.
(Ord. 2012-09, passed 5-29-2012)
§ 152.278 QUALIFYING STANDARDS.
   (A)   The area designated in the planned unit development map must be a
tract of land under single ownership or control. Single control of property
under multiple ownership may be accomplished through the use of enforceable
covenants or commitment that run to the benefit of the zoning jurisdiction.
   (B)   The minimum gross area required for a planned unit development is five
acres. The minimum gross area may be waived by the Plan Commission if it is
demonstrated that granting such waiver is consistent with the district intent
as specified in §
152.276, District Intent.
   (C)   A planned unit development may be established in any district except
for the downtown area as defined by Matthews Drive to Park Street and
Association to Main Street.

property and is not shared by neighboring properties in the same zone;
      (2)   Strict compliance with the standard would unreasonably prevent the
landowner from using
the property for a permitted use, or would render conformity necessarily
burdensome;
      (3)   The particular request, or a lesser relaxation of ordinance
standard, would provide substantial justice to the landowner and neighbors;
      (4)   The need for a variance is not the result of a self-created action
by the current or any former property owner.
   (E)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have made the following additional
findings:
      (1)   The approval complies substantially with the comprehensive plan;
      (2)   The approval is not based solely upon financial hardship or mere

BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS
§ 152.330 ESTABLISHMENT AND MEMBERSHIP.
   The Town Council of Ellettsville hereby establishes a Board of Zoning
Appeals to consist of five members with three appointed by the President of the
Town Council, one appointed by the Town Council who is not on the Plan
Commission and one selected from the membership of the Plan Commission
appointed by the Plan Commission.
(Ord. 03-05, § 806-05, passed 5-27-2003)
§ 152.331 OFFICERS, MEETINGS, AND PROCEDURES.
   (A)   During the first meeting of the year an election of President, Vice
President, and Secretary will be held. Public Meetings will be held at a
regular agreed upon day and time each month depending on new zoning petitions
being filed. Since meetings are formal and quasi-judicial no member may be
lobbied by the petitioner or other members of the public prior to a case being
heard.
   (B)   A quorum consists of a majority of the board, but no action can be
taken unless the action has three official votes. The Board is charged with
hearing all variances and special exceptions, which “run with the property”.
The Board may ask that a deed be changed to reflect a variance or special
exception approval. The Board is also empowered to hear appeals related to
administrative interpretation of the zoning code.
(Ord. 03-05, § 806-10, passed 5-27-2003)
§ 152.332 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   Members of the Board represent the citizens of Ellettsville and the broader
interest of the community. Where in the case of a special exception an uncommon
use can be approved with conditions the use may become a legal approved use for
the specific site and advance the community’s enterprise. Where in the case of
a variance the property owner requests relief from the strict code due to an
uncommon condition, which was not caused by the property owner, or if variance
from the code was minimal and of no impact to the neighboring properties,
written findings of fact and reasons for decisions should be filled out at each
meeting on a form prepared by the town’s zoning officer or administrative staff
complying precisely with the state rules for Board of Zoning Appeals decisions.
Granting of a variance or special exception runs with the property and change
of ownership does not effect the continuing of the variance or special
exception or commitments to specified conditions.
(Ord. 03-05, § 806-15, passed 5-27-2003)
§ 152.333 CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
   (A)   Members must stand down and can not participate in any hearing where
they have a direct or indirect financial interest.
   (B)   Also members may not represent other petitioners before the Board.
(Ord. 03-05, § 806-20, passed 5-27-2003)
§ 152.334 CONDUCT OF HEARINGS.

presents first followed by the opponents.
      (2)   The Board members then bring the case back for discussion before
voting.
      (3)   The President of the Board may set reasonable time limits for each
speaker to address the Board.
   (B)   Written information must be submitted to Town Hall at least 24 hours
prior to the hearing.
