   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the town, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered, and consolidated into component codes,
titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the
“Millersburg Town Code”, for which designation “code of ordinances”, “codified

headings do not constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.

same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.

   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless

resolve a conflict between two or more sections.

reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or subsection.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters, or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)

feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,

nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is severable.
If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect the remainder of the section unless:

authority, or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; on the effective date of that ordinance or following the
effective date, the rights, powers, duties, or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,

liabilities, powers, and rights were transferred.

   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture, or
liability.

§ 31.40 EMPLOYEE REHABILITATION.

to overcome drug and alcohol related problems.

encouraged to volunteer to participate in a approved rehabilitation program
upon referral from the Employee and Family Assistance Program before work

program for a reasonable period of time as determined by the town; and
      (3)   When required by law.

job performance reasonably indicative of substance abuse, the supervisor (with

employee have a fitness for duty examination by a physician designated by the
town. The physician will determine whether a fitness for duty examination is
necessary and whether alcohol or drug tests will be required.

§ 50.01 TOWN STANDARDS.
   (A)   The Town Standard Specification and Development Guide is hereby
incorporated by reference and adopted and established for the town.
   (B)   The Town Standard Specification and Development Guide shall govern all
public work and utility projects of the town, as well as all private projects
to be dedicated to the town and those connecting with or affecting water
utility facilities, sewer utility facilities, park facilities, roads and
streets, buildings and other facilities of the town.
   (C)   For purposes of this chapter, the Town Standard Specification and
Development Guide shall be hereinafter referred to as the “Guide”. The Town
Council may revise the provisions contained in the Guide at any time upon the
adoption of a duly enacted ordinance at a public meeting.
§ 50.02 ACCEPTANCE OF DEDICATED PROJECTS AND CONSTRUCTED STREETS.
   (A)   No dedicated water or wastewater project shall be accepted by the town
until the developer/ builder thereof has complied with the terms and conditions
of the Guide and any and all other legal standards arising from the county’s
Zoning Ordinance, the county’s Subdivision Ordinance or other applicable law.
   (B)   At a minimum, to secure acceptance by the town, the developer/builder

      (1)   If a subdivision is involved, the developer/builder must have
secured both primary and secondary approval of the plat for the subdivision.
      (2)   The final plat, as approved by the Plan Commission, must be

      (3)   All inspections contemplated by the Guide must have been undertaken
and completed, and final approval by the town’s Superintendent of Public Works
must be at hand.
      (4)   All drainage arrangements or systems contemplated by the Guide, the
county’s street standards, the plat of the subdivision and applicable state law
shall be completed by the developer/ builder.
      (5)   The maintenance bond contemplated by the Guide must be in
appropriate form and on file with the Town Council. The amount of the
maintenance bond shall be equal to 10% of the contract price for the items to
be dedicated to the town and shall be effective for a period of three years
from the date of acceptance.
      (6)   A written request for the acceptance must be filed with the Town
Council; as part of such written request, the builder/developer must certify,
under oath, that each of the requirements herein stated have been completed.
      (7)   A written certification executed by a professional engineer
licensed pursuant to I.C. 25-31 et seq. must be filed with the Town Council
certifying that construction review and inspection services have been performed
and that the project in question, including any utilities, have been designed,
constructed and tested in accordance with the requirements of the Guide.
§ 50.03 CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL AND BACKFLOW PREVENTION.
   (A)   The regulations located at 327 I.A.C. 8-10 et seq. entitled “Cross-
Connections; Control; Operation”, as amended or replaced from time to time as
promulgated by the state’s Department of Environmental Management, and 675
I.A.C. 16-1.4 et seq. entitled “Indiana Plumbing Code, 1999 Edition”, as
amended or replaced from time to time as promulgated by the state’s Fire
Prevention and
Building Safety Commission, are hereby incorporated and adopted by reference as
part of this chapter. One copy of these regulations shall be on file with the
town’s water utility.
   (B)   The town’s water utility may cause inspections to be made of all
properties served by the public water system. The frequency of inspections and
reinspections shall be based on potential health hazards involved and shall be
as established by the town’s water utility.
   (C)   Upon presentation of credentials, a representative of the town’s water
utility shall have the right to request entry at any reasonable time into or
upon any property served by a connection to the public water system of the town
in order to inspect connections. On request, the owner, lessee or occupant of
any property shall furnish to the inspector any pertinent information regarding
the connections, piping systems, water systems and hazards on such property. It
shall be assumed that a cross-connection and hazard is present if access or
requested information are refused.
   (D)   The town’s water utility is hereby authorized and directed to
discontinue water service to any property wherein any connection in violation
of this chapter exists, and to take such other precautionary measures deemed
necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water system.
Water service shall be discontinued only after ten days’ written notice is
served on the owner, lessee or occupants of the property or premises where a
violation is found or suspected to exist. Water service to such property shall
not be restored until the violations have been eliminated in compliance with
the provisions of this chapter.
   (E)   If it is deemed by the town’s Superintendent of Public Works that an
emergency endangers public health, safety or welfare and requires immediate
action, and a written finding to that effect is filed with the Clerk of the
town and delivered to the user’s premises, water service may be immediately
discontinued. The user shall have an opportunity for hearing before the Town
Council, or its designated hearing officer, of such emergency discontinuance.
   (F)   If a charger issue exists, an approved reduced-pressure-principle
backflow preventer may be installed and maintained by the user in the principal
water line servicing each connection to the town water system. In the
discretion of the town’s Superintendent of Public Works, a double-check valve
backflow preventer may be used in lieu of a reduced-pressure-principle backflow
preventer. In the event the town’s Superintendent of Public Works determines
that an increased risk or hazard exists to the town water system at a
connection where a double-check valve backflow preventer was originally allowed
to be utilized pursuant to this section, the town’s Superintendent of Public
Works may require the replacement of the double-check valve backflow preventer
with a reduced-pressure-principle backflow preventer.
   (G)   The backflow preventer used must be an approved assembly as found on
the “List of Approved Backflow Prevention Assemblies”, published by the
University of Southern California Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and
Hydraulic Research, which list is available for inspection at the town’s water
utility. The backflow preventer must be installed in an easily accessible
location not subject to flooding or freezing.
   (H)   As a condition of continued service, all users shall arrange for the
inspection of all cross- connection and backflow preventer control assemblies
by an inspector registered by the state’s Department of Environmental
Management. These inspections shall occur at time intervals specified in 327
I.A.C. 8-10-8(b), as amended, or as otherwise required by any applicable
statute, regulation or ordinance. Completed test reports shall be submitted to
the town’s water utility by the user within 30 days after the user’s receipt of
the test reports. Tests and inspections may be required on a more frequent
basis at the discretion of the town’s Superintendent of Public Works.
   (I)   This chapter does not supersede the state’s Plumbing Code as amended
or replaced from time to time or any plumbing ordinances, sewer use ordinances
or other ordinances currently in force and effect in the town, but rather is
supplementary to such. In the event of any conflict with this chapter, the
requirements which are stricter and more protective of the public health and
safety shall control.
§ 50.04 WATER TURN-ON AND SHUTOFF PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Other than by persons authorized by the town, no one shall turn on or
shall turn off town mains, hydrants, gate valves, curb stop valves or other
valves of the town’s water utility. No person shall maliciously, willfully or
negligently break, damage, uncover or deface, or tamper with any structure,
appurtenance or equipment which is part of the town waterworks. Any person
violating this provision shall be subject to immediate arrest.
   (B)   Each month, the town’s water utility shall generate a customer balance
sheet showing the amount owed per customer, not including the amount owed from
the most recent billing.
   (C)   When any account or statement for services provided by the town’s
water utility is 60 days past due, the water utility may send a letter
demanding payment within ten working days and stating that the water service
may be terminated if all delinquent payments are not made within the ten days.
   (D)   (1)   If payment is not received within the ten working days described
in division (C) above, the town water utility may terminate water service to
the customer.
      (2)   Water service shall not be restored until the customer pays the
past due amounts and the customer makes satisfactory arrangements with the
town’s water utility to avoid future delinquencies.
      (3)   In order to re-commence water service after termination, the
customer shall pay to the town’s water utility a re-instatement fee of $30.
Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 50.05 WATER METERS.
   (A)   (1)   Water meters shall be initially purchased by the user from the
water utility at the user’s expense.
      (2)   All water meters used shall meet the requirements of and be subject
to the approval by the town’s Superintendent of Public Works.
   (B)   To confirm and ratify historic policy of the town’s water utility, the
repair and/or replacement of water meters for water lines of one inch or less
in size shall be provided by the town at its expense; the repair and/or
replacement of water meters for water lines greater than one inch in size shall
be provided by the user at the user’s expense.
§ 50.06 FIRE PROTECTION AND WATER CONNECTIONS.
   Any fire protection system utilizing water from the town’s water utility
shall have its own tap and be connected to a town water line separate and apart
from any other water tap or connection to the town water system.
§ 50.07 AUTHORITY OF SUPERINTENDENT.
   (A)   In the event of unforeseen circumstances or developments or emergency
situations, the Superintendent of the town’s water utility is hereby vested
with such authority and discretion as is needed in order to protect the public
health, safety and welfare in connection with the operation of the town’s water
utility.
   (B)   A person shall not institute, permit or maintain any conditions that
may jeopardize or threaten the public health and safety with respect to the
town water system. The Superintendent, upon hearing of the existence of such
conditions, shall order the abatement of those conditions. The order must be in
writing, specify the conditions that may jeopardize or threaten the public
health and safety and name the shortest reasonable time for abatement. If a
person refuses or neglects to obey an order issued under this provision by the
Superintendent, the Town Attorney may, upon receiving the information from the
Superintendent, institute proceedings in the courts for enforcement. An order
may be enforced by injunction. If the action involves a criminal offense, a law
enforcement authority with jurisdiction over the location where the offense
occurred shall be so notified for further enforcement.
§ 50.08 PRIORITY OF GOVERNING STANDARDS.
   (A)   Within the Guide, the following standards are established for the
town: state laws and regulations; the “Ten States Standards”; and the American
Waterworks Association Standards.
   (B)   In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between these various
standards, the controlling standard or requirement shall be established and
determined by reference to and priority shall be given in the following order:
      (1)   State laws and regulations;
      (2)   Town standards contained within the Guide;

and charges shall be collected from the owners of each and every lot, parcel of
real estate or building that is connected with the town’s sanitary sewage
system or otherwise discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or
other liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the sanitary sewage system
of the town.
   (B)   Such rates and charges include user charges, debt service costs,
excessive strength surcharges and other service charges, which rates and
charges shall be payable as hereinafter provided and shall be in an amount
determined as follows.
      (1)   The sewage rates and charges shall be based on the quantity of
water used on or in the property or premises subject to such rates and charges
as the same is measured by the water meter there in use, plus a base charge
based on the size of water meter installed except as herein otherwise provided.
For the purpose of billing and collecting the charges for sewage service, the
water meters shall be read monthly and the users shall be billed each month (or
period equaling a month). If, for any reason, the monthly meter reading is not
available, a bill will be prepared, based on the estimated usage, and a
correction will be made when meter readings are available. The water usage
schedule on which the amount of said rates and charges shall be determined is
as follows: all Class I users:
         (a)   Treatment rate per 1,000 gallons of usage per month: $ ; plus
         (b)   Base rate per month:
Water Meter Amount
Water Meter               Amount
5/8-inch to 3/4-inch
1-inch
1-1/4-inch to 1-1/2- inch
2-inch
3-inch
4-inch
6-inch
 
      (2)   For users of the sewage works that are unmetered water users or
accurate meter readings are not available, the monthly sewer charge shall be
determined by equivalent single-family dwelling units, except as herein
provided. Sewage service bills shall be rendered once each month (or period
equaling a month). The schedule on which said rates and charges will be
determined is as follows: residential: single-family dwelling unit, monthly
rate: $ .
      (3)   As contemplated by applicable state law, the town and other
government users shall be subject to the same rates and charges established
herein for their use and receipt of sewage services by the town.
      (4)   In order to recover the cost of monitoring industrial wastes, the
town shall charge the user not less than $36 per sampling event, plus the
actual cost for collecting and analyzing the sample(s) as determined by the
town or by an independent laboratory. This charge will be reviewed on the same
basis as all other rates and charges in this subchapter.
(Ord. 2019-06, passed 8-28-2019)
§ 52.04 QUANTITIES OF WATER.
   The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewage system and
obtained from sources other than the water utility that serves the town shall
be determined by the town in such manner as the town shall reasonably elect,
and subject to payment by the user of the method used for measuring such usage,
and the sewage service shall be billed at the appropriate rates; except as
hereinafter provided in this section, the town may make proper allowances in
determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be
consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the town that such
quantities do not enter the sanitary sewage system.
   (A)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building other than a
single-family dwelling unit discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes,
water or other liquids into the town’s sanitary sewage system, either directly
or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied by the water utility serving the
town, and the water used thereon or therein is not measured by a water meter,
or is measured by a water meter not acceptable to the town, then the amount of
water used shall be otherwise measured or determined by the town. In order to
ascertain the rate or charge provided in this subchapter, the owner or other
interested party shall, at his or her expense, install and maintain meters,
weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of
measurement acceptable to the town for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the town and, in addition, is a user of
water from another source which is not measured by a water meter or is measured
by a meter not acceptable to the town, then the amount of water used shall be
otherwise measured or determined by the town. In order to ascertain the rates
or charges, the owner or other interested parties shall, at his or her expense,
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the town for the
determination of sewage discharge.
   (C)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and
the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each such
case, for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for
each user and the base charge and the flow rates and charges shall apply to
each of the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate or buildings
served through the single water meter.
   (D)   In the event two or more dwelling units, such as mobile homes,
apartments or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water or other
liquids into the town’s sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly,
are users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water
meter, then in such case, billing shall be for a single service in the manner
set out elsewhere herein; except that, the minimum charge shall be $21.25 per
month per dwelling unit served through the single water meter. In the case of
mobile home courts, the number of dwelling units shall be computed and
interpreted as the total number of mobile home spaces available for rent, plus
any other dwelling units served through a meter. A dwelling unit shall be
interpreted as a room or rooms or any other space or spaces in which cooking
facilities are provided.
   (E)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess
of 25,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the
town that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not
and can not enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other
interested party may, at its expense, install and maintain meters, weirs,
volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the town for the determination of sewage discharge; but upon
failure to do so, the billing shall be based upon the water usage.
   (F)   (1)   In order that domestic and residential users of sewage services
shall not be penalized for sprinkling lawns during the months of June, July,
August and September, the billing for sewage services for residential and/or
domestic users for said months shall be based upon the average water usage per
month for the previous billed months of October through June, if such average
usage is lower than the summer months and if the owner of the property has
remained the same. Said sprinkling rate shall not apply to any premises which
are partially or wholly used for commercial or industrial purposes.
      (2)   In the event a portion of such premises shall be used for
commercial or industrial purposes, the owner shall have the privilege of
separating the water service so that the residential portion of the premises is
served through a separate meter and, in such case, the water usage as
registered by the water meter serving such portion of the premises used for
residential purposes would qualify under the sprinkling rate.
   (G)   The provisions of division (F) above may from time to time be extended
to and be applicable in the months of May, June and/or October upon motion and
approval by the Town Council at a duly called public meeting of the Town
Council.
(Ord. 2019-06, passed 8-28-2019)
§ 52.05 STRENGTH AND CONTENT OF WASTEWATER.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered to users, the town shall base its charges not
only on the volume, but also on strength and character of the stronger-than-
normal domestic sewage and wastes for which it is required to treat and
dispose. The town shall require the user, at the user’s expense, to determine
the strength and content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either directly
or indirectly, into the sanitary sewage system, in such manner, by such method
and at such times as the town may deem practicable in light of the conditions
and attending circumstances of the case, in order to determine the proper
charge.
   (B)   The user shall furnish a central sampling point available to the town
at all times.
      (1)   Normal domestic sewage waste strength should not have: biochemical
oxygen demand in excess of 240 milligrams per liter of fluid; suspended solids
in excess of 240 milligrams per liter of fluid; ammonia in excess of 30
milligrams per liter of fluid; phosphorus in excess of seven milligrams per
liter of fluid; and fats, wax, grease or oils, collectively, whether emulsified
or not, in excess of 100 milligrams per liter of fluid. Additional charges for
treating stronger-than-normal domestic sewage shall be made on the following
basis.
         (a)   Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids. There shall be an
additional charge of $0.72 per pound of suspended solids for suspended solids
received in excess of 240 milligrams per liter of fluid.
         (b)   Rate surcharge based upon BOD. There shall be an additional
charge of $0.72 per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for BOD received in
excess of 240 milligrams per liter of fluid.
         (c)   Rate surcharge based upon ammonia. There shall be an additional
charge of $0.87 per pound of ammonia for ammonia received in excess of 30
milligrams per liter of fluid.
         (d)   Rate surcharge based upon phosphorus. There shall be an
additional charge of $2.02 per pound of phosphorus received in excess of seven
milligrams per liter of fluid.
         (e)   Rate surcharge based upon oils and grease. There shall be an
additional charge of $0.39 per pound of fats, wax, grease or oils,
collectively, whether emulsified or not, received in excess of 100 milligrams
per liter of fluid.
      (2)   The determination of suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand,
ammonia, phosphorus and fats, wax, grease or oils, whether emulsified or not,
contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the latest copy of Standard
Methods for the Elimination of Water, Sewage and Industrial Wastes, as written
by the American Public Health Association, the American Waterworks Association,
and the Water Pollution Control Federation, and in accordance with Guidelines
Establishing Test Procedures for the Analysis of Pollutants, 40 C.F.R. part
136, as hereinafter amended, supplemented or replaced.
(Ord. 2019-06, passed 8-28-2019)
§ 52.06 USERS OUTSIDE THE TOWN.
   All provisions hereof to the contrary notwithstanding, the rates and charges
to users of the town sewage works, for lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings, of any type or character, situated outside the corporate boundaries
of the town, shall be set and fixed at 150% of the rates and charges to users
(and lots, parcels of real estate or buildings) within the corporate limits of
the town.
(Ord. 2019-06, passed 8-28-2019)
§ 52.07 BILLING; DELINQUENCY.
   All rates and charges herein contemplated shall be prepared, billed and
collected by the town in the manner provided by law and ordinance.
   (A)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed
monthly.
   (B)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying
the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but
such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in the event
payment is not made as herein required. The owners of properties served, which
are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to examine the
collection records of the town for the purpose of determining whether bills
have been paid by such tenant or tenants; provided that, such examination shall
be made at the office at which such records are kept and during the hours that
such office is open for business.
   (C)   As is provided by applicable state statute, all rates and charges not
paid when due are hereby declared to be delinquent and a penalty of 10% of the
amount of the rates and charges not timely paid shall thereupon attach thereto
and be due and owing. The time at which such rates or charges shall be paid is
now fixed at 15 days after the date of mailing of the bill by the town to the
person responsible therefor. Additionally, the Council hereby reserves all
charging and collection rights and remedies permitted by I.C. 36-9-23, with
regard to the collection of rates and charges under this subchapter or the
Sewer Use Ordinance (§§
52.25 through
52.37 of this chapter), or amendments, supplements or replacements thereto,
dealing with hook-ups, connections and usage of the sewage system.
(Ord. 2019-06, passed 8-28-2019)
§ 52.08 STUDY OF RATES AND CHARGES.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain
fair and equitable and be in proportion to the cost of providing services to
the various users of user classes, the town shall cause a study to be made
within a reasonable period of time following the first two years of operation,
following the date on which this subchapter goes into effect. Such study shall
include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the cost associated with the
treatment of excessive strength effluents from industrial users, volume and
delivery flow rate characteristics attributed to the various users and user
classes, the financial position of the sewage works and the adequacy of its
revenue to provide reasonable funds for the operation and maintenance,

preventing any separate agreement or arrangement between the town and any user
whereby waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the town for
treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the user, at such rates as are
compatible with the Sewer Rate Ordinance (§§
52.01 through
52.11 of this chapter), so long as said agreement or arrangement does not

performance of the treatment facilities and for comparison against town
monitoring records.
§ 52.32 MEASUREMENTS, TESTS AND ANALYSIS.
   The Superintendent may require users of the sewage works to supply pertinent
information on wastewater flow characteristics and constituents in order to
verify compliance with the requirements of this subchapter. Such measurements,
tests and analyses shall be made by the user at the user’s expense. The town
may also have such measurements, tests and analyses performed with the expense
of such assessed to the user at the option of the town. Whenever the town
obtains or receives a wastewater or sewage sample for analysis, the town shall
offer to split the sample with the user in order to allow the user an
opportunity to conduct duplicate analytical tests in order to verify the
analytical results received by the town.
§ 52.33 GREASE, OIL AND SAND INTERCEPTORS.
   (A)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors or traps shall be provided by a user

rules, and regulations applicable to that Board.
   (B)   In addition, any person, partnership, association, or corporation
aggrieved by a decision of the Board of Trustees as a result of appealing to

or they give 15 days’ written notice of intent to do so to the Board by
certified United States mail. The notice shall concisely state the grievance.

this chapter and not having begun the appeal process shall be deemed guilty of
an ordinance violation and, upon conviction, may be fined not less than $10 and
no more than $50 for that day and for each day thereafter that the violation
remains unabated. If the Board of Trustees or any other body to whom an appeal
is processed finds on appeal that the ruling of the Building Commissioner is
correct, the penalties set out in this division (A) accrue immediately
irrespective of the number of days since the posting of the stop work order.
Unless the Board or any other body determines that the stop work order was
improperly posted, the order shall remain in full force and effect.
   (B)   The Building Department may institute suit for injunction in the
County Circuit Court to restrain an individual from violating the provisions of
this section or any rules and regulations established pursuant to the terms of
