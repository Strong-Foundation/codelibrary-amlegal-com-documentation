A BRIEF HISTORY OF BROWNSBURG, INDIANA
   James B. Brown settled in Brown Township in 1824, thus becoming Brownsburg's
first settler. The area was dense and unbroken wilderness with only hunters and
trappers in the area. Delaware Indians lived in what is now called Lincoln
Township, along White Lick Creek, which was then called “Wa-pe-ke-way” or
“White Salt.”
   In 1928, the first log school house was built in Brown Township. One-room
brick schools were built every four miles. Everyone in the family except the
mothers went to school when it was not crop season. The age range in the
classroom was from six years to 43 years.
   Due to problems with swamp land, the northern part of the county, including
Brown Township, were the last to be settled. Illnesses caused by the swamp
land, then known as “Ague,” affected entire families, with many dying. In the
1840's, woodland ditch systems were built by Irish immigrants familiar with
bogs in their native homeland to drain the swamps, making the areas habitable.
   Brown Township was divided in 1863, becoming Brown Township in the north,
being named after its first resident James B. Brown, who was originally from
Kentucky. Lincoln Township was created to the south, being named after
President Lincoln as a sign of support during the Civil War.
   A stagecoach line was established along a road built in 1820 connecting all
of the small outlying communities with Indianapolis.
   The Calvary Methodist Episcopal Church was organized under Reverend Joseph
Tarkington in 1828. It held services in the little red school house until March
2, 1872, when it moved into its new facilities on Main Street. The church is
presently located on South Green Street.
   William Harris settled in the area north of what is now Main Street on
either side of the current Green Street Area. Selling sections of these woods
to incoming pioneers gave the Town its original name of Harrisburg in 1835. Mr.
Harris marked these original six acres of land by walking off distances between
tree stumps.
   Thomas Lockhard and his 17-member congregation organized the Brownsburg
Christian Church in 1835.
   The post office was established in 1836 under the name of Harrisburg, but
was later changed to Brownsburg, since the name Harrisburg was being used by a
post office in Fayette County.
   The first church building to be erected in Brownsburg was a log structure,
built in 1840 by the Brownsburg Christian Church. From the 1840's to the
1870's, the Town almost tripled in size, from its original six acres to more
than 16 acres. 1848 brought the area's first election with a total of ten male
votes cast.
   In the late 1840's the “Little Church in the Wildwood” was founded, with its
charter being issued in 1851. In 1881, the current brick building known as
White Lick Presbyterian Church was constructed.
   A group of Christian Pioneers, meeting in the old Watson School House,
organized the Bethesda Missionary Baptist Church in 1851, affiliated with the
White Lick Missionary Baptist Association and the Indiana State Convention. The
James Tarpey Farm was obtained in 1857, and a frame building was erected.
   Brownsburg's only Catholic Church was established in 1869 under the
direction of Reverend D. J. McMullen. The first priest in charge of the
congregation after Father McMullen was Reverend J. L. Brassart. The location of
this original structure is on North Green Street.
   In 1869, the Big Four Railroad opened service to Brownsburg, and by 1910,
the Interurban was making daily trips between Indianapolis and Crawfordsville,
with scheduled hourly stops in Brownsburg. A covered bridge stood on Highway
136 just west of the Town, until 1927.
   During the 1910's and the 1920's Brownsburg residents listened and danced to
music played by its own band performing on a bandwagon in the middle of the
current intersection of Main and Green Streets. Later, the bandwagon was placed
by the Chautaqua held one week in August on the school playground. Here the
community enjoyed listening to speakers and talented entertainers. Activities
later included community fish fries as well as ten-cent picture shows.
In 1917, Superintendent of Schools Sylvester Moore and his wife, Anne, were
instrumental in the forming of Brownsburg's first public library, funded by
local gifts, as well as a $12,500 gift from the Carnegie Corporation. The new
library, opening with a total of 400 books, named Ottie Roberts as the first
Librarian, who remained in that position until 1944.
   The first two-story schoolhouse was built in 1917 on College Avenue. Later a
gym and another two-story building was added to house 12 grades, while a school
in Brown Township, north on Highway 267, housed grades one through eight.
   During the 1930's to the 1950's movies at the “Brownie Theatre,” in addition
to the Town fish fries and carnivals at Eaton Park, were held throughout the
summer.
   The Brownsburg Fire Department was officially formed in 1942, as a Volunteer
Fire Department.
   In the 1950's, a roller skating tent was placed on the school property.
Little League sports plus high school sporting activities also began. It was
also during this period of time that the Brownsburg Shopping Center was built
on the east side of Town.
   In 1952 an Elementary School was built east of the gymnasium and another one
added on South Green Street, given the name of South. The late 1950's saw the
high school erected on Stadium Drive, while the present high school was built
on South Odell, turning the old building into an intermediate school for grades
five and six.
   The 1960's established Brownsburg as having the largest varsity gym in the
county-wide basketball area, becoming the site for tournaments. The 1970's saw
Brownsburg Square Shopping Center on the north side being erected, and in 1981
a new ultra-modern library with solar energy and a computer check-out system
was built on South Jefferson Street.
   The library is 25,000 square feet and contains over 102,000 books. Features
of the Brownsburg Public Library include meeting rooms, story hour facilities,
an outdoor amphitheater, typing rooms, computers for public use, video and
audio tapes, art prints, and a totally automated circulation system. Special
programs include adult programming, pre-school story hours, Super Saturday
Programs for school age children, Summer Reading Regular Programs for all ages,
“Booker's Bunch” on Thursday evenings, and annual celebrations during
Children's Book Week and National Library Week.
   Brownsburg is proud to sustain over 40 civic organizations with local and
national affiliations, 30 churches of varying denominations, two community
theatre troupes, a Halloween House, carnivals, celebrations, and several area
parks.
   The 1990 census shows the population of Brownsburg to be 7,628 people.
Brownsburg is ideally located just 15 miles from the Indianapolis International
Airport and has seven universities within driving distance. Nestled in
Hendricks County, this former swampy hunting grounds of the Delaware Indians
has grown to be known as a “small town atmosphere with big city opportunities,”
as a result of its hardworking civic and public officials.

titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the
“Brownsburg Town Code,” for which designation “Code of Ordinances,” “Codified

   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to

originally enacted, or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered

publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only, and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only, and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.

access, misuse, theft, damage, destruction, modification or disclosure. At no
time shall a user access or attempt to access any Town information without
having the express authority to do so or in any manner that is inconsistent
with the approved method of system entry. All information developed by users
while on the job or while utilizing the Town's facilities or resources shall be
the exclusive property of the Town.

the contents of employees' or other authorized users' e-mail, but will do so
only when it has a legitimate business need. The Town's e-mail systems should
be treated like a shared idling system with the expectation that messages sent
or received with respect to Town business or with the use of Town resources may
be reviewed by any authorized Town official for any purposes related to the
Town's business, which may include the public pursuant to I.C. 5-14-3-1 et seq.
      (2)   The Town will not monitor e-mail as a routine matter, but will
inspect the contents of e-mail during the course of an investigation triggered
by indications of illegal actions, misconduct, protection of health and safety,
to prevent interference with the business of the Town, or to locate substantive
information required for Town business purposes that is not more readily
available by some other means. The Town will also respond to legal processes
and fulfill its obligations to third parties, which may include the disclosure
of an individual's e-mail.
      (3)   The contents of e-mail, properly obtained for legitimate business
purposes, may be disclosed without permission of any employee or other
authorized user. Employees or other authorized users on the Town's e-mail
system have no expectation of privacy in e-mail. The e-mail system, like any
other element in the communication and information storage system, belongs to
the Town. E-mail is subject to discovery by litigants in a lawsuit involving
the Town or third parties. Individuals needing access to the e-mail of others,
to use information gained from that access and/or to disclose information from
the access, must obtain advance approval for the activity from the ITD.
   (J)   Appropriate use and decency requirements. Town employees granted
access to the Town computers, internet connected resources and e-mail resources
are required to use that access in a way that is consistent with their job
function, regardless of whether the access is off-hours or on the employee's
time. The content of anything exchanged via internet access or e-mail must be
appropriate and consistent with the standards of common sense, decency and
courtesy. The Town's computers, internet-connected resources and e-mail
resources are not to be used to do any of the following:

agreements and trade secret regulations.
      (7)   Distribute confidential Town information.

finds that the dominant theme of the matter, taken as a whole, appeals to the
prurient interest in sex; depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way,

mercury in amounts that result in the POTW violating any portion of its NPDES
permit.
      (20)   Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste-producing
or odor-producing substances, in concentrations exceeding limits which may be
established by the Superintendent as necessary, after treatment of the
composite sewage, to meet the requirements of the state, federal, or other
public agencies of jurisdiction of discharge to the receiving waters.
      (21)   Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids, such as, but not
limited to, fuller's earth, lime slurries and lime residues; or of dissolved
solids, such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate.

presence of toxic or poisonous solids, liquids or gases in sufficient quantity,
either singly or by interaction with other wastes, to injure or interfere with
any sewage treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create
a public nuisance, or create any hazard in the receiving waters of the sewage
treatment plant.
      (25)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to a degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent
cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over
discharge to the receiving waters.
      (26)   Food waste disposal, including through in-sink grinders of sink
disposal units, except when its use complies with the compatible pollutant
limits set forth in this chapter.
      (27)   No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any
way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the
federal categorical pretreatment regulations or with any other pretreatment
standard set by the Control Authority or specified within this chapter.
   (C)   Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall
not be processed, diluted, or stored in such a manner that they could be
discharged to the POTW.

§ 52.31 ACTION BY TOWN.
   (A)   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged, to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or
possess the characteristics enumerated in §
52.30, and which in the judgment of the Superintendent may effect treatment
works, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a
hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent may do any
of the following:
      (1)   Require new industries (or other large users) or industries (or
other large users) with a significant increase in discharges to submit
information on wastewater quantities and characteristics, and to obtain prior
approval for discharges.
      (2)   Reject the wastes, in whole or in part, for any reason deemed
appropriate by the Town.
      (3)   Require pretreatment of wastes to within the limits of normal
sewage as defined in this chapter.
      (4)   Require control or flow equalization of wastes so as to avoid any
“slug” loads or excessive loads that may be harmful to the treatment works.
      (5)   Require payment of a surcharge on any excessive flows or loadings
discharged to the treatment works to cover the additional cost of having
capacity for and treating the wastes.
   (B)   If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of
waste flows, the design and installation of the plant and equipment shall be
subject to the review and approval of the Superintendent, and subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
   (C)   If any user discharges waste causing the Town to utilize sewer
cleaning equipment, purchase chemicals, hardware or other materials for the
purpose of cleaning to remove the grease or other obstructions from sewer
lines, lift stations or wet wells, the Town shall maintain the right to assess
the user for the cost of materials and services.
   (D)   The Town reserves the right to establish by ordinance more stringent
limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW if deemed necessary.

§ 52.32 PREVENTION OF ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE.
   Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental discharge,
prohibited materials, slug loads, or other regulated substances. Detailed plans
and operating procedures for facilities are provided, and shall be maintained
continuously in satisfactory and effective operating order by the owner at his
expense, and shall be subject to periodic inspection by the Town to determine
if the facilities are being operated and maintained in conformance with
applicable federal, state and local laws and permits. All existing industrial
users who have filed a contingency plan in compliance with the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act shall file a copy of that plan with the Town
within ninety (90) days of the adoption of this chapter. No industrial user who
commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of this chapter
shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental
discharge prevention facilities and procedures have been submitted to the Town.
Submittal and review of the plans and operating procedures shall not relieve
the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the facilities and
procedures as necessary to comply with federal, state and local laws and
permits.

§ 52.33 CONTROL MANHOLE.
   When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole, together with any necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the
wastes at the owner’s expense. The manhole, when required, shall be accessibly
and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved
by the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his
expense, and shall be maintained so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
Agents of the Town, the state water pollution control agencies, and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency shall be permitted to enter all properties for
the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing.
   If a control manhole does not exist on site or is not feasible to install,
an internal drainage point can be used upon permission of the Superintendent.
If neither a private control manhole nor an internal discharge point is
practical as the monitoring location, or causes an undue hardship on the user,
the Superintendent may allow the monitoring facility to be constructed in the
public street or sidewalk area, and to be located so that it will not be
obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. Ample room must be provided to
allow accurate sampling and the compositing of samples for analysis. The
manhole, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in
a safe and proper operating condition at the owner's expense.
   Wastewater shall not be diverted because of changes in plumbing or internal
processing from the designated sampling location without prior notice and
approval of the Superintendent.

§ 52.34 MEASUREMENTS, TESTS AND ANALYSES.
   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided,
or upon suitable samples taken at the control manhole, except for applications
for NPDES permits and reports thereof which shall be conducted in accordance
with rules and regulations adopted by the USEPA (40 CFR 136). In the event that
no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered
to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which
the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works,
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The
particular analysis involved will determine whether a twenty-four- hour (24-
hour) composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate, or whether a grab
sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended
solids analysis are obtained from twenty-four-hour (24-hour) composites
determined from periodic grab samples.
   All discharges subject to local, state, or federal regulations must retain
and preserve, for at least three (3) years, any records, books, documents,
memoranda, reports, correspondence, and any and all summaries relating to
monitoring, sampling, and chemical analyses made by or on behalf of a
discharger in connection with its discharge.
   Any required monitoring activities, supplies, laboratory costs (whether in-
house or by a contract laboratory) that must be utilized or performed by the
Town, will be charged to the user. Any tests or services utilized from a
contract laboratory will be charged at the laboratory's rates.

   No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the Town and any industrial concern
whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by
the Town for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern
at rates as are compatible with the rate ordinance. Special arrangement
agreements may be made based upon an allocation of the WWTP design capacity for
a compatible pollutant, and may be subject to surcharge fees based upon the
allocated waste strength or the actual waste strength, whichever is greater.

prior to discharge to the treatment works is required and is subject to the
rules and regulations adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (40
CFR 403), and Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of
Pollutants (40 CFR 136), in addition to any more stringent requirements
established by the Town and any subsequent state or federal guidelines and
rules and regulations.
   (B)   Whenever deemed necessary, as determined at the discretion of the Town
and/or the Superintendent, the Superintendent may require users to restrict
their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewaters be
discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of
discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and
such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the
user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   No user shall increase the use of process water or, in any way,
attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the federal
categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant-specific
limitation established by the Town.
   (D)   Any user discharging to the POTW greater than twenty-five thousand
(25,000) gallons per day of process wastewater, or greater than (5%) of the
average daily flow in the POTW, whichever is lesser, maybe required to install
and maintain, on the user's property and at the user's expense, a suitable
storage and flow control facility to insure equalization of flow over a twenty-
four-hour (24-hour) period. The facility shall have a capacity for at least
twenty percent (20%) of the daily discharge volume, and shall be equipped with
alarms and a rate of discharge controller, the regulation of which shall be
directed by the Superintendent. A discharge permit may be issued to any user
solely for flow equalization.
   (E)   Industrial users with the potential to discharge flammable substances
may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection
meter.
   (F)   Industrial users shall provide and maintain in safe and proper
condition, on their own property and at their own expense, facilities to allow
authorized representatives of the POTW or Control Authority to inspect, sample,
or measure discharges subject to regulation pursuant to this ordinance. Such
facilities shall have ample space to allow accurate sampling and preparation of
samples for analysis.
   (G)   Consistent noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements may be the basis for the Town determining that a user is not a
responsible party, for the purpose of rejecting the user's bid for the sale of
goods or services to the Town.

is granted. Where facilities are provided, they shall be maintained
continuously in satisfactory and effective operating order by the owner at his
expense, and shall be subject to periodic inspection by the Town to determine
that the facilities are being operated in conformance with applicable federal,
state and local laws and permits. The owner shall maintain operating records
and shall submit to the Town a monthly summary report of the character of the
influent and effluent to show the performance of the treatment facilities and
for comparison against Town monitoring records. Any subsequent changes in the
pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to the
Superintendent, and all state and federal agencies having regulatory authority.

and opportunity to respond, which threatens to interfere with the operation of
the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the
environment. Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Superintendent may take any steps necessary, including immediate severance of
the sewer connection to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving
stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent may allow the
user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed.

§ 52.60 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent may petition the County Court through the Town Attorney for the
issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which
restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge
permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of
the user. The Superintendent may also seek any other action as is appropriate
for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to
conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not
be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a
user.

§ 52.61 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   The Superintendent shall have the legal authority to issue notices of
violation, cease and desist orders, establish compliance schedules, request
show cause, and revoke permits as outlined in the written enforcement response
plan under approval by the Control Authority.
   The enforcement response plan shall detail formal action taken by the Town
in the event of compliance issues, including but not limited to, those found
within this chapter.
   (B)   The plan shall be made available upon request to any user of the POTW.

FEES AND SURCHARGES
§ 52.70 USER CLASSES.
   Every person whose premises are served by the sewage works shall be charged
for the services provided. These charges are established for each user class,
as defined, in order that the sewage works recovers, from each user and user
class, revenue which is proportional to its use of the treatment works in terms
of volume and load. User charges are levied to defray the costs of operation
and maintenance (including replacement) of the treatment works. User charges
shall be uniform in magnitude within a user class.
   (A)   User charges are subject to the rules and regulations adopted by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency. Replacement costs, which are
recovered through the system of user charges, shall be based upon the expected
useful life of the sewage works equipment.
   (B)   The various classes of users of the treatment works, for the purposes
of this chapter, are as follows:
      (1)   Class I -- residential.
      (2)   Commercial.
      (3)   Governmental.
      (4)   Institutional.
      (5)   Industrial.

§ 52.71 DETERMINATION OF RATES.
   For the use of and the services rendered by the sewage works, rates and
charges shall be collected from the owners of each and every lot, parcel of
real estate or building that is connected with the Town’s sewage system or
otherwise discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other
liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the sanitary sewage system of the
Town. Rates and charges include user charges, debt service costs, excessive
strength surcharges, outside Town surcharges and other service charges, which
rates and charges shall be payable as provided in this chapter and shall be in
an amount determinable as follows:
   (A)   Metered water users. The sewage rates and charges shall be based on
the quantity of water used on or in the property or premises subject to such
rates and charges, as the same is measured by the water meter there in use,
plus a base charge based on the size of the water meter installed, except as
herein otherwise provided. For the purpose of billing and collecting the
charges for sewage service, the water meters shall be read monthly and the
users shall be billed each month (or period equaling a month). Users located
outside of the corporate limits of the Town shall be subject to an additional
surcharge as set forth below. The water usage schedule on which the amount of
the rates and charges shall be determined is as follows for all users:
      (1)   Treatment rate per one thousand (1,000) gallons of usage per month:
            Total Treatment Rate
            $6.28 plus the base rate

   (B)   Unmetered water users.
      (1)   For users of the sewage works that are unmetered water users or
where accurate meter readings are not available, the monthly charge shall be
determined as an average of single-family dwelling units, except as herein
provided. Sewage service bills shall be rendered once each month (or period
equaling a month). The schedule on which rates and charges shall be determined
is as follows:
 
                           Outside Town Surcharge Total Monthly Rate
                                                  Inside Town Outside Town
Residential: Single-family $6.66                  $46.21      $52.87
residence/unit
 
      (2)   Unmetered nonresidential single-family dwelling units shall be
charged a rate to be determined by the Town, on an individual basis, by
applying the above metered rates to estimated usage, meter size and user
location.
   (C)   For the service rendered to the Town, the Town shall be subject to the
same rates and charges hereinabove provided, or to charges and rates
established in harmony therewith.
   (D)   In order to recover the cost of monitoring industrial wastes, the Town
shall charge the user the actual cost of monitoring; but not less than twenty-
five dollars ($25) per sampling event. This charge will be reviewed on the same
basis as all other rates and charges in this chapter.
   (E)   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered to users, the Town shall base its charges not
only on the volume, but also on strength and character of stronger-than-normal
domestic sewage, and shall require the user to determine the strength and
content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly,
into the sewage system, in such manner and by such method as the Town may deem
practicable in the light of the conditions and attending circumstances of the
case, in order to determine the proper charge. The user shall furnish a
sampling point, as defined in the sewer use ordinance, available to the Town at
all times.
      (1)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a
biochemical oxygen demand of two hundred (200) milligrams per liter of fluid or
suspended solids in excess of two hundred (200) milligrams per liter of fluid.
Additional charges for treating stronger-than-normal domestic waste shall be
made on the following basis:
         (a)   Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids. There shall be an
additional charge of forty-seven cents ($0.47) per pound of suspended solids
for suspended solids in excess of two hundred (200) milligrams per liter of
fluid.
         (b)   Rate surcharge based upon BOD. There shall be an additional
charge of forty-seven cents ($0.47) per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for
BOD received in excess of two hundred (200) milligrams per liter of fluid.
      (2)   The determination of suspended solids and five-day (5-day)
biochemical oxygen demand contained in the waste shall be in accordance with
the current edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage
and Industrial Wastes, as written by the American Public Health Association,
the American Water Works Association and the Water Pollution Control
Federation.
   (F)   For current monthly bills rendered in the months of June, July,
August, and September to metered water users with 5/8 inch or 3/4 inch meters,
the sewage rates and charges shall be the base rate amount plus the treatment
rate applied to the lesser of either: (1) the quantity of water used on or in
the property or premises as measured by the water meter there in the use; or
(2) the average monthly quantity of water usage on which the sewage rates and
charges to that same customer for that same premises were determined in the
monthly bills rendered the immediately prior April, November, and October. If
the customer does not have a billing history for that same premises going back
to a bill rendered the prior October on the basis of a full month's water
usage, then the sewage rates and charges for bills rendered in the months of
June, July, August, and September shall be the basic rate amount plus the
treatment rate applied to the quantity of water used on or in the property or
premises as measured by the water meter there in use.
   (G)   Annual COLA increase. Subject to annual review by the Town Council, on
January 1, 2022 and on January 1 of each year, beginning in 2023, a 1% cost of
living adjustment ("COLA") shall be added to the previous year's rates and
charges for all customers. This 1% increase shall occur automatically each
year, subject to the Town Council's annual review in July of each year, unless
and until such time that the Town Council amends or adjusts the percentage
increase for the next calendar year or otherwise amends this division, which
may include but not be limited to an additional annual increase as determined
by the Town Council.

§ 52.72 BASIS UPON WATER USE.
   The quantity of water discharged into the sewage system and obtained from
sources other than the utility that serves the Town shall be determined by the
Town in a manner as the Town reasonably elects, and thesewage service shall be
billed at the appropriate rates set out in this chapter. The Utility Billing
Office may also make allowances in unique situations, such as but not limited
to water leaks and their subsequent documented repair.
   (A)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the Town's
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied
by the water utility serving the Town and the water used thereon or therein is
not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not acceptable
to the Town, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or
determined by the Town. In order to ascertain the rate or charge provided in
this chapter, the owner or other interested party shall, at his expense,
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the Town for the
determining of sewage discharge.
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the Town's
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water supplied by
the water utility serving the Town, and in addition, is a user of water from
another resource which is not measured by a water meter or is measured by a
meter not acceptable to the Town, then the amount of water used shall be
otherwise measured or determined by the Town. In order to ascertain the rates
or charges, the owner or other interested party shall, at his expense, install
and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and
approved method of measurement acceptable to the Town for the determination of
sewage discharge.
   (C)   In the event two (2) or more residential lots, parcels of real estate
or buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the
Town’s sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and the
quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then, for billing
purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for each user and the
base charge and the flow rates and charges shall apply to each of the number of
residential lots, parcels of real estate or buildings served through the single
water meter.
   (D)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the Town's
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess of ten
thousand (10,000) gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of
the Town that a portion of the water as measured by the water meter or meters
does not and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other
interested party shall, at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs,
volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the Town for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (E)   Where a metered water supply is used for fire protection as well as
for other uses, the Town may, at its discretion, make adjustments in the user
charge as may be equitable.
   (F)   Annual COLA increase. Subject to annual review by the Town Council, on
January 1, 2022 and on January 1 of each year, beginning in 2023, a 1% cost of
living adjustment ("COLA") shall be added to the previous year's rates and
charges for all customers. This 1% increase shall occur automatically each
year, subject to the Town Council's annual review in July of each year, unless
and until such time that the Town Council amends or adjusts the percentage
increase for the next calendar year or otherwise amends this division, which
may include but not be limited to an additional annual increase as determined
by the Town Council.

§ 52.73 ADDITIONAL CHARGES/DEPOSITS.
   (A)   Security deposits. To secure the payment of the sewer bill, the Town
shall require customers that occupy premises they do not own to pay in advance
the sum of one hundred dollars ($100) for each one inch (1") meter or smaller
and three- hundred fifty dollars ($350) for a meter larger than one inch (1").
Upon termination of sewer services by the customer, the paid security deposit
shall be refunded or credited to the customer less any outstanding water bill
due to the Town.

and collected by the Town in the manner provided by law and ordinance.
   (A)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed
monthly.
   (B)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying
the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but
that billing shall in no way relieve the owner from liability in the event
payment is not made as required in this chapter. The owners of properties
served, which are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to
examine the collection records of the Town for the purpose of determining
whether bills have been paid by the tenant or tenants; provided, that the
examination shall be made at the office at which the records are kept and
during the hours that the office is open for business. Owners of properties
occupied by tenants are liable for the charges incurred for that property, and
pursuant to state law, a sewage lien may be placed on such properties for these
charges if unpaid, whether incurred by a tenant or the owner.
   (C)   As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when due are
delinquent and a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the rates or
charges shall thereupon attach thereto.

§ 56.01 TITLE.
   (A)   These regulations shall hereafter be known and cited as the Storm
Water Utility Ordinance of the Town of Brownsburg, Indiana.
   (B)   The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and procedures
for the Brownsburg Storm Water Utility for determining impervious surface area,
establishing the Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) and multiplier for storm
water users, and for billing and collection.
   (C)   The Town intends to operate its Storm Water Utility under provisions
of I.C. 36-9-23. The Storm Water Utility will be responsible for the management
of the Brownsburg Storm Water System and will fund storm water management
activities by charging user fees to the owner/renter of each property
containing impervious surface area within the corporate limits of the Town.
   (D)   All residential properties will be charged a uniform user fee. User
fees for non-residential will be based upon the amount of impervious surface
area contained within the property. The amount of impervious surface area for
each property has been determined based upon measurements using aerial
photography, submitted construction plans and by field measurements. Public
right-of-way is exempt from the user fee.
   (E)   User fees do not relieve any property owner from compliance with the
Town of Brownsburg and/or Hendricks County ordinances and/or other applicable
state and/or federal laws/regulations.

(Ord. 2006-28, passed 11-16-06; Am. Ord. 2012-19, passed 1-10-13)
§ 56.04 STORM WATER USER FEE DETERMINATION.
   (A)   The monthly user fee is uniform for all residential properties
assigned one (1) ERU. The user fee for one (1) ERU shall be five dollars ($5).
This user fee may be changed from time to time by the Town Council by
ordinance.
   (B)   The monthly user fee for a non-residential property, combined
residential/business property (that is not zoned in a residential district
according to the Town's Zoning Ordinance), or a multi-family property with five
(5) or more units (defined as non-residential) are determined using an ERU
multiplier, which is calculated by dividing the total impervious surface area
within the property by the base ERU of twenty- nine hundred (2,900) square
feet. This method allows for the non-residential property user fees to be based
upon the amount of impervious surface area within the property as compared to
the amount of impervious surface area of the average residential property. For
example, a non-residential property with thirty thousand (30,000) square feet
of impervious surface area receives an ERU multiplier of 10.3 (30,000/2,900).
The ERU multiplier shall be rounded to one decimal place and the minimum ERU
shall be one (1). The ERU multiplier is then multiplied by the current fee for
one (1) ERU to determine the actual user fee in dollars.
   (C)   Impervious surface areas shall be measured in the field or based on
aerial footprint of impervious surfaces. Angled rooftops shall be measured as
if they were flat. All impervious surfaces within the parcel boundaries of a
property shall be measured, with the exception of those surfaces located within
a road right-of-way. For multi-unit properties, all units within a single
parcel and all impervious surfaces (such as parking lots and walkways) shall be
measured and billed to the property owner. For multi-level or multistory
structures (containing more than one (1) level), the footprint of the building
and other impervious surfaces shall be measured and billed to the property
owner.
   (D)   A reduction in the storm water user fee, or credit, based on specific
qualifying conditions defined in this chapter may be available to utility rate
payers. Utility rate payers must successfully complete any application process
required by the Town to demonstrate compliance with this section.
   (E)   Credit procedures outlined in this chapter are not intended to be all-
inclusive. Upon approval by the Storm Water Utility, storm water user fee
credits may be allowed for circumstances not described in this chapter.
   (F)   Upon written notice, the Storm Water Utility may revoke a credit for
good reason, including failure to meet credit conditions or failure to meet
minimum maintenance requirements for BMPs.
   (G)   One-time credits may be issued for services provided to the Town by a
rate payer. The rate payer shall present the proposed service to the Storm
Water Utility for review and approval. A credit amount shall be determined and
agreed upon per each service. The agreed dollar amount shall be credited on the
utility bill one time when the service is complete. One-time services may
include, but are not limited to, the following: a stream clean-up activity,
developing a storm water brochure, printing/distributing educational
information, or developing a storm water education video. If such activities or
services can be quantified and can provide a storm water quality benefit, it
may be considered for storm water user fee credits.
(Ord. 2006-28, passed 11-16-06; Am. Ord. 2012-19, passed 1-10-13)
§ 56.05 BILLING AND COLLECTION.
   (A)   For non-residential property owners, a database has been developed
consisting of the non-residential property owner's/renter's name, property
address, property's square footage of impervious surface area, user fee
multiplier and monthly user fee. The billing for non-residential property
owners is based on this database.
   (B)   Charges for storm water service shall be billed by and through the
Town utilities on the monthly utility bill and with the implementation of
related policies. The storm water user fee is billed monthly to the owner or
renter who occupies the property as of the first day of the current month.
Where the property having a delinquent account for charges for storm water
service is served by the Town’s Utility Department, said Department may, after
reasonable notice to the owner and/or customer, shut off the water service to
the property. Water service may not be restored until the delinquent account
and associated costs have been paid.
   (C)   Storm water user fees are hereby made a lien upon the applicable
corresponding lot, parcel of land, building or premises at or upon which such
fees are incurred. Storm water user fees shall be the obligation of the
property owner. In the event the utilities for any particular property is
billed to the tenants or renters of such property, the storm water user fee
shall also be the obligation of any renter occupying the property. Storm water
user fees shall be billed to the property owner if there is no renter known to
the Town or in the event the renter of the property does not pay said fees
within ninety (90) days of the due date. If the owner does not pay within one
(1) month after the owner's first receipt of the bill, the Town may take action
to collect delinquent fees. Delinquent fees may be collected in either or both
of the following ways (and also in any other way allowed by law):
      (1)   A civil action may be brought against the renter and/or property
owner.
      (2)   The fees may be recorded in the Office of the Hendricks County
Recorder and certified to the Auditor of Hendricks County, who shall place the
same on the tax duplicate of the county with the interest and penalties allowed
by law to be collected as ad valorem property taxes are collected.

§ 56.06 EDUCATION CREDITS.
   (A)   Education credits for storm water user fees.  Education credits for
storm water user fees are available to all public and private schools or school
systems in accordance with the terms and conditions of this section that are
accredited by the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE).
      (1)    Program eligibility.  In order for a school or school system to
receive an education credit, the school must teach an approved educational
program that educates and informs the students on the importance of preserving
and restoring the source and integrity of water resources (storm water, ground
water and/or surface waters). Programs must be approved by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources (IDNR), the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), IDOE, or the Brownsburg Wastewater Superintendent (or
designated representative). The program may be taught in grades kindergarten
(K) through 12. While some educational materials may be available through the
town, as determined in its discretion, the town’s total contribution of
educational materials for any one program participant shall not exceed $1,000
for any school year.
      (2)   Amount and types of credit. Prior to the adoption and effective
date of this section, the maximum credit for a school or school system may be
50% of the monthly storm water user fee for the corresponding property or
properties used for education purposes described herein, and after the adoption
and effective date of this section the maximum credit for a school or school
system may be 100% of the monthly storm water user fee for the corresponding
property or properties used for the educational purposes described herein. The
credit will be proportional to the extent to which the program was taught per
garde level. For example: if the program is completed for all grade levels in a
particular school or school corporation, the full amount will be issued (i.e. a
50% credit prior to the adoption and effective date of this section, and 100%
credit after the adoption and effective date of this section), but if only half
of the grades were taught, then only half the amount of the credit will be
issued (i.e, a 25% credit prior to the adoption and effective date of this
section, and a 50% credit after the adoption and effective date of this
section). In the event that the property is used for other activities unrelated
to the education purposes described herein, then the credit will be reduced
based on the pro-rata portion of the property that issued for educational
purposes as provided for herein in comparison to the entire property.
      (3)   Credit application process. Any public or private school or school
system that is eligible for participation in this program and who has not
participated in the program prior to the adoption and effective date of this
section, shall first need to complete an application process through the town.
Such process shall include the applicant’s submittal of written materials
determined necessary by the town to confirm program eligibility, including, but
not limited to, identifying property address(es) and parcel(s) numbers, the
type of credit and amount being requested, and confirmation of the
accreditation through the IDOE.
      (4)   Credit certification process. By July 1 each year, a qualifying
school shall certify, in writing, with the Brownsburg Superintendent (or
designated representative) the programs and grade levels that were taught in
the previous year, and the intended extent to which the programs and grade
levels will be taught during the upcoming year, and shall also include such
other information as may be requested by the town to confirm compliance with
the requirements to this section. Beginning January 1, 2015, the credit will be
based on the previous year’s certification, and the certification must occur on
or before July 1 annually for the credit to be issued for the following year. A
certification letter will be forwarded to the Brownsburg Utilities by the
Wastewater Superintendent (or designated representative) so that appropriate
billing adjustments may be made.
   (B)   Public education credit for automotive racing events. An education
credit is also available for qualifying property determined to be eligible by
the town for up to a 25% credit for the annual storm water user fees, so long
as the following conditions are met by the applicable property owner, and such
other reasonable conditions that may be adopted by the town from time to time.
      (1)   Education must be given to attendees at all events involving
automotive racing events (the “events”) held on the property, regarding storm
water issues, as reasonably requested by the town, including but not limited
to, posting and distributing storm water quality and pollution prevention
materials provided by the town; conducting a reasonable amount of litter clean-
up after such events are held, with assistance from the town as to supplies,
disposal, and the like; making a reasonable number of promotional announcements

§ 56.07 RECREATIONAL CREDITS.
   (A)   Recreational credits for automotive racing events. A recreational
credit for up to a seventy-five percent (75%) credit for the annual storm water
user fees is available for qualifying property determined to be eligible by the
Town, so long as the following conditions are met by the applicable property
owner, and such other reasonable conditions that may be adopted by the Town
from time to time:
      (1)   The ratio of the pervious vs. impervious surface on the property is
maintained at a ratio so that the impervious surface area does not exceed
thirty-five percent (35%) of the entire property;
      (2)   The primary use of the property must be for recreational-type
purposes, including automotive racing support activities, racing events and
camping activities associated therewith;
      (3)   The property must be owned by a not-for-profit organization under
applicable laws, and must have a minimum capacity to accommodate twenty-five

camping areas, trails, hiking and common areas. The property must have seventy
percent (70%) pervious area or more (30% impervious or less) as compared to the
entire parcel area. Impervious areas must flow to a pervious area where
infiltration into the ground can occur. An individual property qualifying for
this credit may not be issued more than seventy-five percent (75%) credit for
the property.
   (C)   Credits for trails or access drives.  Trails or access drives that are
surrounded by pervious areas may be eligible for user fee credits on those
properties. One hundred percent (100%) credit may be granted for parcels that
contain only trails or access drives, when a qualifying vegetated filter strip
collects runoff from the trail or access drive. The filter strip shall meet the
following criteria:
      (1)   The filtering distance of the filter strip must be at least as wide
as the trail or access drive, and requires a minimum slope of one percent (1%)
and maximum slope of five percent (5%) for the slope of the filter strip.
      (2)   The filter strip must be maintained with vegetation cover at a
density of eighty percent (80%) or greater over the soil surface, and a minimum
vegetation height of four (4) to six (6) inches. Deep rooting vegetation is
preferred to prevent eroding of the vegetation and to promote infiltration into
the ground.

§ 57.10 SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
   (A)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The
Development Services Department may, without prior notice, suspend MS4
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons,
or to the MS4 or waterways. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension
order issued in an emergency, the Town may take such steps as deemed necessary
to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waterways, or to minimize danger to
persons.
   (B)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
Town will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The
violator may petition the Town for a reconsideration and hearing. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated
pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the Town.

the Town prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
(Ord. 2016-42, passed 1-12-17; Am. Ord. 2024-05, passed 4-25-24)
§ 57.12 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (A)   Inspection and monitoring. The Town has the authority to periodically
inspect any portion of the MS4, whether publicly or privately owned, to detect
and eliminate illicit connections and discharges into the MS4. The inspection
may include dry weather screening of discharges from outfalls connected to the
MS4 to determine if prohibited flows are being conveyed into the MS4. It could
also include spot testing of waters contained in the MS4 itself to detect the
introduction of pollutants into the MS4 by means other than a defined outfall,
such as dumping or contaminated sheet runoff.
   (B)   Access to facilities and properties.
      (1)   The Town or representative thereof shall be permitted to enter and
inspect properties and facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as
often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a
discharger has security measures in place which require proper identification
and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the
necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the Town.
      (2)   Facility operators and property owners shall allow the Town ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination, and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of
an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional
duties as defined by state and federal law.

monitoring equipment, as necessary. The sampling and monitoring equipment shall
always be maintained in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger
at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality
shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to a
facility or property to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed
by the owner or operator at the written or oral request of the Town and shall
not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the owner
or operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Town access to a facility or
property is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter. A
person who is the operator of a facility commits an offense if the person
denies the Town reasonable access to the facility for the purpose of conducting
any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
      (7)   If the Town has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there
is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the
community, then the Town may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court
of competent jurisdiction.

or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at
said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent
the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4.
   (C)   These BMPs shall be incorporated into a stormwater pollution
prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of a
NPDES permit.

entities as required by state or federal regulations.
   (E)   If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall
also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three (3)
years.
   (F)   A properly reported accidental discharge shall be an affirmative
defense to a civil infraction proceeding brought under this chapter against a
discharger for such discharge. It shall not, however, be a defense to a legal
action brought to obtain an injunction, to obtain recovery of costs, or to
obtain other relief because of or arising out of the discharge. A discharge
shall be considered properly reported only if the discharger complies with all
the requirements of this section and the Indiana Spill Rule (327 IAC 2-6.1).
This requirement does not relieve discharger from notifying other entities as
required by state or federal regulations.

§ 71.98 UNIFORM SYSTEM OF CITATION.
   (A)   Pursuant to I.C. 9-21-1-3, the Town may enforce certain traffic
violations as local ordinance violations. The Traffic Code of the Town provides
for specific infractions and other violations which may be in addition to, or
separate from the Traffic Code set forth in I.C. Title 9.
   (B)   In order to provide for the efficient citation for these violations by
the police officers, a traffic citation issued by any such officer may be
enforced by the Town as an ordinance violation under this chapter if the
officer provides on the Uniform Citation Form the corresponding general traffic
code violation and otherwise indicates a Town ordinance violation enforcement.
For example, a citation for speeding shall be enforceable under this chapter if
the citation provides that the offense of speeding has occurred, giving the
actual and posted speeds and the location of the violation. A citation is valid
and enforceable under this chapter without a citation to the specific section
of this code.
   (C)   The fines and costs for such violations as established by the Town
Court from time to time in accordance with §
71.99 shall be assessed for any citation which is issued pursuant to this

Police Department, finds, on the basis of falling, snow, sleet, or freezing
rain, or on the basis of a forecast by the U.S. Weather Bureau or other weather
service of snow, sleet, or freezing rain, that weather conditions will make it

on parts of, or all, snow emergency routes as necessary by declaring it in a
manner prescribed by this chapter.

PUBLIC SAFETY RADIO BUILDING AMPLIFICATION SYSTEM
§ 150.80 PUBLIC SAFETY 800 MHZ RADIO BUILDING AMPLIFICATION SYSTEM.
   (A)   General. Except as otherwise provided, no person shall erect,
construct, change the use of or provide an addition of more than twenty-five
percent (25%) to, any multi-family, commercial, and/or industrial building or
structure or any part thereof, or cause the same to be done which fails to
support adequate radio coverage for the Hoosier SAF-T Radio Communications
System, including but not limited to firefighters and police officers.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, adequate radio coverage shall include
all of the following:
      (1)   A minimum signal strength of -95 dbm available in ninety percent
(90%) of the area of each floor of the building when transmitted from the
closest Hoosier SAF-T Radio Communications System site;
      (2)   A minimum signal strength of -95 dbm received at the closest
Hoosier SAF-T Radio Communications System site when transmitted from ninety
percent (90%) of the area of each floor of the building;
      (3)   The frequency range which must be supported shall be the current
band of frequencies used by the Hendricks County; and
      (4)   A one hundred percent (100%) reliability factor.
   (C)   When measuring the performance of a bi-directional amplifier, signal
strength measurements are based on one (1) input signal adequate to obtain a
maximum continuous operating output level.
   (D)   Amplification systems allowed.
      (1)   Buildings and structures which cannot support the required level of
radio coverage shall be equipped with any of the following in order to achieve
the required adequate radio coverage:
         (a)   A radiating cable system; or
         (b)   An internal multiple antenna system with or without FCC type
accepted bi- directional 800 MHZ amplifiers as needed.
      (2)   If any part of the installed system or systems contains an
electrically powered component, the system shall be capable of operating on an
independent battery and/or generator system for a period of at least twelve
(12) hours without external power input. The battery system shall automatically
charge in the presence of an external power input.
      (3)   If used, bi-directional amplifiers shall include filters to reduce
adjacent frequency interference. These filters shall be tuned so that they will
be thirty-five (35) dbm below the Hendricks County frequencies.
   (E)   Testing procedures.
      (1)   Acceptance test procedure. When an in-building radio system is
required, and upon completion of installation, it will be the building owner' s
responsibility to have the radio system tested to ensure that two (2)-way
coverage on each floor of the building is a minimum of ninety percent (90%).
Each floor of the building shall be divided into a grid of approximately twenty
(20) equal areas. A maximum of two (2) non-adjacent areas will be allowed to
fail the test. In the event that three (3) of the areas fail the test, in order
to be more statistically accurate, the floor may be divided into forty (40)
equal areas. A maximum of four (4) non-adjacent areas will be allowed to fail
the test. After the forty (40)-area test, if the system continues to fail, it
will be the building owner' s responsibility to have the system altered to meet
the ninety percent (90%) coverage requirement.
      (2)   The test shall be conducted using a Motorola XTS5000, or
equivalent, portable radio, talking through the Hoosier SAF-T Radio
Communications System as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. A spot
located approximately in the center of a grid area will be selected for the
test, then the radio will be keyed to verify two (2)-way communications to and
from the outside of the building through the Hoosier SAF-T Radio Communications
System. Once the spot has been selected, prospecting for a better spot within
the grid area will not be permitted.
      (3)   The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the test
measurement results shall be kept on file with the building owner so that the
measurements can be verified each year during the annual tests. In the event
that the measurement results become lost, the building owner will be required
to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values.
      (4)   As part of the installation, a spectrum analyzer or other suitable
test equipment shall be utilized to insure that spurious oscillations are not
being generated by the subject bi-directional amplifier (BDA) due to coupling
(lack of sufficient isolation) between the input and output systems. This test
will be conducted at time of installation and subsequent annual inspections.
      (5)   Annual tests. When an in-building radio system is required, it
shall be the building owner's responsibility to have all active components of
the system, such as amplifiers and power supplies and backup batteries tested
to a minimum of once every twelve (12) months. Amplifiers shall be tested to
ensure that the gain is the same as it was upon initial installation and
acceptance. Backup batteries and power supplies shall be tested under load of a
period of one (1) hour to verify that they will properly operate during an
actual power outage. If within the one (1)-hour test period, and in the opinion
of the testing technician, the battery exhibits symptoms of failure, the test
shall be extended for additional one (1)-hour periods until the integrity of
the battery can be determined. All other active components shall be checked to
determine that they are operating within the manufacturers specifications for
the intended purpose.
      (6)   Five year tests. In addition to the annual test, it shall be the
building owner's responsibility to perform a radio coverage test a minimum of
once every five (5) years to ensure that the radio system continues to meet the
requirements of the original acceptance test.
      (7)   Qualifications of testing personnel. Personnel conducting radio
system tests shall be qualified to perform the work. All tests shall be
conducted, documented and signed by a person in possession of a current FCC
license, or a current technician certification issued by the Associated Public-
Safety Communications Officials International (APCO) or the Personal
Communications Industry Association (PCIA). All test records shall be retained
on the inspected premises by the building owner and a copy submitted to the
Fire Department officials.
   (F)   Field testing. Police and Fire personnel, after providing reasonable
notice to the owner or his representative, shall have the right to enter onto
the property to conduct field testing to be certain that the required level of
radio coverage is present.
   (G)   Exemptions. This section shall not apply to buildings less than five
thousand (5,000) square feet.

§ 151.21 STANDARDS FOR STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Watercourse protection.
      (1)   Legal drains within the Town are under the jurisdiction of the
Hendricks County Drainage Board. The Indiana Drainage Act has established
seventy-five (75) foot easements to either side of legal drain tile lines and
seventy-five (75) feet from the top of the bank on each side of open legal
drains. Any stormwater discharge or work to be completed within a legal drain
easement must obtain approval from the Hendricks County Drainage Board.
      (2)   Waterways within the Town may be under the jurisdiction of the IDEM
or the ACOE.
      (3)   Work within a floodway is under the jurisdiction of the IDNR.
      (4)   Any relocation of a watercourse shall require a plan approved by
the Development Services Department, and it shall not discharge water onto
downstream adjacent property owners in any location different from its existing
location.
      (5)   Alterations shall be designed to accommodate all on- and off-site
upstream drainage areas. Design capacities shall be determined as described in
this chapter.
      (6)   Entities owning property through which a watercourse passes, or
such an entity's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse
in accordance with this chapter and all applicable state and federal statutes
and regulations. In addition, the entity or lessee shall maintain existing
privately owned structures within or adjacent to the watercourse so that such
structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity
of the watercourse. The entity or lessee shall not place or construct a
privately-owned structure or other impairment within or adjacent to the
watercourse such that is an impairment or a detriment to the flow of water
within the channel.
   (B)   Determination of stormwater runoff rates.
      (1)   Stormwater runoff rates shall be calculated in accordance with
Chapter 2 of the Hendricks County Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
Composite runoff coefficients shall be calculated and account for connected
impervious surfaces such as downspouts connected to stormwater conveyance
system; typical composite runoff coefficients shall not be used.
      (2)   Stormwater drainage systems shall be designed to accommodate the
following:
         (a)   All upstream off-site drainage.
         (b)   Existing drain tiles from upstream.
         (c)   Diffused water flow from upstream properties.
         (d)   Storm sewers from upstream.
         (e)   The drainage collection system from within the project or
property.
   (C)   Detention/retention and pond requirements.
      (1)   General requirements.
         (a)   Storage volume.
            1.   Storage volumes shall be computed using a computer model that
can generate hydrographs based on the NRCS TR-55 time of concentration and
curve number calculation methodologies.
            2.   Storm durations shall be used that maximize the peak flow for
the pre-developed condition and maximize detention storage volume for the post-
developed condition. The storm duration shall be equal to or greater than the
site time of concentration but shall not be less than thirty (30) minutes.
            3.   When determining curve numbers for post-developed conditions,
the initially determined hydrologic soil group for disturbed areas should be
changed to the next less infiltrating capacity category (i.e., A to B, B to C
and C to D).
         (b)   Detention release rates.
            1.   Detention control devices shall limit the discharge to a rate
such that the post developed release rate from the site is no greater than 0.2
cfs per acre of development for the 0-10 year return interval storms and 0.4
cfs per acre of developed area for the 11-100 year return interval storms.
            2.   The two-year (2-yr) (50% chance/year) peak runoff from the
post-developed condition shall not exceed the two-year (2-yr) (50% chance/year)
peak runoff from the pre-developed condition.
            3.   If the downstream receiving channel or pipe is inadequate to
accommodate the post-developed flow, then the release rate must be further
reduced.
            4.   The minimum allowable orifice size is four (4) inches.
            5.   For sites where the pre-developed area has more than one (1)
outlet, the release rate should be computed based on pre-developed discharge to
each outlet point. The computed release rate for each outlet point shall not be
exceeded at the respective outlet point even if the post developed condition
would involve a different arrangement of outlets.
         (c)   Runoff from upstream tributary areas (off-site areas) may be
bypassed around the facility without attenuation. If it is to be routed through
the facility, a separate outlet system or channel must accommodate those flows.
Unless the pond is being designed as a regional detention facility, the primary
outlet structure shall be sized and the invert elevation of the emergency
overflow weir determined according to the onsite runoff only. Once the size and
location of the primary outlet structure and the invert elevation of the
emergency overflow weir are determined by considering on-site runoff, the one
hundred-year (100-yr.) (1% chance/year) pond elevation is determined by routing
the entire inflow, on-site and off-site, through the pond.
         (d)   The detention facility shall be designed in such a manner that a
minimum of ninety percent (90%) of the maximum volume of water stored and
subsequently released at the design release rate shall not result in a storage
duration in excess of forty-eight (48) hours from the start of the storm unless
additional storms occur within the period. In other words, the design shall
ensure that a minimum ninety percent (90%) of the original detention capacity
is restored within forty-eight (48) hours from the start of the design one
hundred-year (100-yr.) (1% chance/ year) event.
         (e)   Refer to the Town of Brownsburg Construction Standards for
construction specifications for detention and retention ponds related to the
maximum allowable depth of water, maintenance and safety ledges, underdrains in
dry ponds and maximum side slopes of ponds.
         (f)   An emergency overflow/spillway shall be designed for the release
of exceptional storm runoff or in emergency conditions should the normal
discharge devices become totally or partially inoperative. The overflow
facility shall be of such design that its operation is automatic and does not
require manual attention. At a minimum, emergency spillways shall be capable of
handling one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the inlet peak discharge
resulting from the one hundred-year (100-yr.) (1% chance/year) storm event from
the entire contributing watershed in the post-developed condition.
         (g)   All ponds (including both dry and wet ponds, and ponds that are
not used for stormwater quality or quantity management) shall incorporate
applicable requirements included in the Town's standard detail for "Detention/
Retention Ponds."
         (h)   All detention/retention facilities (including underground
detention) shall have an upstream BMP designed in accordance with §
151.23 and installed for each inlet pipe, to collect sediments, debris,
floatables, and other material prior to entering the detention/retention
facility. Forebays are not acceptable. Position BMPs outside right- of-way and
not more than fourteen (14) feet from a concrete or paved area for vac-truck
and maintenance vehicle access.
         (i)   Underground detention facilities shall have sufficient
observation wells or inspection ports, at least ten (10) inches in diameter, to
allow access for inspection, maintenance, and regular cleaning operations in
each underground chamber.
         (j)   Designers and developers are encouraged to consider methods of
runoff reduction such as reducing impervious surface area, disconnecting
impervious areas, promoting infiltration, stormwater capture and reuse, and
other low-impact development methods to reduce requirements for on-site
stormwater detention.
         (k)   Any regulations of the State Board of Health concerning standing

      (3)   The stormwater collection system (storm sewers, open channels,
etc.) shall be assumed full at capacity) from a previous storm event at the
beginning of the flood routing analysis.
      (4)   The overflow path/ponding resulting from the flood routing event
shall be clearly shown as a hatched area on the plans. Plans shall include
cross sections along the flood route path. Cross sections shall include the

§ 151.22 STANDARDS FOR STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLANS FOR LAND
DISTURBANCES.
   (A)   Applicability and exemptions.
      (1)   The Town will require a SWPPP, which includes erosion and sediment
control measures, pollution prevention practices and materials handling
procedures, to be submitted as part of the construction plans and
specifications. Any project located within the Town that involves land
disturbance (with exception of divisions (A)(2) and (A)(3) below) shall comply
with this section. Calculation of land disturbance should follow the guidelines
contained in division (C) of this section. Land disturbance falls into one (1)
of two (2) categories with differing requirements as follows:
         (a)   Land disturbances which are one (1) or more acres shall obtain
coverage under IDEM's CSGP for construction activities and are subject to the
requirement of this section. This section also applies to disturbances of less
than one (1) acre of land that are part of a larger common plan of development
or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb one (1) or more acres
of land.
         (b)   Land disturbances which are less than one (1) acre shall submit
a SWPPP that at a minimum includes the following:
            1.   Installation and maintenance of appropriate perimeter control
measures. These measures are to be installed prior to land disturbance and
maintained until bare soils are permanently stabilized to at least seventy
percent (70%) density of permanent perennial vegetated cover. Maintain existing
vegetation when possible.
            2.   Installation of a temporary construction entrance/drive.
Minimize sediment and soil discharge and tracking from the disturbed area.
Clean-up sediment that is either tracked or washed on to roads or into
stormwater conveyances (sewers, ditches, waterways, storm inlets, and the
like). Cleaning surfaces shall not include flushing the area with water.
Cleared sediment and soil must be collected and redistributed or disposed of in
a manner that is compliant with all applicable statutes and rules.
            3.   Establish a concrete washout area to contain residual concrete
and washout waters. Water collected from washout that does not harden or
evaporate must be handled as wastewater.
            4.   Bare soils are to be stabilized in areas where work is
complete, or where bare soils are to be inactive for more than seven (7) days.
Utilize soil stabilization measures that are appropriate for the season.
            5.   Adjacent areas disturbed by an individual lot operator must be
repaired and stabilized with temporary or permanent surface stabilization.
            6.   Install inlet protection at all stormwater inlets that receive
runoff from disturbed areas. For inlets within a road or driving lane, inlet
protection must be installed below the grate with an overflow or bypass so that
ponding water does not cause unsafe driving conditions.
            7.   Where construction disturbs surfaces greater than 3H:1V slope
or in areas of concentrated flow, establish permanent vegetation with erosion
control blanket and seeding.
      (2)   The requirements under this chapter do not apply to the following
activities:
         (a)   Agricultural land-disturbing activities, including tillage,
planting, cultivation, or harvesting operations for the production of
agricultural or nursery and vegetative crops, pasture renovation and
establishment, the construction of agricultural conservation practices, and the
installation and maintenance of agricultural drainage tile.
         (b)   Silvicultural activities associated with nonpoint discharges (40
CFR 122.27).
         (c)   Stormwater discharges associated with oil and gas exploration,

         (e)   Single family residential with disturbance of less than five
hundred (500) square feet.
      (3)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control and pollution
prevention measures:
         (a)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10.
         (b)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34.
         (c)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste
pursuant to a permit issued by IDEM under 329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent
stormwater requirements, including the expansion of landfill boundaries and
construction of new cells either within or outside the original solid waste
permit boundary.
      (4)   For an individual lot where land disturbance is expected to be one
(1) acre or more, the individual lot owner must complete their own notice of
intent (NOI) letter, obtain stormwater management plan approval, and ensure
that a SWPPP is completed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter
and other relevant ordinances.
      (5)   An individual lot with land disturbance less than one (1) acre,
located within a larger permitted project site, is considered part of the
larger permitted project site, and the individual lot operator must comply with
the terms and conditions of the stormwater management plan approved for the
larger project site. The stormwater management plan for the larger project site
must include detailed erosion and sediment control measures for individual
lots. The following general requirements apply to all individual building lots,
where the individual lot operator/owner is working within a permitted project.
         (a)   All stormwater measures, including erosion and sediment control
measures, necessary to comply with this permit must be implemented in
accordance with the overall project construction plan
         (b)   Provisions for erosion and sediment control and project
management on individual building lots regulated under the overall project site
permit must ensure:
            1.   The individual lot operator (contractor/subcontractor),
whether owning the property or acting as the agent of the individual lot owner,
is responsible for erosion and sediment control requirements associated with
activities on individual lots.
            2.   Installation and maintenance of a stable construction site
access unless the site is to be accessed solely from impervious or similar non-
erosive areas.
            3.   Installation and maintenance of appropriate erosion and
sediment control measures prior to land disturbance.
            4.   Temporary stabilization is utilized on the building site, but
not required during periods when accessibility to the building site is a
necessity.
            5.   Sediment discharges and tracking from each lot is minimized
until permanent stabilization has been achieved.
            6.   Sediment that is either tracked or discharged onto internal
project site roads is removed by the end the same day. Clearing of sediment
must not include flushing the area with water, unless authorized by the
permittee of the overall project site and the sediment is directed to an
appropriate on-site sediment control measure. Cleared sediment must be
redistributed or disposed of in a manner that is compliant with all applicable
statutes and rules.
            7.   Adjacent lots disturbed by an individual lot operator are
required to be repaired and stabilized with permanent surface stabilization.
            8.   Construction and domestic waste must be managed to prevent the
discharge of pollutants and windblown debris. When disposed of in waste
containers (trash receptacles) the receptacle must be covered when not in use
and at the end of the day. Waste that is not disposed of in trash receptacles
must be removed at the end of the day from the site and disposed of properly.
            9.   Demolition waste must be managed to prevent windblown debris
and to protect water quality.
            10.   Concrete washout areas provided by the permittee of the
overall project site are utilized unless a leak-proof containment system is
operated on the building lot, or special arrangements are made to properly
dispose of the wash water. Concrete washout systems on individual lots must be
properly installed and maintained. Wash water must be disposed of by the
individual lot operator and is not allowed to discharge.
         (c)   For an individual residential lot to be considered stabilized
according to the criteria in §
151.28, the individual lot operator must:
            1.   Complete final stabilization taking into account weather and
season;
            2.   Initiate permanent seeding with appropriately crimped or
tackified mulch cover, erosion control blanket, sod; or
            3.   Install appropriate and/or ensure functional erosion and
sediment control measures are in place on the individual lot. Upon issuance of
the certificate of occupancy and concurrence of the homeowner, the homeowner is
responsible to maintain the sediment control measures until final stabilization
has occurred.
      (6)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to obtain
stormwater management plan approval and ensure that a sufficient construction
plan is completed and submitted to the Town in accordance with the requirements
of this section and other relevant ordinances. It will be the responsibility of
the project site owner to ensure compliance with this section during the
construction activity and implementation of the construction plan, and to
notify the Town with a sufficient NOT letter upon completion of the project and
stabilization of the site. However, all persons engaging in construction and
land disturbing activities must comply with the requirements of this section.
      (7)   For land disturbing projects owned or operated by the Town,
construction plans must be submitted to the Development Services Department and
County SWCD for review and approval.
   (B)   Policy on stormwater pollution prevention. Effective stormwater
pollution prevention on construction sites is dependent on a combination of
preventing movement of soil from its original position (erosion control),
intercepting displaced soil prior to entering a waterbody (sediment control),
and proper on-site materials handling and pollution prevention practices. The
developer must submit to the Town a SWPPP with detailed erosion and sediment
control plans as well as a narrative describing materials handling and storage,
and construction sequencing. The following principles apply to all land-
disturbing activities and should be considered in the preparation of a
stormwater pollution prevention plan within the Town.
      (1)   Minimize the potential for erosion by designing a development that
fits the topography and soils of the site. Deep cuts and fills in areas with
steep slopes should be avoided whenever possible, and natural contours should
be followed as closely as possible.
      (2)   Existing natural buffers that are adjacent to waters of the state
to promote infiltration and provide protection of the water resource shall be
preserved, unless infeasible. Activities performed by a county drainage board
under I.C. 36-9-27 are excluded.
      (3)   Natural buffers must be preserved, including the entire buffer
bordering and/or surrounding the water resource. Buffers:
         (a)   Fifty (50) feet or more in width must be preserved to a minimum
of fifty (50) feet.
         (b)   Less than fifty (50) feet in width must be preserved in their
entirety.
         (c)   May be enhanced with vegetation that is native and promotes
ecological improvement and sustainability.
         (d)   Runoff directed to the natural buffer must be:
            1.   Treated with appropriate erosion and sediment control measures
prior to discharging to the buffer.
            2.   Managed with appropriate runoff control measures to prevent
erosion from occurring within the buffer area.
         (e)   Further information regarding buffer requirements is contained
in IDEM's "Implementation of Buffers" guidance document.
      (4)   Unvegetated or vegetated areas with less than seventy percent (70%)
cover that are scheduled or likely to be left inactive for seven (7) days or
more must be temporarily or permanently stabilized with measures appropriate
for the season to reduce erosion potential. Alternative measures to site
stabilization may be acceptable if the project site owner or their
representative can demonstrate they have implemented and maintained erosion and
sediment control measures adequate to prevent sediment discharge from the
inactive area. Vegetated areas with a density of less than seventy percent
(70%) shall be restabilized using appropriate methods to minimize the erosion
potential.
      (5)   All practices on a site should be conducted in a logical sequence
so that the smallest practical area of land will be exposed for the shortest
practical period during land disturbing activities.
      (6)   The length and steepness of designed slopes should be minimized to
reduce erosion potential. Drainage channels and swales must be designed and
adequately protected so that their final gradients and resultant velocities
will not cause erosion in the receiving channel or at the outlet. Guidance for
determining acceptable velocities and energy dissipation is provided in HEC-14.
      (7)   Sediment basins, where feasible, must withdraw water from the
surface of the water column.
      (8)   Basin slopes must be stabilized upon achieving design grades to
eliminate sediment inflow from the measure itself.
      (9)   The outfall of a basin must be stabilized and non-erosive within
twenty-four (24) hours of installation of the basin outlet.
      (10)   Pipe outlets discharging from the project site must be provided
with temporary or permanent energy dissipation within twenty-four (24) hours of
discharging runoff.
      (11)   Sediment-laden water which otherwise would flow from the project
site shall be treated by erosion and sediment control measures appropriate to
minimize sedimentation.
      (12)   A stable construction site access shall be provided at all points
of construction traffic ingress and egress to the project site.
      (13)   Stormwater runoff leaving a project site must be discharged in a
manner that is consistent with applicable state or federal law.
      (14)   Appropriate measures shall be implemented to prevent wastes or
unused building materials, including garbage, debris, packaging material, fuels
and petroleum products, hazardous materials or wastes, cleaning wastes,
wastewater, concrete truck washout, port-a-let waste, and other substances from
being carried from a project site by runoff or wind. Identification of areas
where concrete truck washout is permissible must be clearly posted at
appropriate areas of the site. Wastes and unused building materials shall be
managed and disposed of in accordance with all applicable state statutes and
regulations. Proper storage and handling of materials such as fuels or
hazardous wastes, and spill prevention and cleanup measures shall be
implemented to minimize the potential for pollutants to contaminate surface or
groundwater or degrade soil quality.
      (15)   Public or private roadways shall be kept cleared of accumulated
sediment that is a result of runoff or tracking. Bulk clearing of accumulated
sediment shall not include flushing the area with water. Cleared sediment shall
be redistributed or disposed of in a manner that is in accordance with all
applicable statutes and regulations.
      (16)   Natural features, including wetlands and sinkholes, shall be
protected from pollutants associated with stormwater runoff.
      (17)   Ground water from the dewatering of excavations, trenches,
foundations, etc. must not be discharged when:
         (a)   Sediment and ground water is not first directed to an
appropriate stormwater quality measure or a series of control measures that
minimize the discharge of the sediment.
         (b)   A visible sheen and/or pollutants are present at a level that
requires additional treatment and/or an individual permit from IDEM.
      (18)   Fertilizer applications associated with the stabilization plan for
the project must meet the following requirements:
         (a)   Apply fertilizer at a rate and amount as determined by a soil
analysis or in accordance with the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual or similar
guidance documents.
         (b)   Apply fertilizer at an appropriate time of year for the project
location, taking into consideration proximity to a waterbody, and preferably
timed to coincide with the period of maximum vegetative uptake and growth.
         (c)   Avoid applying fertilizer before rainfall events that could
result in the discharge of nutrients.
      (19)   Soil compaction is to be minimized, especially in areas where
permanent vegetation will be re-established and/or areas that are designated to
infiltrate stormwater for the post-construction phase.
      (20)   Topsoil is to be preserved, unless infeasible.
      (21)   Generation of dust shall be minimized through dust suppression
techniques to prevent deposition into waters of the state.
      (22)   The use of anionic polymers (cationic polymers are not authorized
for use) on the project site are authorized for sediment control provided their
use is in conformance with current State of Indiana standards and
specifications. The use of the polymers requires notification to IDEM and the
Town.
      (23)   Required postings.
         (a)   The project site owner shall post a notice near the main
entrance of the project site. For linear projects sites, such as a pipeline or
highway, the notice must be placed in a publicly accessible location near the
project field office. The notice must be maintained in a legible condition and
contain the following information:
            1.   Copy of the completed IDEM NOI and the CSGP number issued by
IDEM, where applicable.
            2.   Name, company name, telephone number, e-mail address (if
available), and address of the project site owner or a local contact person.
            3.   Location of the construction plan.
         (b)   This permit and posting of the notice does not provide the
public with any right to trespass on a project site for any reason, nor does it
require that the project site owner allow members of the public access to the
project site.
      (24)   All stormwater quality measures must be designed and installed
under the guidance of a trained individual (refer to definitions section or
according to the requirements of the CSGP).
      (25)   Certified professionals shall be utilized for activities
associated with the development and design of the SWPPP, stormwater measure
implementation, and stormwater project management.
      (26)   Personnel associated with the project must be informed of the
terms and conditions of this permit and the requirements within the SWPPP. The
permittee is required to document this process. Information must be provided
through training, preconstruction meetings, written notification, contracts, or
other means that effectively communicates the provisions and requirements of
the permit and SWPPP. Personnel include, but are not limited to:
         (a)   General contractors, construction management firms, grading or
excavating contractors, trade industry representatives (i.e., concrete
industry), and utility contractors associated with the overall project.
         (b)   Contractors or individual lot operators that have primary
oversight on individual building lots.
         (c)   Those responsible for the implementation of the SWPPP, and the
installation, repair, and maintenance of stormwater measures.
         (d)   Those responsible for the application and storage of treatment
chemicals.
         (e)   Those responsible for administering inspections.
   (C)   Calculations and design standards and specifications.
      (1)   In calculating the total area of land disturbance, for the purposes
of determining applicability of this section to the project, the following
guidelines should be used:
         (a)   Off-site construction activities that provide services (for
example, road extensions, sewer, water, and other utilities) to a land
disturbing project site, must be considered as a part of the total land
disturbance calculation for the project site, when the activity is under the
control of the project site owner.
         (b)   Strip developments will be considered as one (1) project site
and must comply with this chapter unless the total combined disturbance on all
individual lots is less than one (1) acre and is not part of a larger common
plan of development or sale.
         (c)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by this
chapter, the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the total
area of land disturbance for improvements, such as, roads, utilities, or common
areas, and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as determined
by the following:
            1.   A single-family residential project site where the lot(s) is
one-half (0.5) acre or more in total size, as one-half (0.5) acre of land
disturbance.
            2.   A single-family residential project site where the lot(s) is
less than one-half (0.5) acre in size, as the actual lot size.
            3.   All other types of project sites, such as industrial and
commercial project sites, as a minimum of one (1) acre for all lots regardless
of size.
      (2)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement
of all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction sites shall
meet the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the Indiana
Stormwater Quality Manual and the Town of Brownsburg Construction Standards.
   (D)   Submittal requirements. For those projects meeting the requirements of
this section, a construction stormwater pollution prevention plan is required
in addition to the submittal requirements listed in §
151.20. This plan must include the following information:
      (1)   IDEM NOI form along with the information required by the NOI form.
      (2)   Proof of publication in a newspaper of general circulation, in the
affected area, that notified the public that a construction activity is to

§ 151.23 STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   Applicability and exemptions.
      (1)   The stormwater application must include post-construction
stormwater quality measures. These measures are incorporated as a permanent
feature into the site plan and are left in place following completion of
construction activities to continuously treat stormwater runoff from the
stabilized site. Any project located within the Town that includes clearing,
grading, excavation, and other land disturbing activities, resulting in the
disturbance of one (1) acre or more of total land area, is subject to the
requirements of this section. This includes land disturbances of less than one
(1) acre of land that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale
if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb one (1) or more acres of
land.
      (2)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the following
activities:
         (a)   Land-disturbing activities where there will be no additional
impervious surfaces associated with the final completed project, including but
not limited to, ditch construction/reconstruction and utility installation/
maintenance activities.
         (b)   Single-family residential strip development offered for sale or
lease without land improvements and the project is not part of a larger common
plan of development or sale.
         (c)   Residential developments consisting of four (4) or fewer lots
where the proposed impervious surfaces are ten percent (10%) or less of the
project acreage. Impervious is determined by the sum of all infrastructure
(roads, paths, parking, etc.) and the average projects hard surfaces associated
with all building lots within the project.
         (d)   Single-family residential strip development offered for sale or
lease without land improvements, and the project is not part of a larger common
plan of development or sale.
      (3)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure
proper construction and installation of all stormwater BMPs in compliance with
this chapter and with the approved stormwater management plan, and to notify
the Town with a sufficient NOT letter upon completion of the project and
stabilization of the site. However, all eventual property owners of stormwater
quality facilities meeting the applicability requirements must comply with the
requirements of this chapter and this section.
   (B)   Policy on stormwater quality management.
      (1)   BMPs must be implemented for the management of total suspended
solids (TSS) including floatables. BMP systems or treatment trains shall have
at least one (1) component of the system providing floatable control. Position
BMPs outside right-of-way and not more than fourteen (14) feet from a concrete
or paved area for vac-truck and maintenance vehicle access.
      (2)   The project site owner must submit to the Town a SWPPP that would
show placement of appropriate BMPs designed, constructed, and maintained.
      (3)   For ease of maintenance and to reduce the frequency of pond
dredging, all detention/retention facilities (including underground detention)
shall have an upstream BMP installed for each inlet pipe, to collect sediments,
debris, floatables, and other material prior to entering the detention/
retention facility. Forebays are not acceptable.
      (4)   Fueling areas must install appropriate practices to reduce lead,
copper, zinc, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in stormwater runoff. These
requirements will apply to all new facilities and existing facilities that
replace their fuel tanks.
      (5)   Infiltration practices will not be allowed in wellhead protection
areas. Discharges will not be allowed directly into sinkholes or fractured
bedrock, without treatment that results in the discharge meeting Indiana
groundwater quality standards as referenced in 327 IAC 2-11.
      (6)   Any stormwater practice that is a Class V injection well must
ensure that the discharge from such practices meets Indiana groundwater quality
standards as referenced in 327 IAC 2-11.
   (C)   Calculations and design standards and specifications.
      (1)   Calculation of land disturbance should follow the guidelines
contained in §
151.22(C).
      (2)   The target TSS removal rate is eighty percent (80%). For the
purposes of this requirement, TSS is defined as particles smaller than one
hundred twenty-five (125) microns in diameter.
      (3)   There are two (2) methods for calculating the required size of a
BMP. The first method calculates the water quality volume to be treated, which
applies to detention-based BMPs. The second method calculates the water quality
peak flow rate to be treated, which applies to filtration processes and
mechanical-type BMPs such as hydrodynamic devices.
      (4)   The appropriate stormwater quality volume (WQv) and/or stormwater
quality flow rate (Qwq) generated from a qualifying site shall be adequately
treated before discharge. Traditional structural BMPs are presumed to comply
with the eighty percent (80%) TSS removal rate if BMPs are:
         (a)   Sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume or flow
rate, as applicable;
         (b)   Designed according to the specific performance criteria outlined
in Appendix D of the Hendricks County Stormwater Technical Standard Manual or
the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual;
         (c)   Constructed properly; and
         (d)   Maintained regularly.
      (5)   Mechanical-type BMPs must be approved by the Town and meet ASTM
standard methods for verifying performance and must be certified by a
professional engineer. The BMP must meet the eighty percent (80%) TSS removal
rate and floatable control without resuspension of particles at the design
water quality flow rate resulting from a one inch (1-inch) rainfall depth.
Testing of the TSS removal rate must be conducted by an independent testing
facility rather than by the manufacturer.
      (6)   Water quality volume (WQv) - The WQv is the storage needed to
capture and treat the runoff from the first one inch (1-inch) of rainfall. A
twenty-four (24) to forty (40) hour emptying time must be used for the release
of the WQv, with no more than fifty percent (50%) of the water quality volume
being released in the first twelve (12) hours. The WQv is equivalent to one
inch (1-inch) of rainfall multiplied by the volumetric runoff coefficient (Rv)
and the site area. The volume of runoff is directly related to the amount of
impervious cover at the site and is calculated using the following equation.
 
WQv =    PRVA  
       12
 
where:
WQv = water quality volume (acre-feet, ac-ft)
P = rainfall depth (inches, in) = 1 inch
Rv = volumetric runoff coefficient — see the following equation
A = site area (acres)
 
Rv = 0.05 + 0.009 I
 
where:
Rv = volumetric runoff coefficient
I =percentage of impervious cover (%)
      (7)   Water quality flow rate (Qwq) - The Qwq is needed to size BMP
devices designed to treat runoff at a peak design flow rate through the system.
The rational method in conjunction with a rainfall intensity will be used to
calculate the Qwq in cfs. This method relies on an intensity that is one-half
(0.5) of the two-year (2-yr) (50% chance/year) storm intensity from the
intensity-duration-frequency curve along with the percent of impervious cover
to identify the appropriate runoff coefficient for the proposed land use.
Step 1 – Using the percent of impervious cover, calculate the corresponding
runoff coefficient for land use using the following equation:
 
C = 0.858 ic3 - 0.78 ic2 + 0.774 ic + 0.04
 
where:
C = Runoff Coefficient for Land Use
ic = Percent of Impervious Cover (%/100)
Step 2 – Calculate the site time of concentration in minutes (Tc) and area in
acres (A).
Step 3 – Using the time of concentration (Tc), define the peak intensity (in
inches/hour) of the two-year (2-yr.) (50% chance/year) storm event utilizing
the intensity-duration-frequency curve (shown in table form) from the NOAA
Point Precipitation Frequency Estimates which can be found at https:/
/_hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/pfds/pfds_map_cont.html?bkmrk=in. Interpolation may be
necessary for times of concentration between given values.
Step 4 – To meet the design specification, divide the intensity determined in
Step 3 by two (2) to identify one-half (0.5) of the two-year (2-yr) (50%
chance/year) storm intensity.
Step 5 – Use the Rational Method equation shown utilizing the previously
calculated values to calculate Qwq.
 
Qwq = C x p x A
 
where:
Qwq = Water Quality Flow Rate (cfs)
C = Runoff Coefficient for Land Use
p = one-half (0.5) of the two-year (2-yr) (50% chance/year) storm intensity
(inches/hour)
A = Area (acres)
   (D)   Easement requirements. All stormwater quality management systems,
including detention or retention basins, filter strips, pocket wetlands, in-
line filters, infiltration systems, conveyance systems, structures and
appurtenances are to be located outside of the right-of-way and shall be
incorporated into permanent easements as listed in §
151.21(J).
   (E)   Submittal requirements. A post-construction stormwater pollution
prevention plan is required in addition to the submittal requirements listed in
§
151.20. This plan must include the following information:
      (1)   A description of potential pollutant generating sources and a list
of pollutants from the proposed land use that may reasonably be expected to
contribute pollutants to stormwater discharges.
      (2)   A description of stormwater quality and stormwater management
measures that will be installed to address post-construction sources that are
expected to generate pollutants in stormwater discharges after construction
activities have been completed. The measures selected should achieve, at a
minimum, the following objectives:
         (a)   Stormwater quality measures that target pollutants of concern
and are designed to remove or minimize pollutants from stormwater runoff that
is associated with the final land use.
         (b)   Stormwater quality measures that will be implemented to prevent
or minimize adverse impacts to aquatic resources including, but not limited to,
wetlands, streams, karst features, and riparian habitats.
         (c)   Stormwater management measures that will address the potential
impacts of increased runoff from the project. Measures must be designed and
approved according to this permit or where applicable local requirements and
drainage ordinances. A certified professional must approve that the design
meets the applicable requirement(s).
         (d)   Measures, including structural and those based on low impact
development principles, selected to address the pollutant(s) of concern,
reduction of peak flows, and ability to infiltrate.
         (e)   Protective measures that will be implemented during active
construction when the type of post-construction measure(s) planned are
susceptible to pollutants, specifically sediment that may be generated during
land-disturbing activities.
         (f)   Measures that will prevent or minimize adverse impacts to stream
and riparian habitat.
      (3)   The location, dimensions, detailed specifications, and construction
details of all post-construction stormwater quality and stormwater management
measures.
      (4)   A sequence describing when each post-construction stormwater
measure will be installed in relation to project construction.
      (5)   An O&M manual shall be provided in accordance with §
151.29. This O&M manual must be signed and provided to future parties who will
assume responsibility for the operation and long-term maintenance of the post-
construction stormwater measures.
      (6)   Calculations demonstrating the required water quality treatment
volume or water quality treatment rate for post-construction stormwater quality
measures.

be collected in the same manner as delinquent property taxes.
   (C)   Expenses. The Town may recover all remediation costs, legal fees,
consultant fees, monitoring costs, construction costs, collection fees and any
other costs borne by the Town related to the violation.
   (D)   Remedies not exclusive. The remedies listed in this chapter are not
exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state,
or local law and it is within the discretion of the Town to seek cumulative
remedies.
   (E)   Transfer of ownership. No owner of any lands upon which a penalty or
cost of abatement has been assessed shall sell, transfer, mortgage, lease, or
otherwise dispose of to another until the amount has been paid, or until such
owner first furnishes to the Town a signed and notarized statement from the
grantee, transferee, mortgagee, or lessee, acknowledging and fully accepting
the responsibility of payment.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS  OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND METHODS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-1-4-11 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Town Council of the Town of Brownsburg does hereby adopt the following
floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 6-9-22)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The flood hazard areas of the Town are subject to periodic inundation which
results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. Additionally, structures
that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of
such damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these
regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 6-9-22)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located
in floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
area;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 6-9-22)
§ 152.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 6-9-22)
§ 152.05 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them meaning they have in common
usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A structure with a floor area of four hundred (400)
square feet or less that is on the same parcel of property as a principal
structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal
structure; an ACCESSORY STRUCTURE specifically excludes structures used for
human habitation.
      (1)   ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are considered walled and roofed where the

grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing

grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FILL. For floodplain management purposes, any material deposited or placed
which has the effect of raising the level of the ground surface above the
natural grade elevation. FILL MATERIAL includes but is not limited to
consolidated material such as concrete and brick and unconsolidated material
such as soil, sand, gravel, and stone.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. 
      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from:
         (a)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
         (b)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
         (c)   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by
flooding and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of
normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and
deposited along the path of the current.
      (2)   FLOOD OR FLOODING also includes the collapse or subsidence of land
along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion or
undermining caused by waves or current of water exceeding anticipated cyclical
levels that result in a flood as defined above.
   FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Areas subject to the one percent (1%) annual chance
flood. (See SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.)
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available
digitally is called a digital flood insurance rate map (DFIRM).
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM and
the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOODPLAIN.)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The BFE plus two (2) feet at any given
location in the SFHA. (See FREEBOARD.)
   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by water from any source. (See FLOOD.)
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. Zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances
(such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control
ordinance), and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. The term describes such state or local regulations in any
combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage
prevention and reduction.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulative increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE or FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the floodplain lying outside the
floodway.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   HARDSHIP (as related to variances of this chapter). The exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Town
Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the  variance is exceptional, unusual,
and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship
alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical
handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise
cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems
can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by (a)
an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of Interior, or (b)
directly by the Secretary of Interior in states without approved programs.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. Analyses performed by a
professional engineer licensed by the State of Indiana, in accordance with
standard engineering practices that are accepted by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and FEMA, used to determine the base flood, other frequency
floods, flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries, and flood
profiles.
   INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL- EVALUATION SERVICE (ICC-ES) REPORT. A document
that presents the findings, conclusions, and recommendations from a particular
evaluation. ICC-ES REPORTS provide information about what code requirements or
acceptance criteria were used to evaluate a product, and how the product should
be identified, installed.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six- (6-
) month adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain
management regulations during this six- (6-) month period unless the community
has previously incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). FEMA’s comment on a
proposed project that would, upon construction, result in modification of the
SFHA through the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
      (2)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (CLOMR-F). A
letter from FEMA stating that a proposed structure that will be elevated by
fill would not be inundated by the base flood.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a building or of land is not
located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A
LOMA is only  issued by FEMA.
      (4)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT OUT AS SHOWN (LOMA-OAS). An official
determination by FEMA that states the property or building is correctly shown
outside the SFHA as shown on an effective NFIP map. Therefore, the mandatory
flood insurance requirement does not apply. An out-as-shown determination does
not require elevations.
      (5)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (6)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). FEMA’s modification
of the SFHA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill outside the
existing regulatory floodway.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.
   LOWEST FLOOR. For floodplain management purposes, the lowest elevation
described among the following:

      (4)   The first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or pillars.
      (5)   The floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement, below an
elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any resistance to
the flow of floodwaters. Designs for meeting the flood opening requirement must
either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet
or exceed the following criteria:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
         (b)   At least two (2) openings are designed and maintained for the
entry and exit of floodwater; and these openings provide a total net area of at
least one (1) square inch for every one (1) square foot of enclosed area. The
bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above the
exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath each opening,
whichever is higher. Doorways and windows do not qualify as openings.
      (6)   The first floor of a building elevated on pilings or columns in a
coastal high hazard area (as that term is defined in 44 CFR 59.1), as long as
it meets the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a recreational vehicle.

land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of MITIGATION
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.
   NATURAL GRADE. For floodplain management purposes, the elevation of the
undisturbed natural surface of the ground. Fill placed prior to the date of the
initial identification of the flood hazard on a FEMA map is also considered
NATURAL GRADE.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. For floodplain management purposes means any structure for
which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulations adopted by a community and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88). As adopted in 1993 is a
vertical control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations
within the floodplain.
   OBSTRUCTION. Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization,
bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a one percent (1%)
chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. See REGULATORY FLOOD.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community’s FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1% (one percent) annual chance) flood
elevations, floodplain boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and
planimetric features. These changes typically occur as a result of structural
works or improvements, annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas,
or correction to base flood elevations or SFHAs.
   PREFABRICATED BUILDING. A building that is manufactured and constructed
using prefabrication. It consists of factory-made components or units that are
transported and assembled on-site to form the complete building.

equaled or exceeded in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure
that is acceptable to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood
elevation at any location is as defined in §
152.07. The REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the term BASE FLOOD, ONE-PERCENT
ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD, and 100-YEAR FLOOD.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten- (10-) year period for which the cost of
repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or
exceeded twenty-five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   RIVERINE. Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, and the like.
   SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITY. Any facility involved in the storage or
disposal of non-liquid, non-soluble materials ranging from municipal garbage to

   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA), synonymous with AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD
HAZARD and FLOODPLAIN. Those lands within the jurisdiction of the Town subject
to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year. SPECIAL
FLOOD HAZARD AREAS are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on
Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-
30, A99. The SFHA includes areas that are flood prone and designated from other
federal, state or local sources of data including but not limited to best
available flood layer maps provided by or approved by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources, historical flood information reflecting high water marks,
previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a
watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab
or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any
work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on
a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank, which is principally above ground. The term includes a manufactured home,
as well as a prefabricated building. It also includes recreational vehicles

damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures that have
incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair
work performed. The term does not include improvements of structures to correct
existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
requirements.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter consistent
with the variance conditions herein.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter.
   WALLED AND ROOFED. A building that has two (2) or more exterior rigid walls
and a fully secured roof and is affixed to a permanent site.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.06 LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard (SFHAs) within
the jurisdiction of the Town as identified in § 152.07, including any
additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the Town.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 6-9-22)
§ 152.07 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (A)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the Town, delineated as an AE Zone on
the Hendricks County, Indiana and incorporated areas flood insurance rate map
dated September 25, 2009 shall be determined from the one percent (1%) annual
chance flood profiles in the flood insurance study of Hendricks County, Indiana
and incorporated areas and the corresponding flood insurance rate maps (FIRM)
dated September 25, 2009 as well as any subsequent updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date. Should the floodway limits not be delineated on the flood
insurance rate map for a studied SFHA designated as an AE Zone, the limits of
the floodway will be according to the best available flood layer as provided by
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
   (B)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each
of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the Town, delineated as an A Zone on
the Hendricks County, Indiana and incorporated areas flood insurance rate map,
dated September 25, 2009, as well as any subsequent updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best available flood layer provided by
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage
area from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available flood layer data, the party needs to replace
existing data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and subsequently approved.
   (C)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification
on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of
any watercourse in the community’s known flood prone areas shall be according
to the best available flood layer as provided by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is
greater than one square mile.
   (D)   Upon issuance of a letter of final determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 6-9-22)
§ 152.08 ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   A floodplain development permit shall be required in conformance with the
provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development
activities in areas of special flood hazard.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 6-9-22)
§ 152.09 COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or
structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of
this chapter and other applicable regulations.
   (B)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the most conservative
(highest) base flood elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed
structure; or for other developments, affecting any part of the area of the
development.
   (C)   No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without
full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 6-9-22)
§ 152.10 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions
shall prevail.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 6-9-22)
§ 152.11 DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND ELEVATIONS.
   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) with base flood elevations provided (riverine or lacustrine Zone AE) on
the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the
profiles or table of still water elevations shall govern.
   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
   (C)   If the natural grade elevation of the site in question is at or above
the base flood elevation and a LOMA or LOMR-FW is obtained, the floodplain
regulations will not be applied provided the LOMA or LOMR-FW is not
subsequently superseded or invalidated.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 6-9-22)
§ 152.12 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall
be:
   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 6-9-22)
§ 152.13 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this chapter does not create any
liability on the part of the Town, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
this chapter, or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 6-9-22)
§ 152.14 PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit in the SFHA or failure to
comply with the requirements of a floodplain development permit or conditions
of a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter. All violations
shall be considered a common nuisance and be treated as such in accordance with
the provisions of the Zoning Code for Town. All violations shall be punishable
by a fine not exceeding two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500).
   (A)   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the violation
continues to exist.
   (B)   The Town Floodplain Administrator shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the Town from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

§ 152.29 MAP MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.
   To meet NFIP minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved
by FEMA, and to ensure that the Town flood maps, studies and other data
identified in §
152.07 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
   (A)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
      (1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six (6) months of the date
such information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         (a)   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         (b)   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;

injury of others;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (6)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (7)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (8)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (9)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters at the site; and
      (10)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance.
   (E)   Variances from the provisions of this chapter shall only be granted
when the board can make positive findings of fact based on evidence submitted
at the hearing for the following:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship as defined in §
152.05.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
   (F)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §§
152.40(A),
152.40(C)(1) or
152.40(D) of this chapter may be granted.
   (G)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §§
152.40(A),
152.40(C)(1) or
152.40(D) will require a permit from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources. Variances shall not be issued within any designated regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
   (H)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §§
152.40 through
152.44 may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one- (1-) half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
   (I)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and
the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of
the structure.
   (J)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use.
   (K)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (L)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
   (M)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (N)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request.
(Ord. 2022-11, passed 6-9-22)
PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD  HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 152.40 FLOODPLAIN STATUS STANDARDS.
   (A)   Floodways (riverine). Located within SFHAs, established in §
152.07 , are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. Under the provisions of the
Flood Control Act (IC 14-28-1) a permit for construction in a floodway from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a
local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction
activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities
such as filling, grading, clearing and paving undertaken before the actual
start of construction of the structure. General licenses and exemptions to the
requirements of the Flood Control Act (IC 14-28-1 and 312 IAC 10) may apply to
qualified additions/improvements to existing lawful residential structures,
rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland restoration, utility line crossings,
outfall projects, creek rock removal, and prospecting.
      (1)   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in §
152.07, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources and apply for approval for construction in a
floodway, provided the activity does not qualify for a general license or
exemption (IC 14-28-1 or 312 IAC 10).
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. The floodplain
development permit shall meet the provisions contained in this subchapter.
      (3)   The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than
an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to qualify for
a general license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site/
project. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
      (4)   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development shall cause
no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge
without first obtaining a conditional letter of map revision and meeting
requirements of §
152.29(A). A conditional letter of map revision cannot be issued for
development that would cause an increase in flood levels affecting a structure
and such development should not be permitted.
      (5)   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet identified on the
effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity
of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation
of the regulatory flood of at least fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as
determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project
condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with
hydraulic analyses.
      (6)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the Town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR § 65. 12.
   (B)   Fringe (riverine). If the site is in the fringe (either identified on
the FIRM or identified by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources through
detailed or approximate studies and not identified on a FIRM), the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in this subchapter have been met.
   (C)   SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/
fringes (riverine).
      (1)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the one percent (1%) annual chance flood elevation and the recommended Flood
Protection Grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be
issued, provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
      (2)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one (1) square
mile:
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and one percent (1%) annual chance flood elevation for
the site.
         (b)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this
subchapter have been met.
   (D)   SFHAs not identified on a map.
      (1)   If a proposed development site is near a waterway with no SFHA
identified on a map, the Floodplain Administrator shall verify the drainage
area upstream of the site. If the drainage area upstream of the site is
verified as being greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the one percent (1%) annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood
protection grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper written
approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain analysis/
regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be issued,
provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not less
restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and the provisions contained in this subchapter have been met.
