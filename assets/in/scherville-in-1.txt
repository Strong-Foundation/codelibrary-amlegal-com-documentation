authorized Town business.
   d.   Use of Public Property. No official or employee shall use, or induce,
order, or allow other persons to use, Town funds or property for a purpose
which is for private benefit unless the property is available to the general
public on equal terms, or unless the use is in accordance with other Town

   e.   Assistance. No official or employee shall assist any person in any
transaction with the Town when such assistance is or would reasonably appear to

entity, or represents at least fifty percent (50%) of the property or business
that is the subject of a petition.
      2.   No official or employee shall participate or represent another
person or entity in the procurement of any contract or purchase by the Town if
such contract or purchase involves the official or employee, a member of said
official or employee’s family, or other entity in which the official or
employee has a financial interest.
      3.   No official or employee, either on that person’s behalf or on behalf
of any other person, shall have any financial or personal interest in any
business or transaction with the Town Council, as well as any Board,
Commission, Committee or other Town public body unless that official or
employee makes full public disclosure of the nature and extent of such
interest, and if required, disqualifies himself or herself from participating
in and acting upon the business or transaction.
      4.   No official, in his or her public capacity, shall vote on any issue/
matter or participate in any discussion if the matter has a potential financial
benefit to the official, his or her immediate family members or their business.
In the event that an official is required to abstain from voting on a
particular issue, the official or employee shall announce the abstention and
the reason for the abstention, or that a filed disclosure form provides the
reason for the abstention, prior to discussion and voting on the particular

(Ord. No. 1726, § 2, 1-17-08; Ord. No. 1750, § 2, 2-29-09)
Sec. 1-22 Acceptance of Gifts/Gratuities, Meals, Entertainment, and Campaign
Contributions.
   a.   Gifts/Gratuities.
      1.   No official or employee shall solicit personal gift(s) from any
entity with which the Town does business unless the gift of donation is for a
charitable or non-profit agency. Unsolicited gifts may be accepted and kept by
an official or employee if the gift is in the amount of fifty dollars )$50.00)
or less. All gifts with an estimated monetary value of more than fifty dollars
($50.00) are given to the Town of Schererville and must remain Town property.
All gifts received are reportable, and are to be recorded in the Office of the
Town Clerk-Treasurer noting a description of the gift, donor of the gift, date
of the giving of the gift, and location/use of the gift. This record shall be
open to public inspection.
      2.   The acceptance of items of a general advertising nature (i.e., the
item must be clearly marked with company advertising logos) are acceptable. Any
general advertising item having an estimated retail value of fifty dollars
($50.00) or more must be reported to the Office of the Town Clerk-Treasurer
which will maintain a record of the description of the item, donor of the gift,
and the date of the giving of the gift. This record shall be open to public
inspection.
   b.   Meals. A meal which occurs in the pursuit of normal day-to-day business
is considered a simple courtesy. Meals that are a result of business
discussions that extend into/during/or beyond working hours are a normal part
of doing business. Meals that occur when an official or employee accepts an
invitation to visit a business facility or in which the discussions extend into
or beyond normal working hours are also normal parts of doing business. All
meals of an estimated monetary value of fifty dollars ($50.00) or more will be
recorded in the Office of the Town Clerk-Treasurer noting a description of the
meal, who paid for the meal, and the date of the meal. This record shall be
open to public inspection.
   c.   Entertainment.
      1.   Any entertainment which occurs in the pursuit of normal day-to-day
business is considered a simple courtesy as are activities that are a result of
business discussions which extend into/during/or beyond working hours
considered a part of doing business. Activities that occur when an official or
employee accepts an invitation to visit a business facility and in which the
discussions extend into or beyond normal working hours are also part of normal
business relationships. Each official or employee who participates in
entertainment exceeding an estimated monetary value of fifty dollars ($50.00)
will have such event recorded in the Office of Town Clerk-Treasurer, noting a
description of the entertainment, who paid for the entertainment, date of the
entertainment, and the purpose of the entertainment. This record shall be open
to public inspection. No gifts shall be accepted when ongoing contractual
negotiations are being conducted and are in process.
      2.   Invitations to functions of a general nature, rather than specific
or individual nature, where a business sponsors and pays for clients from
multiple businesses or governmental agencies, may be accepted. For example, if
a business sponsors a training course, seminar, golf outing, sporting event
admission or banquet for clients from multiple government entities, then these
offers may be accepted. However, an official or employee must report all
participation to the Town Clerk-Treasurer of any event exceeding an estimated
monetary value of fifty dollars ($50.00). The reported participation will be
recorded in the Office of the Town Clerk-Treasurer, and will be open for public
inspection during business hours. Any additional offers of hospitality from
businesses such as paid lodging, transportation, etc. shall be declined.
   d.   Campaign Contributions. An official or employee may accept campaign
contributions reported in full compliance with any applicable federal and state
statutes, and local Town ordinances.

the member's allowances for insurance benefits to which the member was entitled
before being suspended or placed on administrative leave. In addition, the Town

member was entitled before being suspended or placed on administrative leave.
   b.   Before a member of the Metropolitan Police Department may be suspended
in excess of five (5) days without pay, demoted, or dismissed, the Board of
Safety shall offer the member an opportunity for a hearing. If a member seeks a
hearing, the member must request the hearing not more than five (5) days after
receiving the notice of the suspension, demotion, or dismissal. Written notice
shall be given either by service upon the member in person or by a copy left at
the member's last and usual place of residence at least fourteen (14) days
before the date set for the hearing. The hearing conducted under this
Subsection shall be held not more than thirty (30) days after the hearing is
requested by the member, unless a later date is mutually agreed upon by the
parties. The notice must state:
      1.   The date, time and place of the hearing;
      2.   The charges against the member;
      3.   The specific conduct that comprises the charges;
      4.   That the member is entitled to be represented by counsel;
      5.   That the member is entitled to call and cross-examine witnesses;
      6.   That the member is entitled to require the production of evidence;

attendance of witnesses, examine them under oath, and require the production of
books, papers, and other evidence at a meeting of the Board. For this purpose,
the Board of Safety may issue subpoenas and have them served and executed in
any part of Lake County, Indiana. If a witness refuses to testify or to produce
books or papers in his or her possession or under his or her control, the
provisions of I.C. 36-4-6-21, as amended from time to time, control to the
extent applicable. The proper court may compel compliance with the order by
attachment, commitment, or other punishment.
   d.   The reasons for the suspension, demotion, or dismissal of a member of
the Metropolitan Police Department shall be entered as specific findings of
fact upon the records of the Board of Safety. A member who is suspended for a
period exceeding five (5) days, demoted, or dismissed may appeal the decision
to the Circuit or Superior Courts of Lake County, Indiana. However, a member
may not appeal any other decision.
   e.   An appeal under this section must be taken by filing in court, within
thirty (30) days after the date the decision is rendered, a verified complaint
stating in concise manner the general nature of the charges against the member,
the decision of the Board of Safety, and a demand for the relief asserted by
the member. A bond must also be filed that guarantees the appeal will be
prosecuted to a final determination and that the plaintiff will pay all costs
adjudged against the plaintiff. The bond must be approved as bonds for costs
are approved in other cases. The Town must be named as the sole defendant, and
the plaintiff shall have a summons issued as in other cases against the Town.
Neither the Board of Safety, nor the Commissioners of it, may be made parties
defendant to the complaint, but all are obligated by service upon the Town and
any judgment rendered by the court.
   f.   In an appeal under subsection e, no pleading is required by the Town to
the complaint, but the allegations are considered denied. The Town may file a
motion to dismiss the appeal for failure to perfect it within the time and in
the manner required by this Section. If more than one (1) person was included
in the same charges and in the same decision of dismissal by the Board of
Safety, then one (1) or more of the persons may join as plaintiffs in the same
complaint, but only the persons that appeal from the decision are affected by
it. The decision of the Board of Safety is final and conclusive upon all
persons not appealing. The decision appealed from is not stayed or affected
pending the final determination of the appeal, but remains in effect unless
modified or reversed by the final judgment of the court.
   g.   A decision of the Board of Safety is considered prima facie correct,
and the burden of proof is on the party appealing. All appeals shall be tried
by the court. The appeal shall be heard de novo only upon any new issues
related to the charges upon which the decision of the Board of Safety was made.
The charges are considered to be denied by the accused person. Within ten (10)
days after service of summons, the Board of Safety shall file in court a
complete transcript of all papers, entries, and other parts of the record
relating to the particular case. Inspection of these documents by the person
affected, or by the person's agent, must be permitted by the Board of Safety
before the appeal is filed, if requested. Each party may produce evidence
relevant to the issues that it desires, and the court shall review the record
and decision of the Board of Safety upon appeal.
   h.   The court shall make specific findings and state the conclusions of law
upon which its decision is made. If the court finds that the decision of the
Board of Safety appealed from should in all things be affirmed, its judgment
should state that, and judgment for costs shall be rendered against the party
appealing. If the court finds that the decision of the Board of Safety appealed
from should not be affirmed in all things, then the court shall make a general
finding, setting out sufficient facts to show the nature of the proceeding and
the court's decision on it. The court shall either:
      1.   Reverse the decision of the Board of Safety; or
      2.   Order the decision of the Board of Safety to be modified.
   i.   The final judgment of the court may be appealed by either party. Upon
the final disposition of the appeal by the courts, the Clerk shall certify and
file a copy of the final judgment of the court to the Board of Safety, which
shall conform its decisions and records to the order and judgment of the court.
If the decision is reversed or modified, then the Board of Safety-shall pay to
the party entitled to it any salary or wages withheld from the party pending
the appeal and to which the party is entitled under the judgment of the court.
   j.   Either party shall be allowed a change of venue from the court or a
change of judge in the same manner as such changes are allowed in civil cases.
The Indiana Rules of Trial Procedure govern in all matters of procedure upon
the appeal that are not otherwise provided for by this section.
   k.   An appeal takes precedence over other pending litigation and shall be
tried and determined by the court as soon as practical.
   l.   Except as provided in I.C. 36-5-2-13, the Town executive may reduce in
grade any member of the Metropolitan Police Department who holds an upper level
policy making position. The reduction in grade may be made without adhering to
the requirements of subsections a through k above. However, a member may not be
reduced in grade to a rank below that which the member held before the member's
appointment to the upper level policy making position.
   m.   If the member is subject to criminal charges, the Safety Board may
place the member on administrative leave until the disposition of the criminal
charges in the trial court. Any other action by the Safety Board is stayed
until the disposition of the criminal charges in the trial court. An
administrative leave under this subsection may be with or without pay, as
determined by the Safety Board. If the member is placed on leave without pay,
the Safety Board, in its discretion, may award back pay if the member is
exonerated in the criminal matter.

Council, as Town Legislative Body, which is the appropriate appointing
authority of the Town. If a member desires a hearing, the member must request
the hearing not more than five (5) days after the notice of the suspension,
demotion, or dismissal. Written notice shall be given either by service upon
the member in person or by a copy left at the member's last and usual place of

hearing conducted, under this Section shall be held not more than thirty (30)
days after the hearing is requested by the member, unless a later date is
mutually agreed upon by the parties. The notice must state:
      1.   The date, time and place of the hearing;
      2.   The charges against the member;
      3.   The specific conduct that comprises the charges;
      4.   That the member is entitled to be represented by counsel;

writing that the board review the reprimand or suspension and either uphold or
reverse the Chiefs’ decision. At its discretion, the board may hold a hearing
during this review. If the board holds a hearing, written notice must be given

         (b)   will be used to finance the cost identified in sub-paragraph (5)
(a) above.
      7.   A description of the nature and location of existing infrastructure
in the impact
zone.

(Ord. No. 1400, § 3, 11-26-97)
Sec. 5-103 Establishment of Park and Recreational Impact Fee.
   a.   There shall be established an impact fee of two thousand one hundred
seventy dollars and thirty-three cents ($2,170.33) per dwelling unit based upon
the cost calculated to provide the new and expanded park facilities required by
development according to the established community standards, and said fee
shall take effect upon due publication pursuant to law.
   b.   The Town Council makes as a part of the record of these proceedings,
all of the data collected, the calculations made, and the conclusions reached
by Pflum, Klausmeier & Gehrum Consultants in the process of developing the Zone
Improvement Plan, and specifically instructs the employees of the Town to make
such data and other information inclusively available to anyone for review
during regular business hours. The Town Council further authorized Pflum,
Klausmeier & Gehrum Consultants to sell or otherwise distribute copies of the
Zone Improvement Plan and any of the other data collected upon which they
relied, at a cost reasonably intended to compensate them for the cost of
reproduction only.
   c.   In the event that any parcel of real estate considered in the creation
of the Zone Improvement Plan undergoes a change in use, redevelopment, or a
modification which requires a structural building permit and creates a need for
new infrastructure, an impact fee will only be assessed for the increase in the
burden on infrastructure.
   d.   Dedication of Park Lands or Payments of Fees In Lieu of Lands. As a
condition of a final plat of a subdivision or of a final plat of a planned unit
development, each subdivider or developer shall be required to dedicate land
for park and recreational purposes, to serve the immediate and future needs of
the residents of the development, or cash contribution in lieu of actual land
dedication, or a combination of both, at the option of the Town in accordance
with the following criteria and formula:
      1.   Requirements and Ratio. The ultimate density of a proposed
development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for
dedication. The total requirement shall be one (1) acre for every ten (10)
acres.
      2.   Criteria for Requiring a Contribution in Lieu of Park Site. Where
the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical or
when the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes,
the Town shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution
in lieu of land dedication required. The cash contributions in lieu of park and
recreation land dedication shall be held in trust by the Town, or other public
body designated by the Town, solely for the acquisition of park and recreation
land as hereinbefore classified, which will be available to serve the immediate
or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development or for the
improvement of other existing local parks and recreation land which already
serves such needs. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of park and
recreation land dedication is not expended for the purposes set forth herein
within ten (10) years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the
developer who made such contribution.
         (a)   Fair Market Value. The cash contributions in lieu of land shall
be based on the “fair market value” of the acres of land in the area improved
as specified herein, that otherwise would have been dedicated as park and
recreation sites. In the event that the developer or subdivider files a written
objection to the fair market value as determined by the Town Park and
Recreation Board, then the developer shall submit an appraisal showing the fair
market value of such improved land in the area of his or her development or
other evidence thereof and a final determination of said “fair market value” of
such improved land shall be made by the Town Council based upon such
information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources
which may be submitted to the Town Council by the Park and Recreation Board.
         (b)   Criteria for Requiring Dedication and a Fee. There will be
situations in subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination of
land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. This
will occur when:
            (i)   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the
location for a park site. That portion of the land within the subdivision
falling within the park location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and
a cash contribution in lieu of land thereof shall be required for any
additional land that would have to be dedicated;
            (ii)   A major part of the local park or recreation site has
previously been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the
development to complete the site. The remaining portion shall be required by
dedication and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required.
      3.   Reservation of Additional Land. Where the Comprehensive Plan of the
Town calls for a larger amount of park and recreational land or school sites in
a particular proposed subdivision or planned unit development than the
developer is required to dedicate, the land needed beyond the developer’s
contribution shall, if so determined by the Town Council, be reserved for
subsequent purchase by the Town provided that such acquisition is made within
one (1) year from the date of approval of the final plat.
      4.   Location. The park and recreation plan as adopted by the
Schererville Park and Recreation Board and as established by the Comprehensive
Master Plan for the Town shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. A
central location which will serve equally the entire development is most
desirable. In large developments these sites can be located throughout the
development according to established standards for park area distance.
      5.   Credit for Private Open Spaces and Recreation Areas.
         (a)   When subdividers or developers provide their own open space for
recreation areas and facilities, it has the effect of reducing the demand for
local public recreational services. Depending on the size of the development, a
portion of the park and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit
developments may, at the option of the Schererville Park and Recreation Board,
be provided in the form of “private” open space in lieu of dedicated “public”
open space. The extent of same shall be determined by the Schererville Park and
Recreation Board, based upon the needs of the projected residents and in
conformance to the total park and recreation land for the general area.
         (b)   In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated
parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the
installation of recreational facilities, including equipment by the developer
as part of his or her obligation. Detailed plans of such areas, including
specifications of facilities to be installed, must be approved by the
Schererville Park and Recreation Board, and before any credit is given for
private recreation areas, the subdivider or developer must guarantee that these
private recreation areas will be permanently maintained for such use by the
execution of the appropriate legal documents. When adjustment for private
recreation areas is warranted, it will be necessary to compute the total park
land dedicated that would have been required from the subdivision or planned
unit development and then subtract the credit to be given.
      6.   Combining with Adjoining Developments. Where the subdivision or
planned unit development is less than forty (40) acres, public open space which
is to be dedicated should, where possible, be combined with dedications from
adjoining developments in order to produce usable recreation areas without
hardship on a particular developer.
      7.   Topography and Grading. The slope, topography and geology of the
dedicated site as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended
purposes. Grading on sites dedicated for park and recreational uses shall not
differ greatly from surrounding land.
      8.   Improved Sites. All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready
for full service of electrical, water, sewer and streets (including enclosed
drainage and curb and gutter) as applicable to the location of the site, or
acceptable provision made therefor.
      9.   Title to Sites. All sites shall be conveyed to the Town either by
warranty or trustee’s deed. The subdivider or developer shall be responsible
for conveying good, merchantable title to such sites, and shall be responsible
for payment of all real estate taxes to the date of conveyance, including any
agricultural roll back taxes which might be extended or levied against such
sites, for any tax years or periods prior to the time of conveyance.
      10.   Provisions Applicable Prior to February 9, 1994.
         (a)   This division d. is applicable only to those developments with
petitions approved by the Plan Commission prior to February 9, 1994 and shall
have no effect upon pending and future petitions before the Shererville Plan
Commission. This division d. shall remain in full force and effect and shall be
enforced as to previous developments approved since February 14, 1990 up to,
but not including, February 9, 1994.
         (b)   The owners of each and every proposed development of one (1)
acre or greater for which petition to approve plat is pending before the
Schererville Plan Commission as of February 9, 1994 and as shall thereafter be
submitted shall, prior to the secondary approval of the Plan Commission, deed
to the Schererville Park Board, without restriction or encumbrance other than
easements acceptable to the Park Board, land acceptable to the Park Board
comprising at least five percent (5%) of the proposed platted area. One and two
lot subdivisions may apply to the Park Board for relief upon a showing
sufficient to satisfy the Park Board of undue hardship and the
inappropriateness of park land or equivalent in the given location and
circumstances. Land for retention/detention of storm water, floodways, drainage
ways and wetlands will not be permitted to fulfill the requirement, unless the
Park Board finds they have significant ecological and aesthetic qualities that
warrant park management and protection. The land need not be platted as lots or
improved but must be of buildable quality and location suitable to the Park
Board. The Plan Commission shall issue no secondary approval for any plat until
such time as the Park Board files before the Plan Commission, and the
Commission makes a part of its official record of consideration, confirmation
that it has been deeded the land required by this division d.10 or waiver of
the requirements of this division d.10.
         (c)   To administer and facilitate the implementation of this division
d.10, the Planning and Building Administrator will remind each developer of
their obligation at the time the developer and planning and building staff
conduct discussion of preliminary assessment of areas to be dedicated for park
purposes.
         (d)   Jointly the Park Superintendent and Planning and Building
Administrator will make a recommendation to the Park Board for its final
determination of the land to be deeded to the Park Board.
         (e)   In the event that the same owner or developer presents
subsequent petition for plat of subdivision adjacent to previously approved
plat of subdivision wherein land had been deeded, pursuant to this section, the
Park Board shall have the discretion to exchange land previously obtained in
prior plats/units for other lots in the newer proposed plat so as to have a
larger single park to serve a residential area rather than several pocket
parks.
         (f)   (i)   This division d.10 provides and allows for the donation of
labor and materials, equivalent to the value of a five percent (5%) dedication
of land for park purposes, when, and in the event, that it is determined by the
members of the Park and Recreation Board, to, in their sound discretion, be in
the best interests of the citizens of the Town of Schererville and, further,
when the developer has demonstrated an ability and interest to provide the
same.
            (ii)   The responsibility for determining such an option will be
that of the members of the Park and Recreation Board, and shall be submitted to
the Plan Commission prior to secondary approval of the proposed development.
(Ord. No. 1142, 2-14-90; Ord. No. 1269, §§ 1 - 5, 2-9-94; Ord. No. 1276, §§ 1,
2, 5-11-94; Ord. No. 1301, §§ 1, 2, 5-9-95; Ord. No. 1400, § 4, 11-26-97; Ord.
No. 1400B § 1, 6-11-03; Ord. No. 1594 § 1, 11-21-03; Ord. No. 1733, § 1, 6-11-
08; Ord. No. 1838, § 1, 7-10-13; Ord. 1926, § 1, 7-11-18)
Sec. 5-104 Credit in Lieu of Payment Exemptions.
   a.   Any person or entity obligated to pay a fee pursuant to the terms of
this ordinance may have the option of financing, constructing and dedicating
park and recreational infrastructure in the form of block parks owned and
operated by a neighborhood association for the public benefit, all as described
and defined in the park and recreation improvement plan, instead of making all
or part of any impact fee payment which may be due, so long as such financing,
construction and dedication are accomplished pursuant to the park and
recreational improvement plan of the Town, and in accordance with the park and
recreational specifications for such park and recreational infrastructure to be
improved in force within the Town's jurisdiction at the time. Such fee payer,
or other person or entity providing the infrastructure or improvement, shall be
given credit for the actual costs of planning, financing, constructing such
park and recreational improvements to the Town. Such request for credit shall
be presented prior to the issuance of the structural building permit. In the
event the actual cost of such planning, financing, and construction do not
equal the amount of the impact fee due pursuant to the calculation provided for
in the schedule set forth in Section 4 hereof, the remaining balance she be due
in accordance with the provisions stated hereafter.
   b.   Credits against impact fees otherwise due shall be allowed pursuant to
this section for all infrastructure and improvements constructed or furnished
in accordance with Indiana Code, § 36-7-4-1313 and Indiana Code, § 36-7-4-1335
since January 1, 1989. In addition, a fee payer or other person or entity
responsible for installing infrastructure or improvements may designate in
writing a method of allocating its credits to future fee payers who may be
successors in interest to the credits earned by the fee payer or others, as
part of the certification provided for above.
   c.   Any person or entity otherwise obligated to pay the fee established by
this ordinance whose property was totally or partially destroyed by fire, storm
or other casualty beyond their control, shall be exempt from said fee if they
repair or replace the destroyed structure without creating a burden on
infrastructure greater than the burden imposed by the destroyed structure. In
the event of such additional burden, the fee shall be calculated based only on
the increased burden created by the structure.
(Ord. No. 1400, § 5, 11-26-97)
Sec. 5-105 Impact Fee Due Upon Issuance of Structural Building Permit.
   a.   The impact fee imposed pursuant to the terms of this ordinance shall be
due and payable upon the issuance of a structural building permit by the Town
of Schererville, Lake County, Indiana. In this regard, it is understood that
the structural building permit is synonymous with the term "structural building
permit" as that term is used in Indiana Code, § 36-7-4-1323, in that the
issuance of a structural building permit authorizes the applicant to commence
construction activities, structural and otherwise. The entire fee, which is
calculated pursuant to the terms of this ordinance, shall be due at said time
unless the amount of the fee upon calculation is greater than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00), in which case an installment plan may be requested by the
applicant in accordance with the terms set forth in Indiana Code, § 36-7-4-1324
(a), (b), (c), and (d). The Schererville Impact Fee Review Board she establish
specific rules consistent with said code provisions for installment payments.
The interest rate on any installment plan or deferred payment shall be the
prejudgment rate of interest set forth in the Indiana Code as from time to time
amended.
   b.   If a fee payer requests, the amount of the impact fee shall be assessed
upon the voluntary submission of a development plan or upon the issuance of the
structural building permit, whichever is earlier. For purposes of this section,
"assessment" means the act of calculating the amount of the impact fee which
shall be due. The Town shall make such assessment within thirty (30) days of
the date of such voluntary request or at the issuance of the structural
building permit, with or without a request.
(Ord. No. 1400, § 6, 11-26-97)
Sec. 5-106 Lien Rights Established.
   Pursuant to Indiana Code, § 36-7-4-1325, the Town of Schererville acquires a
lien against the real estate which is the subject of the impact fee. Upon
adoption, this ordinance shall be recorded, and thereafter, it shall constitute
constructive notice of the lien rights of the Town. The Town may, in its
discretion, file a specific instrument setting forth its lien rights with
respect to a parcel of real estate which is the subject of an installment
payment of an impact fee, and such instrument shall constitute actual notice in
addition to the constructive notice provided for by the recording of this
ordinance.
(Ord. No. 1400, § 7, 11-26-97)
Sec. 5-107 Form of Receipt.
   The Clerk-Treasurer of the Town of Schererville shall issue a receipt for
any and all impact fees collected, and the form of such receipt shall be as
follows:
“Received of                                         (fee
payer)                          this                day of  , 19         , the
sum of                                                 in (full) (partial)
satisfaction of impact fees due pursuant to Ord No.        relating to
improvements to be constructed on the real estate described on Exhibit A.,
attached hereto, made part hereof, and subject to lien rights in favor of the
Town of Schererville in the event of partial payment with payments remaining
due. The remaining balance due (if any) is in the following amount:
$              . This impact fee is dedicated to the creation of the following
infrastructure element in accordance with the Zone Improvement Plan:
            
   Clerk-Treasurer
   Town of Schererville, Indiana.
Sec. 5-108 Appeals.
   a.   Any fee payer, who believes itself to be aggrieved by the calculation
of the impact fee, may appeal from such calculation to the Town of Schererville
Impact Fee Review Board, and the Town of Schererville Impact Fee Review Board
shall conduct a hearing with regard thereto. At such hearing, the fee payer
shall bear the burden of going forward with the evidence and shall present
evidence addressing either or the following propositions:
      1.   A fact assumption used in determining the amount of the impact fee
is incorrect, or
      2.   The amount of the impact fee is greater than the amount allowed
under Indiana Code, § 36-7-4-1320, 1321 and 1322.
   Upon conclusion of the presentation of evidence, the Town of Schererville
Impact Fee Review Board shall make a determination, within not more than thirty
(30) days, upon the facts presented and may make such adjustments in the impact
fee as they believe are appropriate under the circumstances, if any.
   b.   An appeal under this Section must be filed not later than thirty (30)
days after the issuance of the structural building permit. The appeal shall be
initiated with the filing of a Petition for Review with the Clerk-Treasurer's
office, together with a filing fee in the amount of one hundred dollars
($100.00). The filing fee shall be refunded in full (1) if the Petition for
Review is granted and the impact fee is eliminated, reduced or adjusted by the
Town of Schererville Impact Fee Review Board, by independent action of the
Town, or by a court having jurisdiction; and (2) if the reviewing body
determines that the amount of the fee, reductions, or credits were arbitrary or
capricious. The Petition for Review shall be in a form calculated to inform the
Town of Schererville Impact Fee Review Board of the nature of the complaint,
the parties to the action, and the relief requested. In addition, the petition
shall describe the new development on which the impact fee has been assessed,
all facts related to the assessment of the impact fee, and the reasons the
petitioner believes that the amount of the impact fee assessed is erroneous or
is greater than the amount allowed by the fee limitations set forth in the
enabling statute.
   c.   Should a party contest the amount of impact fee assessed, he may post
bond in aforesaid amount with the Town or pay the sum due and owing into an
escrow account and file appeal as set forth herein. Upon posting of the funds
set forth under the Impact Fee Ordinance, a building permit shall be issued. If
the party is successful in his appeal, then the Town shall refund any excess
amounts due to the applicant.
(Ord. No. 1400, § 9, 11-26-97)
Sec. 5-109 Establishment of Non-Reverting Park and Recreational Fund.
   a.   There is established the Park and Recreational Fund of the Town of
Schererville. This fund shall be a non-reverting fund and shall receive any and
all sums collected pursuant to this ordinance to be utilized in connection with
the purposes set forth herein. Said fund shall consist initially of one account
based upon the current existence of one Impact Zone. In the event, and only in
the event that an additional Impact Zone is created hereafter, a separate
account shall be maintained for each separate Impact Zone established with the
Town of Schererville. Interest earned on the fund, or any account within the
fund, shall be deposited and maintained with the fund or the separate account.
The Clerk-Treasurer of the Town of Schererville shall maintain records of the
status of the fund or any account which may be established there and shall make
an annual report of said fund and accounts which shall be available to the
public in general and fee payers, upon request, in particular.
   b.   Pursuant to Indiana Code, § 36-7-4-1332(e), the Clerk-Treasurer is
designated as the Town official responsible for acting upon refund requests. In
order to facilitate refunds when they may be due, the Clerk-Treasurer is
directed to identify the purpose of any impact fee paid in order that a refund,
if any, may be paid from the fund or account into which the fee was originally
deposited.
(Ord. No. 1400, § 10, 11-26-97)
Sec. 5-110 Use of Impact Fees Collected.
   Any and all fees collected pursuant to the provisions of this ordinance may
be utilized for the following purposes only the Town of Schererville, acting by
and through its Town Council which, for the purpose of this ordinance, is
identified as the "infrastructure agency" contemplated by Indiana Code, § 36-7-
4-1317:
      1.   Providing funds to be utilized by the Town of Schererville for the
purpose of paying the capital costs of new park and recreational infrastructure
that is necessary to serve the new development within the corporate limits of
the Town, and that is identified in the Zone Improvement Plan;
      2.   An amount not to exceed five percent (5%) of the annual collections
of the fee to be utilized for expenses incurred by the Town for the consulting
services used to establish this ordinance;
      3.   To pay any refund due pursuant to the terms of this ordinance;
      4.   To pay the debt service cost on an obligation issued to provide new
park and recreational infrastructure described in sub-paragraph (1) above.
(Ord. No. 1400, § 11, 11-2697)
Sec. 5-111 House Enrolled Act No. 1467.
   The Town Council of the Town of Schererville, Lake County, Indiana,
specifically acknowledges the existence of a law adopted by the General
Assembly of the State of Indiana which regulates the imposition of impact fee
ordinances by municipal corporations with the State of Indiana. It is the
intent of the Town of Schererville to comply with such legislation, and this
ordinance shall be construed in all respects to be consistent with the Act. The
substantive and procedural requirements Indiana Code, § 36-7-4-1300, et seq.,
shall control in the event of conflicts which are unintended by the Town
Council.
(Ord. No. 1400, § 12, 11-26-97)
Sec. 5-112 Amendments and Review.
   The impact fee provided for herein is based upon data which, in large part,
is subject to inflation and other economic and market forces over which the
Town has no control. The Town Council shall, therefore, not less than once each
year, cause a review to be made by Town staff or consultants as may be
required, to determine the continuing validity of the Impact Fee, the Impact
Zone, and the Zone Improvement Plan. The Town Council shall consider and adopt
such amendments as are necessary to cause a substantive compliance with the
rational nexus test to continue, to insure that procedural due process is
maintained or enhanced and to insure that this ordinance meets the requirements
of the Indiana Code § 36-7-4-1300 series. To the extent required by the facts
and circumstances, this process shall include the steps necessary to update the
Zone Improvement Plan and the Comprehensive Plan.

such a manner that all of the requirements of this ordinance relating to the
issuance of orders, service of orders and affirmation of orders are deemed
satisfied and all of the requirements of this ordinance relating to issuance of
orders and affirmation of orders are deemed satisfied. In the instance,
however, where an interest is taken in the unsafe premises relative to which a

of the order as modified at the hearing and specifically in such a manner that
all of the requirements of this ordinance relating to the issuance of orders,
service of orders and modification of orders at hearing are deemed satisfied.
   A person who takes an interest in unsafe premises which are the subject of a

Sec. 6-92 Emergency Action.
   If in any instance the Unsafe Building Department shall find that it is
necessary to take emergency action with reference to unsafe premises in order
to protect life, safety, or property, the Unsafe Building Department may cause
such action as necessary to protect life, safety, or property to be performed
without issuing an order or giving notice.
   Such emergency action shall be limited to removing any immediate danger. The
cost incurred in taking or having such action taken may be recovered against
the persons who have fee interest or life estate interest in the unsafe
premises at the time the Unsafe Building Department found it necessary to take
emergency action by the filing of a civil action in Lake County Circuit or
Superior Court by the Unsafe Building Department. Costs of such justify an
action shall not be borne by either the Unsafe Building Department, any other
Department of the Town, or the Town of Schererville.
(Ord. No. 1001, § 15, 2-12-86)
Sec. 6-93 Receivers - Appointment and Powers.
   In accordance with Section
6-98, a receiver may be appointed by a Court of competent jurisdiction relative
to unsafe premises subject to the following provisions:
   a.   The purpose of the receivership shall be to take possession of the
unsafe premises for a period of time sufficient to accomplish and pay for
repairs and improvements.
   b.   The receiver may not be a not-for-profit corporation whose primary
purpose is the improvement of housing conditions in Lake County, or may be any
other capable person residing in Lake County.
   c.   The receiver shall collect and use the rents and other income of the
unsafe premises despite any prior assignments thereof, to repair or remove the
defects as required by the order, and may, upon approval by the Court, make
repairs and improvements in addition to those specified in the order or
required by the applicable statutes, ordinances, codes or regulations.
   d.   The receiver shall have the power to make any contracts and do all
things necessary to accomplish the repair and improvement of the unsafe
premises.
   e.   The Court may, after hearing, authorize the receiver to obtain moneys
needed to accomplish the repairs and improvements by the issuance and sale of
notes or receiver's certificates bearing such interest as the Court may fix.
The notes or certificates shall be a first lien upon the unsafe premises and
the rents and income thereof, and shall be superior to all existing assignments
of rents, liens, mortgages or other encumbrances on the property, except taxes,
provided that within sixty (60) days following the sale or transfer for value
of the notes by the receiver, the holder thereof shall file notice in the
County Recorder's Office which shall contain the following information:
      1.   The legal description of the tract of real estate on which the
unsafe building is located;
      2.   The face amount and interest rate of the note or certificate.
      3.   The date when the note or certificate was sold or transferred by the
receiver; 4. The date of maturity.
   Upon payment to the holder of the receiver's note or certificate of the face
amount and interest, and upon filing in the County Recorder's Office of a sworn
statement of payment, the lien of such note or certificate shall be released.
Upon failure of payment, the lien may be enforced by proceedings to foreclose
as in the case of mechanic's liens or mortgages; however, such suit must be
commenced within two (2) years after the date of default.
   The receiver shall be entitled to the same fees, commissions, and necessary
expenses as are receivers in actions to foreclose mortgages and said fees,
commissions and expenses shall be paid out of the rents and incomes of the
property in receivership.
   The issuance of an order concerning unsafe premises is not a prerequisite to
the appointment of a receiver nor does such an order prevent the appointment of
a receiver. In the event the Unsafe Building Department requests the
appointment of a receiver, all persons having a substantial pro interest in the
unsafe premises shall be made party defendants.
(Ord. No. 1001, § 16, 2-12-86)
Sec. 6-94 Repairs - Public Bids for Work Pursuant to Order.

manner that all persons having a substantial property interest in the unsafe
premises which are the subject of each of the orders are currently subject to

complied with, or, having once been complied with, is not now being complied
with; and

      2.   If the estimated cost of this work is five thousand dollars
($5,000.00) or more, this work shall be let out at public bid to a contractor
licensed and duly qualified under the laws of the State of Indiana and any
applicable Town ordinances. The obligation to pay costs imposed by Section
6-95 is based on the condition of the unsafe premises at the time the public
bid is accepted. Changes occurring in the condition of the unsafe premises
after public bid was accepted shall not eliminate or diminish this obligation.
   Bids may be solicited and accepted for work on more than one property if the
bid reflects an allocation of the bid amount among the various unsafe premises
in proportion to the work to be accomplished. The portion of the bid amount
attributable to each of the unsafe premises shall constitute the basis for
calculating the portion of the costs defined under Section
6-95.
   c.   All persons who have a substantial property interest in the unsafe
premises and are subject to an order of the Unsafe Building Department shall be
notified about the public bid in accordance with Section

premises;
      6.   A statement that the owner has the right to elect in writing within

work to be accomplished. The publication also shall include a statement that a
copy of the statement of public bid may be obtained from the Unsafe Building
Department.
   e.   Notice of the statement that public bids are to be let shall be given

which are the subject of a statement that public bids are to be let may, as
their interest allows, within a period of five (5) calendar days after they
have received notice of such statement, elect by sending a statement in writing
to the Unsafe Building Department to retain any or all of the materials
resulting or salvaged from such work. In the absence of such statement, the
Unsafe Building Department may decide the method of disposal of such materials.
   g.   If action in accordance with this Section is being taken on the basis
of an order which was served by publication, it shall be sufficient to serve
the statement that the Unsafe Building Department, acting by and through its
agents, intends to perform the work or that public bids are to be let by
publication unless the Unsafe Building Department has received information in
writing that would enable it to make service in accordance with Section
6-87 'b' a method other than publication.
(Ord. No. 1001, § 17, 2-12-86)
Sec. 6-95 Liability for Costs or Work Pursuant to Order.
   When action required by an order is performed by the Unsafe Building
Department, acting by and through its agents, or by a contractor in accordance
with Section
6-94 each person who held a fee interest or life estate interest in the unsafe
premises, from the time when the order requiring the work performed was
recorded to the time that the work was completed, shall be jointly and
severally responsible for the following costs:
   a.   The actual cost of the work performed by the Unsafe Building
Department, acting by and through its agents, or the bid price of work

      3.   Salaries for employees;
      4.   The cost of supplies, equipment and office space.
   The amount of such average processing expense shall be determined by the
Unsafe Building Department at a public hearing after notice has been given in
the same manner as is required for other official action of the Unsafe Building
Department. In determining such average processing expense, it shall be
acceptable to fix the amount at a full dollar amount, which is an even multiple
of ten (10).
   c.   If all or any part of the actual costs incurred by the Unsafe Building
Department, acting by and through its agents, or the bid price and the
applicable average processing expense remain unpaid relative to any unsafe
premises, other than unsafe premises owned by a government, after a period of

Court has received a written petition from the person named in the record,
objecting to the claim for payment and requesting a hearing, the Clerk of the
Circuit Court shall enter the cause on the Docket of the Circuit or Superior
Court as a civil action and a hearing on the question shall be held pursuant to
the provisions of Indiana Code, § 4-22-1 (§ 4-22-1-1-4-22-1-30). However,
issues that could have been determined pursuant to Section 12 of this ordinance
shall not be entertained at the hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing on
the petition, the Court shall either sustain the petition or enter a judgment
for the amounts recorded or for modified amounts against the person or persons
named in the record. If no petition is received at the end of thirty (30) days

Dollars. The effective date of such forfeiture may be postponed for a period
not to exceed thirty (30) days after which the Court may order forfeiture
reduced or stricken if it is satisfied that all work necessary to fully comply
with the order has been done.
   On request of the Unsafe Building Department, the Court shall enter a

made party defendants.
   The cost of accomplishing the work and the processing expenses incurred by
the Unsafe Building Department computed in accordance with the provisions of
Section
6-95 both may, after a hearing, be entered by the Court as a judgment against
persons having a fee interest or life estate interest in the unsafe premises.
   e.   Set a hearing to be held within ten (10) days of the filing of a

relief under this Subparagraph (2), the Court shall set a date certain for the
completion of the necessary action and shall hold a hearing within ten (10)
days thereafter to determine whether the necessary action has been accomplished
completely.
   The issuance of an order relative to such unsafe premises is not a
prerequisite to the authorization by the Court to cause action to be performed
on the unsafe premises. If an order has been issued relative to such unsafe
premises, it shall not prevent the authorization by the Court to cause action
to be performed on the unsafe premises.
   In any case in which the Unsafe Building Department requests authority to
cause action on the unsafe premises to be performed by a Contractor, all
persons having a substantial property interest in the unsafe premises shall be

   e.   Building permit minimum mandatory conditions. In addition to any other
conditions that may be required in connection with the issuance of building
permits, each building permit issued in connection with the construction,
reconstruction, installation, demolition, maintenance, or repair of any
commercial building estimated to cost not less than two hundred fifty thousand
dollars ($250,000.00), or in connection with a residential building with five
(5) or more units, shall be subject to, and shall include the following set of
mandatory permit conditions, namely:
      If any person or entity that is subject to the foregoing fails to comply
with any of the qualifications and conditions with respect to work on the
project, this permit shall be deemed temporarily suspended and all construction
work on the entire project shall cease immediately upon issuance of a stop work
order by the Building Commissioner, or his/her designee, until further notice
by him/her.
      It shall be a material condition of a building permit issued hereunder
that any construction manager, general contractor, or other lead or prime
contractor, or any entity functioning in any such capacity, and any other
contractor or subcontractor of any tier or other person or entity that is
engaged to perform the construction work on the property that is the subject of
this permit (hereinafter, collectively and individually, referred to as the
"contractor") shall comply with the following qualifications and conditions at
all times during their performance of work pursuant to said issued building
permit on the project, namely:
      1.   The contractor has not been barred or suspended from performing
construction work by any federal, state, or local government agency or
authority in the past three (3) years;
      2.   The contractor had not been found within the past three (3) years by
a court or governmental agency in violation of any law relating to providing
workers compensation insurance coverage, misclassification of employees as
independent contractors, payment of employer payroll taxes, employee income tax
withholding, wage and hour laws, prompt payment law, or prevailing wage laws;
      3.   The contractor shall maintain appropriate worker's compensation
insurance as required by the provisions of I.C., § 22-3-5, et seq., as amended,
and provide documentary proof of such coverage to the Building Commissioner, to
be maintained as a public record;
      4.   The contractor must properly classify employees as employees rather
than independent contractors and treat them accordingly for purposes of minimum
wages and overtime, worker's compensation insurance coverage, unemployment
taxes, social security taxes, and state and federal income tax withholding;
      5.   The contractor must maintain detailed payroll records and provide
the records, upon request, to the Building Commissioner, or his/her designee,
within five (5) days of the request;
      6.   The contractor must comply with the provisions of I.C., § 22-2 et

   f.   In the event that the permit is issued, the applicant for the building
permit shall be responsible for ensuring that all contractors performing
construction work on the property comply with the building permit minimum
mandatory conditions required by this section, as amended from time to time,
for the duration of work on the project. If any person or entity that is
subject to those building permit minimum mandatory conditions fails to comply
with any of the qualifications and conditions with respect to work on the
project and this law, and in addition to any other penalties or consequences
provided by applicable law, the Building Commissioner, or his/her designee, may
issue a stop work order of all construction work on the entire project until
the violation is remedied. Once the Building Commissioner, or his/her designee,
determines that the violation has been remedied, he/she will withdraw the stop
work order, and construction on the project may proceed, or resume.
   g.   In the event that a complaint is filed and/or brought to the attention
of the Town's Building Department or Building Commissioner, may conduct an
investigation of the required building permit minimum mandatory conditions. All
documents requested will be required to be provided to the Building Department
of the Town no later than five (5) business days from date of notice. In the
event that a violation is found, the contractor may be subject to fines and/or
loss of contractor license issued by the Town. All documents will be recorded
and retained as public documents and, as deemed appropriate, will be turned
over to local, county and state prosecuting attorneys for further investigation
and/or prosecution.
   h.   In the event that the contractor applying for a building permit has
been found guilty or violative of any local, state or federal violations of
applicable law, or said building permit minimum mandatory conditions, the
Building Commissioner may not issue a permit to the contractor and may deny a
building permit application; after a period of five (5) years elapses from the
date of the violations, and at the approval of the Building Commissioner, the
Building Commissioner may consider and approve building permits for an
applicant contractor which had previously violated these and all related laws
based upon verification of compliance with said laws and the building permit
minimum mandatory conditions set forth herein, including verified compliance
with the mandatory reporting of all payroll documents, including pay stubs, to
all employees and minimum wages and overtime, worker's compensation insurance
coverage, unemployment taxes, social security taxes and state and federal
income tax withholding and certification of current workers compensation
insurance coverage for the proper amount of employees on a weekly basis for the
duration of the building permit. This verification shall be documented as a
public record in the Town records. (Ord. No. 770, § 1-4, 12-27-78; Ord. No.

   j.   A written statement of any federal, state or local tax liens or tax
delinquencies owed to. any federal, state or local taxing body in the last five
(5) years;
   k.   A statement that individuals who will perform work on the public works
project on behalf of the bidder will be properly classified as either (I) an

federal laws and local ordinances; and
   l.   A list of projects of similar size and scope of work that the bidder
has performed in the State of Indiana within three (3) years prior to the date
on which the bid is due.
The Town reserves the right to demand supplemental information from the bidder,
additional verification of any information provided by the bidder, and may also
conduct random inquiries of the bidder's current and prior customers.
(Ord. 1900, § 2, 4-12-17)
Sec. 7-30 Post-Bid Submission Requirements for Subcontractors.
   Upon request, the Town may require all bidders to provide a written list
that discloses the name, address, and type of work for each first-tier
subcontractor from whom the bidder has accepted a bid and/or intends to hire on
any part of the public work project, including individuals performing work as
independent contractors, within five (5) business days after the date the bids
are due.
   In addition, each listed first-tier subcontractor shall be required to
adhere to the requirements of this Ordinance as though it were bidding directly
to the Town, except that first-tier subcontractors shall submit the required
information (including the name, address, and type of work for each of their
first-tier subcontractors) to the successful bidder no later than (5) business
days after the subcontractor's first day of work on the public work project and
the bidders shall immediately forward said information to the Town. Payment
shall be withheld from any first-tier subcontractor who fails to timely submit
said information until such information is submitted and approved by the Town.
   The Town may require any second and lower-tier subcontractors to provide the
required information (including name, address, type of work on the project and
the name of the higher-tier subcontractor) within ten (10) calendar days.
Payments shall be withheld from any second or low-tier contractor who fails to
timely submit this information until this information is submitted and approved
by the Town. Additionally, the Town may require the successful bidder and
relevant subcontractor to remove the second or lower-tier subcontractor from
the project and replace it with the responsive and responsible subcontractor.
   Failure of a subcontractor to submit the required information shall not
disqualify the successful bidder from performing work on the project and shall
not constitute a contractual default and/or breach by the successful bidder.
However, the Town may withhold all payments otherwise due for work performed by
a subcontractor until the subcontractor submits the required information and
the Town approved such information. The Town may also require that successful
bidder to remove the subcontractor from the project and replace it with a
responsive and responsible subcontractor.
   The disclosure of a subcontractor ("disclosed subcontractor") by a bidder or
a subcontractor shall not create any rights in the disclosed subcontractor.
Thus, a bidder and/or subcontractor may substitute another subcontractor
("substitute subcontractor") for a disclosed subcontractor by giving the Town
written notice of the name, address and type of work of the substitute
subcontractor. The substitute subcontractor is subject to all of the
obligations of a subcontractor under this Ordinance, as amended from time to
time.

subcontractor may be designated as pre-qualified for future Town public works
projects. A contractor's designation as pre-qualified shall exempt the
contractor or sub-contractor from the comprehensive submission requirements
contained herein for a period of twelve (12) months. Thereafter, contractors or
subcontractors who are pre-qualified must submit a complete application for
continued or pre-qualified standing, on a form provided by the Town, (also
referred to as the "short form") by December 31st for the upcoming calendar
year. Failure by any pre-qualified standing shall result in automatic removal
of the designation effective January 21 of the upcoming year. However, the
"removed" contractor or subcontractor shall still be permitted to bid on Town
public works project.
   Any material changes to the contractor's status at any time must be reported
in writing by the contractor within ten (10) days of its occurrence to the
Town. The pre-qualification designation is solely within the discretion of the
Town and the Town specifically reserves the right to change or revoke the
designation for a stated written reason(s).
   Denial of pre-qualification shall be in writing and shall be forwarded to
the contractor within seven (7) working days of such decision. Any contractor
denied or losing pre-qualification status may request reconsideration of the
decision by submitting such request in writing to the Town within five (5)

report utilizing the federal form now known as WH-347 which must be prepared on
a weekly basis and submitted to the Town within ten (10) calendar days after
the end of each week in which the bidder or subcontractor performed its work on
the public work project. These certified payroll reports shall identify the job
title and craft of each employee on the project, e.g., journeyman electrician
or apprentice electrician. In the event that any contractor or subcontractor
uses independent contractors to perform work on the project, such individual
must be identified on the WH-347 form with the same information as is required
for employees.
   The Town may withhold payment due for work performed by a bidder if the
bidder fails to timely submit its certified payroll reports until such time as
such certified payroll reports are submitted. The Town may also withhold
payment due for work performed by a subcontractor if the subcontractor fails to
timely submit its certified payroll reports until such time as certified
payroll reports are submitted. The Town shall not withhold payment to a bidder
for work performed by the bidder or for work performed by subcontractors who
have submitted their certified payroll reports, because one (1) or more other
subcontractors failed to timely submit their certified payroll reports.
(Ord. 1900, § 8, 4-12-17)

deceptive or fraudulent statement, or willfully submits false, deceptive or
fraudulent information in connection with any submission made to the Town shall
be disqualified from bidding on all Town public works projects for a period of
three (3) years. Thereafter, the disqualified bidder shall comply with all

any manufacturer's warranty currently exists.
         b)   Individual unit mechanical equipment. Individual unit mechanical
equipment shall refer to all appliances and other mechanical equipment
including heating, electrical, and plumbing systems physically located within

(Ord. No. 887, § 6, 5-12-82)
Sec. 7-104 Protection of Tenants.
   a.   Notice requirements.
      1.   A declarant of a conversion condominium shall give each of the
tenants in possession of units subject to this ordinance notice of intent to
convert no less than two hundred ten (210) days prior to requiring the tenants
to vacate, at least one hundred twenty (120) days of which must elapse before
the recording of the condominium instruments with the Lake County Recorder.
This notice shall be concurrently filed with the Town as provided in Section
7-102 'a'.
      2.   The notice of intent must set forth the rights of tenants under this
ordinance and must include a copy of this ordinance as an attachment. Such
notice shall be hand delivered or sent by certified mail.
      3.   No tenant may be required by the declarant to vacate upon less than
two hundred ten (210) days notice, except by reason of nonpayment of rent,
conduct that disturbs other tenants' peaceful enjoyment of the premises, or
other substantial violations of the terms of the rental agreement. The terms of
tenancy may not be altered during that period.
      4.   Nothing in this section permits termination of a lease by a
declarant in violation of its terms.
      5.   Any tenant under a lease entered into subsequent to the effective
date of this ordinance who receives a notice of intent to convert shall at any
time after receipt of the notice have the right to terminate the lease with
sixty (60) days written notice to the landlord, which sixty (60) days shall
start to run from the date that the next rental payment is due. Such
termination shall be without penalty or other termination charge to the tenant.
By delivering the notice of termination to the landlord, the tenant waives the
right to purchase the unit under Section
7-104 'b'.
      6.   Where an existing tenant's lease has expired and not been renewed,
at the landlord's behest, and within ninety (90) days of the last effective day
of said lease a notice of intent to convert has been served on any tenant in
that building, the most recent tenant whose lease expired shall have the same
rights of purchase and of relocation as if he were still a tenant of that unit.
This section does not apply to termination of leases for violations of their
terms or default by the tenant.
      7.   Those tenants under a lease entered into subsequent to the effective
date of this ordinance who within thirty (30) days of signing of a lease,
whether or not they have moved into the unit, receive notice of intent to
convert shall have fifteen (15) days from receipt of that notice to serve an
immediate fifteen (15) day notice of their intent to vacate, or not to honor
said lease. There shall be no penalties assessed against tenants who void their
lease pursuant to this section.
   Failure of said tenant to utilize this fifteen (15) day notice right is not
a waiver of his rights to give a sixty (60) day notice as set forth in Section
7-104 'a' '5' above.
      8.   Failure of a declarant to give notice as required by the above
section is a defense to an action for possession, unless the tenant knowingly
avoids receiving or delivery of said notice of intent.
   b.   Tenant's right to purchase - During the one hundred twenty (120) day
period following the delivery to tenants of the notice of intent, or until
thirty (30) days after the condominium instruments have been filed with the
Town, whichever is longer, the declarant shall offer the tenant his unit. This
offer shall be held open until tenant's acceptance or refusal, but in no event
longer than the expiration of either the one hundred twenty (120) period or the
thirty (30) days after filing of the condominium instruments, whichever is
longer. Inaction by the tenant after the expiration of the one hundred twenty
(120) days or thirty (30) days shall constitute a waiver of his right of first
purchase. Said offer shall be either a first-time offer to the tenant when a
bonafide offer has been submitted for that unit by a third party. Under either
procedure, the tenant shall have thirty (30) days to execute his own contract
for the unit from the date of receipt of the offer or right of first refusal.
If a tenant foils to execute a contract during that period, the declarant may
not offer to sell that unit during the following one hundred eighty (180) days
at a price or on terms more favorable to the prospective purchaser than the
price or terms offered to the tenant without first making same offer to the
tenant, who shall have no less than fifteen (15) days within which to accept
the offer.
   c.   Relocation assistance - Within fourteen (14) days after receiving a
receipted bill for costs of relocation, the declarant must pay actual moving
expenses to a maximum amount of three hundred dollars ($300.00) or one months'
rent, whichever is higher, for any tenant of record.
   d.   Access.
      1.   The tenant in a conversion condominium shall not unreasonably

Sec. 9-106 Sprinkling Rates.
   In order that domestic and residential users of sewage services shall not be
penalized for the sprinkling of lawns during the months of May, June, July, and
August, the billing for sewage service for residences and/or domestic users for
said months of May, June, July, and August, shall be based upon the water usage
for the previous months of January, February and March. In the event the water
usage for said previous months of January, February and March is greater than
the water usage for said months of May, June, July, and August, then the
billing for sewage service shall be computed on the actual water used in the
month for which the sewage service bill is being rendered. Domestic and/or
residential sewage service, as applicable to this sprinkling rate, shall apply
to each lot, parcel of real estate or building which is occupied and used as a
residence. Said sprinkling rate shall not apply to any premises which are
partially or wholly used for industrial or commercial purposes. In the event a
portion of such premises shall be used for commercial or industrial purposes,
the owner shall have privilege of separating the water service so that the
residential portion of the premises is served through a separate meter, and in
such case, the water usage as registered by the water meter serving such
portion of the premises used for residential purposes would qualify under the
sprinkling rate.

Sec. 9-126 Reimbursement Required by Industrial User.
   In order to comply with federal regulations, in the case of federal grant
assistance for the construction of waste treatment works, where it has been
determined that "industrial users" as defined in Section
9-125, above, or as amended by appropriate federal regulations, are required to
reimburse a portion of the federal grant amount allocable to the capital cost
of constructing facilities for the treatment of "industrial wastes", rates and
charges shall be collected from each industrial user connected to the municipal
sewage works or who otherwise discharges sewage, water or liquids, either
directly or indirectly, into the municipal waste treatment system, which
charges shall be payable as hereinafter provided and shall be in an amount
determinable as follows:
   a.   The industrial cost recovery charges for the treatment of industrial
wastes shall be based upon the volume of sewage flow billed to industrial
users, as determined in accordance with appropriate provisions for determining
billed flow included in Ordinance Number 648 B (Rate Ordinance) and the total
strength and character of industrial wastes which is introduced into the waste
treatment system. The strength and character of industrial wastes shall be
measured at the industrial users expense as provided for in Ordinance Number
648B (Rate Ordinance) and furnished to the Town. The owner or industrial user
shall furnish a central sampling point available to the Town at all times. In
the event that measurement of the strength and character of industrial wastes
are not provided to the Town on a timely basis, the measurements of the
strength and character of industrial wastes shall be determined by the Town on
the basis of a sample, authorized hereunder, to be taken by the Town for the
purpose of appropriate billing. The industrial cost recovery rates for the
treatment of wastes shall be as follows:
   Measurement
   Monthly volume flow, which includes
   normal domestic wastes (BOD 240 mg/l
   and suspended solids 240 mg/1)         $. 106 per 1,000 gallons
   Monthly pounds of BOD in excess of 240
   mg/l                     $.016 per pound
   Monthly pounds of suspended solids in
   excess of 240 mg/l               $.016 per pound
   b.   However, in the event an "industrial user" can and does show to the
satisfaction of the Town that a portion of the total monthly billed sewage flow
is from sanitary conveniences, then the flow and pollutant loadings to which
the industrial cost recovery charge is applied, shall be determined on the
basis of net flow and pollutant loadings excluding sanitary conveniences.
   c.   The industrial cost recovery charges for treatment services on or after
the effective date as stated in Section 9-116 shall be prepared and billed
quarterly.
(Ord. No. 672, § 2, 10-27-76; Schererville Town Code, § 10-2-24)
Sec. 9-127 Determination of Users Subject to Industrial Cost Recovery Charges.
   The Town shall determine which users are subject to paying the industrial
cost recovery charges, in the following manner:
   a.   The Town shall require appropriate employees of the Sewage works to
review billing records and prepare a list of all potential industrial users, as
identified in each of the Divisions listed in Section
9-125 above.
   b.   The list of all potential industrial users shall be analyzed on the
basis of data available at the Sewage Works billing office (i.e. type of
business, volume charges, excessive loading charges, estimated number of
employees, etc.) for the purpose of developing preliminary lists of probable
"industrial" and probable "non-industrial" users.
   c.   The Town shall conduct an immediate survey of all probable "industrial"
users in order to substantiate the validity of classifying a particular user as
an "industrial" user. Each user initially classified as an industrial user,
shall be notified as to their classification.
   d.   After completing the survey of all probable "industrial" users, the
Town shall review the list of probable "non-industrial" users to determine if
the initial classification of any of these users should be reconsidered. Where
appropriate, individual users will be contacted in order to determine the
proper classification.
   e.   After an industrial user has been notified of his classification, the
user may request reconsideration by furnishing data and measurements acceptable
to the Town for the determination of sewage discharges. The Town shall have the
right to measure and determine the strength and content of all sewage and waste
discharges, either directly or indirectly into the Town's sanitary sewage
system, in such manner and by such method as it may deem practicable in light
of the conditions and attending circumstances of each case in order to
determine the proper user classification.
   f.   Within a reasonable period of time following completion of the sewage
works construction project, the Town shall have completed the initial
classification of all industrial users. During the first calendar year of
operation, subsequent to completion of the construction project, and annually
thereafter, the Town will review, classify and reclassify all users as either
industrial or non-industrial users based upon measurements and data obtained by
the Town or furnished by individual users. Normally, each user will retain his
classification until the next succeeding classification period. However, if
there is a substantial change in the strength, volume or delivery flow rate
characteristics introduced into the treatment works by an individual user, then
the classification of that user may be reviewed and established during the year
in the light of the conditions and attending circumstances of each case.
(Ord. No. 672, § 3, 10-27-76; Schererville Town Code, § 10-2-25)
Sec. 9-128 Basis for Industrial Cost Recovery Rates.
   The basis for the industrial cost recovery rates and charges included in
Section
9-126, above, are as follows:
   a.   Total estimated federal grant amount to be awarded for the plant
improvements and interceptor sewers under Project Number C-180474 01 amounts to
approximately $1,162,050.00
   b.   The consulting engineers estimate that an equitable distribution on a
percentage basis of the total cost of construction and equipment included in
the treatment plant project would be as follows:
      Treatment of sanitary waste flow   40%
      Treatment of suspended solids   25%
      Treatment of BOD   35%
   c.   The design capacity of the treatment plant is as follows:
   Flow:                  Annual design flow capacity of 365 M.G.
   Suspended Solids:            Design capacity 200 mg/l, times annual flow
                     capacity 365 M.G., times weight will result in
                     608,820 # average annual design capacity.
   Biochemical Oxygen Demand:      Design capacity 240 mg/l, times annual flow
                     capacity 365 M.G., times weight will result in
                     729,971 # average annual design capacity.
   d.   Industrial cost recovery period will be thirty (30) years.
   e.   Average annual basis for the cost recovery charge will amount to
$38,735.00 ($1,162,050.00 federal grant, divided by thirty (30) years recovery
period).
   f.   Total annual basis for the cost recovery charge allocated to treatment
functions, is as follows:
      Treatment of waste volume ($38,735.00 x 40%.   =   $15,494.00)
      Treatment of suspended solids ($38,735.00 x 25%.   =   $ 9,683.75)
      Treatment of BOD ($38,735.00 x 35%.      =   $13,557.25)
   g.   The industrial cost recovery rates for the treatment charges are
computed on the basis of the annual functional costs of treatment, divided by
average annual design capacity in the following manner:
      Treatment of sanitary waste volume:
      Annual functional cost of $15,494.00 divided by annual capacity 365 M.G.,
equals $.042 per 1,000 gallons.
      Treatment of suspended solids:
      Annual functional cost of $9,683.75 divided by annual capacity of 729,971
pounds equals $.0159 per pound.
      Treatment of biochemical oxygen demand:
      Annual functional cost of $13,557.25 divided by annual capacity of
729,971 pounds equals $.0186 per pound.
   h.   The rates computed in subsection (g) above, would result in total
recovery of the federal grant amount if all users were subject to the
industrial cost recovery requirements, and provided that the treatment plant
was operated at capacity during the cost recovery period. Therefore, these
rates will ensure that each industrial user will pay only that portion of the
federal grant amount applicable to the costs of the treatment facilities
actually utilized to treat industrial wastes, as determined by each industrial
users flow and pollutant loadings.
(Ord. No. 672, § 4, 10-27-76; Schererville Town Code, § 10-2-26)
Sec. 9-129 Accounting Procedures - Sewage Works Industrial Cost Recovery Fund.
   The Town shall account for all industrial cost recovery payments in the
following manner:
   a.   All revenues derived from the industrial cost recovery rates and
charges shall be segregated and kept in a special fund, separate and apart from
all other funds of the Town. The special fund shall be designated the "Sewage
Works Industrial Cost Recovery Fund" and payment of said amount into said fund
shall be deemed a reasonable expense of operation of the sewage works for the
purpose of computing net operating revenue.
   b.   Within forty five (45) days following the end of the first calendar
year after completion of construction of the sewage facilities and annually
thereafter, the Town shall return fifty percent (50%) of the amounts recovered
through the industrial cost recovery charges, together with any interest earned
thereon, to the U.S. Treasury. Pending use, the Town shall invest the retained
amounts for reconstruction and expansion in:
      1.   Obligations of the U.S. Government; or
      2.   obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S.
Government or any agency thereof; or
      3.   shall deposit such amounts in accounts fully collateralized by
obligations of the U.S. Government or by obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by the U.S. Government or any Agency thereof.
   c.   Eighty percent (80%) of the funds retained by the Town in the "Sewage
Works Industrial Cost Recovery Fund" or authorized investments and the interest
earned thereon, shall be expended only for the purpose of eligible costs of
expansion or reconstruction of the treatment works. The Town shall obtain the
written approval of the Regional Administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency prior to commitment of the retained amounts for any expansion
and reconstruction. The remaining twenty percent (20%) of the funds retained by
the Town may be utilized for any authorized use associated with the sewage
works.
(Ord. No. 672, § 5, 10-27-76; Schererville Town Code, § 10-2-27)
Sec. 9-130 Reviews by EPA.

permit representatives of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to review
appropriate industrial sewage records for the purpose of independently
verifying the flow and characteristics of industrial wastes which are
introduced into the treatment works. No waste introduced into the waste
treatment system shall interfere with the operation or performance of the
sewage treatment works. All users are subject to the requirements of
pretreatment standards established by federal and state law.
(Ord. No. 672, § 6, 10-27-76; Schererville Town Code, § 10-2-28)

Sec. 9-144 Quantity of Water Discharged into System and Corresponding Charges.
   The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewerage system and
obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the Town shall be
determined by the Town in such manner as the Town shall reasonably elect, and
the sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates. Further, as
is hereinafter provided in this Section, the Town may make proper allowances in
determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be
consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the Town that such
quantities do not enter the sanitary sewage system.
   a.   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the Town
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the Town, and the water used thereon or
therein is not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not
acceptable to the Town then the amount of water used shall be otherwise
measured or determined by the Town. In order to ascertain the rate or charge
provided in this ordinance, the owner or other interested party shall, at his
expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or
any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the Town for the
determination of sewage discharge.
   b.   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the Town’s
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the Town and, in addition, is a user of
water from another source which is not measured by a water meter or is measured
by a meter not acceptable to the Town, then the amount of water used shall be
otherwise measured or determined by the Town, In order to ascertain the rates
or charges, the owner or other interested parties, shall, at his expense,
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the Town for the
determination of sewage discharge.
(Ord. No. 648B, § 4(a)-(c), 10-27-76; Schererville Town Code, § 10-2-6 (a) -
(c))
   c.   In the event two (2) or more dwelling units, such as mobile homes,
apartments or housekeeping rooms, discharging sanitary sewage, water or other
liquids into the Town’s sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly,
are users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water
meter, then in such case billing shall be for a single service in the manner
set out elsewhere herein, except that there will be an additional charge of
three-dollars and twenty-five cents. ($3.25) per month for each additional
unit. In the case of mobile home courts, the number of dwelling units shall be
computed and interpreted as the total number of mobile home spaces available
for rent, plus any other dwelling units served through the meter. A dwelling
unit shall be interpreted as a room or rooms, or any other space or spaces in
which cooking facilities are provided.
(Ord. No. 1271, § 2, 7-13-94)
   d.   In the event two (2) or more dwelling units such as mobile homes,
apartments or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water or other
liquids into the Town’s sanitary sewerage system, either directly or
indirectly, are users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a
single water meter then in such case billing shall be for a single service in
the manner set out elsewhere herein, except that there will be an additional
charge of two-dollars and fifty cents ($2.50) per month for each additional
unit. In the case of mobile home courts, the number of dwelling units shall be
computed and interpreted as the total number of mobile home spaces available
for rent plus any other dwelling units served through the meter. A dwelling
unit shall be interpreted as a room or rooms or any other space or spaces in
which cooking facilities are provided.
(Ord. No. 974, Schererville Town Code, § 10-2-6(d))
   e.   In order that the single family domestic and residential users or
sewage service shall not be penalized for sprinkling lawns during the summer
months of June, July, August and September the billing for sewage service for
residences and/or domestic users for said months shall be based upon the water
usage for the previous months of December, January, February, and March. In the
event the water usage for said previous months is greater than the water usage
for said summer months then the billing for sewage services shall be computed
on the actual water used in the month for which the sewage service bill is
being rendered. Domestic and/or residential sewage service as applicable to the
sprinkling rate shall apply to each lot, parcel of real estate or building
which is occupied and used as a single family residence. Said sprinkling rate
shall not apply to any premises which are partially or wholly used for
commercial or industrial purposes. In the event a portion of such premises
shall be used for commercial or industrial purposes, the owner shall have the
privilege of separating the water service so that the residential portion of
the premises is served through a separate meter and in such case the water
usage as registered by the water meter serving such portion of the premises
used for residential purposes would qualify under the sprinkling rate.
   f.   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate of building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the Town’s
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in
excess of thirty-five thousand (35,000) gallons per month, and it can be shown
to the satisfaction of the Town that a portion of water as measured by the
water meter or meters does not and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system,
then the owner other interested party shall install and maintain meters, weirs,
volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the Town for the determination of sewage discharge.
(Ord. No. 648B, § 4, (e)(F), 10-27-76; Schererville Town Code, § 10-2-6 (e)(F))
Sec. 9-145 Strength and Character of Industrial Discharges.
   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably adjusted to
the service rendered to industrial users, the Town shall base its charges not
only on the volume, but also on strength and character of the stronger-than-
normal domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose of.
The Town shall require the industrial user to determine the strength and
content of all sewage and wastes discharge, either directly or indirectly into
the sanitary sewage system, in such manner and by such method as the Town may
deem practicable in the light of the conditions and attending circumstances of
the case, in order to determine the proper charge. The industrial user shall
furnish a central sampling point available to the Town at all times.
(Schererville Town Code, § 10-2-7)
   a.   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) of two-hundred fifty (250) milligrams per liter of fluid or
suspended solids in excess of two-hundred fifty (250) milligrams per liter of
fluid or ammonia nitrogen measured as nitrogen (NH3-N) in excess of twenty-five
(25) milligrams per liter of fluid. Additional charges for treating stronger-
than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis:
      1.   Rate Surcharge Based Upon Suspended Solids: There shall be an
additional charge of twenty-five cents ($0.25) per pound of suspended solids
for suspended solids received in excess of two-hundred fifty (250) milligrams
per liter of fluid.
      2.   Rate Surcharge Based Upon BOD: There shall be an additional charge
of thirty-one cents ($0.31) per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for BOD
received in excess of two-hundred fifty (250) milligrams per liter of fluid.
      3.   Rate Surcharge Based Upon NH3-N: There shall be an additional charge
of one dollar and seventy-eight cents ($1.78) per pound of ammonia nitrogen
measured as nitrogen for NH3-N received in excess of twenty-five (25)
milligrams per liter of fluid.
   b.   The determination of Suspended Solids, five-day biochemical oxygen
demand and ammonia nitrogen measured as nitrogen contained in the waste shall
be in accordance with the current edition of “Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water, Sewage and Industrial Wastes”, as written by the American
Public Health Association, the American Water Works Association and the Waste
Pollution Control Federation.
(Ord. No. 1271, § 3,7-13-94; Ord. No. 1271A, § 2, 11-10-09; Ord. No. 1271B, §

in the manner provided by law and ordinance.
   a.   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed
monthly.
   b.   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying
the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but
such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in event
payment is not made as herein required. The owners of properties served, which
are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to examine the
collection records of the Town for the purpose of determining whether bills
have been paid by such tenant or tenants, provided that such examination shall
be made at the office at which said records are kept and during the hours that
such office is open for business.
   c.   The Clerk-Treasurer shall notify:

Sec. 9-147 Annual Study of Rates and Charges.
   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain fair and
equitable and be in proportion to the cost of providing services to the various
users of user classes, the Town shall cause a study to be made within a
reasonable period of time following the first twelve (12) months of operation,
following the date on which this ordinance goes into effect. Such study shall
include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the costs associated with the
treatment of excessive strength effluents from industrial users or user
classes, the financial position of the sewage works and the adequacy of its
revenue to provide reasonable funds for operation and m maintenance,
replacements, debt service requirements and capital improvements to the waste
treatment systems.
   Thereafter, on an annual basis, within a reasonable period of time following
the normal accounting period, the Town shall cause a similar study to be made
for the purpose of reviewing the fairness and equity of the rates and charges
for sewage services on a continuing basis. Said studies shall be conducted by
officers or employees of the Town or by a firm of certified public accountants,
or a firm of consulting engineers which firms shall have experience in such
studies, or by such combination of officers, employees, certified public
accountant, or engineers as the Town shall determine to be best under the
circumstances.

(Ord. No. 1862, § 2.1, 2-11-15)
Sec. 9-179 Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
   Users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40
CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 and the same are hereby incorporated
into this ordinance by reference.
   a.   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Superintendent may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance
with divisions e. and f. of this section.
   b.   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Superintendent
may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of
pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
   c.   When Wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed
with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Superintendent shall
impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e).
   d.   A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment
standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this section.
      (1)   Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the
presence of pollutants in the industrial user’s intake water in accordance with
this section. Any industrial user seeking to obtain credit for intake
pollutants shall apply to the Town. Upon request of the industrial user, the
applicable standard will be calculated on a “net” basis (i.e., adjusted to
reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the requirements of
division d.(2) of this section are met.
      (2)   Criteria.
         (a)   Either (I) The applicable categorical pretreatment standards
contained in 40 CFR subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be
applied on a net basis; or (ii) the industrial user demonstrates that the
control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment
standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the
absence of pollutants in the intake waters.
         (b)   Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be granted
unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic
measure in the user’s effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of
the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits
are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere.
         (c)   Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s), up to a maximum value equal to
the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine
eligibility for credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under this
section.
         (d)   Credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the
intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW
discharges. The Town or Superintendent may waive this requirement if it finds
that no environmental degradation will result.
   e.   When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the Town convert
the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert
concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the
Superintendent. The Town may establish equivalent mass limits only if the
industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in divisions e.(1)(a)
through e.(1)(e) below.
      (1)   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user
must:
         (a)   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of
its individual wastewater discharge permit;
         (b)   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
         (c)   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility’s
actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility’s long-term
average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-
term average production rate must be representative of current operating
conditions;
         (d)   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the discharge; and
         (e)   Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user’s request
for equivalent mass limits.
      (2)   An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
         (a)   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
         (b)   Continue to record the facility’s flow rates through the use of
a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
         (c)   Continue to record the facility’s production rates and notify
the Town and Superintendent whenever production rates are expected to vary by
more than 20% from its baseline production rates determined in division f.(l)
(c) of this section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the
[Superintendent] will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit
as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
         (d)   Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to division e.(l)(a) of
this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
      (3)   When developing equivalent mass limits, the Superintendent:
         (a)   Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial
user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for
the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
         (b)   Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess
the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect
changed conditions at the facility; and
         (c)   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial user’s actual
average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of
water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow
rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not
based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to § 9-184.
The industrial user must also be in compliance with § 9-266 regarding the
prohibition of bypass.
   f.   The Superintendent may convert the mass limits of the categorical
pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration
limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual
industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Superintendent.
   g.   Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the
equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated
categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived.
   h.   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where
such Standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be
used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation.
   i.   Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent
mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall
notify the Superintendent within two business days after the user has a
reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change
within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the Superintendent of
such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration
limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term
average production rate.

Sec. 9-182 Town's Right of Revision.
   The Town reserves the right to establish, by enabling ordinance or in
individual wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or
requirements on discharges to the POTW if deemed necessary to comply with the
objectives presented in §
9-170, or the general and specific prohibitions in §
9-178.
(Ord. No. 1862, § 2.5, 2-11-15)
Sec. 9-183 Special Agreement.
   The Town reserves the right to enter into special agreements with users
setting out special terms under which they may discharge into the POTW. In no
case will a special agreement waive compliance with a pretreatment standard or
requirements. However, the user may request a net gross adjustment to a
categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. They may also request a
variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from the EPA or Approval
Authority. Such a request will be approved only if the user can prove that
factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors
considered by the EPA when establishing that pretreatment standard. A user
requesting a fundamentally different factor variance must comply with the
procedural and substantive provisions in 40 C.F.R. 403.13.
(Ord. No. 1862, § 2.6, 2-11-15)
Sec. 9-184 Dilution.
   No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly
authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The
Superintendent may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to
meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when
the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is
later, existing categorical industrial users currently discharging to or
scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the Superintendent a report
which contains the information listed in paragraph b., below. At least 90 days
prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become
categorical industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical standard, shall submit to the Superintendent a report which
contains the information listed in paragraph b., below. A new source shall
report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable
categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its
anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
   b.   The users described above shall submit the information set forth below.
      (1)   All information required in §§
9-201a.(1)(a),

         (b)   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.
         (c)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process
if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula in 40
CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the Pretreatment Standards. Where an
alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40
CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted
to the Control Authority;
         (d)   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with §
9-224;
         (e)   The Superintendent may allow the submission of a baseline report
which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information
sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures;
         (f)   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of
sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
Discharges to the POTW.
      (3)   Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user’s
authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating
whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if
not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
      (4)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be
required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the
user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule
pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in §
9-216 .
      (5)   Signature and report certification. All baseline monitoring reports
must be certified in accordance with §
9-229  a. and signed by an authorized representative.

Sec. 9-216 Compliance Schedule Progress Reports.
   The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by
§
9-215 b.(4):
   a.   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for
the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and
operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
   b.   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months;
   c.   The user shall submit a progress report to the Superintendent no later
than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of
compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and
   d.   In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress
reports to the Superintendent.

Sec. 9-217 Report on Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard
Deadlines.
   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject
to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
Superintendent a report containing the information described in §
9-201 a.(6) and (7) and §
9-215 b.(2). For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established in accordance with the procedures in §
9-179, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user’s long-term
production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user’s actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with §
9-229 a.. All sampling will be done in conformance with §
9-225.
(Ord. No. 1862, § 6.3, 2-11-15)
Sec. 9-218 Periodic Compliance Reports.
   [Note: All SIUs are required to submit periodic compliance reports even if
they have been designated a non-significant categorical industrial user under
the provisions of §
9-218 c.]
   a.   All significant industrial users must, at a frequency determined by the
Superintendent submit no less than two times per year (June and December)
submit reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the
discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases
where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management
practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit
documentation required by the Superintendent or the pretreatment standard
necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. All periodic
compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with §
9-229 a.
   b.   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge.
   c.   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors
any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently
than required by the Superintendent, using the procedures prescribed in §
9-225, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
(Ord. No. 1862, § 6.4, 2-11-15)
Sec. 9-219 Reports of Changed Conditions.
   Each user must notify the Superintendent of any significant changes to the
user’s operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of
its wastewater at least 30 days before the change.
   a.   The Superintendent may require the user to submit such information as
may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §
9-201.
   b.   The Superintendent may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit
under §
9-207 or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under §
9-209 in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
   c.   No user shall implement the planned changed condition(s) until and
unless the Superintendent has responded to the user’s notice.
   d.   For purposes of this requirement, flow increases of 10% or greater, and
the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, shall be deemed
significant.
   e.   For purposes of this requirement, solid concentration (or strength)
increases of ten 10% or greater shall be deemed significant.
(Ord. No. 1862, § 6.5, 2-11-15)
Sec. 9-220 Reports of Potential Problems.
   a.   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch
discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems
for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the
Superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include the location of
the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and
corrective actions taken by the user.
   b.   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the Superintendent, submit a detailed written report describing the
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result
of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this ordinance.
   c.   Failure to notify the Town of potential problem discharges shall be
deemed a separate violation of this ordinance.
   d.   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in paragraph a., above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
   f.   Significant industrial users are required to notify the Superintendent
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug
discharge.
(Ord. No. 1862, § 6.6, 2-11-15)
Sec. 9-221 Reports from Unpermitted Users/Nonpermitted Users.
   All users not required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit
shall provide appropriate reports to the Superintendent as the Superintendent
may require.
(Ord. No. 1862, § 6.7, 2-11-15)
Sec. 9-222 Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting.
   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
the Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user
shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the Superintendent within 30 days after becoming aware of
the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the Town
performs sampling at the user’s facility at least once a month, or if the Town
performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was
conducted and the time when the user or the Town receives the results of this
sampling, or if the Town has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the
Industrial user.
(Ord. No. 1862, § 6.8, 2-11-15)
Sec. 9-223 Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste.
   a.   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once
for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed
conditions must be submitted under §
9-219. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
9-215,
9-217, and
9-218.
   b.   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph a. of this
section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
   c.   In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
Superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and
state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90
days of the effective date of such regulations.
   d.   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall
certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of
hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically
practical.
   e.   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this ordinance, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(Ord. No. 1862, § 6.9, 2-11-15)
Sec. 9-224 Analytical Requirements.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, and amendments
thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical Pretreatment
Standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques
for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136
sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated
analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures,
including procedures required by the Superintendent or other parties approved
by EPA.
(Ord. No. 1862, § 6.10, 2-11-15)
Sec. 9-225 Sample Collection.
   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data
obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
   a.   Except as indicated in divisions b. and c. of this section, the user
must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Superintendent. Where time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Town, the samples must be
representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures
as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the Town, as
appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with
instantaneous limits.
   b.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   c.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90 day
compliance reports required in §§
9-215 and
9-217 [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must be used
for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic
compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for
facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Superintendent
may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraphs in §
9-218 (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required to
collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a three days
from the date of the order. If the user does not come into compliance within
the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the
user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.

long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during
the period of violation.
   b.   Assessments may be added to the user’s next scheduled sewer service
charge and the Superintendent shall have such other collection remedies as may
be available for other service charges and fees.
   c.   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 18% of the unpaid balance, and interest shall
accrue thereafter at a rate of ½% per month. A lien may be recorded against the
user’s property shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
   d.   Users seeking to dispute such fines must file a written request for the
Superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine
amount within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has
merit, the Superintendent may convene a hearing on the matter within 15 days of
receiving the request from the user. In the event that the user’s appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be
returned to the user. The Superintendent may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   e.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

Sec. 9-244 Emergency Suspensions.
   a.   The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause
an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons.
The Superintendent may also immediately suspend a User’s discharge, after
notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to
the environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent
may permit the User to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless termination proceedings as set forth in §
9-245 are initiated against the user.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Superintendent prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under §§
9-240 or
9-245.

user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   b.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of paragraph c., below, are met.
   c.   A user who seeks to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the
Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset [if this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five says]:
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   d.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   e.   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   f.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power

9-178a. or the specific prohibitions in §§
9-178b.(3)-(7), (9)-(20), specifically excluding §
9-178b.(l ), (2) and (8), of this ordinance if it can prove that it did not
know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference, and
that either:
   a.   A Local Limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   b.   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when the Town was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

Sec. 9-266 Bypass.
   a.   For the purposes of this section:
      (1)   Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a user’s treatment facility.
      (2)   Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   b.   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of paragraphs c. and d. of this section.
   c.   Bypass notifications.
      (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Superintendent, at least ten days before the date of
the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Superintendent of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Superintendent may waive the written report on
a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
   d.   Bypass.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Superintendent may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under paragraph c. of
this section.
      (2)   The Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after

Article 11. Storm Drainage Control Regulations.
Division I. General Provisions.
Sec. 9-340 Purpose.
   a.   This ordinance is adopted in accordance with statutory authority
granted to the Schererville Town Council under "Home Rule" as well as the
"Indiana Drainage Code", and further is required by I.C. §§ 36-9-28.5 and 36-9-
27-69.5, Phase II of the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
program (FR Doc. 99-29181) authorized by the 1972 amendments to the Clean Water
Act, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management's Rule 13 (327 IAC 15-
13), and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management's Rule 5 (327 IAC
15-5), all as amended from time to time.
   b.   It is recognized that smaller streams and drainage channels serving the
Town of Schererville may not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey
storm water runoff, resulting when land use changes from open or agricultural
use to a more urbanized use. It is further recognized that deposits of sediment
from developments during and after construction can reduce capacities of storm
sewers and drainage systems and result in damages to receiving lakes and
streams.
   c.   Therefore, it shall be the policy of the Town of Schererville that the
storage and controlled release of storm water runoff shall be required of all
new development and new construction in the Town of Schererville. The release
rate of storm water from developed lands shall not exceed the release rate from
the land area in its present land use.
   d.   Because topography and the availability and adequacy of outlets for
storm runoff vary with almost every site, the requirements for the storm
drainage tend to be an individual matter for any project. It is recommended
that each proposed project be discussed with the MS4 Coordinator at the
earliest practical time in the planning stage.
   e.   The regulations set forth herein are made in order to promote the
public health, safety, comfort, morals, convenience and general public welfare.
The regulations are made in order that the environment may be protected and
that properly planned development may be promoted. Further, the regulations
prohibit illicit discharges and regulate the contribution of pollutants to the
stormwater drainage system and public waters from construction sites, new
development and redevelopment projects. Finally, the regulations establish
legal authority for the Town of Schererville and its designee(s) to inspect,
monitor and enforce compliance with this ordinance.

Sec. 9-341 Title.
   This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as "The Storm Drainage
Control Regulations Ordinance of the Town of Schererville, Lake County,
Indiana".

   Base fee $500 + (50 acres x $50 per acre) = $3,000 permit fee
   In this case a permit fee of $4,700 would be required as it is the greater
of the fee calculations.
2.   Single residential lot with single unit:
   Base fee $200 + $100 per one unit = $300 permit fee
3.   Single residential lot with a duplex unit:
   Base fee $200 + (2 x $100 per unit) = $400 permit fee
4.   Mixed use residential and non-residential of 100 acres total, including
residential: 75 acres and 200 residential lots and non-residential: 25 acres
and 12 non-residential lots
   Residential
   Base fee $500 + (200 lots x $35 per lot) = $7,500 permit fee
   Base fee $500 + (75 acres x $50 per acre) = $4,250 permit fee
   Non-residential
   Base fee $1,000 + (12 lots x $200 per lot) = $3,400 permit fee
   Base fee $1,000 + (25 acres x $100 per acre) = $3,500 permit fee
   In this case a permit fee of $7,500 for residential and $3,500 for non-
residential for a total permit fee of $11,000 would be required as it is the
greater of the fee calculations.
5.   Non-residential subdivision: with 15 acres and 6 lots.
   Base fee $1,000 + (6 lots x $200 per lot) = $2,200
   Base fee $1,000 + (15 acres x $100 per acre) = $2,500
   In this case a permit fee of $2,500 would be required as it is the greater
of the fee calculations.
6.   Non-residential lot with a single unit:
   Base fee $400 + $250 per one unit = $650 permit fee
7.   Non-residential lot with 5 units:
   Base fee $400 + (5 units x $250 per unit) = $1,650 permit fee
   b.   A re-inspection fee shall be applicable when inspections of site
improvements fail to meet approved plan submittals or where a violation of this
ordinance exists.
   c.   Prior to the commencement of construction, storm water BMP's, in

Sec. 9-381 Computational Methods.
   a.   For project areas up to and including five (5) acres or tributary
drainage areas up to and including fifty (50) acres, the Rational Method may be
used. In the Rational Method, the peak rate of runoff, Q, in cubic feet per
second is computed as:
   Q = CIA
where: C = runoff coefficient, representing the characteristics of the drainage
area and defined as the ratio of runoff to rainfall. I = average intensity of
rainfall in inches per hour for a duration equal to the time of concentration
(tc) for a selected rainfall frequency. A = tributary drainage area in acres.
Guidance to selection of the runoff coefficient "C" is provided by Table 1 and
Table 1A which show values for different types of surface and local soil
characteristics. The composite "C" value used for a given drainage area with
various surface types shall be the weighted average value for the total area
calculated from a breakdown of individual areas having different surface types.
   Table 2 provides runoff coefficients and inlet times for different land use
classifications. In the instance of undeveloped land situated in an upstream
area, a coefficient or coefficients shall be used for this area in its present
or existing state of development.

2.   Rolling terrain 2 - 7% slopes.
3.   Steep terrain greater than 7% slopes.
4.   Interpolation, extrapolation and adjustment for local conditions shall be
based on engineering experience and judgment.
   Rainfall intensity shall be determined from the rainfall frequency curves
shown in Figure 1 or from data shown in Table 5A. The time of concentration
(tc) to be used shall be the sum of the inlet time and flow time in the
drainage facility from the most remote part of the drainage area to the point
under consideration. The flow time in the storm sewers may be estimated by the
distance in feet divided by velocity of flow in feet per second. The velocity
shall be determined by the Manning Formula.
   Inlet time is the combined time required for the runoff to reach the inlet
of the storm sewer. It includes overland flow time and flow time through
established surface drainage channels such as swales, ditches and sheet flow
across such areas as lawns, fields, and other graded surfaces. It may be
computed by using HEC-22, TR-20 or TR-55 methods.
   b.   The runoff rate for drainage areas in excess of one hundred (100) acres
shall be determined by computer simulation methods acceptable to the Town
Engineer and Department of Planning and Building.
   c.   Projects which include construction in a floodway shall conform to the
requirements of Division IV.

follows:
   a.   The minor drainage system such as inlets, catch basins, street gutters,
swales, sewers and small channels which collect storm water must accommodate
peak runoff from a 10-year return period storm. Rainfall duration shall be
equal to the time of concentration or one (1) hour if the time of concentration
is less than one (1) hour. A first quartile storm distribution shall be used
for computer modeling. These minimum requirements must be satisfied:
      1.   The allowable spread of water on collector streets is limited to
maintaining two (2) clear ten (10) foot moving lanes of traffic. One (1) lane
is to be maintained on local roads.
      2.   Open channels carrying peak flows greater than thirty (30) cubic
feet per second shall be capable of accommodating peak runoff for a 50-year
return period storm within the drainage easement.
      3.   Culverts shall be capable of accommodating peak runoff from a 50-
year return period storm when crossing under a road which is part of the
Indiana Department of Transportation functional classification system and are

Sec. 9-390 General.
   All storm sewers, whether private or public, and whether constructed on
private or public property shall conform to the design standards and other
requirements contained herein.
   a.   Manning Equation. The hydraulic capacity of storm sewers shall be

      V = 1.486 2/3 1/2
       n R S
      V = mean velocity of flow in feet per second
      R = the hydraulic radius in feet
      S = the slope of the energy grade line in feet per foot
      n = roughness coefficient, Manning's "n"
   The hydraulic radius, R, is defined as the cross sectional area of flow
divided by the wetted flow surface or wetted perimeter. Typical "n" values and
maximum permissible velocities for storm sewer materials are listed in Table 3.
Roughness coefficient (n) values for other sewer materials can be found in
standard hydraulics texts and references.
   b.   Minimum Size. The minimum size of all storm sewers shall be twelve (12)
inches, except for house connections which will be six (6) inches. Rate of
release for detention storage shall be controlled by an orifice plate or other
devices, subject to the approval of the Town Engineer, with the developer to
have the right to appeal the determination of the Town Engineer to the
Department of Planning and Building within thirty (30) days of such
determination.
   c.   Grade. Sewer grade shall be such that, in general, a minimum of two (2)
feet of cover is maintained over the top of the pipe. Pipe cover less than the
minimum may be used only upon the approval of the Department of Planning and
Building after review and recommendation of the Town Engineer. Uniform slopes
shall be maintained between inlets, manholes and inlets to manholes. Final
grade shall be set with full consideration of the capacity required,
sedimentation problems and other design parameters. Minimum and maximum
allowable slopes shall be those capable of producing velocities of two and one-
half (2-1/2) and fifteen (15) feet per second, respectively, when the sewer is
flowing full.

Division IX. Open Channel Design Standards.
Sec. 9-395 General.
   All open channels, whether private or public, and whether constructed on
private or public land, shall conform to the design standards and other design
requirements contained herein.
   a.   Manning Equation. The waterway for channels shall be determined using
Manning's Equation.
      Q = AV = A 1.486   2/3   1/2
            N   R   S
   Where   A = Waterway area of channel in square feet
         Q = Discharge in cubic feet per second (cfs)
         V, R, S and n are explained in Division VIII, Section
9-390(a).
   b.   Channel Cross Section and Grade. The required channel cross section and
grade are determined by the design capacity, the material in which the channel
is to be constructed, and the requirements for maintenance. A minimum depth may
be required to provide adequate outlets for subsurface drains, tributary
ditches, or streams. The channel grade shall be such that the velocity in the
channel is high enough to prevent siltation but low enough to prevent erosion.
Velocities less than two (2) feet per second should be avoided because
siltation will take place and ultimately reduce the channel cross section. The
maximum permissible velocities in vegetative, lined channels are shown in Table
4. Developments through which the channel is to be constructed must be
considered in design of the channel section.
   c.   Side Slopes. Earthen channel side slopes shall be no steeper than three
(3) to one (1). Flatter slopes may be required to prevent erosion and for ease
of maintenance. Where channels will be lined, side slopes shall be no steeper
than two (2) to one (1) with adequate provisions made for weep holes. Side
slopes steeper than two (2) to one (1) may be used for lined channels provided
that the side lining and structural retaining wall are designed and constructed
with provisions for live and dead load surcharge.
   d.   When design discharge produces a depth greater than three (3) feet in
the channel, add appropriate safety precautions based on reasonably anticipated
need.

(1)   From Soil Conversation Service, SCS-TP-61, "Handbook of Channel Design
for Soil and Water Conservation".
(2)   Use velocities exceeding 5 feet per second only where good cover and
proper maintenance can be obtained.
(3)   Do not use on slopes steeper than 10 percent except for vegetated side
slopes in combination with a stone, concrete, or highly resistant vegetative
center section.
(4)   Do not use on slopes steeper than 5 percent except for vegetated sided
slopes in combination with a stone, concrete or highly resistant vegetative
center section.
(5)   Annuals – use on mild slopes or as temporary protection until permanent
covers are established.
(6)   Use on slopes steeper than 5 percent is not recommended.
   e.   Channel Stability.
      1.   Characteristics of a stable channel are:
         A.   It neither aggrades nor degrades beyond tolerable limits;
         B.   The channel banks do not erode to the extent that the channel
cross section is changed appreciably;
         C.   Excessive sediment bars do not develop;
         D.   Excessive erosion does not occur around culverts, bridges or
elsewhere; and
         E.   Gullies do not form or enlarge due to the entry of uncontrolled
surface flow to the channel.
      2.   Channel design for soil and water conservation.
         A.   Channel stability shall be determined for an aged condition and
the velocity shall be based on the design flow or the bank full flow, whichever
is greater, using "n" values for various channel linings as shown in Table 3.
In no case is it necessary to check channel stability for discharges greater
than that from a 100-year return period storm.
         B.   Channel stability must be checked for conditions immediately
after construction. For this stability analysis, the velocity shall be
calculated for the expected flow from a 10-year return period storm on the
watershed, or the bank full flow, which is smaller. The "n" value for newly
constructed channels in fine-grained soils and sands may be determined in
accordance with the National Engineering Handbook 5, Supplement B, Soil
Conservation Service and shall not exceed 0.025. The allowable velocity in the
newly constructed channel may be increased by a maximum of twenty percent (20%)
to reflect the effects of vegetation to be established under the following
conditions:
            i.   The soil and site in which the channel is to be constructed
are suitable for rapid establishment and support of erosion controlling
vegetation;
            ii.   Species of erosion controlling vegetation adapted to the
area, and proven methods of establishment are shown; and
            iii.   The channel design includes detailed plans for establishment
of vegetation on the channel side slopes.
   f.   Drainage of Waterways. Vegetated waterways that are subject to low
flows of long duration or where wet conditions prevail shall be drained with a
tile system or by other means such as paved gutters. Tile lines may be
outletted through a drop structure at the end of the waterway or through a
standard tile outlet.
   g.   Establishment of New Regulated Drain. When the Department of Planning
and Building determines it is necessary to establish a new regulated drain, the
applicant must provide the necessary information and meet the requirements of
the State of Indiana Drainage Code, as amended from time to time, for the
establishment of a new regulated drain. The Department of Planning and Building
shall determine the necessary easements for adequate maintenance of any new
regulated drain, if appropriate.
   h.   Appurtenant Structures. The design of channels will provide all
structures required for the proper functioning of the channel and the laterals
thereto and travel ways for operation and maintenance. Recessed inlets and
structures needed for entry of surface and subsurface flow into channels
without significant erosion or degradation shall be included in the design of
channel improvements. The design is also to provide the necessary flood gates,
water level control devices, and any other appurtenance affecting the
functioning of the channels and the attainment of the purpose for which they
are built. The effect of channel improvements on existing culverts, bridges,
buried cables, pipelines and inlet structures for surface and subsurface
drainage on the channel being improved and laterals thereto shall be evaluated
to determine the need for modification or replacement. Culverts and bridges
which are modified or added as part of channel improvement projects shall meet
reasonable standards for the type of structure, and shall have a minimum
capacity equal to the design discharge or governmental agency design
requirements, whichever is greater.
   i.   Disposition of Spoil. Spoil material resulting from clearing, grubbing
and channel excavation shall be disposed in such a manner which will:
      1.   Minimize over bank wash;
      2.   Provide for the free flow of water between the channel and
floodplain unless the valley routing and water surface profile are based on
continuous dikes being installed;
      3.   Not hinder the development of travel ways for maintenance;
      4.   Leave the right-of-way in the best condition feasible, consistent
with the project purposes, for productive use by the owner;
      5.   Improve the aesthetic appearance of the site to the greatest extent
feasible; or
      6.   Be approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources or United
States Army Corps of Engineers (whichever is applicable) if deposited in the
floodway.
(Ord. No. 1708, 6-13-07)
Sec. 9-396 Construction and Materials.
   a.   Specifications shall be in keeping with the current standards of
engineering practice and shall describe the requirements for proper
installation of the project to achieve its intended purpose.
   b.   Materials acceptable for channel lining are:
      1.   Grass;
      2.   Revetment riprap;
      3.   Concrete;
      4.   Hand-laid riprap;
      5.   Precast cement concrete riprap;
      6.   Grouted riprap; and
      7.   Gabions.
   c.   Other channel lining materials shall receive specific approval of the
Town Engineer and/or Department of Planning and Building. Materials shall
comply with the latest edition of the Indiana Department of Transportation
"Standard Specifications".

Division X. Storm Water Detentions.
Sec. 9-400 General.
   The following shall govern the design of any improvement with respect to the
detention of storm water runoff.
(Ord. No. 1708, 6-13-07)
Sec. 9-401 Acceptable Detention Methods.
   The increased storm water runoff resulting from a proposed development
should be detained on-site by the provisions of appropriate wet or dry bottom
reservoirs, by storage on flat roofs, parking lots, streets, lawns, or other
acceptable techniques. Measures which retard the rate of overland flow and the
velocity in runoff channels shall also be used to control the runoff rate
partially. Detention basins shall be sized to store flows from storms with a
100-year return period. Control devices shall limit the discharge to a rate no
greater than that prescribed by this ordinance, as amended from time to time.
(Ord. No. 1708, 6-13-07)
Sec. 9-402 Design Storm.
   Design of storm water detention facilities shall be based on a return period
of one (1) time in one hundred (100) years. The storage volume and outflow rate
shall be sufficient to handle storm water runoff from a critical duration
storm, as defined herein. Rainfall depth-duration-frequency relationships and
intensity-duration-frequency relationships shall be those given in Tables 5 and
5A.
(Ord. No. 1708, 6-13-07)
Sec. 9-403 Allowable Release Rate.
   a.   The allowable release rate of storm water originating from a proposed
development shall not exceed the amount specified herein under Storm Water
Control Policy, and as described herein.
   b.   In the event the natural downstream channel or storm sewer system is
inadequate to accommodate the release rate provided above, then the allowable
release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted by the capacity of the
receiving downstream channel or storm sewer system and additional detention as
determined by the Town Engineer or its designee after review and recommendation
of the Plan Commission shall be required to store that portion of the runoff
exceeding the capacity of the receiving sewers or waterways.
   c.   If more than one (1) detention basin is involved in the development of
the area upstream of the limiting restriction, the allowable release rate from
any one (1) detention basin shall be in direct proportion to the ratio of its
drainage area to the drainage area of the entire watershed upstream of the
restriction.

Sec. 9-404 Drainage System Overflow Design.
   Drainage systems shall have adequate capacity to convey the storm water
runoff from all upstream tributary areas through the development under
consideration for a storm of 100-year design period calculated on the basis of
the upstream land in its present state of development. An allowance, equivalent

(Ord. No. 1708, 6-13-07)
Sec. 9-405 Determination of Storage Volume – Rational Method.
   For project areas of five (5) acres or less or drainage areas of fifty (50)
acres or less, the Rational Method may be used to determine the required volume
of storm water storage. The following eleven (11) step procedure may be used to
determine the required volume of storage. Other design methods may also be
used, subject to the approval of the Town Engineer in conformance with
generally accepted engineering standards and practices. Due to existing
limitations within the drainage basin or downstream route, the Plan Commission
or Town Engineer may require additional storage above the calculated value.
   Steps      Procedure
   1.      Determine total drainage area in acres "A";
   2.      Determine composite runoff coefficient "Cu" based on existing land
use (undeveloped);
   3.      Determine time of concentration "tc" in minutes based on existing
conditions;
   4.      Determine rainfall intensity "Iu" in inches per hour, based on time
of concentration and using Figure 1 or from data given in Table 5A for the 10-
year return period;
   5.      Compute runoff based on existing land use (undeveloped), and 10-year
return period:
                  Qu = CuIuA
   6.      Determine composite runoff coefficient "Cd" based on developed
conditions and a 100-year return period;
   7.      Determine the 100-year return period rainfall intensity "Id" for
various storm durations "td" up through the time of concentration for the
developed area using Table 5A;
   8.      Determine developed inflow rates "Qd" for various storm durations
"td", measured in hours.
                  Qd = Cd Id A
   9.      Compute a storage rate "Std" for various storm durations "td" up
through the time of concentration of the developed area.
                  Std = Qd – Qu
   10.      Compute required storage volume "SR" in acre-feet for each storm
duration "td". This assumes a triangular hydrograph of duration (2*td) hours
with the peak flow of Std at td hours.
                  SR = Std (td / 12)
   11.      Select the largest storage volume computed in Step 10 for detention
basin design.
(Ord. No. 1708, 6-13-07)
Sec. 9-406 Determination of Storage Volume – Other Methods.
   Methods other than the rational method for determining runoff and routing of
storm water may be used to determine the storage volume required to control
storm water runoff. The procedures or methods used must receive the prior
approval of the Town Engineer. The ILLUDAS, TR-20 and TR-55 models, and other
similar computer programs are approved for appropriate use in analysis of the
runoff and routing of storm water. The use of these models or other approved
procedures can be defined in a seven (7) step procedure to determine the
required storage volume of the detention basin.
   Step      Procedure
   1.      Calibrate the hydrologic/hydraulic model that is to be used for
prediction of runoff and routing of storm water;
   2.      For each storm duration listed in Table 5, perform steps three (3)
through six (6);
   3.      Determine the 10-year, undeveloped peak flow. Denote this flow by
Qu10.
   4.      Determine the 100-year runoff hydrograph (Hd100) for developed
conditions;
   5.      Determine the hydrograph that must be stored (Hs100) by subtracting
a flow up to Qu10 from the hydrograph (Hd100) found in Step 4;
   6.      Determine the volume of water (Vs) to be stored by calculating the
area under the hydrograph Hs100;
   7.      The detention basin must be designed to store the largest volume
(Vs) found for any storm duration analyzed in Step 6.

Article 2. Flood Plain Development Regulations.
Sec. 10-25 Statutory Authorization; Findings of Fact.
   a.   Statutory Authorization. The Indiana Legislature has, in I.C. 36-7-
4 and I.C. 14-28-4, granted the power to local government units to control land
use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the Town Council of the Town of
Schererville does hereby adopt the following replacement Floodplain Management
Regulations for the Town of Schererville.
   b.   Findings of Fact.
      1.   The flood hazard areas of the Town of Schererville are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
      2.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities,
and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-
proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. No. 1879, § 1, 3-9-16)
Sec. 10-26 Statement of Purpose; Objectives.
   a.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Article to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      1.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
      2.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      3.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
      4.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage;
      5.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and,
      6.   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the Town by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   b.   Objectives. The objectives of this article are:
      1.   To protect human life and health;
      2.   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      3.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      4.   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      5.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains;
      6.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood
blight areas, and;
      7.   To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in
a flood area.
(Ord. No. 1879, § 1, 3-9-16)
Sec. 10-27 Definitions.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this Article
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this Article it’s most reasonable application.
   a.   A zone - means portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of
flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A
zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a
significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE5
Zones A1-A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions
are presented below:
      1.   Zone A - areas subject to inundation by the one-percent (1%) annual
chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been
performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown.
      2.   Zone AE and A1-A30 - Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent
(1%) annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood
elevations are shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in
place of Zones A1-A30.)
      3.   Zone AO - Areas subject to inundation by one-percent (1%) annual
chance shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average
depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from
detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      4.   Zone AH - Areas subject to inundation by one-percent (1%) annual
chance shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      5.   Zone AR - Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      6.   Zone A99 - Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent (1%)
annual chance flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon
completion of an under-construction Federal flood protection system. These are
areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the
construction of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to
consider it complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used
when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress
toward completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown.
   b.   Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) - means a structure with a
floor area 400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of
property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the
use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a
minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be
designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory
structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay
sheds.
   c.   Addition (to an existing structure) - means any walled and roofed
expansion to the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by
a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed
addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent
perimeter load-bearing walls, is new construction.
   d.   Appeal - means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this Article or a request for a variance.
   e.   Area of shallow flooding - means a designated AO or AH Zone on the
community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one (1)
to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the
path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow
may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   f.   Base Flood - means the flood having a one-percent (1%) chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   g.   Base Flood Elevation (BFE) - means the elevation of the one-percent
(1%) annual chance flood.
   h.   Basement - means that portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade
(below ground level) on all sides.
   i.   Boundary River - means the part of the Ohio River that forms the
boundary between Kentucky and Indiana.
   j.   Boundary River Floodway - means the floodway of a boundary river.
   k.   Building - see “Structure.”
   l.   Community - means a political entity that has the authority to adopt
and enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   m.   Community Rating System (CRS) - means a program developed by the
Federal Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in
the Regular Program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management
requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   n.   Critical facility - means facilities for which even a slight chance of
flooding might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited
to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   o.   D Zone - means unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined,
but flooding is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating
communities but is not required by regulation in this zone.
   p.   Development - means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate including but not limited to:
      1.   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any
addition to a structure;
      2.   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home or installing a recreational vehicle on a site for more than
one hundred eighty (180) days;
      3.   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction of
roads, or similar projects;
      4.   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements, etc.;
      5.   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling
operations;
      6.   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
      7.   Storage of materials; or
      8.   Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
      9.   Development does not include activities such as the maintenance of
existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing
roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent
structures.
   q.   Elevated structure - means a non-basement structure built to have the
lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation
perimeter walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls),
pilings, or columns (posts and piers).
   r.   Elevation Certificate - is a certified statement that verifies a
structure’s elevation information.
   s.   Emergency Program - means the first phase under which a community
participates in the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of
insurance at subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community
before the effective date of the initial FIRM.
   t.   Encroachment - means the advance or infringement of uses, fill,
excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain,
which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   u.   Existing Construction - means any structure for which the “start of
construction” commenced before the effective date of the community’s first
floodplain ordinance.
   v.   Existing manufactured home park or subdivision - means a manufactured
home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a
minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either
final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the
effective date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
   w.   Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision - means
the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including
the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final
site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   x.   FEMA - means the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   y.   Five-hundred year flood (500-year flood) - means the flood that has a
0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year.
   z.   Flood - means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete

regulations are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain
ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain management
requirements.
   jj.   Floodproofing (dry floodproofing) - is a method of protecting a
structure that ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities
and sanitary facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation
with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All
structural components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated
debris impact forces.
   kk.   Floodproofing certificate - is a form used to certify compliance for
nonresidential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect.
   ll.   Floodway - is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of

manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   pp.   Hardship (as related to variances of this Article) - means the
exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested
variance. The Town of Schererville Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the
variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere
economic or financial hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience,
aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the
disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an
exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means
without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or
requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different
use than originally intended.
   qq.   Highest adjacent grade - means the highest natural elevation of the
ground surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls
of a structure.

Sites and Structures.
   ss.   Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC) - means the cost to repair a
substantially damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that
is required to bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the
local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are
elevation, relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and
new business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC coverage.
   tt.   Letter of Final Determination (LFD) - means a letter issued by FEMA
during the mapping update process which establishes final elevations and
provides the new flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates
the six-month adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain
management regulations during this six-month period unless the community has
previously incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   uu.   Letter of Map Change (LOMC) - is a general term used to refer to the
several types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished
by letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision

resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one (1)
square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such

first revision.)
   bbb.   Market value - means the building value, excluding the land (as
agreed to between a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local
real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent
certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual
cash value), or adjusted assessed values.
   ccc.   Mitigation - means sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate
long-term risk to people and property from hazards and their effects. The
purpose of mitigation is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to
minimize the cost of disaster response and recovery.

any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   kkk.   One-hundred year flood (100-year flood) - is the flood that has a one
percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood
zone that begins with the letter A is subject to the one-percent annual chance

structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost
of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or
exceeded twenty-five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   www.   Section 1316 - is that section of the National Flood Insurance Act of
1968, as amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be
provided for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a

placement or permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slabs or footing, installation of piles, construction of columns, or
any work beyond the stage of excavation for placement of a manufactured home on
a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the

addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
“start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures that
have incurred “repetitive loss” or “substantial damage” regardless of the
actual repair work performed. The term does not include improvements of
structures to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary,
or safety code requirements or any alteration of a “historic structure”,
provided that the alteration will not preclude the structures continued
designation as a “historic structure”.
   cccc.   Suspension - means the removal of a participating community from the
NFIP because the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper
floodplain management regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   dddd.   Variance - is a grant of relief from the requirements of this
Article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this
Article where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   eeee.   Violation - means the failure of a structure or other development to

older FIRMs) designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of
flooding is less than 0.2 percent.
   iiii.   Zone - means a geographical area shown on a FHBM or FIRM that
reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area.
   jjjj.   Zone A - (See definition for A zone).
   kkkk.   Zone B, C, and X - means areas identified in the community as areas
of moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area.
However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated
rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is
available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in
these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and
C.)

   a.   Lands to Which This Article Applies. This Article shall apply to all
SFHAs and known flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the Town of
Schererville.
   b.   Basis for Establishing Regulatory Flood Data. This Article’s protection
standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory flood data is
listed below.
      1.   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the Town of Schererville shall be as
delineated on the one-percent annual chance flood profiles in the Flood
Insurance Study of Lake County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas dated January
18, 2012 and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map dated January 18, 2012
as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date.
      2.   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each
of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the Town of Schererville, delineated as
an “A Zone” on the Lake County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance
Rate Map dated January 18, 2012 as well as any future updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area
from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace existing
data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and subsequently approved.
      3.   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification
on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of
any watercourse in the community’s known flood prone areas shall be according
to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater
than one square mile.
      4.   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.
(Ord. No. 1879, § 1, 3-9-16)
Sec. 10-29 Establishment of Floodplain Development Permit.
   A Floodplain Development Permit shall be required in conformance with the
provisions of this Article prior to the commencement of any development
activities in areas of special flood hazard.
(Ord. No. 1879, § 1, 3-9-16)
Sec. 10-30 Compliance.
   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally
altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of this Article
and other applicable regulations. No land or stream within the SFHA shall
hereafter be altered without full compliance with the terms of this Article and
other applicable regulations.
(Ord. No. 1879, § 1, 3-9-16)
Sec. 10-31 Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
   This Article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this Article and
another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions
shall prevail.
(Ord. No. 1879, § 1, 3-9-16)
Sec. 10-32 Discrepancy between Mapped Floodplain and Actual Ground Elevations.
   a.   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles shall govern.
   b.   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
   c.   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the
base flood elevation and not located in the floodway, that site shall be
considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied.
The property owner should be advised to apply for a LOMA.
(Ord. No. 1879, § 1, 3-9-16)
Sec. 10-33 Interpretation.
   In the interpretation and application of this Article all provisions shall
be:
   a.   Considered as minimum requirements;

   c.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state
statutes.
(Ord. No. 1879, § 1, 3-9-16)
Sec. 10-34 Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
   The degree of flood protection required by this Article is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this Article does not create any
liability on the part of the Town of Schererville, the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results
from reliance on this Article or any administrative decision made lawfully
thereunder.
(Ord. No. 1879, § 1, 3-9-16)
Sec. 10-35 Penalties for Violation.
   Failure to obtain a Floodplain Development Permit in the SFHA or failure to
comply with the requirements of a Floodplain Development Permit or conditions
of a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this Article. All violations
shall be considered a common nuisance and be treated as such in accordance with
the provisions of the Zoning Code for The Town of Schererville. All violations
shall be punishable by a fine ranging from a minimum of twenty-five dollars
($25.00) per day to a maximum of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00)
per day.
   a.   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the violation
continues to exist.
   b.   The Town of Schererville Town Council shall inform the owner that any
such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and
therefore may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be
suspended.
   c.   Nothing herein shall prevent the Town of Schererville from taking such
other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.
(Ord. No. 1879, § 1, 3-9-16)
Sec. 10-36 Increased Cost of Compliance (ICO).
   In order for buildings to qualify for a claim payment under ICC coverage as
a “repetitive loss structure”, the National Reform Act of 1994 requires that
the building be covered by a contract for flood insurance and incur flood-
related damages on two occasions during a 10-year period ending on the date of
the event for which the second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing
the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded twenty-five percent (25%)
of the market value of the building at the time of each such flood event.
(Ord. No. 1879, § 1, 3-9-16)
Sec. 10-37 Administration.
   a.   Designation of Administrator. The Town Council of the Town of

shall be made to the Floodplain Administrator on forms furnished by him or her
prior to any development activities, and may include, but not be limited to,
the following plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location,
dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed
structures, earthen fill, storage of materials or equipment, drainage
facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically the following
information is required:

         A.   A description of the proposed development;
         B.   Location of the proposed development sufficient to accurately
locate property and structure in relation to existing roads and streams;
         C.   A legal description of the property site;
         D.   A site development plan showing existing and proposed development
locations and existing and proposed land grades;
         E.   Elevation of the top of the planned lowest floor (including
basement) of all proposed buildings. Elevation should be in NAVD 88 or NGVD;
         F.   Elevation (in NAVD 88 or NGVD) to which any nonresidential
structure will be floodproofed;
         G.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of proposed development; and
         H.   A hydrologic and hydraulic engineering study is required and any
watercourse changes submitted to DNR for approval and then to FEMA as a Letter
of Map Revision. (See Section
10-38b.6. for additional information.)
      2.   Construction stage.
         A.   Upon establishment of the lowest floor of an elevated structure
or structure constructed on fill, it shall be the duty of the applicant to
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the NAVD 88 or NGVD
elevation of the lowest floor, as built. Said certification shall be prepared
by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or
professional engineer and certified by the same. The Floodplain Administrator
shall review the lowest floor elevation survey data submitted. The applicant
shall correct deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is
allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said
corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the
project. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the elevation certification
shall be at the applicant’s risk.
         B.   Upon establishment of the floodproofed elevation of a
floodproofed structure, it shall be the duty of the applicant to submit to the
Floodplain Administrator a floodproofing certificate. Certification shall be
prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered professional
engineer and certified by same. (The Floodplain Administrator shall review the
floodproofing certification submitted.) The applicant shall correct any
deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is allowed to
proceed. Failure to submit the floodproofing certification or failure to make
correction required shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
      3.   Finished Construction. Upon completion of construction, an elevation
certification (FEMA Elevation Certificate Form 81-31 or any future updates)
which depicts the “as-built” lowest floor elevation is required to be submitted
to the Floodplain Administrator. If the project includes a floodproofing
measure, floodproofing certification (FEMA Floodproofing Certificate Form 81-65

      6.   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned
or finished into separate rooms; and
      7.   The interior grade of such enclosed area shall be at an elevation at
or higher than the exterior grade; and
      8.   Property owners shall be required to execute a flood openings/
venting affidavit acknowledging that all openings will be maintained as flood
vents, and that the elimination or alteration of the openings in any way will
violate the requirements of Section
10-40d. Periodic inspections will be conducted by the Floodplain Administrator
to ensure compliance. The affidavit shall be recorded in the office of the Lake
County Recorder.
      9.   Property owners shall be required to execute and record with the
structure’s deed a non-conversion agreement declaring that the area below the
lowest floor (where the interior height of the enclosure exceeds 6 feet) shall
not be improved, finished or otherwise converted; the community will have the
right to inspect the enclosed area. The non-conversion agreement shall be
recorded in the office of the Lake County Recorder.
   e.   Structures Constructed on Fill. A residential or nonresidential
structure may be constructed on a permanent land fill in accordance with the
following:
      1.   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot (1) deep

test showing compliance shall be retained in the permit file.
      2.   The fill should extend at least ten feet (10) beyond the foundation
of the structure before sloping below the BFE.
      3.   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during
flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulkheading. If vegetative cover is
used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three (3) horizontal to one (1)
vertical.
      4.   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties.
      5.   The top of the lowest floor including basements shall be at or above
the FPG.
      6.   Fill shall be composed of clean granular or earthen material.
   f.   Standards for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles.
Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially
improved on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days must meet one
(1) of the following requirements:
      1.   These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed on a
site outside a manufactured home park or subdivision; in a new manufactured

   h.   Above Ground Gas or Liquid Storage Tanks. All above ground gas or
liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral
movement.
(Ord. No. 1879, § 1, 3-9-16)
Sec. 10-41 Standards for Subdivision Proposals.
   a.   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize
flood damage;
   b.   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage;
   c.   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards; and
   d.   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals

(Ord. No. 1879, § 1, 3-9-16)
Sec. 10-42 Critical Facility.
   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities
shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and
sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be
displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above
the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. No. 1879, § 1, 3-9-16)
Sec. 10-43 Standards for Identified Floodways.
   a.   Located within SFHAs, established in Section
10-28b. are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to die issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of non-substantial additions/ improvements to residences in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval (construction in a floodway permit) for the fill is required from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources.)
   b.   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a permit
or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in the
floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit,
provided the provisions contained in Sections
10-39 through
10-46 of this Article have been met. The Floodplain Development Permit cannot
be less restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community’s more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
   c.   No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, will adversely affect the efficiency of,
or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is defined
as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least fifteen-
hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood
elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway
condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
   d.   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees), the Town of Schererville shall submit the data and request that the
Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per
mapping standard regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
(Ord. No. 1879, § 1, 3-9-16)
Sec. 10-44 Standards for Identified Fringe.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit provided the
provisions contained in Sections
10-39 through
10-46 of this Article have been met. The key provision is that the top of the
lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or
above the FPG.
(Ord. No. 1879, § 1, 3-9-16)
Sec. 10-45 Standards for SFHAs Without Established Base Flood Elevation and/or
Floodways/Fringes.
   a.   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one (1) square mile:
      1.   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one (1) square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      2.   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the one-
percent annual chance flood elevation and the recommended Flood Protection
Grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      3.   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit for
construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a Floodplain
Development Permit may be issued provided the conditions of the Floodplain
Development Permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions contained in
Sections
10-39 through
10-46 of this Article have been met.
   b.   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one (1) square mile:
      1.   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one (1) square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and one-percent (1%) annual chance flood elevation for
the site.
      2.   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in Sections
10-39 through
10-46 of this Article have been met.
   c.   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot (1) and will not increase flood
damages or potential flood damages.
(Ord. No. 1879, § 1, 3-9-16)
Sec. 10-46 Standards for Flood Prone Areas.
   All development in known flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or
where no FEMA published map is available, shall meet applicable standards as
required per Sections
10-39 through
10-46.
(Ord. No. 1879, § 1, 3-9-16)
Sec. 10-47 Variance Procedures.
   a.   Designation of Variance and Appeals Board. The Board of Zoning Appeals
of the Town of Schererville, as established by the Town Council of the Town of
Schererville, Lake County, Indiana, shall hear and decide appeals and requests
for variances from requirements of this Article.
   b.   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board. The board shall hear and decide
appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination is made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this Article. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the
board may appeal such decision to the Lake County Circuit or Superior Court.
   c.   Variance Procedures. In passing upon such applications, the
Schererville Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations,
all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this
Article; and
      1.   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      2.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      3.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      4.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      6.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      7.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      8.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      9.   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
of transport of the floodwaters at the site; and
      10.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
(Ord. No. 1879, § 1, 3-9-16)
Sec. 10-48 Conditions for Variances.
   a.   Variances shall only be issued when there is:
      1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship; and
      3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
   b.   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to Section
10-43 or Section
10-45a. of this Article may be granted.
   c.   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to Section
10-43 or Section
10-45a. of this Article will require a permit from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources.
   d.   Variances to the Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction of Section
10-40, may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one-half (½) acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
   e.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   f.   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of any
structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
   g.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the Flood Protection Grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation (See Section
10-49).
   h.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request (See Section
10-49).
(Ord. No. 1879, § 1, 3-9-16)
Sec. 10-49 Variance Notification.
   a.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted that allows the lowest
floor of a structure to be built below the flood protection grade shall be
given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      1.   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the Flood
Protection Grade will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25) for one hundred dollars ($100)
of insurance coverage; and
      2.   Such construction below the Flood Protection Grade increases risks
to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the County Recorder and shall be recorded in a

Table 5. Town Council Ordinances
   The researcher should be aware that the Date of Passage is the constant
factor in this TABLE. In light of the fact that the Town of Schererville often
identifies an amendment to an ordinance by referring to its original number,
and the fact that the Ordinance No. assigned to a particular ordinance has not
been consistent chronologically over the years, we have included that in its
chronological date of passage for reference purposes.
