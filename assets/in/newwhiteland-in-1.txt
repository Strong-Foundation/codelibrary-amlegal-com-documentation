§ 10.06 SEVERABILITY.

or application.
   (B)   (1)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code
containing a non-severability provision, each division or part of every section
is severable.
      (2)   If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the
invalidity does not affect the remainder of the section unless:
         (a)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with
and so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
         (b)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in

whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a section or amendment stating that the provisions of a

§ 10.07 REFERENCE TO OTHER SECTIONS.
   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof, the

refers to any board, commission, department, officer, agency, authority or
instrumentality of the town, and that name designation is incorrectly stated on
the effective date of that ordinance or following the effective date, the
rights, powers, duties or liabilities placed with that entity are or were
transferred to a different entity then the named board, commission, department,
officer, agency, authority or instrumentality of the town, whether correctly
named in the ordinance at its effective date or not, means that correctly named
entity, or the entity to which the duties, liabilities, powers and rights were
transferred.
(I.C. 1-1-6-1)
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any

the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
the error.
§ 10.10 REASONABLE TIME.
   (A)   In all cases where an ordinance requires an act to be done in a
reasonable time or requires reasonable notice to be given, REASONABLE TIME OR
NOTICE shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of the act or the giving of the notice.

as herein provided, shall be computed by excluding the first day and including
the last. If the last day be a Saturday, Sunday or a state holiday, it shall be
excluded.
§ 10.11 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected
by the repeal and reenactment; but all suits, proceedings and prosecutions for
causes arising or acts committed prior to the effective date of this code may
be commenced and prosecuted with the same effect as if this code had not been
enacted.
Statutory reference:
   Periods of limitation, see I.C. 1-1-1-7

   All offenses committed under laws in force prior to the effective date of
this code shall be prosecuted and remain punishable as provided by those laws.
This code does not affect any rights or liabilities accrued, penalties incurred
or proceedings begun prior to the effective date of this code. The liabilities,
proceedings and rights are continued; punishments, penalties or forfeitures
shall be enforced and imposed as if this code had not been enacted. In
particular, any agreement granting permission to utilize highway rights-of-way,

SMALL PURCHASES
§ 34.01 SMALL PURCHASE POLICIES.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this subchapter, the following
definitions apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      PURCHASING AGENT. The Clerk Treasurer, the Town Marshal, the Fire Chief,
the Utility Superintendent, the Public Works Superintendent, and other town
employees who may be designated by the Town Council, from time to time, in
writing.
      SMALL PURCHASE. A purchase of supplies and/or services in an amount less
than $50,000.
      SUPPLIES. Any property, including equipment, goods, and materials.
   (B)   Purchases. For all small purchases of supplies:
      (1)   (a)   A purchasing agent shall solicit and compare prices from as
many responsible suppliers as is practical. RESPONSIBLE SUPPLIER shall mean a
supplier who has the apparent ability to timely and responsibly deliver the
described supplies and/or services and who submits a bid or quote conforming in
all material respects to the requisite description or specifications. In the
event there are three or more available suppliers who are believed to be
responsible, a purchasing agent shall solicit and attempt to secure no less
than three proposals. A purchasing agent shall purchase from the responsible
supplier who submits the lowest responsive bid unless there is a compelling
reason to purchase from another, taking into consideration any applicable
preferences, past experience, timeliness of delivery, reputation and standing
in the industry or profession.
         (b)   Comparison pricing can be obtained via telephone, letter, email,
fax, or website.
      (2)   (a)   For purchases of supplies, the following purchasing
preferences may be applied to responsible providers who offer a responsive
quote:
            1.   Under I.C. 5-22-15-16, a price preference of 10% is available
to suppliers offering supplies that contain recycled materials or post-consumer
materials.
            2.   For purchases resulting in a contract, a price preference of
5% is available to suppliers that qualify as a “local Indiana business”, as
defined in I.C. 5-22-15-20.9.
            3.   A price preference of 15% is available to suppliers that
qualify as an “Indiana small business”, pursuant to I.C. 5-22-15-23.
         (b)   In assessing whether a bid or quote is responsive, the
purchasing agent and/or purchasing agency may evaluate whether the supplies and
delivery schedule offered conform in all material respects to the
specifications and whether the supplier has complied with all applicable
statutes, ordinances, resolutions, or rules pertaining to the award of a public
contract.
         (c)   A supplier who wants to claim a preference provided by this
policy must indicate in the quote which preference is claimed and the supplier
must certify that it qualifies for the stated preference. In order to be
considered for the Indiana small business preference, suppliers must provide
the purchasing agent with information regarding the number of employees
employed by the supplier and the average sales and receipts for the prior year.
         (d)   The purchasing agent will use the “U.S. Small Business
Administration Table of Small Business Size Standards...” in assessing whether
a particular supplier qualifies as a small business.
         (e)   Suppliers are only eligible to claim one type of preference. The
purchasing agent shall follow the procedures outlined in I.C. 5-22-15-10 in
assessing purchasing preferences.
      (3)   As required by I.C. 5-22-15-21, supplies manufactured in the United
States shall be specified and purchased by the town unless the purchasing agent
determines that any of the following apply:
         (a)   The supplies are not manufactured in the United States in
reasonably available quantities.
         (b)   The price of the supplies manufactured in the United States
exceeds by an unreasonable amount the price of available and comparable
supplies manufactured outside the United States. For purposes of this section,
UNREASONABLE AMOUNT shall mean 15%. Accordingly, if the price of supplies
manufactured in the United States exceeds, by 15% or more, the price of
available and comparable supplies manufactured outside the United States, the
difference in price shall be deemed to be unreasonable and the purchasing agent
may specify and/or purchase the supplies manufactured outside the United
States.
         (c)   The quality of the supplies is substantially less than the
quality of comparably priced available supplies manufactured outside the United
States.
         (d)   The purchase of supplies manufactured in the United States is
not in the public interest.
      (4)   (a)   Purchases will not be artificially divided so as to
constitute a “small purchase.”
         (b)   Nothing in this policy shall be interpreted as precluding the
purchasing agent from making a special purchase under I.C. 5-22-10.
   (C)   Purchasing agents’s separate authority.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided herein, for all purchases up to
$5,000, a purchasing agent, after complying with all applicable policies, may
commit to make the purchase. For all purchases in excess of $5,000, a
purchasing agent shall comply with these policies, but shall have no authority
to accept a quote or proposal or otherwise commit the town to the purchase.
Formal action by the Council is required for all purchases over $5,000.
      (2)   The Utility Superintendent or the Public Works Superintendent,
after complying with all applicable policies, and with the approval of their
Council representative or the Town Council President, may commit to make
purchases of up to $7,500. Except as set forth herein, with regard to emergency
purchases, formal action by the Council is required for all purchases of
supplies over $7,500.
   (D)   Emergency purchases. The Utility Superintendent or the Public Works
Superintendent, in the event of an emergency, defined as an event or condition
that interrupts the provision of essential services or poses an immediate
threat to public health or safety, after complying with all applicable
policies, and with the approval of their Council representative or the Town
Council President, may commit to make purchases of up to $25,000. All Town
Council member and the town’s Clerk Treasurer shall be notified, as soon as is

rules and regulations adopted by the USEPA published in the Federal Register
October 16, 1973 (38 C.F.R. part 20758), and any subsequent revisions subject
to approval by the town. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular analysis
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-
hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab
samples.)

§ 51.22 DELINQUENT USERS; WATER SHUT-OFF.
   (A)   Indiana American Water, as the water utility providing water to users
of the town’s sewage works, will discontinue water service to delinquent users
of the town’s sewage works until payment of all overdue user fees, together
with any applicable penalties, are received by the town.
   (B)   If a fee established by the town and charged to users of the town’s
sewage works is not paid within one monthly billing cycle after it is due, the
Town Council or its designee shall send notice to the delinquent user stating:
      (1)   The delinquent amount due, together with any penalty;
      (2)   Water service may be disconnected if the user continues not to pay
the delinquency and any penalty; and

the charges as specified, the Town Council or its designee shall give written
notice to Indiana American to discontinue water service to the premises
designated in the notice until notified otherwise. The notice must identify the
delinquent user in enough detail to enable Indiana American to identify the
water service connection that is to be discontinued.
   (D)   Upon receipt of the notice, the Indiana American will disconnect water
service to the user.
   (E)   Water service may not be shut off under this section if a local board
of health has found and certified to the town that the termination of water
service will endanger the health of the user and others in the town.
   (F)   Indiana American does not incur any liability for discontinuing water
service in accordance with a notice from the town, except to the extent of its
own negligence or improper conduct.
   (G)   If Indiana American does not discontinue service within 30 days after

from the user.
   (H)   A delinquent user of the town’s sewage works may dispute a bill by
submitting to the town’s Clerk-Treasurer a written objection or in an informal
meeting, during regular business hours, with the town’s Clerk-Treasurer or
designated representative who will be authorized and empowered to correct
incorrect charges or at any regular meeting of the Town Council.
   (I)   Payment of a disputed bill and penalties by a user does not constitute
a waiver of rights to subsequently claim and recover from the town sums
improperly charged to that user.
(Res. 2154, passed 6-5-2012)
§ 51.23 SPRINKLING, SOD AND POOL CREDITS.
   (A)   More specifically, the “Sprinkling Credit,” “Sod Credit,” and “Pool
Credit,” as adopted and affirmed previously by the Council remain unchanged and
are restated here as follows:
   (B)   Water used to irrigate or, “sprinkle” yards, or fill swimming pools is
not discharged into the town's sewage works. Accordingly, the town will make
available to customers of its sewage works, who sprinkle their yards or fill
their own pools, with water purchased directly from their water utility, a
credit against their sewer bills as follows:
      (1)   The current owner or occupant of real estate served by the town's
sewage works may apply for a sprinkling credit prior to May 1 of the calendar
year for which the credit is sought. If application for the sprinkling credit
is not made prior to May 1, the credit will not apply until the following
calendar year. Applications for subsequent years will not be required unless
ownership or possession of the property changes.
      (2)   For those customers who timely apply for a sprinkling credit
(eligible customers), the monthly water usage recorded for their property for
the prior months of October through April will be averaged (the winter
average). For eligible customers who have not owned or occupied their property
beginning with the prior October 1, the winter average shall be deemed to be
6,000 gallons for the following year.
      (3)   Then, for the months of May through September (bills for which are
printed and mailed in June through October), eligible customers will be billed
for water usage equal to their winter average plus 2,000 gallons.
      (4)   New or existing sewage works customers may apply for a “sod credit”
against their monthly sewer charge. The sod credit shall be for a maximum of 60
days, or two billing cycles. To be eligible for the sod credit, customers must
apply in writing and represent to the town that they are installing sod, for a
new home, or are replacing their entire existing yard with new sod. The
customer will then be eligible for and receive a credit against that customer's
sewer bill for water usage in excess of 9,000 gallons during that 60 period, or
two billing cycles, unless that customer's normal usage during the same period,
in the prior year, exceeded 9,000 gallons, in which event, no credit shall be
given.
      (5)   Customers may apply, annually, for a one time per year “pool
credit.” That application shall include the dimensions of the pool to be filled
and the month in which the pool will be filled. The customer's average usage
will be checked to verify that the pool was actually filled and the calculated
amount of water was used. If confirmed a pool credit against that customer's
sewer bill for the volume of water used to fill that customer's pool will be
applied. If volume of water used to fill that customer's pool cannot be

in the form of a check or ACH transfer, for which there are not, in the drawn
account, sufficient funds, shall be charged $20, in addition to all other late
payment penalties and disconnection charges that may be imposed, and shall be
ineligible, for a period of one year, to make payment to the Town's Sewage

(Res. 2018-04, passed 8-21-2018)
§ 51.25 BILL ADJUSTMENTS.
   (A)   Excessive water usage/leak adjustment criteria. Adjustments to sewer/
wastewater bills, for excessive water usage, may be granted by the
Superintendent, or his or her designee, upon a customer’s request if all of the
following conditions are met:
      (1)   Excessive water volume results from a leak or malfunctioning
appliance, fixture, or device, which has been repaired.
      (2)   The customer requesting the adjustment submits proof of repair, in
a form satisfactory to the Superintendent.
      (3)   The request for adjustment is submitted within 180 days of the date
of the bill which includes excessive usage.
   (B)   Amount of adjustment.
      (1)   If the Superintendent, or his or her designee, determines that the
adjustment criteria are satisfied, and the excessive volume was not discharged
into the town’s sewage works, the water usage will be reduced to the average
usage for the prior 12 billing cycles (or all prior billing cycles, whichever
is less) and the bill adjusted accordingly.
      (2)   If the Superintendent, or his or her designee, determines that all
of the adjustment criteria are satisfied, and the excessive volume was
discharged into the town's sewage works, the water usage will be reduced by one
half of the difference between the usage reported on the current bill and the
average usage for the prior 12 billing cycles (or all prior billing cycles,
whichever is less) and the bill adjusted accordingly.
      (3)   Any customer who disagrees with the Superintendent's determination
related to a sewer bill adjustment may, within ten days, file with the New
Whiteland Utility Superintendent, 540 Tracy Road, New Whiteland, IN 46184, a
request for a review and determination by the Town Council. The Town Council,
then at regular meeting, will consider that customer's request for adjustment
applying the same adjustment criteria as set forth above.
   (C)   One time annual hardship extension. Each customer of the town's sewage
works may, once each year, request an extension of up to 30 days to pay their
most current sewer bill because of an inability to pay. The extension must be
requested, in writing, before the bill for which it is requested becomes past
due. The Superintendent or his or her designee may, but shall not be required
to, grant the extension. Sewer bills which are delinquent are subject to a 10%
penalty. (I.C. 36-9-23-32.) The granting of an extension to pay a sewer bill
will not relieve the customer of those penalties which are imposed, by law, on
delinquent bills.
   (D)   Other remedies. The sewer bill adjustment policies and procedures as
set forth above are in addition to and in no way limit any customer's right to
request that the Town Council adjust their sewer bill as permitted and pursuant
to other adopted town policies.

appropriate authorities of the town may pursue any or a combination of the
following remedies as they deem appropriate:
   (A)   Taking into custody and impounding any animal found to be kept in
violation of any provision applicable under this chapter;
   (B)   If the violation is a violation only of this chapter and is not
concurrently a violation of a state statute, citing the owner of the animal for
a town ordinance violation;
   (C)   If the violation constitutes an infraction or crime under state

I.C. 36-1-6-4.
(Ord. 2016-12, passed 9-6-2016)
§ 132.13 IMPOUNDED ANIMALS.
   (A)   The town may retain or cause to be retained an impounded animal,
either in town facilities or the facilities of a cooperating state or county
agency, for a period of time deemed necessary and appropriate under the
circumstances. If the animal is a wild animal, of a species indigenous to the
state, that no person has a lawful right to possess, is deemed to pose no
unusual threat to humans or livestock, and is sufficiently mature to care for
itself in the wild, the town may, as permitted by applicable federal, state and
county laws and regulations, release the animal back into the wild.
   (B)   Upon the expiration of applicable time periods, the town or a
cooperating agency may humanely destroy or otherwise lawfully dispose an
impounded animal. An impounded domestic animal shall be kept for at least five
days. If the owner of an impounded domestic animal is known, the town shall, as
soon as is practicable, notify that owner of the animal’s impoundment.
   (C)   Unless a court, or a state or county officer having proper authority
orders the continued detention of an animal, the owner of an impounded domestic
animal, other than an animal impounded for violation of I.C. 35-46-3, may
reclaim the animal, prior to its destruction or other disposition as set forth
herein, by paying to the town the following fees:
      (1)   A charge of $25 for initial capture of the animal; and
      (2)   A charge of $10 per day for boarding and feeding the animal.
   (D)   If the town delivers the animal to a cooperating agency, the above
charges shall nevertheless apply for the time that the animal is in the town’s
custody, and an additional fee of $25 for transporting the animal shall apply.
These charges and fees are in addition to any penalties or costs assessed under
this chapter. Any cooperating agency into whose custody an animal is delivered
may charge and collect its own usual and standard fees from the person
reclaiming the animal for the period of time the animal was in its custody. An
animal was impounded by reason of a suspected violation of I.C. 35-46-3 shall
be deemed in protective custody and may not be released to its owner, except as
permitted by and in compliance with the provisions of I.C. 35-46-3.
(Ord. 2016-12, passed 9-6-2016)

mains at higher elevations, the contractor shall furnish booster pumping
equipment to complete the filling and flushing.
         (b)   All air shall be expelled from the mains as they are filled. Air
valves and hydrants at high points in the main shall be utilized for this
purpose. Where permanent vents are not provided, the contractor shall install
corporation cocks at high points to assure removal of air. Such cocks shall be
left in place and location noted by dimension ties on the field record set of
drawings.
      (3)   Disinfection.
         (a)   Before being placed in service, all new mains and repaired
portions of, or extensions to, existing mains shall be chlorinated with a
chlorine solution so that a chlorine residual of not less than 25 PPM remains
in the water after 24 hours standing in the pipe.
         (b)   A chlorine gas-water or hypochlorite mixture shall be applied by
means of a solution-feed chlorinating device. Chlorinating devices for feeding
solutions of chlorine gas must provide means for preventing the backflow of
water into the chlorine cylinder.
         (c)   The preferred point of application of chlorinating agent is
ahead of the beginning of the pipeline extension or any valve section of it and
through a corporation stop inserted by the contractor, in the top of the pipe.
The water injector for delivering the chlorine-bearing water into the pipe
should be supplied from a tap on the pressure side of the gate valve
controlling the flow into the pipeline extension.
         (d)   Water from the existing distribution system or other source of
supply shall be controlled so as to flow slowly into the newly laid pipeline
during the application of chlorine. The rate of chlorine mixture flow shall be
in such proportion to the rate of water entering the pipe that the chlorine
dose applied to the water entering the newly laid pipe shall produce at least a
25 P.M. residual after 24 hours.
         (e)   If the circumstances are such that a shorter retention period
must be used, the chlorine concentration shall be increased accordingly.
         (f)   In the process of chlorinating newly laid pipe, all valves or
other appurtenances shall be operated while the pipeline is filled with the
chlorinating agent.
      (4)   Testing and flushing.
         (a)   Following chlorination, all treated water shall be thoroughly
flushed from the newly laid pipeline at its extremities until the replacement
water throughout its length shall, upon testing, be proven comparable in
quality to the water served the public from the existing water supply system
and approved by the state’s Board of Health. This satisfactory quality of water
delivered by the new main should continue for a period of at least two full
days as demonstrated by laboratory examination of samples taken from a tap
located and installed in such a way as to prevent outside contamination.
         (b)   Before the system is placed into use, the contractor shall
obtain from the new mains two successive water samples 48 hours apart, and have
them tested for bacteria content by the state’s Board of Health. Samples shall
be drawn in accordance with the Board’s procedure.
         (c)   If samples do not prove satisfactory, the system shall be
rechlorinated and resampled until safe water is approved.

      (1)   General.
         (a)   Excavation shall be performed to the lines and grades shown on
the plans. The work shall be performed in a safe and proper manner with
suitable precautions being taken against all hazards. Excavations shall provide
adequate working space and clearances for the work to be performed including
the installation and removal of concrete forms. In no case shall excavation
faces be undercut for extended footings.
         (b)   Subgrade surfaces shall be clean and free of loose material of
any kind when concrete is placed thereon.
         (c)   All suitable excavated material meeting the requirements of
general fill shall be used as backfill, in the formation of embankments or
engineered fill, or for other purposes shown on the plans. All unsuitable
material shall be removed from the site unless otherwise allowed by the town.
Satisfactory excavated materials shall be stockpiled until required for fill or
embankment. Stockpiles shall be graded and shaped for proper drainage.
         (d)   Excavation work shall be performed in accordance with all
applicable provisions of the OSHA standards for excavation safety.
      (2)   Underground utilities. Utilities shall be located in areas of work
prior to commencement of work. If utilities are to remain in place, adequate
means of support and protection during earthwork operations shall be provided.
Should unknown or unidentified piping or other utilities be encountered during
excavation, the contractor shall consult applicable utilities immediately for
directions. The contractor shall cooperate with the town and the utility
companies in keeping respective services and facilities in operation. The
contractor shall repair damaged utilities to the satisfaction of the utility
owner.
      (3)   Sheeting and shoring. Except where banks are cut back on a stable
slope, excavation for structures and trenches shall be properly and
substantially sheeted, braced and shored, as necessary, to prevent caving or
sliding, to provide protection for workers and the work. Sheeting, bracing and
shoring shall be designed and built to withstand all loads that might be caused
by earth movement or pressure, and shall be rigid, maintaining shape and
position under all circumstances. Sheeting and shoring shall comply with all
applicable requirements of the OSHA standards for excavation.
      (4)   Unsuitable bearing material. Materials encountered at design
elevations which are considered inadequate for suitable bearing shall be
removed and replaced. Removal shall be to a depth as required to reach suitable
bearing material. Fill material shall consist of either structural backfill or
concrete.
      (5)   Subgrade stabilization.
         (a)   Subgrades for concrete structures shall be firm, dense and
thoroughly compacted and consolidated; shall be free from mud; and shall be
sufficiently stable to remain firm and intact under the feet of the workers.
         (b)   Subgrades for concrete structures which are otherwise solid, but
which become mucky on top due to construction operations, shall be reinforced
with crushed stone or gravel. The finished elevation of stabilized subgrades
shall not be above subgrade elevations shown on the plans.
      (6)   Dewatering.
         (a)   The contractor shall provide and maintain adequate dewatering
equipment to remove and dispose of all surface and ground water entering
excavations, trenches or other parts of the work. Each excavation shall be kept
dry during subgrade preparation and continually thereafter until the structure
to be built, or pipe to be installed therein is completed to the extent that no
damage from hydrostatic pressure, flotation or other cause will result.
         (b)   All excavations which extend down to or below static ground
water elevations shall be dewatered by lowering and maintaining the ground
water surface beneath such excavations a distance of not less than 12 inches
throughout the time the excavation remains open.
         (c)   Surface water shall be diverted or otherwise prevented from
entering excavated areas or trenches to the greatest extent practicable without
causing damage to adjacent property.
         (d)   The contractor will be held responsible for the condition of any
pipe or conduit which he or she may use for drainage purposes, and all such
pipes or conduits shall be left clean and free of sediment.
         (e)   Water shall be disposed of in such a manner as will not cause
injury to public or private property, nor be a nuisance or a menace to the
public. The contractor shall be responsible for any and all permits and
approvals thereof necessary for disposal of the water.
   (B)   Backfill and embankment.
      (1)   Materials. All material placed in fills and embankments shall meet
the requirements of general fill as previously defined. No rocks or stones
shall be placed in the upper 18 inches of any fill or embankment. Rocks or
stones within the allowable size limit may be incorporated in the remainder of
fills and embankments; provided, they are distributed so that they do not
interfere with proper compaction; except that, no rocks or stones shall be
placed in fill area under structures.
      (2)   Placement.
         (a)   The backfill and fill materials shall be evenly placed adjacent
to structures, piping or conduit to the required elevations. Care shall be
taken to prevent wedging action of backfill against structures or displacement
of piping or conduit by carrying the material uniformly around the structure,
piping or conduit to approximately the same elevation in each lift.
         (b)   Where fill is required on both sides of a foundation or wall,
the fill shall be placed simultaneously on each side. Fill against building
walls shall not be placed until the first floor slab has been poured and set.
         (c)   Fill against other work shall be in a manner and at such time as
not to endanger the stability or damage the work. No fill shall be placed
against water bearing walls until they have been tested for water tightness. No
fill shall be placed over snow or frozen material.
         (d)   Materials such as brush, hedge, roots, stumps, grass and other
organic matter shall not be incorporated or buried in the engineered fill.
      (3)   Compaction.
         (a)   Compaction of backfill and embankment material shall be
accomplished by mechanical means such as vibratory plates or rollers.
Compaction by jetting methods will not be performed unless specifically allowed
by the town. No backfill shall be deposited or compacted in water.
         (b)   Backfill shall be placed in eight-inch loose layers and each
layer compacted to not less than 95% of maximum dry density; the moisture
content shall be within two percentage points of optimum as determined by ASTM
D-698.
         (c)   Embankment fill shall be placed in eight-inch loose layers and
each layer compacted to not less than 98% of maximum dry density. The moisture
shall be within two percentage points of optimum as determined by ASTM D-698.
         (d)   Granular fill under slabs shall be placed after the subgrades
have been leveled and cleared of all debris and immediately prior to pouring of
the slab. Granular material shall be placed in eight-inch loose layers and each
layer compacted to not less than 98% of maximum dry density; the moisture
content shall be with two percentage points above optimum as determined by ASTM
D-698.
   (C)   Compaction testing.
      (1)   Sampling and testing shall be the responsibility of the contractor.
Tests shall be performed by an approved commercial testing laboratory or may be
tested with approved facilities furnished by the contractor. All test results
shall be submitted to the town.
      (2)   Laboratory tests for moisture-density relations shall be determined
in accordance with ASTM D-698. A minimum of one test shall be performed on each
different type of material used for backfill.
      (3)   Field in-place density tests:
         (a)   The contractor shall perform a sufficient number of compaction
density tests to demonstrate that the required compaction requirements are
being met. In general, a minimum of one satisfactory compaction test shall be
performed for each cumulative lift length of 400 feet. Upon failure of a test,
the lift shall be recompacted and retested. Additional tests will be required
if the first tests consistently fail, if material changes, or if the
contractor’s method of compaction changes.
         (b)   Density tests shall be determined in accordance with ASTM D-
1556, ASTM D-2167 or ASTM D-2922. When ASTM D-2922 is used, the calibration
curves shall be checked and adjusted using only the sand cone method as per
ASTM D-1556. ASTM D-2922 results in a wet unit weight of soil and when using
this method, ASTM D-3017 shall be used to determine the moisture content of the
soil. The calibration curves furnished with the moisture gages shall be checked
along with density calibration checks as described in ASTM-D3017. The
calibration checks of both the density and moisture gages shall be made at the
beginning of a job and on each different type of material encountered.
         (c)   Copies of calibration curves and results of calibration tests
shall be furnished to the town.

material, placed on a flat trench bottom. The bedding shall have a minimum
thickness of four inches or one-fourth the outside pipe diameter below the pipe
and shall extend halfway up the pipe barrel at the sides. All material shall be
placed in the trench in approximately six-inch layers. Each layer, shall be
leveled and evenly distributed on both sides of the pipe so as not to disturb,
displace or damage the pipe and shall be thoroughly compacted. When Class I or
II materials are used, compaction may be accomplished by hand or mechanical
tamping or by “walking” the material in. Bedding from the halfway point on the
pipe to a point six inches above the top of the pipe shall be a Class I, II,
III or IV material placed in six-inch layers and thoroughly compacted to
prevent settlement. Class III and IV material shall not be used when the trench
is located in an area subject to vehicular traffic.
      (2)   Flexible and semirigid conduit. All flexible and semirigid pipe
shall be laid to the lines and grades shown on the plans, unless otherwise
directed by the Engineer. All flexible and semirigid conduit shall be bedded in
compacted Class I or Class II material, placed on a flat trench bottom. The

diameter below the pipe and shall extend to six inches above the top of the
pipe level the full width of the trench. All material shall be placed in the
trench in a maximum of six-inch layers (before compaction). Each layer shall be
leveled and evenly distributed on both sides of the pipe so as not to disturb,
displace or damage the pipe and shall be adequately compacted. When Class I
materials are used, compaction may be accomplished by hand or mechanical
tamping or by “walking” the material in. When Class II materials are used,
compaction shall be accomplished only by hand or mechanical tamping to a
minimum 85% Standard Proctor Density.
   (K)   Backfilling.
      (1)   Areas not subject to vehicle traffic.
         (a)   For purposes of this specification, trenches shall be considered
subject to vehicular traffic if any portion of the excavation is located within
four feet of a roadway or alley.
         (b)   The trench between a level six inches above the top of the pipe
and the ground surface shall be backfilled with Class I, II, III or IV
materials. The contractor shall consolidate the backfill by the back and forth
travel of a suitable roller, wheeled device or other similar heavy equipment
until no further settlement is obtained. Heavy equipment shall not be used
until there is a cover of not less than three feet over the pipes. To assist in
promoting maximum settlement, the surface of the trench shall be left in a
slightly rounded condition. Periodical dressing of the backfill in the trench
to promote the drainage and safety conditions shall be made during the course
of the contract as required or ordered by the Engineer.
      (2)   Areas subject to vehicle traffic.
         (a)   The trench between a level of six inches above the top of the
pipe and the surface, which are located in areas subject to vehicular traffic,
shall be backfilled with granular backfill materials, deposited in maximum
lifts of 12 inches. Each layer shall be thoroughly compacted by mechanical
tamping to not less than 95% density as determined by the Proctor Test (ASTM D-
698).

finished grade sufficient to allow placement of the permanent surface
materials. Where the permanent surface is asphalt or concrete, the aggregate
base thickness shall be the specified thickness of the pavement material plus
six inches.
         (c)   For portions of the trench surface not subject to traffic, the
backfill material shall end six inches below the finished grade. This six-inch
depth shall be filled with good top soil and seeded in accordance with these
specifications.
      (3)   Placement.
         (a)   No fill shall be placed against any manhole or other structure
until placed concrete has been allowed to cure for at least three days.
Backfill shall be placed in such a manner that the structure will not be
damaged by shock from falling earth.
         (b)   The backfill material shall be deposited and compacted as
specified for final backfill, and shall be placed in such a manner as to
prevent eccentric loading and excessive stress on the structure.
   (L)   Compaction testing.
      (1)   Sampling and testing shall be the responsibility of the contractor.
Tests shall be performed by an approved commercial testing laboratory or may be
tested with approved facilities furnished by the contractor.
      (2)   Laboratory tests for moisture-density relations shall be determined
in accordance with ASTM D-698. A minimum of one test shall be performed on each
different type of material used for backfill.
      (3)   Field in-place density tests:
         (a)   Shall be performed in sufficient numbers to ensure that the
specified compaction is being obtained. A minimum of one test per lift of
backfill for every 500 feet of installation shall be performed; and
         (b)   Shall be determined in accordance with ASTM D-1556, ASTM D-2167
or ASTM D-2922. When ASTM D-2922 is used, the calibration curves shall be
checked and adjusted using only the sand cone method as per ASTM D-1556. ASTM
D-2922 results in a wet unit weight of soil and when using this method, ASTM D-
3017 shall be used to determine the moisture content of the soil. The
calibration curves furnished with the moisture gauges shall be checked along
with density calibration checks as described in ASTM-D3017. The calibration
checks of both the density and moisture gauges shall be made at the beginning
of a job and on each different type of material encountered.
      (4)   All test results shall be submitted to the town.
      (5)   Trenches improperly compacted shall be reopened and then refilled
and compacted to the density specified. Field in-place density tests shall also
be repeated for improperly compacted trenches that are reopened, refilled and
recompacted.

      (4)   The pipe shall be thoroughly cleaned before being laid and kept
clean during construction.
      (5)   The contractor shall cut all pipe and drill all holes that may be
necessary.
   (B)   Pipe laying.
      (1)   The laying of pipe on the prepared bedding material shall commence
from the lowest point, with the spigot ends pointing in the direction of flow.
All pipes shall be laid true to line and grade. They shall be carefully
centered so that when laid, they form a sewer with uniform invert.
      (2)   A pipe plug or bulkhead shall be used whenever pipe laying
operations are not in progress as required to protect the pipe ends from
foreign material.
      (3)   Before making pipe joints, all surfaces of the joints shall be
clean and dry. Lubricants, primers and adhesives shall be used in accordance
with the manufacturer’s recommendations. The pipe shall then be placed, fitted
and adjoined so as to obtain a water-tight joint. In the event that previously
laid pipe is disturbed, it shall be removed and relaid.
      (4)   The contractor shall assure proper alignment and grade by the
proper use of lasers, batter boards, surveying instruments or other suitable
means.
   (C)   Leakage tests.
      (1)   General. Prior to acceptance, all gravity sewers, including service
laterals, shall be tested and pass a test for leakage. The contractor shall
furnish all labor, materials and equipment required for making the tests and
ground water level determinations with no extra compensation over and above the
specified contract prices for the sewers. Testing shall not be performed until
backfilling and compaction are completed. All gravity sewers shall pass a
leakage test as further specified below.
      (2)   Low pressure air test.
         (a)   A “Low Pressure Air Test” conforming to the requirements of the
latest revision of ASTM C828 and ASTM C924 shall be performed on all new
sanitary sewer pipe, except as revised below. Low pressure air testing is used
to determine the existence of pipe leaks; however, it does not indicate water
leakage limits.
         (b)   Prior to the low pressure air testing, all wyes, tees or end of
side sewer stubs shall be plugged with flexible-joint caps, or acceptable
alternate, securely fastened to withstand the internal test pressures. Such
plugs or caps shall be readily removable, and their removal shall provide a
socket suitable for making a flexible-jointed lateral connection or extension.
         (c)   All plugs shall be securely braced to prevent possible blowout
due to internal air pressure. One plug shall have an inlet tap, or other
provision for connecting a hose to a portable air supply source. Air hose shall
be connected to the inlet tap and a portable air supply source.
         (d)   Air equipment shall consist of all necessary valves and pressure
gages to control rate of air flow into the test section and to enable
monitoring of air pressure within the test section. Testing apparatus shall
also be equipped with pressure relief device to prevent the possibility of
loading test section with full capacity of compressor.
         (e)   Air shall be slowly added to test section until pressure inside
pipe is raised to 4.0 psig. After a pressure of 4.0 psig is obtained, air
supply shall be regulated such that pressure is maintained between 3.5 and 4.0
psig for a period of two minutes, to allow air temperature to stabilize in
equilibrium with temperature of pipe walls. Pressure will normally drop
slightly until equilibrium is obtained. During this period, all plugs shall be
checked with soap solution to detect any plug leak.
         (f)   After this two-minute air stabilization period, air supply shall
be disconnected and test pressure allowed to decrease. Time required for test
pressure to drop from 3.5 psig to 2.5 psig is determined by means of stop
watch, and this time interval is then compared with required time to determine
if rate of air loss is within the allowable limit. Required time to arrive at
the allowable air loss is calculated by means of following formula:
T =  0.0850 DK
Q
   Where:   T = time in seconds
         K = .000419 DL, but not less than 1.0
         Q = rate of loss (= 0.003 cfm/sq. ft. of internal surface)
         D = diameter of pipe in inches
         L = length of pipe tested in feet
         (g)   Upon completion of test, the bleeder valve shall be opened and
all air allowed to escape. Plugs shall not be removed until all air pressure in
test section has been released.
         (h)   If measured time interval for the pressure to drop from 3.5 psig
to 2.5 psig is less than the required time as calculated, sewer section shall
be deemed to have failed test. The contractor shall then proceed to repair pipe
at his or her cost as necessary until the sewer section passes the test. All
testing shall be conducted in presence of town or its representative.
      (3)   Infiltration test.
         (a)   An infiltration test shall be used only when approved by the
town or when the starting pressure for the low pressure air test would be
greater than 9.0 psig. For an infiltration test to be performed, the ground
water elevation must be at least two feet above the crown of the upstream pipe.
The test shall require cleaning of the line and then plugging the upstream pipe
opening with a water-tight plug with length equal to or greater than the pipe
diameter.
         (b)   A 90-degree V-Notch weir shall be placed in the downstairs
manhole of the section of pipe being tested. When performing an infiltration
test with a weir, sufficient time shall be allowed for the infiltration to
crest the weir and stabilize. This time shall be determined by the town based
on the allowable infiltration, the size of the sewer line, the slope of the
line and other pertinent information. In no case shall the time be less than
one hour. The contractor shall measure the head (H) of water flowing over the
weir. The measurement must be accurate and taken a minimum distance of 18
inches or four times the height of H upstream of the weir, whichever is
greater. The measured infiltration over the weir can be calculated as:
Q = 3240 H2.5
   where: H is in inches and Q is in gallons per day
         (c)   In order for the section to pass the allowable leakage limits,
the measured infiltration shall not exceed 200 gallons per day per inch of pipe
diameter per mile (200 gpd/in./mile).
   (D)   Deflection testing.
      (1)   (a)   Deflection testing shall be performed by the contractor in
the presence of the town or his or her representative on all plastic pipes with
nominal inside diameters of six inches or greater.
         (b)   Deflection testing shall be accomplished using one of the
following devices: calibrated television or photography; or a properly sized
“go, no go” mandrel or sewer ball.
         (c)   Deflections of no more than 5% based on the base inside
diameters shown below will be allowed:
Table 1: Allowable Deflection
Nominal Size (in.) Base Inside Diameter (in.) 5% Deflection Mandrel (in.)
Table 1: Allowable Deflection

18                 17.629                     16.75
 
      (2)   The deflection test shall be performed no sooner than 30 days
following installation of the pipe (including backfill). Prior to testing, the
pipeline shall be thoroughly cleaned.
      (3)   Prior to acceptance, pipes having deflections greater than 5% shall
be excavated, re-bedded and/or replaced and retested (successfully).
      (4)   (a)   The contractor shall submit deflection test reports to the
town within 30 days after performance of each said test.
         (b)   A separate report shall be submitted for each manhole to manhole
sewer section.
         (c)   This report shall provide all pertinent data regarding the test
including, but not limited to, the date of the test, details of the testing
device used, diameter of the pipe, the date installation of the line was
completed including backfill and whether the line passed or failed the test.

            1.   If the amount of makeup water entering the pipeline (during
the two-hour test while the pressure is maintained within five psi of the
specified test pressure) is less than or equal to the allowable leakage as
calculated by the following formula, the pipeline shall be accepted as having
passed the leakage test satisfactorily:
L =  SD (P)1/2
133,200
* Formula from AWWA Standard C600
   where:   L = allowable leakage, gallons per hour
         S = length of pipeline tested, feet
         D = nominal diameter of pipe, inches

§ 153.18 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to all premises that discharge
storm water associated with an industrial activity or a construction activity.
   (B)   Access to premises.
      (1)   The authorized enforcement agent shall be permitted to enter and
inspect premises subject to regulation under this subchapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this subchapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to the authorized enforcement agent.
      (2)   Premises operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agent to
all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records that must be kept pursuant to the requirements of an
NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional
duties as defined by state and federal law. Any temporary or permanent
obstruction to safe and easy
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed
by the operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement
agent and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be
borne by the operator.
      (3)   The authorized enforcement agent shall have the right to set up on
any premises such devices as are necessary, in the opinion of the authorized
enforcement agent, to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the premises’ storm
water discharge.
      (4)   The authorized enforcement agent has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All
devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the town’s authorized agent access
to a permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of
this subchapter. A person who is the operator of premises with a NPDES storm
water discharge permit associated with industrial activity commits an offense
if the person denies the town’s authorized agent reasonable access to the
permitted premises for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this subchapter.
      (6)   If the authorized enforcement agent has been refused access to any
part of the premises from which storm water is discharged, and he or she is
able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of
this subchapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
subchapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety and welfare of the community, then the town may seek issuance of
a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

§ 153.19 BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The town will adopt requirements identifying best management practices
(BMPs) for activities, operations and premises that may cause or contribute to
pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system or the waters
of the United States. The owner or operator of commercial or industrial
premises shall provide, at his or her own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the storm
drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-
structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises,
which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge may be required to
implement, at said person’s expense, additional structural and non-structural
BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the storm drain system.
Compliance with terms and conditions, a valid NPDES permit authorizing the
discharge of storm water associated with industrial activity, to the extent
practicable, shall be deemed in compliance with the provisions of this section.
These BMPs shall be part of a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 11-1-2023)
§ 153.20 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately-owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function or physical
integrity of the watercourse. It shall be the property owners’ responsibility
to maintain the watercourses on their lots and to take preventative measures
against any and all erosion and/or deterioration of natural or manmade features
on their lots. Owner/lessee maintenance responsibilities shall include the
following:
   (A)   Maintaining the watercourse free of trash, debris, excessive
vegetation, and obstacles that impede flow;
   (B)   Not removing healthy bank vegetation beyond that actually necessary
for maintenance;
   (C)   Not removing vegetation in such a manner that makes the banks
vulnerable to erosion; and
   (D)   Maintaining and stabilizing the watercourse in order to protect
against erosion and degradation.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 11-1-2023)
§ 153.21 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.

responsible for premises, or responsible for emergency response for a facility
or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials
which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system or water of the United
States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the town in person
or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in
person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to
the town within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of
prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment,
the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site
written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
   (B)   A written report concerning the discharge shall be filed with the town
and IDEM, by the person responsible for the discharge, within five days. The
written report shall specify:
      (1)   The composition of the discharge and the cause;
      (2)   The date, time, and estimated volume of the discharge;
      (3)   All measures taken to clean up the accidental discharge and all
measured proposed to be taken to prevent any recurrence; and
      (4)   The name and telephone number of the person making the report, and
the name and telephone number of a person who may be contacted for additional
information on the matter.
   (C)   A properly reported accidental discharge shall be an affirmative
defense to a civil infraction proceeding brought under this chapter against a
discharger for such discharge. It shall not however, be a defense to a legal
action brought to obtain and injunction, to obtain recovery of costs or to
obtain other relief because of or arising out of the discharge. A discharge
shall be considered properly reported only if the discharger complies with all
the requirements of this section. This requirement does not relive discharge
from notifying other entities as required by state or federal regulations.

§ 153.22 INSPECTIONS AND MONITORING.
   (A)   The town has the authority to periodically inspect the storm drainage
system, whether publicly or privately owned, to detect and eliminate illicit
connections and discharges into the system. The inspection may include a
screening of discharges from outfalls connected to the system to determine if
prohibited flows are being conveyed into the storm drainage system. It could
also include spot testing of waters contained in the storm drainage system
itself to detect the introduction of pollutants into the system by means other
than a defined outfall, such as dumping or contaminated sheet runoff.
   (B)   If, as a result of the storm drainage system inspection, a discharger
is suspected of an illicit discharge, the town may inspect and/or obtain storm
water samples from storm water runoff facilities of the subject discharger, to
determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter. Upon request, the
discharger shall allow a properly identified town representative to enter upon
the premises of the discharger at all hours necessary for the purposes of such
inspection or sampling. The town or its properly identified representative may
place on the discharger’s property the equipment or devices used for such
sampling or inspection, as-built drawings and the rec[text missing].

§ 153.45 STORM WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Introduction. The town may require any combination of storage,
infiltration, filtering or vegetative practices to reduce the impact of
pollutants in storm water run-off on receiving waters, where appropriate, and,
additionally, shall require the following:
      (1)   Run-off from the project site must be managed to minimize
pollutants that are expected to be associated with the final land use. To
achieve pollutant minimization goals, measures shall be selected and meet the
requirements as established by ordinance or other regulatory mechanism.
      (2)   The post-construction measures shall at a minimum be selected based
on correct sizing to address the Water Quality Volume (WQv) or water quality
flow rate as specified below.
      (3)   One or more post-construction measures working in tandem or series
shall be utilized to treat storm water run-off and increase the overall
efficiency of individual and specialized measures.
      (4)   In combination with proper post-construction measure selection,
design and development strategies may be selected and incorporated into the
plan to minimize the discharge of pollutants. These strategies may include, but
are not limited to:
         (a)   Low Impact Development (LID) and green infrastructure.
         (b)   Infiltration measures, when selected must take into
consideration the pollutants associated with run-off and the potential to
contaminate ground water resources. When there is a potential for
contamination, choose alternative measures or measures that pre-treat run-off
to eliminate or reduce the pollutants of concern.
   (B)   Policy on Stormwater Quality Management.
      (1)   BMPs must be implemented for the management of total suspended
solids (TSS) including floatables. BMP systems or treatment trains shall have
at least one component of the system providing floatable control. Position BMPs
outside right-of-way and not more than 14 feet from a concrete or paved area
for vac-truck and maintenance vehicle access.
      (2)   For ease of maintenance and to reduce the frequency of pond
dredging, all detention/retention facilities (including underground detention)
shall have an upstream BMP installed for each inlet pipe, to collect sediments,
debris, floatables, and other material prior to entering the detention/
retention facility.
      (3)   Fueling areas must install appropriate practices to reduce lead,
copper, zinc, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in stormwater runoff. These
requirements will apply to all new facilities and existing facilities that
replace their fuel tanks.
      (4)   Infiltration practices will not be allowed in wellhead protection
areas. Discharges will not be allowed directly into sinkholes or fractured
bedrock, without treatment that results in the discharge meeting Indiana
groundwater quality standards as referenced in 327 IAC 2-11.
      (5)   Any stormwater practice that is a Class V injection well must
ensure that the discharge from such practices meets Indiana groundwater quality
standards as referenced in 327 IAC 2-11.
   (C)   Calculations and design standards and specifications.
      (1)   All developed drainage area is to be treated by a water quality
BMP.
      (2)   The target TSS removal rate is 80%. For the purposes of this
requirement, TSS is defined as particles smaller than 125 microns in diameter.
      (3)   There are two methods for calculating the required size of a BMP.
The first method calculates the water quality volume to be treated, which
applies to detention-based BMPs. The second method calculates the water quality
peak flow rate to be treated, which applies to filtration processes and
mechanical-type BMPs such as hydrodynamic devices.
      (4)   The appropriate stormwater quality volume (WQv) and/or stormwater
quality flow rate (Qwq) generated from a qualifying site shall be adequately
treated before discharge. Traditional structural BMPs are presumed to comply
with the 80% TSS removal rate if BMPs are:
         (a)   Sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume or flow
rate, as applicable;
         (b)   Designed according to the specific performance criteria outlined
in Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual or other reference document;
         (c)   Constructed properly; and
         (d)   Maintained regularly.
      (5)   Mechanical-type BMPs must be approved by the town and meet ASTM
standard methods for verifying performance and must be certified by a
professional engineer. The BMP must meet the 80% TSS removal rate and floatable
control without resuspension of particles at the design water quality flow rate
resulting from a one-inch rainfall depth. Testing of the TSS removal rate must
be conducted by an independent testing facility rather than by the
manufacturer.
      (6)    Water Quality Volume (WQv). The WQv is the storage needed to
capture and treat the runoff from the first one-inch of rainfall. A 24- to 40-
hour emptying time must be used for the release of the WQv, with no more than
50% of the water quality volume being released in the first 12 hours. The WQv
is equivalent to one inch of rainfall multiplied by the volumetric runoff
coefficient (Rv) and the site area. The volume of runoff is directly related to
the amount of impervious cover at the site and is calculated using the
following equation.
      (7)   Water Quality Flow Rate (Qwy). The Qwy is needed to size BMP
devices designed to treat runoff at a peak design flow rate through the system.
The rational method in conjunction with a rainfall intensity will be used to
calculate the Qwy (in cubic feet per second -cfs). This method relies on an
intensity that is ½ the two-year storm intensity from the intensity-duration-
frequency curve along with the percent of impervious cover to identify the
appropriate runoff coefficient for the proposed land use.
      Step 1 - Using the percent of impervious cover, calculate the
corresponding runoff co eff ici ent for la nd us e usi ng the following
equation:
      Step 2 - Calculate the site time of concentration in minutes (Tc) and
area in acres (A).
      Step 3 - Using the time of concentration (Tc), define the peak intensity
(in inches/hour) of the two-year storm event utilizing the intensity-duration-
frequency curve (shown in table form) from NOAA Point Precipitation Frequency
Estimates which can be found at https://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/pfds/
pfds)map)cont.html?bkmrk=in. Interpolation may be necessary for times of
concentration between given values.
      Step 4 - To meet the design specification, divide the intensity
determined in Step 3 by two to identify ½ the two-year storm intensity.
      Step 5 - Use the Rational Method equation shown utilizing the previously
calculated values to calculate Qwq.
   (D)    Easement requirements. All stormwater quality management systems,
including detention or retention basins, filter strips, pocket wetlands, in-
line filters, infiltration systems, conveyance systems, structures and
appurtenances are to be located outside of the right-of-way and shall be
incorporated into permanent easements as listed in §
153.46(J).
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 11-1-2023)
§ 153.46 STORM WATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Watercourse requirements.
      (1)   Legal drains within the town are under the jurisdiction of the
Johnson County Drainage Board. Any storm water discharge or work to be
completed within a legal drain easement must obtain approval from the county.
      (2)   Waterways within the town may be under the jurisdiction of the IDEM
or the United States Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE).
      (3)   Work within a floodway is under the jurisdiction of the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources (DNR).
      (4)   Alterations shall be designed to accommodate all on- and off-site
upstream drainage areas. Design capacities shall be determined as described in
this chapter.
      (5)   Entities owning property through which a watercourse passes shall
keep and maintain that part of the watercourse in accordance with this chapter
and all applicable state and federal statutes and regulations. In addition, the
occupant shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent
to the watercourse so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use,
function, or physical integrity of the watercourse and shall not restrict flow
of the watercourse.
   (B)   Determination of storm water runoff rates.
      (1)   Storm water runoff rates shall be calculated in accordance with the
Indiana LTAP Storm Water Drainage Manual. Composite runoff coefficients shall
be calculated and account for connected impervious surfaces such as downspouts
connected to storm water conveyance system; typical composite runoff
coefficients shall not be used.
      (2)   Storm water drainage systems shall be designed to accommodate the
following:
         (a)   All upstream off-site drainage;
         (b)   Existing drain tiles from upstream;
         (c)   Diffused water flow from upstream properties;
         (d)   Storm sewers from upstream; and
         (e)   The drainage collection system from within the project or
property.
   (C)   Detention/retention and pond requirements.
      (1)   General requirements.
         (a)   Storage volume.
            1.   Storage volumes shall be computed using a computer model that
can generate hydrographs based on time of concentration and curve number
calculation.
            2.   Storm durations shall be used that maximize the peak flow for
the pre-developed condition and maximize detention storage volume for the post-
developed condition.
            3.   When determining curve numbers for post-developed conditions,
the initially determined hydrologic soil group for disturbed areas should be
changed to the next less infiltrating capacity category (i.e. A to B, B to C
and C to D).
         (b)   Detention release rates.
            1.   Detention control devices shall limit the discharge to a rate
such that the post developed release rate from the site is no greater than 0.2
cfs per acre of development for the 0-10 year return interval storms and 0.4
cfs per acre of developed area for the 11-100 year return interval storms.
Verify that the two year post-developed peak flow does not exceed the two-year
pre-developed peak flow.
            2.   If the downstream receiving channel or pipe is inadequate to
accommodate the post-developed flow, then the release rate must be further
reduced.
            3.   The minimum allowable orifice size is four inches.
            4.   For sites where the pre-developed area has more than one
outlet, the release rate should be computed based on pre-developed discharge to
each outlet point. The computed release rate for each outlet point shall not be
exceeded at the respective outlet point even if the post developed condition
would involve a different arrangement of outlets.
         (c)   Runoff from upstream tributary areas (off-site areas) may be
bypassed around the facility without attenuation. If it is to be routed through
the facility, a separate outlet system or channel must accommodate those flows.
Unless the pond is being designed as a regional detention facility, the primary
outlet structure shall be sized and the invert elevation of the emergency
overflow weir determined according to the onsite runoff only. Once the size and
location of the primary outlet structure and the invert elevation of the
emergency overflow weir are determined by considering on-site runoff, the 100-
year pond elevation is determined by routing the entire inflow, on-site and
off-site, through the pond.
         (d)   The detention facility shall be designed in such a manner that a
minimum of 90% of the maximum volume of water stored and subsequently released
at the design release rate shall not result in a storage duration in excess of
48 hours from the start of the storm unless additional storms occur within the
period. In other words, the design shall ensure that a minimum 90% of the
original detention capacity is restored within 48 hours from the start of the
design 100-year storm.
         (e)   An emergency overflow/spillway shall be designed for the release
of exceptional storm runoff or in emergency conditions should the normal
discharge devices become totally or partially inoperative. The overflow
facility shall be of such design that its operation is automatic and does not
require manual attention. At a minimum, emergency spillways shall be capable of
handling 125% of the peak inflow into the pond resulting from the 100-year
storm event from the entire contributing watershed in the post-developed
condition.
         (f)   All detention/retention/infiltration facilities (including
underground detention) shall have an upstream BMP designed in accordance with §
153.43 and installed for each inlet pipe, to collect sediments, debris,
floatables, and other material prior to entering the detention/retention
facility. Position BMPs outside right-of-way and not more than 14 feet from a
concrete or paved area for vac-truck and maintenance vehicle access.
         (g)   Underground detention facilities shall have sufficient
observation wells or inspection ports, at least 12 inches in diameter, to allow
access for inspection, maintenance, and regular cleaning operations.
         (h)   Designers and developers are encouraged to consider methods of
runoff reduction such as reducing impervious surface area, disconnecting
impervious areas, promoting infiltration, storm water capture and reuse, and
other low-impact development methods in order to reduce requirements for on-
site storm water detention.
         (i)   The outlet location must be approved by the town. The outlet
control structure and piping shall be designed to operate simply and
effectively with minimal maintenance. The outlet structure shall be positioned
in an accessible location for maintenance.
         (j)   A safety ramp and ingress/egress easement from a nearby road
must be provided for all wet ponds. The safety ramp shall be minimum 20 feet
wide and have a maximum exit slope of 6H:1V.
         (k)   Detention ponds located within a floodplain must be protected
from the base flood elevation and shall not be designed to hold flood waters.
Detention ponds may not be used for compensatory flood storage.

year (10-yr.) (10% chance/year) peak runoff and maintain the hydraulic grade
line (HGL) below the crown of the pipe. Flood routing shall be provided in
accordance with division (I) below. If an overflow route is not available, then
the storm sewer system shall be designed for the 100-year (100-yr.) (1% chance/
year) peak runoff HGL below the ground surface and less than six inches of
ponding at inlets.
         (b)   Minimum pipe size shall be 12 inches.
         (c)   Minimum full-flow velocity of 2.5 feet per second is desirable

below.
      (4)   Connections to the storm sewer system.
         (a)   Sump pumps which receive and discharge groundwater and other
storm water shall be connected to the storm sewer system where possible,
preferably at an inlet or manhole structure. Sump pumps may also be connected
to subsurface drains in accordance with §
151.21(F).
         (b)   Footing, perimeter, and other subsurface drains shall be
connected to the storm sewer system where possible, preferably at an inlet or
manhole structure. Footing and perimeter drains may also be connected to
subsurface drains in accordance with §
151.21(F). Footing, perimeter, and other subsurface drain connections to the
sanitary sewer are prohibited.
         (c)   Floor drains and swimming pool drains shall not be directly
connected to the storm sewer system. Floor drains and swimming pool drains
shall be connected to an approved outlet and comply with the requirements of
other town ordinances established for control of illicit discharges and
connections.
      (5)   Culvert requirements.
         (a)   Culverts shall be sized in accordance with the Federal Highway
Administration's HDS-5 Hydraulic Design of Highway Culverts.
         (b)   Minimum culvert pipe size shall be 12 inches. Minimum full-flow
velocity of three (3.0) feet per second is desirable to prevent sedimentation
in the pipe. Maximum full-flow velocity of ten (10.0) feet per second is
recommended. The minimum Manning's n roughness value shall be twelve
thousandths (0.012), regardless of material.
         (c)   Culvert pipes shall have a minimum of 24 inches of cover,
measured from the crown of pipe to the ground surface. Shallower depth of cover
may be considered by the town under conditions where engineering design will
alleviate concern for surface loadings and frost heave.
         (d)   Outlet protection and energy dissipaters shall be used wherever
the velocity of flows leaving a culvert exceed the erosive velocity of the
downstream channel.
   (E)   Open channel design standards.
      (1)   Open channel requirements.
         (a)   Open channels, roadside ditches, swales, and culverts shall
accommodate the twenty-five-year (25-yr.) (4% chance/year) peak runoff without
overflowing the banks and shall accommodate the one hundred-year (100-yr.) (1%
chance/year) peak runoff within the drainage easement, provided however:
         (b)   Flood routing shall be provided in accordance with division (I).
         (c)   Any alteration of an existing open outlet channel traversing a
property shall be sized as described above or for the capacity of the existing

         (d)   The channel lining material shall be selected such that the
design shear stress is less than the maximum permissible shear stress for the
lining material.
         (e)   For grass-lined channels, the side slope shall be no steeper
than three horizontal to one vertical.
         (f)   For armored channels (turf reinforcement mat, riprap, etc.), the
side slope shall be no steeper than one and one half (1-1/2) horizontal to one
vertical.
         (g)   Subsurface drains shall be required if the channel slope is less
than one percent (1.0%). The minimum channel slope shall be three tenths of a
percent (0.3%). A minimum channel velocity of two feet per second is desired to
prevent deposition within the channel. All rear yard swales shall have
subsurface drains.
   (F)   Subsurface drains design standards.
      (1)   Subsurface drains are required along all streets constructed in the
town to lower the seasonally high water table in Brookston, Crosby, and Miami
soil types.
      (2)   Subsurface drains shall be a minimum of six inches diameter for
areas receiving subsurface flow only. Subsurface drains which may receive
surface (roof drains, yard drains, etc.) and subsurface flows shall be a
minimum of 12 inches diameter. Underdrain capacity calculations shall be
provided to ensure underdrains are properly sized for the subsurface and
surface flows.
   (G)   Low impact development design standards.
      (1)   Low Impact Development (LID) is an approach to land planning and
engineering design which manages rainfall at the source to reduce storm water
runoff and manage runoff timing, emphasizes conservation and natural features,
and protects water quality by controlling pollutants.
      (2)   Designers and developers are encouraged to consider methods of
runoff reduction such as reducing impervious surface area, disconnecting
impervious areas, promoting infiltration, storm water capture and reuse, and
other LID methods in order to reduce requirements for on-site storm water
detention.
      (3)   LID features shall conform to current industry guidelines and will
be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Green infrastructure and storm water BMPs
shall be designed in accordance with the Indiana Storm Water Quality Manual or
other accepted design standard. All design calculations and justification shall
be submitted for review.
   (H)   Standards for adequate outlet.
      (1)   Storm water and drainage from the site must be discharged into an
adequate outlet or outlets so as not to adversely affect other landowners. The
criteria for outletting is as follows:
         (a)   All storm sewers, subsurface drains and open channels shall
outlet into an open channel, storm pipe, detention/retention facility or
waterway.
         (b)   Detention/retention ponds shall outlet into an open channel,
storm pipe or waterway.

including open channel, storm pipe, detention/retention facility, waterway or
street curb and gutter.
         (e)   All outlets must have adequate capacity for proposed flows, must
not be deteriorated, and can be maintained.
      (2)   Analysis is required when connecting the outlet to existing storm
water pipe. Include calculations showing that the receiving pipe has adequate
capacity for the total flow, including any additional flow from the
development.
   (I)   Flood routing.
      (1)   Storm water ponding and overflow path routing shall be evaluated
for the peak one hundred-year (100-yr.) (1% chance/year) storm event.

areas, on-site and off-site, in their proposed or reasonably anticipated land
use.
      (3)   The storm water collection system (storm sewers, open channels,
etc.) shall be assumed full (at capacity) from a previous storm event at the
beginning of the flood routing analysis.
      (4)   The overflow path/ponding resulting from the flood routing event
shall be clearly shown as a hatched area on the plans. Plans shall include
cross sections along the flood route path. Cross sections shall include the
existing surface, proposed grading, and the maximum water elevation for the
peak one hundred- year (100-yr.) (1% chance/year) storm event. The flood
routing path and ponding areas shall be placed in a right-of-way or drainage
easement in accordance with §
151.210).
   (J)   Drainage easements.
      (1)   Drainage easements must be provided for maintenance of the storm
water management system of publicly-owned systems and privately-owned ponds,
detention/retention basins, water quality BMPs, and LID practices. Easements

or architects, certifying that there is adequate room for maintenance of the
drainage facility.
      (2)   No building or structure shall be separated by the one hundred-year

acceptable outlets having capacity to receive upstream on-site and off-site
drainage.
      (2)   No activities conducted as part of the land disturbance shall be
allowed to obstruct the free flow of flood waters from an upstream property.

      (3)   Where an adequate outlet is not located on the site or the outfall
from a site's storm water system flows onto or through property not owned by
the developer prior to reaching a regulated drain or natural waterway, off-site
drainage improvements may be required and the flow path must be contained with
a right-of-way or easement. Off-site improvements may include, but are not
limited to, extending or replacing storm sewers; clearing, dredging, and

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-1-4-11 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Town Council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 2023-08, passed 9-6-2023)
§ 154.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation which
results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. Additionally, structures
that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of
such damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these
regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 2023-08, passed 9-6-2023)
§ 154.03 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control

§ 154.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,

FLOOD HAZARD AREA.)
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available
digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM and

flood-prone areas. The term describes such state or local regulations in any
combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage
prevention and reduction.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulative increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE or FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the floodplain lying outside the
floodway.
   FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   HARDSHIP. (As related to variances of this chapter.) The exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
Town of New Whiteland Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is
exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or
financial hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of
one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship.
All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally
intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:

states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by:

floods, flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries, and flood
profiles.
   INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL-EVALUATION SERVICE (ICC-ES) REPORT. A document
that presents the findings, conclusions, and recommendations from a particular
evaluation. ICC-ES reports provide information about what code requirements or
acceptance criteria were used to evaluate a product, and how the product should
be identified, installed.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). FEMA's comment on a
proposed project that would, upon construction, result in modification of the
SFHA through the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
      (2)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (CLOMR-F). A
letter from FEMA stating that a proposed structure that will be elevated by
fill would not be inundated by the base flood.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a building or of land is not
located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A
LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
      (4)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT OUT AS SHOWN (LOMA-OAS). An official
determination by FEMA that states the property or building is correctly shown
outside the SFHA as shown on an effective NFIP map. Therefore, the mandatory
flood insurance requirement does not apply. An out-as-shown determination does
not require elevations.
      (5)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (6)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). FEMA's modification
of the SFHA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill outside the
existing regulatory floodway.

or exceed the following criteria:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters;
and
         (b)   At least two openings are designed and maintained for the entry
and exit of floodwater; and these openings provide a total net area of at least
one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of all
such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher. Doorways
and windows do not qualify as openings; and
      (6)   The first floor of a building elevated on pilings or columns in a
coastal high hazard area (as that term is defined in 44 CFR 59.1), as long as
it meets the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a

of a floodplain management regulations adopted by a community and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK or SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88). As adopted in 1993, is a
vertical control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations
within the floodplain.

embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization,
bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. See REGULATORY FLOOD.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community's FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain
boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These
changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements,
annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base
flood elevations or SFHAs.

repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

§ 154.06 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard (SFHAs) within the jurisdiction of the town as
identified in division (B) below, including any additional areas of special
flood hazard annexed by the town.
   (B)   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.
      (1)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the Town of New Whiteland, delineated
as an “AE Zone” on the Johnson County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood
Insurance Rate Map dated August 2, 2007 shall be determined from the 1% annual
chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Johnson County, Indiana
and Incorporated Areas and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM)
dated August 2, 2007 as well as any subsequent updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date. Should the floodway limits not be delineated on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map for a studied SFHA designated as an “AE Zone,” the limits of
the floodway will be according to the best available flood layer as provided by
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (2)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for
each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the Town of New Whiteland,
delineated as an “A Zone” on the Johnson County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas
Flood Insurance Rate Map, dated August 2, 2007, as well as any subsequent
updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency with the most recent date, shall be according to the best available
flood layer provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, provided
the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square
mile. Whenever a party disagrees with the best available flood layer data, the
party needs to replace existing data with better data that meets current
engineering standards. To be considered, this data must be submitted to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and subsequently approved.
      (3)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas
shall be according to the best available flood layer as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile.
      (4)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.
   (C)   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain
development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of
special flood hazard.
   (D)   Compliance.
      (1)   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or
structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of
this chapter and other applicable regulations.
      (2)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the most conservative
(highest) base flood elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed
structure; or for other developments, affecting any part of the area of the
development.
      (3)   No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations.
   (E)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (F)   Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground elevations.
      (1)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) with base flood elevations provided (riverine or lacustrine Zone AE) on
the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the
profiles or table of still water elevations shall govern.
      (2)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
      (3)   If the natural grade elevation of the site in question is at or
above the base flood elevation and a LOMA or LOMR-FW is obtained, the
floodplain regulations will not be applied provided the LOMA or LOMR-FW is not
subsequently superseded or invalidated.
   (G)   Interpretation.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall
be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (H)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Therefore, this chapter does not create any liability on the part of the town,
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any
flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder.
   (I)   Penalties for violation. Failure to obtain a floodplain development
permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a floodplain
development permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. All violations shall be considered a common nuisance
and be treated as a violation of the town’s zoning ordinance and subject the
violator to monetary penalties as set forth in the town’s zoning chapter.
      (1)   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the
violation continues to exist.
      (2)   The town Plan Commission shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended.
      (3)   Nothing herein shall prevent the town from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

   (C)   In considering such applications, the Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (2)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (6)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (7)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (8)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (9)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters at the site; and
      (10)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance.
   (E)   Variances from the provisions of this chapter shall only be granted
when the Board can make positive findings of fact based on evidence submitted
at the hearing for the following:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship as defined in §
154.02; and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
   (F)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §
154.30(A), (C)(1) or (D) may be granted.
   (G)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §

Natural Resources. Variances shall not be issued within any designated
regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
   (H)   Variances to the Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction of §§
154.30 through
154.34 may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
   (I)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic
structures” upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an “historic
structure”. and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character
and design of the structure.
   (J)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use.

variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
   (M)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the Flood Protection Grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (N)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request.
(Ord. 2023-08, passed 9-6-2023)
PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 154.30 FLOODPLAIN STATUS STANDARDS.
   (A)   Floodways (Riverine). Located within SFHAs, established in §
154.03(B), are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. Under the provisions of the
Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1) a permit for construction in a floodway from
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance
of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or
obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation
activities such as filling, grading, clearing, and paving undertaken before the
actual start of construction of the structure. General licenses and exemptions
to the requirements of the Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1 and 312 IAC 10) may
apply to qualified additions/improvements to existing lawful residential
structures, rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland restoration, utility line
crossings, outfall projects, creek rock removal, and prospecting.
      (1)   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in §
154.03(B), the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward
the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for approval for construction
in a floodway, provided the activity does not qualify for a general license or
exemption (I.C. 14-28-1 or 312 IAC 10).
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. The floodplain
development permit shall meet the provisions contained in this chapter.
      (3)   The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than
an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to qualify for
a general license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site/
project. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
      (4)   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development shall cause
no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge
without first obtaining a Conditional Letter of Map Revision and meeting
requirements of §
154.19(E)(1). A Conditional Letter of Map Revision cannot be issued for
development that would cause an increase in flood levels affecting a structure
and such development should not be permitted.
      (5)   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet identified on the
effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity
of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation
of the regulatory flood of at least fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as
determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project
condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with
hydraulic analyses.
      (6)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the Town of New Whiteland shall submit the data and request that the
Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per
mapping standard regulations found at 44 CFR 65.12.
   (B)   Fringe (Riverine). If the site is in the fringe (either identified on
the FIRM or identified by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources through
detailed or approximate studies and not identified on a FIRM), the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in this chapter have been met.
   (C)   SFHAs without Established Base Flood Elevation and/or Floodways/
Fringes (Riverine).
      (1)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended Flood Protection Grade
has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be
issued, provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
      (2)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
         (b)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this
chapter have been met.
   (D)   SFHAs not identified on a map.
      (1)   If a proposed development site is near a waterway with no SFHA
identified on a map, the Floodplain Administrator shall verify the drainage
area upstream of the site. If the drainage area upstream of the site is
verified as being greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended Flood Protection Grade
has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper written
approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain analysis/
regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be issued,
provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not less
restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and the provisions contained in this chapter have been met.

   (D)   If any part or all of any provision of these regulations or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance is adjudged invalid by any
court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall be confined in its
operation to the part, provision or application directly involved and shall not
affect or impair the validity of the remainder of that provision or these
regulations or the application thereof. The town hereby declares that it would
have enacted the remainder of these regulations even without any such part,
provision or application.
(2004 Code, § 4-105)
§ 155.006 SAVING PROVISION.
   These regulations shall not be construed as abating any action pending
under, or by virtue of, prior existing subdivision regulations. Nor shall they
be considered as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any penalty
accruing or about to accrue. They shall not affect the liability of any person,
firm or corporation. They shall not waive any right of the municipality under
any section or provision existing at the time of adoption of these regulations;
nor shall they vacate or annul any rights obtained by any person, firm or
corporation, by lawful action of the town, except as shall be expressly
provided for in these regulations.
(2004 Code, § 4-106)
§ 155.007 RESERVATIONS AND APPEALS.
   Upon the adoption of these regulations according to law, the subdivision
regulations of the town previously adopted shall be repealed.
(2004 Code, § 4-107)
§ 155.008 AMENDMENTS.
   The town, to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare, on
recommendation of the Commission, may from time to time amend these subdivision

Commission and/or the town in the manner prescribed by law.
(2004 Code, § 4-108)
§ 155.009 CONDITIONS.
   Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable
conditions to land subdivision is an exercise of valid police power delegated
by the state to the town. A developer has the duty of compliance with
reasonable conditions imposed by the Commission. These conditions may include
the design, dedication, improvement and restrictive use of the land to conform
to the physical and economical development of the town as well as to the safety
and general welfare of the future lot owners in the subdivision and of the town
at large.
(2004 Code, § 4-109)
§ 155.010 RESUBDIVISION OF LAND.
   (A)   Procedure for resubdivision. Approval of the Commission, pursuant to
the same procedures, rules and regulations applicable to subdivisions, shall be
required for any change of an approved or recorded subdivision plat, if such
change affects:
      (1)   Any street layout shown on such plat;
      (2)   Area reserved thereon for public use;
      (3)   Any lot line; or
      (4)   If it affects any plat or plan legally reached before the adoption
of any regulations controlling subdivisions.
   (B)   Procedure for subdivision where future resubdivision is indicated.
Whenever a subdivision plat includes one or more lots containing more than one
acre of land and there are indications that such lots will eventually be
resubdivided into smaller building sites, the Commission may require that such
parcel of land allow for the future opening of streets and the ultimate
extension of adjacent streets. Easements providing for the future opening and
extension of such streets may be made a requirement of the plat.
(2004 Code, § 4-110)
§ 155.011 VACATION OF PLATS.
   (A)   The owner of a recorded plat may vacate the entire plat, or part
thereof, at any time before the sale of any lot therein by executing and
recording a written instrument, to which a copy of such plat shall be attached,
declaring the same to be vacated.
   (B)   Such an instrument shall be approved by the Commission in like manner
as plats of minor subdivisions. The town may reject any such instrument that
abridges or destroys any public rights in any of its public uses, improvements,
streets or alleys.
   (C)   Such an instrument shall be executed, acknowledged or approved, and
recorded, in like manner as a deed to land. Once being duly recorded or filed,
it shall operate to terminate the effect of the plat so vacated. Further, it
shall terminate all public rights, public ways and public grounds, and all
dedications shown or described in the plat or part of the plat.
(2004 Code, § 4-111)
§ 155.012 VARIANCES.
   (A)   General. Where the Commission finds that extraordinary hardships or
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these
regulations, it may approve variances to these subdivision regulations so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest served; provided that,
such variances shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose
of these regulations. The Commission shall not approve variances unless it
shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific
case that:
      (1)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health or welfare or injurious to other nearby property;
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property;
      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or

         (b)   Minor subdivisions; and
         (c)   Exempt divisions.
      (2)   Before any permit shall be granted for a structure to be erected on
land to be subdivided into a major or minor subdivision, the subdividing owner
or his or her subdivision agent shall apply for and secure approval of the
proposed subdivision in accordance with §
155.031 of this chapter and either §§
155.032 or
155.033 of this chapter as appropriate. Before any permit shall be granted for
a structure to be erected on a parcel of land to be created or altered by an
exempt division, the land divider or his or her agent shall certify to the
satisfaction of the Administrator that all requirements for exemption have been
met. If the requirements as detailed in §
155.034 of this chapter are met, then the land division may be granted
exemption from all other requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Discussion of requirements: pre-design conference. Before submitting
any of the materials required by this chapter, the applicant or applicant’s
representative should discuss with the Administrator the nature of the land
division being proposed and request instruction concerning the classification

appropriate, to discuss the proposed land division with those other officials
who must eventually approve those aspects of the subdivision plat coming within
their jurisdiction. The designation of major and minor subdivisions, as defined
in this chapter, shall be made by the Administrator when the applicant submits
an application for sketch plan approval. The applicant shall, in the case of
exempt divisions, provide the Administrator at a pre-design conference with
adequate information to enable him or her to determine whether the proposed
division is an exempt division.

sketch plan. No response from an official or checkpoint agency shall be
interpreted as meaning “no objection” to the sketch plan.
   (D)   Administrator’s review. Within 30 calendar days of the submission
date, the Administrator shall:
      (1)   Study the proposal;
      (2)   Review any checkpoint agency reports received;
      (3)   Meet with the applicant and representatives of each checkpoint
agency wishing to attend the meeting to discuss pertinent aspects of the
proposed subdivision and possible modifications and/or changes that may be
appropriately required under this chapter; and
      (4)   Classify the proposed subdivision as either a major or minor
subdivision, as defined in this chapter.
   (E)   Consultants’ fees. Applicants shall pay all fees of outside
consultants deemed necessary by the town for review of applicants’ plans.
(2004 Code, § 4-302)
§ 155.032 MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   General procedures. If the Administrator, during sketch plan review,
classifies the proposed land division as a major subdivision, the applicant
shall follow the procedures and be subject to the processes outlined and
detailed in this section.
   (B)   Official submission dates. The application and sketch plan shall be
submitted at least 61 calendar days before the date of the public meeting at
which the applicant intends to present the preliminary plat and at least 31
calendar days before submission of the preliminary plat. Thus, at a minimum,
sketch plan submission shall precede preliminary plat submission by no less
than 31 calendar days, which in turn shall precede the public meeting at which
it is intended to be heard by no less than 30 calendar days.
   (C)   Preliminary plat procedures for primary approval.
      (1)   Submission requirements. Following the submission, review and
report on the sketch plan application, the applicant may file a preliminary
plat in the form prescribed by §
155.096 of this chapter for primary approval. The submission shall:
         (a)   Be made on forms approved and provided by the Commission and be
submitted with a fee of $5 per lot for each lot;
         (b)   Show all land that the applicant proposes to subdivide and
adjacent land within 100 feet. The application shall include the names and
addresses of the owners of adjoining land as shown in the County Auditor’s
files. This information may be shown on a separate plat map reproduction from
the Auditor’s office;
         (c)   Be presented in duplicate to the Administrator no later than 30
calendar days before the regular meeting of the Commission at which it is
requested to be heard;
         (d)   Be accompanied by ten copies of the preliminary plat as
described in this chapter; and
         (e)   Generally comply with the sketch plan as reviewed.
      (2)   Placement on the Commission agenda. Subsequent to the submission of
the primary plat for primary approval and subject to the filing deadlines
required by this chapter, the public hearing for primary approval shall be on
the agenda of the next regular meeting of the Commission which is at least 30
days after the date of submission of the preliminary plat.
      (3)   Administrative review. Subsequent to placement on the agenda, and
before the date of public hearing, the Administrator and other individuals
serving the Commission in an advisory capacity shall review the proposal. They
will then prepare a written report to the Commission and applicant indicating a
recommendation concerning the subdivision being proposed.
      (4)   Public hearing notification. The Commission shall hold a public
hearing on the preliminary plat. Notice of such hearing shall be published by
the applicant and at applicant’s expense in one local newspaper of general
circulation at least ten days prior to the hearing (per I.C. 5-3-1). Prior to
the public hearing, the applicant shall submit proof of publication that the
notices of public hearing were published at least ten days prior to the public
hearing. All interested parties, as defined in §
155.015 of this chapter, shall be notified by the applicant of the date, time,
place and purpose of the public hearing on the subdivision at least ten days in
advance of the hearing, by certified mail. The applicant shall file with the
Commission prior to the public hearing an affidavit in a form acceptable to the
Commission certifying that all interested parties were properly notified.
      (5)   Primary approval of the preliminary plat. At the public hearing,
the Commission will receive and consider the Administrator’s report, the
checkpoint agencies’ recommendations, and testimony and exhibits submitted at
the public hearing. After the hearing on the preliminary plat, the applicant
shall be advised of any required changes and/or additions. The Commission shall
approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the preliminary plat. One copy of
the preliminary plat shall be returned to the applicant with the date of
approval, conditional approval or disapproval and the reasons therefor within
five days of the public hearing. Primary approval by the Commission is subject
to review by certiorari. Secondary approval of a subdivision cannot occur until
a minimum of 30 days after the granting of primary approval.
      (6)   Field trip. The Commission, at its discretion, upon hearing the
request for primary approval, may elect to continue the matter until its next
regularly scheduled public meeting and may schedule a field trip to the site of
the proposed subdivision, accompanied by the applicant or his or her
representative.
      (7)   Effective period of primary approval. Unless extended, the primary
approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for two years at the end of
which time secondary approval of the subdivision must have been obtained and
certified by the designated officials. Any plats not receiving secondary
approval within two years shall be null and void. The applicant shall be
required to resubmit a new application for sketch plan review and certificate
subject to all the zoning restrictions and subdivision regulations in effect at
the time of re-submission. Upon request of the applicant, the Commission may
extend the term primary approval of a preliminary plat in increments beyond two
years without further notice and public hearing.
   (D)   Approval of construction plans.
      (1)   Submission procedure and requirements. Following primary approval
and before submission of the final plat for secondary approval, the applicant
shall file with the Administrator three sets of the detailed construction plans
in the form prescribed in §
155.097 of this chapter. This must be done before starting work on any
improvements.
      (2)   Review process. The Administrator shall immediately refer
construction plans to the appropriate agencies for review. Upon these agencies
notifying the Administrator of their approval of the construction plans or
failing to notify the Administrator within 14 working days of their receipt of
the plans, the Administrator shall mark the plans approved and return one set
to the applicant. In no event shall secondary approval (of the final plat) be
given before approval of the construction plans.
      (3)   Installation of improvements. The installation of improvements
shall be inspected by the town’s appropriate representatives. Such inspections
are required in all instances regardless of whether the work is performed
before or after secondary approval. Failure to request inspection of work
performed before secondary approval may be cause for denial of secondary
approval. See §§
155.080 through
155.084 of this chapter.
   (E)   Final plat procedure (secondary approval).
      (1)   Submission requirements. Following primary approval of the
preliminary plat and construction plans, the applicant shall file with the
Administrator a request for secondary approval of a final plat in the form
prescribed by §
155.098 of this chapter. The application shall:
         (a)   Be submitted on forms approved and provided by the Commission;
         (b)   Include the entire subdivision, or section thereof which derives
access from an existing state, county or municipal roadway;
         (c)   Be accompanied by five copies of the final plat as described in
this chapter;
         (d)   Totally comply with the ordinance and the terms and conditions
of primary approval;
         (e)   Be accompanied by a performance bond, if required, in a form
satisfactory to the Commission’s attorney and in an amount equal to 110% of the
estimated cost of the public improvements. The bond amount shall be certified
by a qualified professional engineer and shall guarantee the completion of all
required subdivision and off-site public improvements. See §§
155.080 through
155.084 of this chapter; and
         (f)   Be accompanied by any restrictive covenants in a form approved
by the Commission, that have been proposed by the applicant or required by the
Commission.
      (2)   Determination of conformance (secondary approval). To secure
secondary approval, a final plat must conform with the preliminary plat
approved by the Commission. If the final plat deviates from the approved
preliminary plat, then the plat shall be submitted to the Commission at a
public hearing for a new primary approval. The Commission may delegate
authority to grant secondary approval to the Administrator.
         (a)   If the Administrator is delegated authority to grant secondary
approval, then he or she shall review the items submitted according to division
(E)(1) above within ten working days and shall determine conformance with all
conditions and requirements imposed as part of the primary approval. If the
plat is found to be in conformance and complete, then the Administrator shall
recommend the signing of the certificate granting secondary approval.
         (b)   If the Commission reviews a plat for secondary approval, the
applicant shall request Commission review in writing no less than 30 calendar
days prior to the date of the public meeting at which the final plat is to be
reviewed. The matter shall be placed on the agenda of the next regular meeting
of the Commission at least 30 days after final plat submission. The
Administrator shall review the proposal and submit a written report and
recommendations to the Commission and the applicant. The Commission shall
approve or disapprove the final plat. If granted secondary approval, the plat
shall be signed by the designated officials. If the plat is not granted
secondary approval, then the applicant shall be informed as to the
insufficiency of his or her submittal.
      (3)   Sectionalizing plats.
         (a)   Before granting secondary approval of a major subdivision plat,
the Commission may permit the plat to be divided into two or more sections.
However, it may impose such conditions upon the filing of the sections as it
may deem necessary to assure the orderly development of the subdivision. The
Commission may require that a performance bond be provided in an amount
commensurate with the section or sections of the plat to be filed and may defer
the remaining required performance bond principal amount until the remaining
sections of the plat are offered for filing. Such sections must contain at
least 20 lots or 10% of the total number of lots contained in the approved
plat, whichever is less.
         (b)   The approval of all remaining sections not filed with the
Administrator shall automatically expire after five years from the date of
primary approval of the preliminary plat, unless the expiration date is
extended.
   (F)   Signing and recording a plat.
      (1)   Signing of plat.
         (a)   When a performance bond is required, the designated officials of
the Commission shall endorse secondary approval of the plat by signing the
certificate of approval after the bond has been approved, and all the
conditions of the primary approval have been satisfied. The certificate of
approval shall be part of the tracing cloth or reproducible Mylar of the
subdivision plat. The applicant shall provide the Administrator a Mylar print
of the approved and fully executed and recorded plat.
         (b)   When, at the discretion of the Commission, installation of
improvements is permitted in place of performance bonds, the designated
officials of the Commission shall endorse secondary approval of the plat by
signing the certificate. Such signing shall only occur after all conditions of
the primary approval have been satisfied and all improvements satisfactorily
completed. The developer shall provide certified as-built drawings of the
completed public improvements and other such written evidence as necessary to
verify that the required public facilities have been installed in a manner
satisfactory to the town.
      (2)   Assurance to applicant. If the applicant is permitted to install
improvements before the secondary approval and it is shown that all such
improvements have been installed in strict conformance with the final plat,
then the Commission shall have no other recourse than to grant secondary
approval.
      (3)   Recording a plat. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant
in the presence of the Administrator or his or her designee to file the plat
with the County Recorder within 30 days of the date of signature.
(2004 Code, § 4-303)
§ 155.033 MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   General procedures. If the Administrator, during sketch plan review,
classifies the proposed subdivision as a minor subdivision, the applicant shall
follow the procedures and be subject to the process as outlined and detailed in
this section.
   (B)   Official submission date and placement on the agenda. An application
for sketch plan approval for a minor subdivision shall be placed on the agenda
of the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Commission to occur 30 days
after the date the application is submitted.
   (C)   Administrative review. Subsequent to placement on the Commission’s
agenda and before the date of the public hearing, the Administrator and other
representatives of the Commission shall submit a written report to the
Commission and applicant including a recommendation about the subdivision being
proposed.
   (D)   Public hearing notification. The Commission shall hold a public
hearing on the sketch plan and notice of such hearing shall be in one local
newspaper of general circulation ten days prior to the hearing (per I.C. 5-3-1)
at the applicant’s expense. At the time of the public hearing, the applicant
shall submit proofs of publication that the notices of public hearing were
published at least ten days prior to the public hearing. Interested parties, as
defined in §
155.015 of this chapter, shall be notified by the applicant of the date, time,
place and purpose of the public hearing on the subdivision at least ten days in
advance of the hearing, by certified mail. The applicant shall file with the
Commission at the time of the public hearing an affidavit so testifying.
   (E)   Approval of the sketch plan. After the Commission has, at a regularly
scheduled meeting, examined the sketch plan, the Administrator’s report, the
checkpoint agencies’ recommendations, testimony and exhibits submitted, the
Commission shall, at a regularly scheduled meeting, approve, conditionally
approve or disapprove the sketch plan. One copy of the sketch plan shall be
returned to the applicant with the date of approval, conditional approval or
disapproval and the reasons therefor accompanying the sketch plan within five
days after the public meeting. Primary approval by the Commission is subject to
review by certiorari. Secondary approval of a subdivision cannot occur until
the minimum of 30 days has elapsed since the granting of sketch plan.
   (F)   Final subdivision plat procedure for secondary approval.
      (1)   Application requirements. Following approval of the sketch plan,
the applicant, if he wishes to proceed with the subdivision, shall file with
the Administrator an application for secondary approval of a final plat in the
form prescribed in §
155.098 of this chapter. The application shall:
         (a)   Be submitted on forms approved and provided by the Commission;
         (b)   Show all land that the applicant proposes to subdivide and
adjacent land within 100 feet. The application shall include the names and
addresses of owners of adjoining land as shown in the County Auditor’s files.
This information may be shown on a separate plat map reproduction from the
Auditor’s office;
         (c)   Include the entire subdivision, or section thereof, which
derives access from all existing state, county or municipal roadways;
         (d)   Be accompanied by five copies of the subdivision plat as
described in this chapter;
         (e)   Totally comply with this chapter and the terms and conditions of
primary approval; and
         (f)   Be accompanied by restrictive covenants in a form approved by
the Commission, where proposed by the applicant or required by the Commission.
      (2)   Determination of conformance (secondary approval). In order to be
recorded, a final subdivision plat shall either be found to be in conformance
with the approved sketch plan by the Administrator, or by the Commission at a
public meeting. If the final subdivision plat deviates from the sketch plan
that received primary approval, the subdivision shall be resubmitted to the
Commission at a public meeting for a new primary approval. The applicant
submitting a final plat conforming to the primary approval shall choose as to
whether this review is performed by the Administrator or by the Commission at a
public meeting.
         (a)   Should the applicant not choose Commission review, the
Administrator shall, within ten working days, review the items submitted as per
division (F)(1) above in order to ascertain conformance with the primary
approval. If the submission is found to be in conformance and complete, the
Administrator shall recommend the signing of the certificate granting secondary
approval.
         (b)   Should the applicant choose Commission review, the Commission
shall perform the same function, but at a public meeting. The applicant shall
request in writing Commission review no less than 30 calendar days prior to the
date of the public meeting at which the applicant intends to have his or her
final plat reviewed. The Commission shall place the matter on its next regular
meeting agenda. The Administrator shall review the proposed final plat and
submit a written report and recommendations to the Commission and the
applicant. The Commission shall approve, conditionally approve or disapprove
the final plat. If approved, it shall be signed by the designated officers of
the Commission. If not approved, then the applicant shall be informed as to the
insufficiency of his or her submittal.
      (3)   Sectionalizing plats. Before granting secondary approval of a minor
subdivision plat, the Commission may permit the plat to be divided into two or
more sections. Further, it may impose such conditions upon the filing of the
sections as it may deem necessary to assure the orderly development of the
plat. The Commission may require that the performance bond be in such amount as
is commensurate with the section or sections of the plat to be filed. It may
also defer the remaining required performance bond principal amount until the
remaining sections of the plat are offered for filing.
   (G)   Signing and recording a plat.
      (1)   Signing of plat.
         (a)   When a bond is required, the designated officials of the
Commission shall endorse secondary approval on the plat after the bond has been
approved by the town’s appropriate representatives and all the conditions of
the primary approval have been satisfied. See §§
155.080 through
155.084 of this chapter.
         (b)   When installation of improvements is required, the designated
officials of the Commission shall endorse secondary approval on the plat by
signing the certificate after all conditions of the primary approval have been
satisfied and all improvements satisfactorily completed. There shall be written
evidence that the required improvements have been installed in a manner
satisfactory to the town’s appropriate representatives in the form of a
certificate signed by the Town Council.
      (2)   Assurance to applicant. If the applicant elects to install all
improvements before he or she applies for secondary approval and it is shown
that the conditions of the ordinance have been met, and if the final plat
completely conforms to the primary approval, the Commission shall have no other
recourse than to grant secondary approval.
      (3)   Recording of plat.
         (a)   The designated officials shall sign the certificates granting
secondary approval which shall be a part of the tracing cloth or reproducible
Mylar of the subdivision plat, plus two Mylar prints of the subdivision plat.
The Mylar prints shall be returned to the applicant and his or her engineer or
surveyor.
         (b)   It shall be the responsibility of the applicant in the presence
of the Administrator or his or her designee to record the plat with the County
Recorder within 30 days of the date of signature.
(2004 Code, § 4-304)
§ 155.034 EXEMPT DIVISIONS.
   (A)   General procedure for exempt divisions. An applicant may apply for an
exempt division of the type or types defined in §
155.015 of this chapter by submitting to the Administrator the information
prescribed under §
155.099 of this chapter.
   (B)   Exempt division review process.
      (1)   The Administrator shall review an application for classification as
an exempt division within 15 working days of receiving the information required
in §
155.099 of this chapter. If the division is not classified as exempt, then the
applicant shall be notified to file an application for a major or minor
subdivision. If the division is classified as exempt, then the Administrator
shall issue a statement of compliance.
      (2)   Both the applicant and the Administrator shall hold copies of the
statement of compliance. When the parcel so exempted by this statement is
conveyed to another party, a copy of the statement of compliance may also be
conveyed as proof of the exemption.
(2004 Code, § 4-305)
IMPROVEMENTS AND DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 155.045 GENERALLY; CONFORMANCE.
   (A)   Conformance to applicable rules and regulations. In addition to the
requirements established herein, all subdivision plats shall comply with the
following laws, rules and regulations:
      (1)   All applicable state and local statutory provisions;
      (2)   The town’s Zoning Ordinance, Comprehensive Plan, Office Map,
Building and Housing Codes and all other applicable laws of the town;
      (3)   The special requirements of these regulations and any rules of the
State or County Health Departments and all other appropriate state agencies;
and
      (4)   The rules and regulations of the state’s Department of Highways if
the subdivision or any lot contained therein abuts a state highway or
connecting street. Plat approval shall be withheld if a subdivision is not in
conformity with the above requirements and with the policies and purposes of
these regulations as established in §§
155.002 and
155.003 of this chapter.
   (B)   Self-imposed restrictions. If the owner places restrictions on any of
the land contained in the subdivision greater than those required by of this
code of ordinances or these regulations, such restrictions or reference thereto
may be required to be indicated on the subdivision plat, or the Commission may
require that restrictive covenants be recorded with the County Recorder in the
form to be approved by the Commission’s Attorney. This section, however, shall
impose no obligation upon the Commissioner or the town to enforce any such
restrictive covenants.
   (C)   Boundary improvements.
      (1)   The applicant shall place, under the supervision of a registered
land surveyor, concrete monuments four inches square or four inches in diameter
and 40 inches long with an iron pipe cast in the center, at each corner or
angle of the ultimate outside boundary of the subdivision. Those monuments
shall be set following grading of each phase of the subdivision.
      (2)   The applicant shall place, under the supervision of a registered
land surveyor, pipes or steel rods, five-eighths of an inch in diameter by 30
inches in length at the corners of each lot. Such pipes or rods shall be set
prior to and as a condition of the issuance of an improvement water permit for
each lot.
   (D)   Character of the land. Land which the Commission finds to be
unsuitable for subdivision or development because of flooding, improper
drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or
topography, utility easements, environmental conditions, artifacts or other
features which might reasonably be harmful to the safety, health and general
welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its
surrounding areas, shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods
are formulated by the developer and approved by the Commission to address the
unsuitable land conditions. Such land shall be set aside for such suitable uses
permitted by
Ch. 156 of this code of ordinances.
   (E)   Subdivision name. The proposed name of the subdivision shall not
duplicate or too closely phonetically approximate the name of any other
subdivision in the area covered by these regulations. The Commission shall have
final authority to approve the name of the subdivision which shall be
determined at the time of primary approval.
(2004 Code, § 4-401)
§ 155.046 LOT IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Lot arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulties in securing building permits to develop each lot in
compliance with
Ch. 156 of this code of ordinances and all other applicable laws, codes, rules
and regulations in providing safe and efficient driveway access to buildings on
such lots from the appropriate approved street.
   (B)   Lot dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards
in
Ch. 156 of this code of ordinances. The Commission may require that lots be
arranged to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets where
they may be necessary to serve all such potential lots in compliance with
Ch. 156 of this code of ordinances and these regulations. Generally, side lot
lines shall be at right angles to the street lines (or radial to curving street
lines) unless a variation from this rule will give a better street or lot plan.
Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for erection of
buildings, observing the minimum front yard setback from both streets. Depth
and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial or
industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for all the off-street parking
and loading facilities required for the type of use and development
contemplated, as established in
Ch. 156 of this code of ordinances.
   (C)   Double frontage lots and access to lots.
      (1)   Double frontage lots. Double frontage and reversed frontage lots
shall be avoided, except where necessary to provide for the separation of
residential development from the traffic on bordering arterials or to overcome
specific disadvantages of topography and orientation affecting the subdivision
lots.
      (2)   Access from primary and secondary thoroughfares. If the area
proposed to be platted abuts upon or contains an existing or proposed primary
or secondary thoroughfare, the street plan shall provide vehicular access to
each lot abutting upon said thoroughfare by one of the following means:
         (a)   A parallel street providing frontage for lots backing onto, but
separated from said thoroughfare right-of-way by a screen planting or buffer
strip;
         (b)   A cul-de-sac, or series of cul-de-sacs, entered from a street
paralleling said thoroughfare, with the terminal lots of the cul-de-sac backing
onto the thoroughfare right-of-way and separated from said thoroughfare right-
of-way by a screen planting or buffer strip;
         (c)   A marginal access street separated from said thoroughfare by a
screen planting or buffer strip, access to the thoroughfare being provided at
points suitably spaced; and
         (d)   Any other reasonable means necessary to control the number and
location of intersections with such thoroughfare and provide adequate
separation of through and local vehicular traffic.
(2004 Code, § 4-402)
§ 155.047 BLOCKS.
   (A)   The width of blocks shall be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots,
except where reverse frontage on a primary thoroughfare is required.
   (B)   As a general principle, intersections with thoroughfares shall not
exist at less than quarter mile intervals. Intersecting streets that determine
block lengths shall be provided at such intervals as to conform to the
Comprehensive Plan and Thoroughfare Plan and serve cross-traffic adequately.
They also must relate logically to existing and proposed topographical and
other conditions, produce reasonable grades and suitable sites for the uses
proposed and create a desirable local subdivision plan consistent therewith.
   (C)   Where blocks are not arranged in the direction of natural pedestrian
and traffic flow, a crosswalk or pedestrian way may be required near the center
and entirely across the block to provide circulation or access to schools,
playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation or other community facilities.
Pedestrian ways required by the Commission shall be dedicated and paved to a
width of at least five feet.
(2004 Code, § 4-403)
§ 155.048 EASEMENTS.
   (A)   All proposed plats submitted for Commission approval under the
provisions of this chapter shall allocate areas of suitable size and location,
wherever necessary, for utility easements. As a general principle, such
easements shall be centered on rear or side lot lines and shall be at least
eight feet wide on both sides of the property lines. Easements shall be
continuous to the street at the end of the block to connect with adjoining
blocks in the shortest direct line.
   (B)   If any stream or necessary surface drainage course is located in said
area proposed to be platted, then adequate areas shall be allocated along the
sides of such stream or surface drainage course for widening, deepening,
sloping, improving or protecting said stream or surface drainage course. (See §
155.061 of this chapter.)
(2004 Code, § 4-404)
§ 155.049 BUILDING SETBACK LINES.
   Building setback lines shall be regulated by the setback provisions of
Ch. 156 of this code of ordinances applicable to said area proposed to be
platted, with the exception that front building setback lines shall be as
follows.
   (A)   Expressway, arterial highway or primary thoroughfare. No part of any
structure (except an eave or cornice overhang four feet or less) shall be built
closer than 50 feet from any right-of-way line of an expressway or arterial
highway or closer than 45 feet from any right-of-way line of a primary
thoroughfare.
   (B)   Secondary thoroughfare. No part of any structure (except an eave or
cornice overhang four feet or less) shall be built closer than 40 feet from any
right-of-way line of any secondary thoroughfare.
   (C)   Collector street. No part of any structure (except an eave or cornice
overhang four feet or less) shall be built closer than 35 feet from any right-
of-way line of any collector street.
   (D)   Local street, marginal access street or cul-de-sac. No part of any
structure (except an eave or cornice overhang four feet or less) shall be built
closer than 25 feet from any right-of-way line of any local street, marginal
access street or cul-de-sac.
(2004 Code, § 4-405)
§ 155.050 NON-RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISION.
   (A)   General. If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for
commercial or industrial purposes, then the layout of the subdivision with
respect to such land shall meet such special provisions as the Commission finds
appropriate. A non-residential subdivision shall also be subject to all the
requirements set forth in
Ch. 156 of this code of ordinances, all the requirements of these regulations,
as well as such additional standards required by the Commission. It shall also
conform to the proposed land use and standards established in the Comprehensive
Plan and Official Map. Exception: where lot lines are to be established
incrementally, they need not be shown on the sketch plan or the preliminary
plat for primary approval. All shopping centers and other non-residential
subdivisions of buildings for lease shall be subject to the relevant provisions
of this chapter.
   (B)   Standards. The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Commission that the street, parcel and block pattern proposed are appropriate
for the uses anticipated and adequately take into account other uses nearby.
The following principles and standards shall be observed.
      (1)   Proposed commercial or industrial parcels shall be of sufficient
area and dimensions to the types of industrial development anticipated.
Proposals for incremental lot by lot subdivision must be made clear in a
statement on the plat that is satisfactory to the Commission.
      (2)   Street rights-of-way and pavement construction shall be adequate to
accommodate the type and volume of traffic anticipated.
      (3)   Special requirements may be imposed by the Commission regarding
street, curb, gutter and sidewalk design and construction.
      (4)   Special requirements may be imposed by the Commission with respect
to the installation of public utilities, including water, sewer and storm water

streets within and on the perimeter of a plat shall be logically related to the
public convenience and safety and shall conform with the Comprehensive Plan and
Thoroughfare Plan, and existing and proposed topographical and other
conditions, to:
      (1)   Produce reasonable grades and suitable sites for the uses proposed;
      (2)   Serve vehicular and pedestrian traffic adequately and provide ease
of circulation within, ingress to and egress from said proposed platted area;
and
      (3)   Create a desirable local subdivision plan consistent with said
proposed uses.
   (B)   Such street plan shall provide for logical extension, continuation or
completion of all properly located existing streets, either constructed or
appearing on any validly recorded plat or survey, or valid plat previously
approved by the Commission.

thoroughfare” shall be an arterial street designed, planned and intended for
through vehicular traffic in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan and
Thoroughfare Plan with partial control of access thereto. As a general
principle, primary thoroughfares shall be located at approximately one-mile
intervals in a north-south, east-west grid pattern, except in congested areas
where they may be located at more frequent intervals. Minimum width of right-
of-way for primary thoroughfare shall be 90 feet. Partial control of access to
a primary thoroughfare shall be exercised to permit access to each lot abutting
thereon.
   (C)   Secondary thoroughfare. Any street designated and labeled as a
“secondary thoroughfare” shall be designed, planned and intended to serve as a
collector and distributor of through vehicular traffic. This shall be done in
conformance with the Comprehensive Plan and Thoroughfare Plan from sections of
land within the town to expressways, parkways and primary thoroughfares and
vice versa, with partial control of access thereto. Minimum width of right-of-
way for a secondary thoroughfare shall be 90 feet. Partial control of access to
a primary thoroughfare shall be exercised to permit access to each lot abutting
thereon. (Refer to “construction standards”.)
   (D)   Collector street. Any street designated and labeled as a “collector
street” shall be designed, planned and intended to serve as a collector and
distributor of vehicular traffic in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan.
Collector streets shall carry vehicular traffic to and from expressways,
parkways, primary thoroughfares and secondary thoroughfares, with partial
control of access thereto. Such streets shall include, but not be limited to,
entrance streets of residential subdivisions. Minimum width of right-of-way for
a collector street shall be 70 feet. Partial control of access to collector
streets shall be exercised to permit access to each lot abutting thereon.
(Refer to “construction standards”.)
   (E)   Local street. Any street designated and labeled as a “local street”
shall be designed, planned and intended to provide access to other streets from
individual properties, in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan, primarily to
provide access to lots abutting thereon, with partial control of access
thereto. Minimum width of right-of-way for a local street shall be 50 feet in
subdivisions designed for five dwelling units or less per acre of ground within
the boundaries of the plat. Minimum width of right-of-way for a local street
shall be 60 feet in subdivisions designed for more than five dwelling units per
acre of ground within the boundaries of the plat or for commercial, industrial
or other non-residential land uses. Partial control of access to local street
shall be exercised to permit access to each lot abutting thereon. (Refer to
“construction standards”.)
   (F)   Cul-de-sac. Any street designated and labeled as a “cul-de-sac” shall
be designed, planned and constructed with one end open to vehicular traffic
from an expressway, parkway, primary thoroughfare, secondary thoroughfare,
collector street or local street. The closed end thereof shall be permanently
terminated by a vehicular turnaround, in conformance with the Comprehensive
Plan, with partial control of access thereto. Minimum width of right-of-way for
a cul-de-sac shall be 90 feet in subdivisions designed for five dwelling units
or less per acre of ground within the boundaries of the plat. Minimum width or
right-of-way for a cul-de-sac shall be 110 feet in subdivisions designed for
more than five dwelling units per acre of ground within the boundaries of the
plat. Minimum width of right-of-way for a cul-de-sac in a commercial,
industrial or other non-residential subdivision shall be 90 feet. Partial
control of access to a cul-de-sac shall be exercised to permit access to each
lot abutting thereon.

Specifications, current edition, hereafter referred to as the Standard
Specifications, unless otherwise required by this chapter. Copies of said
Standard Specifications are on file in the office of the town’s Zoning
Administrator.
   (B)   Preparation of sub-grade for street pavements.
      (1)   After all earth work is substantially complete and all drains
installed, the sub-grade shall be brought to the lines and grades shown on the
plans or as may be otherwise approved according to these standards. Such
portions shall be known as “sub-grades”.
      (2)   Unless otherwise provided, the upper six inches of all sub-grade
shall be uniformly compacted to at least 95% standard density as determined by
the provisions of AASHO, T99, Compaction and Density of Soils. During sub-grade
preparation and after its completion, adequate drainage shall be provided at
all times to prevent water from standing on the sub-grade. Sub-grades shall be
so constructed that it will have nearly uniform density throughout. After
compaction and final grading, the sub-grade shall be finished with a three-
wheel roller weighing not less than ten tons. At areas not accessible to the
roller, the required compaction shall be obtained with mechanical tamps or
vibrators.
      (3)   All soft yielding or otherwise unsuitable material that will not
compact properly shall be removed. All rock encountered shall either be removed
or broken off to conform with the required cross section. Any holes or
depressions resulting from the removal of such unsuitable material shall be
filled with satisfactory material and compacted to conform with the surrounding
sub-grade surface. No placement of pavement shall be permitted on uninspected
or unapproved sub-grade and at no time when the sub-grade is frozen or muddy.
No hauling shall be done nor equipment moved over the sub-grade when its
condition is such that undue distortion results. If these conditions are
present, the sub-grade shall be protected with adequate plank runways, mats or
other satisfactory means if hauling is done thereon. The sub-grade shall be
prepared sufficiently in advance to permit proper inspection so that the final
elevation may be checked with a scratch inspection so that the final elevation
may be checked with a scratch template and compaction checked. All utility
excavations under the pavement shall be backfilled with Grade “B” borrow and
construction shall conform to § 211 of the Standard Specifications or compacted
thoroughly by other means. These locations shall be shown on the construction
drawings as submitted to the Commission.
   (C)   Rigid (plain concrete) pavement construction.
      (1)   At the time of placement of the concrete, the subgrade shall be
properly dampened just before the placement where it has become dry, where the
surface has been removed by final grading or for any other reason it has not
been properly dampened. Plain cement pavement shall be according to § 501 of
the Standard Specifications or any subsequent amendments thereto.
      (2)   Materials shall comply with requirements of the Standard
Specifications. Minimum cement content shall be six bags per cubic yard of
concrete mixture. No cement reduction below the minimum shall be allowed for
admixtures to increase workability or control setting time. Concrete shall be
finished by machine or vibratory screed, except on widened portions,
intersections or other places where hand finishing will be permitted.
      (3)   Weakened plane or dummy, transverse, contraction joints shall be
placed not to exceed 20-foot spacing. Closer spacing to average 15 feet will be
encouraged. Transverse contraction joints may either be formed or sawed dummy
grove, ribbon or premolded strip type, and shall be one-fourth the pavement
depth.
      (4)   When transverse joints are to be formed by sawing, care must be
taken to saw the grooves soon after placing the concrete to prevent the
formation of cracks due to contraction of the slab. All transverse joints shall
be sawed within eight hours after the placing of the concrete unless
authorization is given for sawing later. One of the above named joints shall be
placed at every catch basin and manhole in line of pavement. The location of
manholes and the like in the pavement shall determine the exact location of the
joints. All joints shall extend throughout curbs to full width of pavement.
      (5)   Transverse expansion joints shall be placed at tee intersections
and wherever else shown on the plans.
      (6)   Transverse joints will be formed by sawing or by constructing a
slot or groove, as herein described, for dummy construction joints, or by a
deformed key plate installed before the depositing of the concrete.
      (7)   Curing with white membrane curing compound AASHO Number type 2 - M
- 14B shall be properly applied to give complete coverage.
   (D)   Flexible pavement construction.
      (1)   Pavement shall be constructed according to the requirements of §
401 of the Standard Specifications. Pavement shall be full depth hot asphaltic
concrete unless otherwise approved by the Commission on the recommendation of
the Town Engineer.

(2004 Code, § 4-416)
§ 155.061 DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS.
   (A)   General requirements. The Commission shall not recommend for approval
any subdivision plat that does not make adequate provision for storm or flood
water run-off channels or basins. The storm water drainage system shall be
separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Inlets shall be provided
so that surface water is not carried across or around any intersection, nor for
a distance of more than 600 feet in the gutter or when the encroachment of
storm water into the street disrupts traffic. When calculations indicate that
curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further allowance shall be made for
flow beyond that point and catch basins or inlets shall be used to intercept
flow at that point. Surface water drainage patterns shall be shown for each lot
and block.
   (B)   Nature of storm water facilities.
      (1)   Location. The applicant may be required by the commission to carry
away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist, either
previously to, or as result of the subdivision. Such drainage facilities shall
be located in the street right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual,
unobstructed easements of appropriate width.
      (2)   Accessibility to public storm sewers.
         (a)   Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall
install storm sewer facilities. If there are no outlets within a reasonable
distance, adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm water
subject to the specifications of the Commission. However, in subdivisions
containing lots of less than 14,000 square feet in area and in business and
industrial districts, underground storm sewer systems shall be constructed
throughout the subdivision and be connected to an approved outfall. Inspection
of facilities shall be conducted by the town’s appropriate officials.
         (b)   If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided
eventually, as determined by the Commission, the developer shall arrange for
future storm water disposal by the public utility system at the time the plat
receives final approval. Cost provision(s) for such connection(s) shall be
incorporated by inclusion in the amount of the performance bond or equivalent
required for the subdivision plat.
      (3)   Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert or other
drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential
run-off from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
subdivision. The applicant with subsequent approval of the Commission shall
determine the necessary size of the facility based on the provisions of the
required Construction Standards assuming conditions of maximum potential
watershed development permitted by
Ch. 156 of this code of ordinances.
      (4)   Effect on downstream drainage areas. The Commission shall require
the applicant to determine adequately the effect of each proposed subdivision
on existing drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision. Where it
is anticipated that the additional run-off incident to the development of the
subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage facility, the
Commission may withhold secondary approval of the subdivision until adequate
provisions (such as a storage facility) have been made. No subdivision shall be
approved unless adequate drainage from it will be provided to an adequate
drainage watercourse or facility.
      (5)   Areas of poor drainage. Areas that are not in the floodplain, but
contain soils which are subject to flooding may be approved for subdivision by
the Commission. Such approval shall be given only if the applicant fills the
affected areas of said subdivision to an elevation sufficient to place building
sites and streets two feet above ponding levels.
      (6)   Areas of high seasonal water tables. In areas characterized by
soils having a high seasonal water table as determined by the county’s Soil and
Water Conservation District, lots shall be limited to slab type construction
unless the Commission determines that appropriate engineering techniques will
be applied to alleviate the subsurface problem.
      (7)   Floodway areas. If a subdivision of land is proposed within the
floodplain, floodways shall be preserved and not diminished in capacity by
filling or obstruction, except as approved by the Natural Resources Commission
in writing. No residential building site may be located within the floodway.
      (8)   Floodway fringe areas.
         (a)   Where a subdivision is proposed in an area of the floodplain
designated as a floodway fringe, the Commission may approve such subdivision if
the following conditions are met:
            1.   All lots for residential usage have a flood protection grade
two feet above the regulatory flood elevation;
            2.   Where provided, water and sanitary sewer facilities are
constructed to eliminate contamination of or by flood water; and
            3.   Approval to fill the area from the Natural Resources
Commission has been obtained in writing.
         (b)   Lands below the regulatory flood elevation shall not be used for
computing the area requirement for any lot.
      (9)   Floodplain areas.
         (a)   Where a subdivision is proposed within an area of the floodplain
for which floodway and floodway fringe designations have not been made, the
Commission shall not approve such a subdivision unless the following conditions
are met:
            1.   All streets are raised sufficiently to be above the regulatory
flood elevation;
            2.   All lots for residential usage have a flood protection grade
of two feet above the regulatory flood elevation;
            3.   Where provided, public water and sanitary sewer facilities are
constructed to eliminate contamination of or by flood water; and
            4.   Filling to achieve the above will not raise the level of the
regulatory flood elevation more than one-tenth of one foot for that reach of
the stream.
         (b)   All filling in the floodplain must be approved in writing by the
state’s Natural Resources Commission. Lands below the regulatory flood
elevation shall not be used for computing the area requirement for any lot.
      (10)   Recording of plats in the floodplain and floodway fringe. All
final plats, having within their boundary areas, any elevation of which is
below that of the regulatory flood elevation shall show and label the
regulatory flood boundary and elevation, as of the date the final plat is
drawn. The final plat shall also include all areas of the floodway within a
public utility and drainage easement.
   (C)   Minimum design standards. In designing a drainage system, the
applicant shall be guided by the following minimum standards and requirements.
      (1)   Storm street inlets placed in a low point shall be sized to accept
a ten-year storm volume with 50% of the inlet clogged and no more than one foot
of water pooling above the inlet.
      (2)   Storm swale inlets shall be sized to accept a ten-year storm volume
with 50% of the inlet clogged and no more than one foot of water pooling above
the inlet.
      (3)   The storm detention design shall outlet storm water at a two-year
pre-developed rainfall event rate for a ten-year post developed storm. Also,
the 100-year post developed storm shall be limited to the ten-year pre-
developed outlet rate.
      (4)   Storm pipes shall be reinforced concrete, Class III, with type B
wall thickness. The minimum pipe size shall be 12 inches in diameter. The
minimum pipe flow velocity shall be two and one-half feet per second.
      (5)   Drainage swales with longitudinal slopes flatter than 1% shall have
a six-inch thick reinforced concrete swale, a width (minimum three feet) and
shape as approved by the town’s consultant. Alternative type swale treatments
shall be subject to approval of the town’s consultant.
      (6)   Exposed ends of storm pipes shall have six-inch thick reinforced
concrete slope walls. Pre-cast reinforced concrete end sections are a permitted
alternative.
      (7)   All streets shall be provided with an adequate storm drainage
system consisting of curbs, gutters and storm sewers, or ditches and culverts,
as determined by the Commission. A six-inch perforated tile shall be placed on
each side of all streets and:
         (a)   Be two feet below the soil subgrade and parallel with the
longitudinal pavement grade;
         (b)   Flow to the low point and into the storm drainage system;
         (c)   Be placed below pavement at the inside face of the curbing; and
         (d)   Be backfilled with #8 washed gravel.
      (8)   Inlets in streets shall be placed a maximum of 600 feet apart, or

sized culverts or other approved structures have been permitted by the
Commission. Swales on private property shall be regulated by covenants.
   (F)   Dedication of drainage easements.
      (1)   General requirements. If a subdivision is traversed by a drainage
course, drainage way, channel or stream, then a storm water easement or
drainage right-of-way shall be provided. Such easement or right-of-way shall
conform substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and be of such width
and construction or both as will be adequate for the purpose. Wherever
possible, it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by an open channel
with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume of flow.
      (2)   Drainage easements.
         (a)   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within street rights-of-way,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for such drainage
facilities shall be provided across property outside the right-of-way lines and
with satisfactory access to the street. Easements shall be indicated on the
plat. Drainage easements shall be carried from the street to a natural
watercourse or to other drainage facilities.

shall plant trees on the property of the subdivision. Such trees are to be
planted within five feet of the right-of-way of the street or streets within
and abutting the subdivision, or at the discretion of the Commission and the
County Engineer within the right-of-way of such streets. One tree shall be
planted for every 40 feet of frontage along each street unless the Commission
shall grant a waiver. Such waiver shall be granted only if there are existing
trees growing along such a right-of-way or on the abutting property which, in
the opinion of the Commission, comply with these regulations.
      (2)   New trees to be provided pursuant to these regulations shall be
approved by the Commission and shall be planted according to regulations set
out by the Commission. Such trees shall have a minimum trunk diameter (measured

COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS
§ 155.080 IMPROVEMENT AND PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (A)   Completion of improvements. Before the plat is signed by the
designated officials, all applicants shall be required to complete, in
accordance with the Commission’s decision and to the satisfaction of the
Administrator, all the streets, sanitary and other public improvements
including lot improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision as
required in this chapter, specified in the approved construction plans and on
the final subdivision plat, and as approved by the Commission and to dedicate
the public improvements to the town, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances.
   (B)   Performance bond.
      (1)   The Commission at its discretion may waive the requirement that the
applicant complete all public improvements prior to the approval of the final
subdivision plat. In lieu thereof, the applicant shall post a bond in favor of
the town, hereinafter referred to as a “performance bond”, in an amount
equivalent to 110% of the estimated cost of completion of the required public
improvements to secure to the town the satisfactory construction and
installation of the uncompleted portion of required public improvements, as
provided for in §§
155.032 and
155.033 of this chapter.
      (2)   Such performance bond shall comply with all statutory requirements
and shall be satisfactory to the Commission’s Attorney as to form, sufficiency
and manner of execution. The period within which required public improvements
must be completed shall be specified by the Commission in the primary approval
of the preliminary plat and shall be incorporated into the bond and shall not
in any event exceed two years from date of secondary approval. Such bond shall
be approved by the Commission as to amount. The Commission may upon proof of
difficulty, grant an extension of the completion date set forth in such bond
for a maximum period of one additional year; provided that, the bond submitted
for this extension period meets all other requirements herein. The Commission
may accept, at any time during the period of such bond, a substitution of
principal or sureties on the bond.
      (3)   In place of such a bond, the applicant may submit a certified check
payable to the town in an amount equivalent to 110% of the estimated cost of
completion of the uncompleted portion of required public improvements. Any such
check shall be held by the Clerk-Treasurer.
      (4)   In place of such a bond, the applicant may submit irrevocable
letters of credit on behalf of the applicant and in favor of the town in an
amount equivalent to 110% of the estimated cost of completion of the
uncompleted portion of required public improvements. In the event an
irrevocable letter of credit is used, it shall be written for a maximum length
of two years. Two months prior to the expiration of the letter of credit, the
Commission shall determine if the public improvements have been accepted for
maintenance by the town. If they have not been accepted, the Commission shall:
         (a)   Notify the applicant of intent to secure the funds pledged by
such letter of credit; or
         (b)   At the discretion of the Commission, grant an extension for such
period fixed by the Commission not to exceed one year, in which event the
applicant shall file with the Commission a new letter of credit for the period
so fixed.
      (5)   In place of such a bond, the applicant may submit a certificate of
deposit in an amount equivalent to 110% of the cost of completion of required
public improvements. Such certificate shall be made out to either the town and/
or the applicant and shall be held by the Clerk-Treasurer. If the applicant is
named singly or jointly on such certificate, then the applicant must endorse it
before submitting it to the Commission so that the town may secure the funds.
   (C)   Temporary public improvements. The applicant shall build and pay for
all costs of temporary public improvements required by the Commission and shall
maintain the aforementioned for the period specified by the Commission. Before
construction of any temporary public facility or improvement, the applicant
shall file with the Commission a separate suitable bond for temporary
facilities. Such bond shall ensure that the temporary facilities will be
properly constructed, maintained and removed.
   (D)   Cost of public improvements. All required public improvements shall be
made by the applicant at his or her expense without reimbursement, unless
sharing of expenses is agreed upon by the town.
   (E)   Governmental units. Governmental units to which these bond provisions
apply may file in place of said bond a certified resolution or ordinance from
officers or agencies authorized to act in their behalf, agreeing to comply with
the provisions of this section.
   (F)   Failure to complete public improvements. For subdivisions for which no
performance bond has been posted, if the public improvements are not completed
within the period specified by the Commission, the approval shall be deemed to
have expired. In those cases where a performance bond has been posted and the
required public improvements have not been installed within the terms of such
performance bond, the town may declare the bond to be in default and cause all
public improvements to be installed according to the secondary approval
regardless of the progress of development at the time the bond is declared to
be in default.
   (G)   Acceptance of dedication offers.
      (1)   The approval by the Commission of a subdivision plat shall not be
deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by the town of any street,
easement or other improvement shown on said plat.
      (2)   The Commission may require said plat to be endorsed with
appropriate notes to this effect.
      (3)   The acceptance is that of only the real property itself.

responsible for completing the public improvements according to such plans.
Where the cost of the public improvements is covered by a performance bond, the
applicant and the bonding company shall be severally and jointly liable for
completing the public improvements according to the approved plans.
   (B)   Release or reduction of performance bond certificate of satisfactory
completion.
      (1)   The town shall not accept required public improvements, nor the
Commission release nor reduce a performance bond, until the town has submitted
a certificate stating that all required public improvements or a pro rata part
in the case of a reduction have been satisfactorily completed. The applicant’s
engineer or surveyor shall provide the town with detailed “as built”
construction plans of the public improvements, indicating location, dimensions,
materials and other information required by the Commission.
      (2)   Upon such certification, the town shall thereafter accept the
public improvements for maintenance according to the established procedures.

VARIANCES
§ 156.095 GENERAL.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize upon appeal in specific cases
variances from the terms of this chapter when, because of special conditions, a
literal enforcement of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship upon a
specific property. No conforming use of neighborhood lands, structures or
buildings in the same district, and no permitted non-conforming use of lands,
structures or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for
issuance of variance.
(2004 Code, § 4-300)
§ 156.096 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Two types of variances maybe granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (B)   They are as follows.
      DIMENSIONAL VARIANCE. Designed to adjust the regulations of the zoning
ordinance to the land for which the variance is granted. Generally speaking, a
DIMENSIONAL VARIANCE applies to a bulk, height, area or space requirement of
the zoning ordinance. The primary basis for granting a dimensional variance is
the showing by the applicant that a “practical difficulty” exists if the letter
of the law is strictly applied. Once granted, a DIMENSIONAL VARIANCE shall run
with the land.
      USE VARIANCE. Serves a different function than a dimensional variance. If
a zoning ordinance is valid in general, but confiscatory as applied to a
specific property, the traditional remedy is a use variance. A USE VARIANCE
grants permission for a prohibited use in a given zoning district. The primary
basis for granting a use variance is the showing by the applicant that an
“unnecessary hardship” exists if the letter of the law is strictly applied.
When granted, a USE VARIANCE runs with the applicant (tenant or landlord), not
with the land itself.
(2004 Code, § 4-301)
§ 156.097 REVOCATION OF A DIMENSIONAL VARIANCE.
   A dimensional variance shall be deemed automatically null and void if the
property, building or structure for which the variance was granted is for any
reason demolished or destroyed. Thus, a new replacement building or structure
may be required to conform to regulations in effect at that time. The granting
of a dimensional variance becomes official only upon issuance of an improvement
location permit for the subject property. The issuance of said permit must
occur within 90 days from the date that the dimensional variance was approved
by the Board of Zoning Appeals or the approval becomes null and void. Actual
construction must begin within 90 days from the date that the improvement
location permit is obtained or said permit shall become null and void.
(2004 Code, § 4-302)
§ 156.098 REVOCATION OF A USE VARIANCE.
   A use variance shall be deemed automatically null and void under any and all
of the following conditions:
   (A)   If the use for which the variance was granted ceases for any
continuous period greater than six months in length;
   (B)   If the property or structures for which the variance was granted
change ownership or occupancy;
   (C)   If the applicant to whom the variance was granted fails to comply with
any of the conditions made a part of the variance; and
   (D)   If the Board of Zoning Appeals discovers at some future date that the
variance has created some previously unforeseen problem, nuisance or hazard
that is adversely affecting the health, safety or welfare of adjacent
properties or the general public.
(2004 Code, § 4-303)
§ 156.099 REVOCATION PROCEDURES.
   Procedures for revocation of a variance shall be as follows.
   (A)   Upon determination by the Zoning Administrator that possible grounds
for revocation of a variance exists, the matter shall be placed on the Board of
Zoning Appeals agenda for a public hearing.
   (B)   The original applicant to whom the variance was granted or his or her
successor shall be notified by certified mail of the reasons for the possible
revocation at least 30 days prior to the public hearing.
   (C)   Notice of the public hearing shall also be given as set out in §§
156.135 through
156.138 of this chapter.
(2004 Code, § 4-304)
§ 156.100 APPLICATION STANDARDS FOR A VARIANCE.
   (A)   A variance from the terms of this chapter shall not be granted by the
Board of Zoning Appeals unless and until a written application for a variance
is submitted to the Zoning Administrator and the Board of Zoning Appeals
containing:
      (1)   Name, address and phone number of applicant;
      (2)   Any application filed by any person other than the legal owner of
the real estate involved shall be accompanied by a written statement of such
legal owner consenting to the filing of such application;
      (3)   Legal description of property;
      (4)   Description of nature of variance requested; and
      (5)   A narrative statement demonstrating that the requested variance
conforms to each of the following standards:
         (a)   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other
lands, structures or buildings in the same district;
         (b)   A literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same district under the terms of this chapter;
         (c)   Special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
action of the applicant; and
         (d)   Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant
any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands, structures
or buildings.
   (B)   There shall accompany such application for a variance a verified
statement (affidavit) by the applicant that adjoining property owners were
notified in writing at least 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing of
such application as required by §
156.137 of this chapter.
   (C)   Any applicant shall furnish a verified proof (affidavit) of at least
one publication of a notice in at least one newspaper having general
circulation within the town consistent with the requirements of §
156.136 of this chapter.
   (D)   The cost of legal advertising any required notice to affected property
owners shall be borne by the petitioners.
(2004 Code, § 4-305)
§ 156.101 CONSIDERATION PRIOR TO GRANTING A VARIANCE.
   Prior to granting a variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider the
following conditions.
   (A)   The variance must not be injurious to the public health, safety and
welfare of the town.
   (B)   The use or value of adjacent property must not be adversely affected
by the variance.
   (C)   The need for a variance must arise from some condition peculiar to the
property involved and must not exist in similar property in the same district.
   (D)   Undue hardship as a result of strict application of the chapter must
be proven. Literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter must be
shown to deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties
in the same zoning district.
   (E)   The hardship must not be self-imposed from previous actions. It should
not be a purely financial hardship or a matter of convenience.
   (F)   The variance granted is the minimum variance that will make it
possible to reasonably use the land or structure.
(2004 Code, § 4-306)
§ 156.102 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   Under no circumstances shall the Board of Zoning Appeals grant an appeal or
variance which allows a use not permissible under the terms of this chapter in
the district. The Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions
and safeguards in conformity with this chapter. Violations of these conditions
and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the appeal safeguards
when made a part of the terms under which the appeal or variance is granted,

(2004 Code, § 4-309)
SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS
§ 156.115 GENERAL.

ZONING DISTRICTS AND OFFICIAL MAP
§ 156.150 ESTABLISHMENT AND DEFINITION.
   To classify, regulate and restrict the use of land and structures, the town
is hereby divided into, or provisions are hereby made for future division into,
the following zoning districts. Furthermore, these districts have been
established to encourage the most appropriate use of land within the town, to
protect property values, to regulate the intensity of land use and to promote
the health, safety and general welfare of the public.
(2004 Code, § 5-100)
§ 156.151 SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   The residential districts are intended to be limited to dwellings and public
or semi-public uses which are normally associated with residential
neighborhoods. The only uses permitted in residential districts are those which
would not detract from the residential character of the neighborhood. The
purpose of these three districts is to create an attractive, stable and orderly
residential environment. However, the property development regulations vary
among the three districts in order to provide for the various housing needs and
designs of citizens.
(2004 Code, § 5-101)
§ 156.152 GENERAL BUSINESS ONE (GB1).
   The General Business One District is created to provide for local or
neighborhood business uses that will be compatible with adjoining residential
areas. The GB1 District is designed to provide for commercial, office, public
and semi-public structures which are to be typically much less commercial in
appearance and architecturally more harmonious with residential structures.
This district can serve as a buffer between residential areas and general
business districts where a gradual transition from existing residential use to
general business use is occurring or should occur.
(2004 Code, § 5-102) (Ord. 2026, passed 4-4-2006)
§ 156.153 GENERAL BUSINESS TWO (GB2).
   The General Business Two District is designed to permit the development of a
complete range of retail sales and personal, professional and business services
required to meet the demands of a fully developed residential community. In
general, to achieve maximum flexibility of permitted land use, the GB2 District
makes possible a highly varied grouping of retail and business functions.
(2004 Code, § 5-103) (Ord. 2026, passed 4-4-2006)
§ 156.154 GENERAL BUSINESS MANUFACTURING (GBM).
   The General Business Manufacturing District is designed to permit, within a
single zoning district, multi-use business complexes or land use combinations
of business and non-business uses or single-use business projects. The primary
objective of this district is to encourage development which achieves a high
degree of design and function, and can be intermixed, grouped or otherwise
uniquely located with maximum cohesiveness and compatibility. The district
provides flexibility and procedural economy by permitting the broadest range of
land use choices within a single district, while maintaining adequate land use
controls. The GBM District can be applied to large or small land areas
appropriately located throughout the town, and can be useful in areas of
renewal or redevelopment. Development site plans should incorporate and promote
environmental considerations, working within the constraints and advantages
presented by existing site considerations.
(Ord. 2026, passed 4-4-2006)
§ 156.155 MANUFACTURING (M).
   (A)   The purpose of the Manufacturing District is to encourage the
establishment of manufacturing and wholesale businesses which are clean, quite
of and free of hazardous or objectionable elements. Operation of these
establishments should take place entirely within an enclosed structure and
should generate little industrial traffic. No storage of raw materials,
manufactured products or any other materials is permitted in the non-screened
open space around the building. This district has strict controls on the
intensity of land use providing protection of each industry from the
encroachment of other industries.
   (B)   It is usually located adjacent to residential areas and may serve as a
buffer between heavier industrial districts and business or residential
districts.
(2004 Code, § 5-104)
§ 156.156 MANUFACTURED OF MOBILE HOME COMMUNITY OR PARK DISTRICT (MH).
   (A)   The purpose of the MH District is to accommodate the housing needs of
those residents who prefer manufactured or mobile home living and of those who
desire an economic alternative to conventional dwellings.
   (B)   The term mobile home when used in this section shall denote either a
manufactured home or a mobile home, both of which are more specifically defined
in §
156.410 of this chapter, and the term mobile home park when used in §§
156.405 through
156.416 of this chapter shall mean a parcel of land platted for subdivision
upon which five or more manufactured or mobile homes are harbored for the
purpose of being occupied as principal residences.
(2004 Code, § 5-105)
§ 156.157 FLOOD HAZARD (FH).
   (A)   Flood hazard zoning has been created to protect the public health and
to reduce the financial burdens which may be imposed on the community, its
governmental units and its citizens as a result of improper use of lands which
are subject to periodic flooding.
   (B)   Construction or development of the flood hazard areas of the town
could result in the potential loss of life and property, create health and
safety hazards and lead to extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief.
   (C)   Since development of these areas is not essential to the orderly
growth of the community, these lands are to be reserved for suitable open space
uses that do not require structures or fill.
(2004 Code, § 5-106)
§ 156.158 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP; REPLACEMENT.
   (A)   The town is hereby divided into zones, or districts, as shown on the
Official Zoning Map which, together with all explanatory matter, is hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.
(2004 Code, § 5-201)
   (B)   The Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the Chairperson of the
town’s Plan Commission with the date of the adoption of this chapter.
(2004 Code, § 5-202)
   (C)   No changes of any nature shall be made in the Official Zoning Map or
matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this
chapter. Any unauthorized change of whatever kind by any person or persons
shall be considered a violation of this chapter and punishable as provided
under §
156.999 of this chapter.
(2004 Code, § 5-203)
   (D)   The Official Zoning Map which shall be located in the Town Hall and
shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land and water
areas, building and other structures in the town.
(2004 Code, § 5-204)
   (E)   (1)   In the event that the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged,
destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature and number of
changes and additions, the Plan Commission may, by resolution, adopt a new
Official Zoning Map which shall supersede the prior Official Zoning Map. The
new Official Zoning Map may correct drafting or other errors or omission in the
prior Official Zoning Map.
      (2)   The new Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of
the Chairperson of the Plan Commission under the following words:
 
This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map of the Town of New Whiteland, adopted this                          day of
                                                   , and hereby supersedes and replaces any and all previous zoning maps.
 
                                                                    
Plan Commission Chairperson
 
                                                                    
Recording Secretary
 
      (3)   Unless the prior Official Zoning Map has been lost or has been
totally destroyed, the prior map, or any significant parts thereof remaining,
shall be preserved, together with all available records pertaining to its
adoption or amendment.
(2004 Code, § 5-205)
§ 156.159 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the
Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply.
   (A)   Centerlines of streets. Boundaries indicated as approximately
following the centerlines of streets, highways or alleys shall be construed to
follow such centerlines.
   (B)   Platted lot lines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following
platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines.
   (C)   Town limits. Boundaries indicated as approximately following town
limits shall be construed as following such town limits.
   (D)   Railroad lines. Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall
be construed to be midway between the main tracks.
   (E)   Conflicts to Official Zoning Map. Where physical or cultural features
existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the Official Zoning
Map, or in other circumstances not covered by divisions (A) through (D) above,
the Board of Zoning Appeals shall interpret the district boundaries.
   (F)   Lots divided by district boundaries. Where a district boundary line
divides a lot which was in single ownership at the time of passage of this
chapter, the Board of Zoning Appeals may permit, as a special exception, the
extension of the regulations for either portions of the lot not to exceed 50
feet beyond the district line into the remaining portion of the lot.
(2004 Code, § 5-300)
GENERAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS
§ 156.170 PERMITTED USES AND SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
   The permitted uses for each district are listed in the following Table A,
Official Schedule of Uses. A proposed use not specifically listed shall not be
permitted, unless the Plan Commission determines, in its discretion, that it is
similar enough to a listed use that it should be permitted and deems it to be a
permitted use. In which case, the proposed use will be permitted only in those
zoning classifications in which the use to which it is deemed to be most
similar is permitted. The special exceptions for each district that may be
permitted by the Board of Zoning Appeals are also shown in Table A. The Board
shall follow provisions of this and other applicable sections when considering
any application for a special exception.

NOTES TO TABLE:
1. Setback lines. Setback dimensions given are based upon the requirements for a local street. Other
more stringent setbacks shall be required if adjacent to a higher type of thoroughfare, see § 156.173
of this chapter.
2. Open space. The following requirements are intended to provide exceptions to or qualify and
supplement, as the case may be, the specific district regulations set forth in each of the district's
developmental regulations.
a. Open space not to be counted for two structures. An open space or lot area required for an existing
building or structure shall not be counted as open space for any other building or structure.
b. Eaves, cornices, sills, porches. Open eaves, cornices, window sills and belt courses may project
into any required yard a distance not to exceed 4 feet. Open uncovered porches or open fire escapes
may project into a front or rear yard a distance not to exceed 5 feet.
c. Minimum lot size, cover and street frontage. No dwelling shall be erected on a lot not less than 50

feet. A street or alley shall form the direct and primary means of ingress and egress for all dwelling
units. Accessory buildings which are not a part of the main building may be built in the rear yard,
but shall not cover more than 20% of the rear yard.
d. Attached or detached garages. An attached or detached private garage which faces on a street shall
not be located closer than 30 feet to the right-of-way line.
 
(2004 Code, § 6-201)
§ 156.173 SETBACK REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The below shown setbacks are considered to be minimums. The Plan
Commission may prescribe greater setbacks if either the proposed use or the
condition of the area, in the discretion of the Plan Commission, warrant such
greater setbacks.
   (B)   Yards, having a minimum depth in accordance with the following setback
requirements, shall be provided along all public street right-of-way lines, and
building setback lines shall be as follows:
      (1)   Express, arterial highway or primary thoroughfare. U.S. 31 as
designated on the Comprehensive Plan of the town. No part of any structure
shall be built closer than 75 feet to any right-of-way line of an expressway or
arterial highway, and not closer than 45 feet to any right-of-way line of a
primary thoroughfare. Except, however, in a manufacturing district which shall
have setback requirements as set out in §§
156.215 through
156.218 of this chapter;
      (2)   Secondary thoroughfare. Secondary thoroughfare, as designated on
the Comprehensive Plan of the town. No part of any structure shall be built
closer than 40 feet to any right-of-way line of a secondary thoroughfare.
Except, however, in a manufacturing district which shall have setback
requirements as set out in §§
156.215 through
156.218 of this chapter;
      (3)   Local streets or marginal access streets or cul-de-sacs. No part of
any structure shall be built closer than 25 feet to any right-of-way line of a
local street or marginal access street or cul-de-sac, except where more
restrictive requirements are otherwise provided for in this chapter. Except,
however in a manufacturing district which shall be as set out in §§
156.215 through
156.218 of this chapter. Additionally, it shall be further provided, that in
any block in which an existing yard depth is established (by existing legally
established structures within the same district) for more than 25% of the
frontage of the block (or a distance of 400 feet, whichever is the lesser), the
required yard depth and setback for any new building shall be the average of
such established yards; and
      (4)   Established setbacks.
         (a)   If 25% or more of the lots on one side of the street between two
intersecting streets are improved with buildings all of which have observed an
average setback line greater than the minimum setback requirements for that
specific zoning district, and no building varies more than six feet from this
average setback line, then no building shall be erected closer to the street
line than the minimum setback so established by the existing buildings.
         (b)   If 25% or more of the lots on one side of the street between two
intersecting streets are improved with buildings all of which have observed an
average setback line less than the minimum setback requirements for that
specific zoning district, and no building varies more than six feet from this
average setback line, then it shall be permissible to erect a building as close
to the street line as the average setback line so established by the existing
building; provided, however, that, this provision shall not apply to corner
lots or lots having frontage on more than one street.
(2004 Code, § 6-202)
§ 156.174 HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS.
   The following requirements are intended to provide exceptions to or qualify
and supplement as the case may be, the specific district regulations set forth
in §
156.172 of this chapter and in each of the individual district’s developmental
regulations.
   (A)   General. In measuring heights, a habitable basement or attic shall be
counted as a story at a height of four feet above the floor does not exceed
two-thirds of the area of the story immediately below it and which does not
contain an independent apartment, shall be counted as half story. Height shall
be measured from ground level to the highest point of the building.
   (B)   Projections not for human occupancy. Chimneys, elevators, poles,
spires, tanks towers and other projections not used for human occupancy may
extend above the height limit.
   (C)   Public and semi-public buildings. Houses of worship, schools,
hospitals, sanatoriums and other public and semi-public buildings may exceed
the height limitation of the district if the minimum depth of rear yards and
the minimum width of the side yards required in district are increased one foot
for each two feet by which the height of such public or semi-public structure
exceeds the prescribed height limitation.
   (D)   Accessory buildings. The building height of an accessory building may
not exceed the building height of the principal building.
(2004 Code, § 6-203)
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS
§ 156.185 RESTRICTIONS FOR PERMITTED USES.
   (A)   The permitted uses of property in all residential districts are the
same. Variations among RS1, RS2 and RS3 are in the property development
regulations as shown in Table 156.172. See §
156.170 of this chapter, official Schedule of Uses, for a complete listing of
permitted uses in these districts.
   (B)   The following additional requirements shall apply in all residential
districts.
      (1)   Attached single-family dwelling (zero lot lines). An ATTACHED,
SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING shall be defined as a dwelling structure designed and
intended for multiple-family occupancy with the provision, unlike rental
apartments or condominiums, for private fee simple ownership of each individual
dwelling and lot. Attached, single-family dwellings may provide for two or more
dwelling units per attached structure, up to a maximum of eight units per
attached dwelling structure.
         (a)   Intent.
            1.   It is the intent of this section to provide for the
construction of attached, single-family dwellings and to clarify the
distinction between such units and apartments or condominiums. The structure
itself may be the same as a conventional two-family or multiple-family
structure. The difference is in the extent of ownership and method of
maintenance.
            2.   A conventional apartment building has a single owner
(individual or corporate) with the individual dwelling units leased or rented
to tenants. Building and grounds maintenance normally would be the
responsibility of the property owner.
            3.   Condominiums, on the other hand, have individual owners for
each dwelling unit, with the surrounding common grounds owned and maintained by
a condominium association. In other words, the property owner normally owns
only the dwelling unit in which he or she resides.
            4.   Attached, single-family dwellings are similar to apartments
and condominiums, yet unique in that the property owner owns both the dwelling
and the accompanying lot. Attached, single-family dwellings are single-family
dwellings with zero lot lines and common walls (with other single-family
dwellings) on three or less sides.
         (b)   Permitted zoning districts. Attached, single-family dwellings
shall be permitted in the RF Zoning District and by special exception in RS1,
RS2 or RS3 single-family zoning districts.
      (2)   Manufactured housing Type I.
         (a)   General. It is the intent of this chapter to encourage the
provision of alternative modest income housing in certain residential areas by
permitting the use of Type I manufactured homes. To assure similarity in
exterior appearance between manufactured houses and homes constructed on-site,
only Type I manufactured houses, as defined in §
156.410(A) of this chapter, will be a permitted use in general residential
areas.
         (b)   Permitted placement. The establishment, location and use of Type
I manufactured homes as permanent residences approved individually, by specific
materials, or by design, shall be permitted in any zoning district permitting
installation of a dwelling unit subject to requirements and limitations
applying generally to such residential use in the district; and, provided, such
homes shall meet the requirements for Type I manufactured homes as set out in
§§
156.215 through
156.218 of this chapter. Other types of manufactured homes including mobile
homes shall be a permitted use only in the MH District.
(2004 Code, § 6-301)
§ 156.186 RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Minimum lot areas.
      (1)   Any plat of a subdivision consisting of five lots or more for plat
approval in accordance with
Ch. 155 of this code of ordinances subsequent to the effective date this
chapter, may reduce said minimum lot area of 20% of the total number of lots
within said plat, to the extent of 20% below such square feet requirements;
provided, the average size of all lots within said approved plat shall then be
at least equal to the minimum lot area requirements for the district involved.
      (2)   When not serviced by a public sanitary sewer system, the minimum
lot area for a single-family dwelling shall be increased to a minimum of one
acre. The Plan Commission shall require approval of the private system to be
used from the county’s Health Department.
   (B)   Minimum lot width and street frontage.
      (1)   Any plat of a subdivision consisting of five lots or more submitted
for plat approval in accordance with
Ch. 155 of this code of ordinances, subsequent to the effective date of this
chapter, may reduce said minimum width of 20% of the total number of lots
within said plats, to the extent of 10% below such 80-, 75- and 60-foot
requirements.
      (2)   Each lot shall have as a minimum the front footage shown on a
public street and shall gain access from said street.
(2004 Code, § 6-302)
§ 156.187 GARAGE SALES.
   (A)   Limitation on number and duration of garage sales.
      (1)   No more than one garage sale each month shall be held at the same
location. Garage sales shall not be held in the same location in consecutive
weeks.
      (2)   No single garage sale shall continue for more than four consecutive
days.
      (3)   Garage sales shall not being prior to 7:00 am. or continue past 7:
00 p.m.
   (B)   Restrictions on garage sales. It shall be unlawful to hold a garage
sale:
      (1)   Within the travel portion of any street or alley, or upon any
median thereof, while such street or alley is open to vehicular traffic; or
      (2)   Upon any public sidewalk or right-of-way in such a manner as to
impede the flow of pedestrian traffic.
   (C)   Regulations related to signage. If a garage sale is advertised by the
use of signs, the number, size, location, and duration of such signs shall
comply with the applicable provisions of §§
156.335 through
156.341. All signs advertising a garage sale must include the address of the
garage sale and the dates of the sale.

SIGNS
§ 156.335 PROHIBITION; PURPOSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no sign shall be erected,
moved, enlarged, improved or altered, nor shall any sign be established or
changed in use, without an improvement location permit issued by the Plan
Commission or its designated representative. Permits shall be issued in
conformance with this chapter. The purpose of the sign regulations of this
chapter is to promote the use of signs which enhance the visual environment of
the town and to encourage the use of signs which are harmonious with their
surroundings.
   (A)   All signs and their surrounding structures shall be kept in good
repair. Any sign that advertises an abandoned business or use shall be removed
by the owner of the property on which that sign is located. For purposes of
this section, any business or use that ceases to exist or fails to open for
business continuously for 60 days shall be deemed to be abandoned. With respect
to signs that advertise only one abandoned business or use, all signs and
structures related exclusively to those signs shall be removed. With respect to
sign panels located on a structure shared by two or more businesses, only the
panel(s) advertising the abandoned business must be removed. All signs
advertising abandoned businesses or uses, as defined herein, shall be removed
within 30 days of the date on which the business or use is deemed to be
abandoned or, in other words, within 90 days of the date on which the business
or use ceases.
   (B)   Two permanent freestanding subdivision or project identification
ground signs shall be permitted at each entrance to a subdivision or other
residential project that has been approved in accordance with
Ch. 155 of this code of ordinances. Such signs shall be located on some portion
of the subdivision or project property. The maximum sign face area of such a
sign shall not exceed 40 square feet. If the sign is located on a fence or
wall, only the area of the actual sign itself shall be calculated in
determining the maximum sign area, not the fence or wall itself. No part of the
sign face or the sign support structure of a ground sign shall be more than
four feet above grade level, and earth mounding that is inconsistent with the
ground level of the land surrounding the sign structure and that increases the
elevation of the sign, shall be included in the measurement of the sign height.
Such signs shall be located no closer than ten feet from the existing street
right-of-way line and no closer than five feet from a side or rear property
line. Such signs shall not be placed on utility easements or drainage easements
as defined on recorded plats or site plans without the express consent of the
Plan Commission. Such signs shall not be placed as to interfere with the sight
path of vehicular traffic.
   (C)   No sign shall be erected or maintained at any location where by reason
of its position, working size, shape, color or illumination it may obstruct,
obscure, impair or interfere with the view of, or be confused with any
authorized traffic control devise, signal or sign.
   (D)   No part of any sign attached to the exterior wall of a building shall
be erected to a height in excess of six feet above the roof line or parapet
line of such building.
   (E)   No part of any free-standing sign shall be erected to a height greater
than that specified for other structures in the district in which it is
located; rooftop signs shall not extend more than 20 feet above the roof line,
nor shall such sign be located closer to an exterior wall than a distance equal
to the height such sign extends above the roof.
   (F)   The area of a sign shall be determined by the smallest circle,
triangle or rectangle that can be used to enclose the sign, exclusive of
supporting members that bear no message.
   (G)   (1)   No illuminated sign shall be permitted within 50 feet of any
residential district or in the GB District, unless it is so designed that it
does not reflect or shine light into said district.
      (2)   No illuminated sign shall create an unduly distracting or hazardous
condition to motorists or pedestrians. No sign shall project beyond a lot line,
obstruct a driver’s vision of the road or hinder his or her passage in any way.
Further, no sign shall hinder or obstruct any pedestrian path.
      (3)   No illuminated sign shall shine directly or reflect glare into any
dwelling, hospital, nursing or convalescent home.
      (4)   All sign illumination shall be indirect or interior. No exposed
bulbs, neon tubing or fluorescent tubing shall be allowed, with the exception
of automatic changing signs which display time, temperature or other general
information and illuminated seasonal or holiday signs.
   (H)   Each permitted or required parking area that has a capacity of more
than five cars shall be permitted one sign, not more than two square feet in
area, designating each entrance or exit; and one sign, not more than 12 square
feet in area, identifying or designating the conditions of use of such parking
area for each 25 spaces.
   (I)   Signs established by, or by the order of any governmental agency shall

of the building for the purpose of determining maximum area of the sign.
   (E)   No sign shall project over a lot line and no sign shall project in to
a required yard by more than two feet, except in those blocks where 25% of the
frontage is already occupied by business uses and where overhanging signs are

§ 156.342 SIGN PERMITS.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, it shall be unlawful for
any person to establish any sign within the jurisdictional area of this
chapter, or cause the same to be done without first obtaining a sign permit for
each such sign from the Building Inspector as required by this chapter. These
directives shall not be construed to require any permit for a change of copy
for legal changeable copy, nor for the repainting, cleaning and other normal
maintenance or repair of a sign or sign structure for which a permit has
previously been issued, so long as the sign or sign structure is not modified
in any way to violate the standards or provisions of this chapter. No permit is
required for signs which are exempted from permits elsewhere in this chapter.
No new permit is required for signs which have permits and which conform with
the requirements of this chapter on the date of its adoption unless and until
the sign is altered or relocated in violation of this chapter. A permit must be
secured when the fee ownership of the property upon which the sign is located
has been changed, or when the ground upon which the sign is situated has been
leased to a new tenant.
   (B)   Every sign permit issued by the Building Inspector shall become null
and void if the sign is not established within six months after the issuance of
such permit. Signs which require approval by the Commission must be established
within one year after the date such approval is granted or such approval shall
become null and void. Signs which require variance approval from the Board
shall be established within one year.
   (C)   No person shall establish any sign upon any property or building
without the consent of the owner or person entitled to possession of the
property or building, if any, or his or her authorized representative.
   (D)   Application for a permit shall be made to the Building Inspector upon
a form provided by the Building Inspector and shall be accompanied by such
information as may be required to assure compliance with all appropriate laws
and regulations of the town including, but not limited to:
      (1)   Name and address of the owner of the sign;
      (2)   Name and address of the owner (fee owner) of the premises where the
sign is to be located;
      (3)   Name and address of the person leasing the premises (if
applicable);
      (4)   Clear and legible drawing(s) clearly indicating the proposed
location of the sign which is the subject of the permit and all other existing
signs that require permits, when such signs are on the same premises; and
      (5)   Drawings showing the dimensions, construction supports, sizes,
electrical wiring and components, materials and design of the sign and method
of attachment. The design, quality, materials, and loading shall conform to the
requirements of the Building Official’s and Administrative Code (BOAC), as
amended. If required by the Building Inspector, engineering data shall be
supplied on plans submitted certified by a duly licensed engineer.
   (E)   The Building Inspector shall issue a permit for the establishment of a
sign when an application therefor has been properly made to the town. The
person establishing a sign shall notify the Building Inspector upon completion
of the work for which permits are required, and shall submit a color photograph
of the established sign to the Building Inspector. All signs shall be subject
to an inspection by the Inspector.
   (F)   The Building Inspector may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit
issued under provisions of this subchapter whenever the permit is issued on the
basis of a misstatement of fact or fraud after due notice by and hearing before
the Building Inspector. When a sign permit is denied or revoked by the Building
Inspector, he or she shall give written notice of the denial to the applicant
together with a brief written statement of the reasons for the denial. No
permit for a sign issued hereunder shall be deemed to constitute permission or
authorization to maintain an unlawful sign nor shall any permit issued
hereunder constitute a defense in an action to abate an unlawful sign. An
appeal may be taken to the Board from either the Building Inspector’s denial or
revocation of a permit or from the failure of the Building Inspector to
formally grant or deny a permit within 30 days.
   (G)   (1)   The application, including all required documentation, shall be
filed with the Building Inspector together with the appropriate permit fee.
      (2)   If any sign is hereafter erected, placed, installed to or otherwise
established on any property before obtaining a permit as required herein, the
fees specified shall be doubled.
      (3)   Payment of such double fee shall not relieve any person from
compliance with other provisions of this code and penalties prescribed herein.

§ 156.431 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   COMMON OPEN SPACE. A parcel or parcels of land or an area of water, or a
combination of land and water within the PUD site designed and intended for the
use or enjoyment of the occupants. Street rights-of-way, driveways and parking
lots which directly serve dwellings or commercial buildings shall not be
counted toward area requirements of COMMON OPEN SPACE. Those directly serving
recreational areas may be counted toward COMMON OPEN SPACE area requirements at
the discretion of the Plan Commission.
   GROSS LAND AREA. All areas (whether covered by land or water) contained
within the exterior property boundaries of the PUD that are a part of the PUD.
   LANDOWNER. The legal or beneficial owner or owners of all of the land
proposed to be included in a PUD. The holder of an option or contract to
purchase, a lessee or other persons having an enforceable proprietary interest
in such land shall be deemed to be a LANDOWNER for the purposes of this
subchapter.
   PLAN. The written and graphic submission for a PUD, including a plat of
subdivision; all covenants and articles of incorporation of the homeowner’s
association relating to use; location and bulk of buildings and other
structures; density of development; private streets, ways and parking
facilities; common open space; and public facilities.
   PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD). An area of land, controlled by a landowner,
to be developed as a single entity for a variety of dwelling units and/or other
uses, the plan for which does not correspond in lot size, bulk or types of
dwelling, density, lot coverage and required open space to the regulations
established in any one zoning district, created from time to time, under the
provisions of this chapter, enacted by the Town Council.
   PROFESSIONAL CONSULTANT. A person who possesses the knowledge and skills, by
reason of education, training and experience, to comprehend the full nature and
extent of the project in question regarding its social, economic, physical,
environmental and design characteristics and implications in order to foster a
unified plan for development. He or she may be, but not necessarily limited to,
a registered architect, landscape architect, engineer, planner or equivalent.
   PUD. Planned unit development, as defined in PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD)
above.
(2004 Code, § 9-200)
§ 156.432 MINIMUM AREA REQUIREMENTS.
   The minimum area required for PUD zoning shall be a gross land area of ten
acres if used for residential zone purposes; provided, however, no commercial
uses shall be permitted in a PUD containing a gross land area less than 25
acres; Further provided, however, that, no manufacturing uses shall be
permitted in a PUD containing a gross land area of less than 50 acres.
(2004 Code, § 9-301)
§ 156.433 LOCATION OF A PUD DISTRICT.
   The PUD zoning district may be applicable to any area where the applicant
can demonstrate that his or her proposal will meet the objectives of this
section. After having reviewed the PUD preliminary proposal, the Plan
Commission shall submit its recommendation to the Town Council.
(2004 Code, § 9-302)
§ 156.434 SETBACK REQUIREMENTS.
   The location of all structures shall be as shown on the final approved plat.
Minimum lot size, front, rear and side yard lines, and lot width are not
regulated specifically by this subchapter, although the Plan Commission may be
guided by standards set elsewhere in this chapter for comparable conditions and
by common good practice. The relationship of buildings to each other, to the
local street system and to open space land shall be consistent with the intent
of this subchapter.
(2004 Code, § 9-303)
§ 156.435 INTENSITY OF LAND USE.
   (A)   Because land is used more efficiently in a PUD, improved environmental
quality can often be produced with a greater number of dwelling units per gross
acre than usually permitted in a traditionally zoned district. The Plan
Commission shall determine in each case the appropriate land use and dwelling
unit density for individual projects or sections thereof.
   (B)   However, the following guidelines shall be adhered to:
      (1)   Residential densities:
         (a)   Overall. The maximum residential density for the overall project
shall be five units, per acre: computed by comparing the total number of
dwelling units to the gross land area of the project; and
         (b)   Sections. The maximum residential density for any particular
section shall be 15 units per acre; computed by comparing the number of
dwelling units within a particular section to the gross land area of that
particular section.
      (2)   Land use ratios:
         (a)   Professional. Professional research, office or general business
commercial or business uses may occupy up to a maximum of 20% of the gross land
area;
         (b)   Manufacturing. Industrial uses may occupy up to a maximum of 10%
of the gross land area; and
         (c)   Residential. The remainder of the area shall be devoted to
residential uses; providing that, open space accompanies this land utilization
at the rate of 12 acres for every 300 dwelling units.
(2004 Code, § 9-304)
§ 156.436 COMMON PROPERTY.
   Common property in a PUD is a parcel of parcels of land, together with the
improvements thereon, the use and enjoyment of which are shared by the owners
and occupants. When common property exists, the ownership of such common
property may be either public or private. When common property exists,
satisfactory arrangements shall be made for the improvement, operation and
maintenance of such common property and facilities, including private streets,
drives, service and parking areas, and recreational and open spaces. The
landowner shall provide for and establish an organization for the ownership and
maintenance of any private common open space, and such organization shall not
be dissolved nor shall it dispose of any common open space.
(2004 Code, § 9-305)
§ 156.437 PERMITTED USES.
   All uses within an area zoned as a PUD District are determined by the
provisions of this subchapter and the approved plan of the project concerned.
   (A)   Residential uses. Residential uses may be of a variety of types. In
developing a balanced community, the use of a variety of housing types shall be
deemed in keeping with this subchapter.
   (B)   Commercial, service, other non-residential uses. Commercial,
industrial and other non-residential uses may be included in a PUD subject to
approval by the Plan Commission. Such uses, their locations and commercial area
designs shall be compatible with the residential uses. This subchapter
encourages a mixture of non-residential uses in a PUD as supportive economic
development to the PUD specifically, and to the town in general.
(2004 Code, § 9-306)
§ 156.438 CONFLICT OF RESTRICTIONS.
   Wherever there is a conflict or difference between the provisions of this
subchapter and those of the other sections of this chapter, the provisions of
this subchapter shall prevail. Subjects not covered by this subchapter shall be
governed by the respective provisions found elsewhere in this chapter unless
otherwise approved by the Plan Commission.
(2004 Code, § 9-307)
§ 156.439 NON-RESIDENTIAL USE COMPATIBILITY.
   Commercial, business or industrial uses shall be reviewed by the Plan
Commission to determine the following:
   (A)   The uses permitted are necessary or desirable and are appropriate with
respect to the purpose of this subchapter;
   (B)   The uses are not of such nature or so located as to exercise a
detrimental influence on the PUD, nor on the surrounding neighborhood;
   (C)   The areas and uses are planned as an integral part of the PUD;
   (D)   The uses are located and so designed as to provide direct access to a
collector or an arterial street without creating traffic congestion or hazard;
   (E)   No commercial or industrial uses shall be allowed in a combination PUD
unless the size of the PUD meets or exceeds the area requirements set out in §
156.432 of this chapter;
   (F)   An area map showing adjacent property owners and existing uses within
600 feet of the proposed PUD parcel; and
   (G)   A sketch plan approximately to scale, though it need not be to the
precision of a finished engineering drawing; and it should show the following:
(2004 Code, § 9-308)
§ 156.440 UTILITIES.
   (A)   All utilities, including communication and electrician systems, shall
be placed underground within the limits of a PUD.
   (B)   Appurtenances to these systems may be accepted.
(2004 Code, § 9-309)
§ 156.441 STREETS.
   The design and designation of all streets, public or private, shall be
subject to the approval of the Plan Commission. Minimum pavement construction
and dimension standards shall be as set forth in
Ch. 155 of this code of ordinances. Because of the nature of a PUD and the
intent of this subchapter, the overall shape and dimension of the street right-
of-way shall be at the discretion of the Plan Commission.
(2004 Code, § 9-310)
§ 156.442 HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION.
   There shall be an established home owners association and its by-laws and
other similar deed restrictions which provide for the control and maintenance
of all common areas, recreation facilities or open spaces shall meet with the
approval of the Plan Commission. If any open space or recreational facility is
to be used solely by the residents of the PUD, adequate provisions shall be
made for assessments against the property within the project so that such
facilities can be properly maintained and operated.
(2004 Code, § 9-311)
§ 156.443 COMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL DESIGN.
   The plan of the project shall provide for the integrated and harmonious
design of buildings in commercial and industrial areas and such parcels shall
be developed in park like surroundings utilizing landscaping and existing
woodlands as buffers to screen lighting, parking areas, loading areas and other
features from the adjoining and surrounding residential areas.
(2004 Code, § 9-312)
§ 156.444 APPLICATION AND APPROVAL PROCESS.
   (A)   General. Whenever a PUD is proposed, before a permit for the erection
for a permanent building in such PUD shall be granted, and before a subdivision
plat of any part thereof may be filed in the office of the Plan Commission, the
developer or his or her authorized agent shall apply and secure approval of
such PUD in accordance with this subchapter. Review of the project shall take
place in four phases. At the culmination of each phase, the applicant must
receive the necessary approvals from the appropriate body (Town Plan Commission
or Town Council) prior to proceeding into subsequent review phases. Lack of
sufficient or continuous progress as defined herein, either through or between
phases, may lead to nullification of all approvals by the Town Plan Commission
and Town Council. Approval of any one phase does not guarantee approval of any
subsequent phases.
(2004 Code, § 9-400)
   (B)   Phase I - Concept Approval.
      (1)   Concept plan. In order to allow the Plan Commission and the
developer to reach an understanding on basic design requirements prior to
detailed design, the applicant shall submit:
         (a)   A legal description of the metes and bounds of the parcel;
         (b)   An area map showing adjacent property owners and existing uses
within 600 feet of the proposed PUD parcel;
         (c)   A sketch plan approximately to scale, though it need not be to
the precision of a finished engineering drawing; and it should show the
following:
            1.   The existing topographical features of the site;
            2.   General map of the watershed in which the project is to be
located;
            3.   Location of the various uses and their areas in acres;
            4.   The general outlines of the interior roadway system and all
existing right-of-way and easements whether public or private;
            5.   Delineation of the various residential and non-residential
areas, indication for each area, its general extent, size and composition in
terms of total number of dwelling units and approximate percentage allocation
by dwelling unit type;
            6.   Calculation of the residential density in dwelling units per
gross acre, including interior roadways;
            7.   The interior open space system;
            8.   Where portions of the site are subject to flooding, the map
shall indicate extent and frequency;
            9.   Principal ties to the community at large with respect to
transportation, water supply and sewage disposal;
            10.   General description of the availability of other community
facilities, such as schools, fire protection services and cultural facilities,
if any, and how these facilities are affected by these proposals;
            11.   Evidence that the proposed PUD is compatible with the goals
of the town’s official Comprehensive Plan;
            12.   General statement as to how common open space is to be owned
and maintained;
            13.   If the development is to be staged, a general indication of
how the staging is to proceed. Whether or not the development is to be staged,
the sketch plan shall show the intended total project; and
            14.   The application shall certify that a professional consultant
is being utilized in the planning procedures. Said consultant shall be involved
in the application procedures.
         (d)   The Plan Commission shall review the concept plan and its
related documents at a public hearing and shall render a written report to the
Town Council and to the applicant within 15 days of the public hearing. The
Plan Commission may call upon other public or private consultants to provide a
sound review of the proposal. The Plan Commission may require preliminary
approval from other county or state agencies. The Commission or consultants
need only concern themselves with general conceptual merit, and in no way shall
commit any future acceptance or rejection of detailed design elements required
in subsequent phases of plan review. The written report shall include the
following:
            1.   Whether the proposal meets the intent and objectives of this
subchapter;
            2.   Whether the proposal is conceptually sound in that it conforms
to accepted design principals in the proposed functional roadway system, land
use configuration, open space system, drainage system and scale of the
developed elements; and
            3.   Whether there are adequate services and utilities available or
proposed to be made available in the construction of the project.
         (e)   The Town Council shall review the proposed conceptual PUD plan
within 45 days of receipt of recommendations from the Plan Commission.
      (2)   Proceeding to Phase II. If the Town Council shall grant by formal
resolution approval of the proposed PUD conceptual plan, then the applicant may
proceed to Phase II.
(2004 Code, § 9-401)
   (C)   Phase II - Preliminary Plat Approval and Rezoning Petition.
      (1)   Simultaneous platting and zoning. After having received approval of
the proposed PUD conceptual plan, the applicant may then proceed to Phase II of
the approval process. In Phase II, the applicant shall present the preliminary
site plan (plat) for Plan Commission Review, and may simultaneously petition
for PUD zoning of the total parcel. It should be emphasized that although the
platting procedures may be initiated simultaneously and progress concurrently,
final zoning approval shall be subject to final plan approval, and shall not
occur until after final plan approval (to allow the “Master Plan” to be made a
part of the Zoning Ordinance).
(2004 Code, § 9-402)
      (2)   Application filing and public notification. Application for
preliminary plat approval shall be submitted to the town’s Plan Commission. The
proposed preliminary plat and any supportive documents shall be filed with Plan
Commission office at least 15 days in advance of the public hearing at which
the proposed plat is to be reviewed. The applicant shall meet all Plan
Commission public hearing requirements as set out in §
156.077 of this chapter.
(2004 Code, § 9-403)
      (3)   Contents of preliminary plat.
         (a)   The preliminary plat shall be filed in three copies and include
the following information prepared by a professional consultant:
            1.   An area map showing the applicant’s entire holding, that
portion of the applicant’s property under consideration, and all properties,
subdivisions, streets and easements within 300 feet of the applicant’s
property.
            2.   A topographic map of the entire area showing contour intervals
of not more than two feet of elevation shall be provided.
            3.   A preliminary site plan including the following information:
               a.   Title of drawing, name of project, name and address of
applicant, name and address of professional consultant;
               b.   The land use plan identifying the type, location, quantity,
design, floor area and density of specific sections and the project in total;
               c.   North point, scale and date;
               d.   Existing and proposed watercourses;
               e.   Street layout and design;
               f.   The open space plan and planned sites for schools,
recreation areas, community centers and other public improvements where
applicable;
               g.   Location of all existing or proposed site and off-site
improvements, including drains, ditches, culverts, retaining walls, and fences;
descriptions and location of method of sewage disposal and water supply;
location and size of all signs (street name and traffic control); location and
design of street and parking lighting; and the amount of building area proposed
for non-residential uses, if any; and
               h.   A plan for phasing the construction of the project, showing
the geographical coverage of future plats, their approximate sequence of
development and the tentative timetable for development. It is the intent of
this subchapter that the tempo and sequence of development in a PUD be such
that land uses which provide only moderate local revenues, yet require large
municipal and school service costs, are scheduled simultaneously with those
that provide larger local revenues yet which are not as costly to service.
         (b)   The Plan Commission may require, if all or part of the gross
land area of the PUD has moderate to high susceptibility to flooding, a
transparent overlay showing all soils, areas and their classifications; as well
as those areas susceptible to flooding, or moderately or highly susceptible to
erosion. For areas with potential erosion problems, the overlay shall also
include an outline and description of existing vegetation and tree coverage.
         (c)   The Plan Commission may further require, if the proposed PUD is
within close proximity to an airport, a transparent overlay showing aircraft
patterns, approach patterns and seasonal wind directions. Areas of possible
noise or odor pollution on- or off-site shall be indicated.
(2004 Code, § 9-404)
      (4)   Factors for consideration. The Plan Commission’s review of a
preliminary site plan shall include, but not be limited to, the following
considerations:
         (a)   Adequacy and arrangement of vehicular traffic access and
circulation, including intersections, road widths, channelization structures,
signs and traffic controls;
         (b)   Adequacy and arrangement of pedestrian traffic access and
circulation; separation of pedestrian from vehicular traffic; and pedestrian
convenience;
         (c)   Location, arrangement, appearance and sufficiency of off-street
parking and loading;
         (d)   Location, size and placement of buildings, lighting and signs;
         (e)   Type and arrangement of landscape features;
         (f)   Adequacy, location and size of storm water and sanitary waste
disposal facilities;
         (g)   Adequacy of structures or roadways in areas with moderate to
high susceptibility to flooding, ponding or erosion;
         (h)   Conformance with other specific requirements of the Town Council
which may have been stated in the PUD conceptual resolution or PUD zoning
ordinance;
         (i)   In its review, the Plan Commission may consult with the Town
Engineer, other departments or officials, as well as with the representatives
of federal and state agencies such as the Soil Conservation Services, the
state’s Board of Health or Department of Natural Resources. The Plan Commission
may also require such additional provisions and conditions that appear
necessary for the public health, safety and general welfare; and
         (j)   Property adjacent to the proposed development will not be
adversely affected.
(2004 Code, § 9-405)
      (5)   Action on preliminary plat plan.
         (a)   Within 30 days of the public hearing at which the preliminary
plat is submitted for approval, the Plan Commission shall act on it. If no
decision is made within said 30-day period, the preliminary plat plan shall be
considered conditionally approved. The Plan Commission’s actions shall be in
the form of a written statement to the applicant stating whether or not the
preliminary plat plan is conditionally approved. A copy of the appropriate
minutes of the Plan Commission shall be sufficient report.
         (b)   The Plan Commission’s statement may include recommendations as
to desirable revisions to be incorporated into the final plat plan, of which
conformance with shall be considered a condition of approval. Such
recommendations shall be limited, however, to siting and dimensional details
within general use areas and shall not significantly alter the sketch plan as
it was approved in the zoning proceedings.
         (c)   If the preliminary plat plan is disapproved, the Plan
Commission’s statement shall contain the reasons for such findings. In such a
case the Plan Commission may recommend further study of the plat plan and re-
submission of the preliminary plat plan to the Plan Commission after it has
been revised.
(2004 Code, § 9-406)
      (6)   Town Council review. After having received Plan Commission approval
of the preliminary plat plan, the applicant may then submit his or her proposed
re-zoning ordinance to the Town Council along with the approval recommendations
of the Plan Commission.
(2004 Code, § 9-407)
   (D)   Phase III - Master Plan and Final Zoning Approval.
      (1)   Application for final master plan approval.
         (a)   After receiving the conditional approval from the Plan
Commission on a preliminary plan and approval for all necessary permits and
curb cuts from town, state and county officials, the applicant may prepare his
or her final detailed master plan and submit it to the Plan Commission for
final approval.
         (b)   The final detailed master plan shall conform substantially to
the preliminary plat plan that has received conditional approval. It should
incorporate any revisions or other features that may have been recommended by
the Plan Commission and/or the Town Council during plan concept and preliminary
plat plan review procedures.
(2004 Code, § 9-408)
      (2)   Scope of final platting procedures. Because of the uniqueness of a
PUD compared to conventional zoning and development, the following items shall
be primary considerations related to the final platting of the development:
         (a)   PUD is to be developed as a total project with all area being in
harmony and continuity with each other. Once the project has begun actual
construction, its completion, in the form originally planned and approved,
should be guaranteed in as much as it reasonably can; and
         (b)   At the same time, PUD is usually of sufficient size so as to
make it impractical, both physically and financially, to develop without a
phased and sequenced plan. Thus, some degree of flexibility should be provided
to allow such phasing of the project.
(2004 Code, § 9-409)
      (3)   Master plan to accompany or precede final plat. In the spirit and
intentions of division (D)(2) above, after having received approval of the
proposed master plan, the applicant shall:
         (a)   Provide the Plan Commission with three copies of the final
master plan of the PUD. Said master plan shall show the precise exterior
boundaries of the project, as well as the precise boundary lines of each
section or phase within the PUD. Each section or phase shall have a specific
zoning designation shown on the master plan that conforms to current zoning
designations of the town. At least one of such copies shall be on reproducible
Mylar or equivalent. Subsequent final plats of various individual phases or
sections shall substantially conform to the master plan. Said plan shall also
contain a statement of the good faith intent of the applicant to carry out the
proposed development in accordance with the master plan.
         (b)   The master plan shall further contain a statement of
recommendation from the Plan Commission to the Town Council that said plan, in
conjunction with any other documents or requirements made a part of the project
during the review process, should be a part of the zoning ordinance for the
specific PUD. The statement shall bear the signatures of the Chairperson of the
Plan Commission and the Zoning Administrator.
         (c)   Said master plan when approved by the Town Council shall become
a part of the Zoning Ordinance for the PUD. The master plan shall contain a
statement of approval by the Town Council and shall bear the same signatures as
required on the zoning ordinance. The master plan shall be recorded with the
County Recorder.
(2004 Code, § 9-410)
   (E)   Phase IV - Final Plats. The preliminary plats and final plats for
individual sections or phases shall be approved and signed by the Plan
Commission Chairperson and Recording Secretary in the same manner as prescribed
in
Ch. 155 of this code of ordinances (including requirements for “content of
plat”). The Town Council does not participate in the review or approval of
preliminary plats, final plats or building permits.
(2004 Code, § 9-411)
   (F)   Supplemental regulations.
      (1)   Proceedings. All proceedings brought under this section shall be
subject to the rules of procedure of the Plan Commission, where not
inconsistent with the procedure otherwise stated herein, except that notice by
publication shall be sufficient notice for proceedings related solely to
approval and modification of preliminary plat plans and final plat plan.
(2004 Code, § 9-501)
      (2)   Modification. In the exercise of its continuing jurisdiction, the
Plan Commission may, from time to time, modify the approved final plat plan in
a manner consistent with the approved preliminary plat plan to allow for
changed circumstances and conditions unforeseen at the time of the original
approval. This division (F)(2) does not apply to zoning designations.
(2004 Code, § 9-502)
      (3)   Request for changes. If, in the site development, it becomes
apparent that certain elements of the plan as it has been approved by the town
are not feasible and in need of significant modification, the applicant shall
then present his or her solution to the Plan Commission. The Plan Commission
shall then determine whether or not the modified plan is still in keeping with
the intent of the master plan and zoning ordinance of that specific PUD. If a
negative decision is reached, the site plan shall be considered as disapproved.
The applicant may then produce another site plan solution. If an affirmative
decision is reached, the Plan Commission shall so notify the Town Council,
stating all of the particulars of the matter and the reasons for its
recommendations for approval, whichever the case may be. This division (F)(3)
does not apply to zoning designations.
(2004 Code, § 9-503)
      (4)   Expiration of approval. Approval by the Plan Commission shall
expire after a period of five years from the approval of the PUD’s master plan
unless the development is 51% completed in terms of public improvements such as
power, gas, water and sanitary sewers, in which latter instance an extension of
time may be granted by the Plan Commission not to exceed five successive
periods of two years each.
(2004 Code, § 9-504)
      (5)   Abandonment. Upon abandonment of a development authorized under
this section (abandonment shall be deemed to have occurred when no improvements
have been made pursuant to the approved master plan for 24 months or upon
expiration of the approval as prescribed in division (F)(5) above), the Plan
Commission shall initiate an amendment to the zoning ordinance so that the land
will be zoned into a category or categories which most nearly approximate its
then existing use or such other zoning category or categories which it deems
appropriate.
(2004 Code, § 9-505)
      (6)   Recording. All approved final plat plans and modifications thereof
shall be recorded in the appropriate plat books in the offices of the County
Recorder within two years after approval by the Plan Commission.
(2004 Code, § 9-506)
      (7)   Re-zoning limitations. The Plan Commission shall not initiate any
amendments to the zoning ordinance concerning property involved in a PUD before
completion of development so long as development is in conformity with the
approved master plan and final approved plat plans, and is proceeding in
accordance with the time requirements. Re-zoning may, however, be initiated by
consent of the property owner. In such a case, the regular procedures for re-
zoning property shall be conformed to.
(2004 Code, § 9-507)
      (8)   Official zoning map amended. Upon final passage of the PUD zoning
ordinance by the Town Council, the specific area rezoned shall be shown on the
official zoning map of the town as a PUD district. Reference shall be made on
the map to the number, title and date of passage of said ordinance, as well as
the approved master plan of the PUD and any other supportive documents
designated by the Town Council shall constitute the zoning regulations for that
specific PUD. Any matters not specifically addressed by said ordinance shall be
governed by this chapter and
Ch. 155 of this code of ordinances.
(2004 Code, § 9-508)
INDUSTRIAL PARKS
§ 156.455 GENERAL.
   An “industrial park” shall be defined as a planned industrial subdivision
comprising a single parcel of land, having not less than 400 feet of continuous
frontage on a public street and developed according to a general overall plan
to provide serviced sites for uses permitted in the applicable Manufacturing
Zoning District, including manufacturing, processing, assembly plants,
distribution, wholesalers, warehouses and/or related industrial uses and
accessory facilities therefor and as set out in the official Schedule of Uses.
(2004 Code, § 9-600)
§ 156.456 PERMITTED USES.
   An “industrial park” as so defined in this chapter, shall be permitted in
any manufacturing district by special exception permit (granted by the Board of

FLOOD HAZARD DISTRICT (FH)
§ 156.475 PURPOSE.
   Flood hazard zoning has been created to protect the public health and to
reduce the financial burdens which may be imposed on the community, its
governmental units and its citizens as a result of improper use of lands which
are subject to periodic flooding. Construction or development of the flood
hazard areas of the town could result in the potential loss of life and
property, create health and safety hazards and lead to extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief. Since development of these areas
is not essential to the orderly growth of the community these lands are to be
reserved for suitable open space uses that do not require structures or fill.
(2004 Code, § 10-100)
§ 156.476 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate
including, but not limited to, buildings, and other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operation.
   FLOODPLAIN. Any floodplain, floodway or floodway fringe district or
combination thereof as illustrated on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, as
prepared by the Federal Insurance Administration.
   NATURAL RESOURCES. The state’s Natural Resources Commission.
   REGULATORY FLOOD. The flood having a peak discharge which can be expected to
be equaled or exceeded on the average of once in a 100-year period, as
calculated by a method and procedure which is acceptable to and approved by the
state’s Natural Resources Commission. This FLOOD is equivalent to a flood
having the probability of occurrence of 1% in any given year.
   STRUCTURE. Anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the
ground, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, detached
garages, cabins, mobile homes and other similar items.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 157.01 INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion
by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water
quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat. Eroded soil also
necessitates repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of lakes. In
addition, clearing and grading during construction cause the loss of native
vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat.
   (B)   The purpose of this chapter is to safeguard persons, protect property
and prevent damage to the environment in the town. This chapter will also
promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating, controlling the design,
construction, use and maintenance of any development or other activity that
disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land in
the town.

alteration of ground improvements and structures for the control of erosion,
run-off and grading.
   STABILIZATION. The use of practices that prevent exposed soil from eroding.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The first land-including disturbing activity
associated with a development, including land preparation such as clearing,
grading and filling; installation of streets and walkways; excavation for
basements, footings, piers or foundations; erection of temporary forms; and
installation of accessory buildings such as garages.
   STORM WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN (SWPPP). A document which describes
the best management practices and activities to be implemented by a person or
business to identify sources of pollution or contamination at a site and the
actions to eliminate or reduce pollutant discharges to storm water, storm water
conveyance systems and/or receiving waters to the maximum extent practicable.
   WATERCOURSE. Any body of water, including, but not limited to, lakes, ponds,
