of the body, and therefore, without such authority by the majority he or she
will not be in the direct line of supervision.
   (B)   The town finds that a single member of governing bodies with authority
over employees in the town cannot act for the governing body to make work
assignments, compensation, grievances, advancement, or a performance evaluation
without prior authority of a majority of the body when a statute provides that
a majority is needed to act, and therefore, without such authority by the
majority the single member will not be in the direct line of supervision.

SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY
§ 32.35  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND POLICY: PROTECTION OF EMPLOYEES’ HEALTH AND
SAFETY.
   (A)   Employees are an extremely valuable resource for town’s business.
Their health and safety is a serious concern of the town. Drug or alcohol use
may pose a serious threat to employee health and safety. It is, therefore, the
policy of the Town of Oolitic (hereafter referred to as town) to prevent
substance use or abuse from having an adverse effect on our employees. The town
maintains that the work environment is safer and more productive without the
presence of alcohol, illegal, or inappropriate drugs in the body or on town
property. Furthermore, employees have a right to work in an alcohol- and drug-
free environment and to work with employees free from the effects of alcohol
and drugs. Employees who abuse alcohol or use drugs are a danger to themselves,
their co-workers, and the town’s assets.
   (B)   The adverse impact of substance abuse by employees has been recognized
by the federal government. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration
(“FMCSA”) has issued regulations which require the town to implement a
controlled substance testing program. The town will comply and require that a
driver submit to alcohol and controlled substance tests administered in
accordance with these regulations and is committed to maintaining a drug-free
workplace. All employees are advised that remaining drug-free and medically
qualified to drive are conditions of continued employment with the town.
   (C)   Specifically, it is the policy of the town that the use, sale,
purchase, transfer, possession, or presence in one’s system of any controlled
substance (except medically prescribed drugs) by any employee while on town
premises, engaged in town business, while operating town equipment, or while
under the authority of the town is strictly prohibited. FMCSA states that
mandatory testing must apply to every person who operates a commercial motor
vehicle in interstate or intrastate commerce and is subject to the CDL
licensing requirement.
   (D)   The execution and enforcement of this policy will follow set
procedures to screen body fluids (urinalysis), conduct breath testing, and or
search all covered employees including applicants for alcohol and drug use.
These procedures are designed not only to detect violations of this policy, but
to ensure fairness to each employee. Every effort will be made to maintain the
dignity of employees or applicants involved. Disciplinary action will, however,
be taken as necessary.
   (E)   Neither this policy nor any of its terms are intended to create a
contract of employment or to contain the terms of any contract of employment.
The town retains the sole right to change, amend, or modify any term or
provision of this policy without notice. This policy is effective May l, 2018,
and will supersede all prior policies and statements relating to alcohol or
drugs.
(Ord. 2-2018, passed 3-25-2018)
§ 32.36  PURPOSE OF ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDE FOR TOWN ALCOHOL AND DRUG TESTING
PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The purpose of this administrative guide is to set forth the
procedures for the implementation of controlled substance and alcohol use and
testing of employee applicants, current employees, and employees pursuant to
the town's alcohol and drug abuse policy. These procedures are intended as a
guide only and are in no way intended to alter any existing relationship
between the town and any employee.
   (B)   The town’s alcohol and drug program administrator designated to
monitor, facilitate, and answer questions pertaining to these procedures is the
Clerk-Treasurer.
(Ord. 2-2018, passed 3-25-2018)

(Ord. 2-2018, passed 3-25-2018)
§ 32.39  PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION AND/OR OTHER MEDICATION USE.
   (A)   An employee is prohibited from reporting for duty or remaining on duty
when the employee uses any controlled substance, except when the use is
pursuant to the written instruction of a physician who has advised the employee
that the substance will not adversely affect their ability to safely perform
their duties. The employee must provide the town with proof of such medical
advice. The town can decide if the employee can remain at work or on the town
premises and what work restrictions, if any, are deemed necessary.
   (B)   Any employee who is using a prescribed drug or other medication, which
is known or advertised as possibly affecting or impairing judgment,
coordination, or other senses, (including dizziness or drowsiness), or which
may adversely affect the employee’s ability to perform work in a safe and
productive manner, must notify the town prior to starting work or entering any
town premises. The town will decide if the employee can remain at work or on
the town premises and what work restrictions, if any, are deemed necessary.
   (C)   Ingestion of products that contain hemp will not be an acceptable
explanation for testing positive for marijuana.
(Ord. 2-2018, passed 3-25-2018)
§ 32.40  REFUSAL TO TEST.
   (A)   Refusal to submit to the types ofdrug and alcohol tests employed by
the town will be grounds for refusal to hire employee/applicant(s) and to
discipline existing CDL employee(s) or nonregulated employee(s) covered by this
policy.
   (B)   A refusal to test would include any of the following situations:
      (1)   Failing to appear for any test within a reasonable time after being
directed to do so.
      (2)   Failing to remain at the testing site until the testing process is
completed.
      (3)   Failure to provide a breath sample, saliva sample, or urine sample
as directed.
      (4)   Failure to permit, if the situation requires, the observation or
monitoring of providing a urine specimen.
      (5)   Failure to provide a urine, breath, or saliva specimen within
required time frames may be considered a refusal. If an employee cannot provide
a sufficient quantity of urine or breath, he or she will be directed to be
evaluated by a physician of employer’s choice. If the physician cannot find a
legitimate medical explanation for the inability to provide a specimen (either
breath or urine), it will be considered a refusal to test. In that
circumstance, the employee has violated one of the prohibitions of the
regulations.
      (6)   Failure or declining to take an additional drug test the employer
or collector has directed you to take.
      (7)   Failure to undergo a medical examination or evaluation, as directed
by the MRO as part of the verification process, or as directed by the DER as
part of a “shy bladder” or “insufficient breath” situation.
      (8)   Failure to cooperate with any part of the testing process and/or
conduct that would obstruct the proper administration of a test, (e.g.,
refusing to empty pockets when so directed by the collector, behaving in a
confrontational way that disrupts the collection process).
      (9)   For an observed collection, failure to follow the observer’s
instruction to raise and lower clothing, and to turn around to permit the
observer to determine if you have any type of prosthetic or other device that
could be used to interfere with the collection process.
      (10)   Possessing or wearing a prosthetic or other device that could be
used to interfere with the collection process.
      (11)   Admitting to the collector or MRO that you adulterated or
substituted the specimen.
      (12)   A report from the MRO that you have a verified adulterated or
substituted test result.
      (13)   Refusing to sign step two of the alcohol testing form.
(Ord. 2-2018, passed 3-25-2018)
§ 32.41  TYPES OF TESTS.
   (A)   Authority. Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Department of
Transportation (DOT) and the town’s policy, the following circumstances for
drug and alcohol testing will be required: pre-employment (drug testing only),
post-accident, random and reasonable suspicion.
   (B)   Pre-employment testing.
      (1)   This applies to all applicants applying for a CDL position.
      (2)   As a condition of employment, the applicant applying for a CDL-
covered position shall provide the town with a written authorization for all
previous employers within the past three years to release drug and alcohol
testing records as the DOT FMCSA regulations require. Within 30 days of
performing a safety-sensitive function, DOT regulations require that the town
obtain, to the extent available, certain drug and alcohol testing records from
the employee’s previous employers for the previous three years. All applicants
who are required to have or obtain a CDL must submit to a urine drug test
unless a qualifying pre-employment exemption can be documented.
   (C)   Random testing.
      (1)   The town conducts random drug and alcohol testing on all employees
covered by this policy. Separate random pools will be established and
maintained for CDL covered employees and other non-regulated employees. The
town will submit all employees’ names to a random selection system. The random
selection system provides an equal chance for each employee to be selected each
time random selection occurs. Random selections will be reasonably spread
throughout the year. The town will drug test, at a minimum, 50% of the average
number of employee positions in each calendar year or at a rate established by
the DOT for the given year. The town will select, at a minimum, 10% of the
average number of employee positions in each calendar year for random alcohol
testing, or at the rate established by the DOT for the given year. The town
reserves the right to test above the above-stated minimum percentages should
they feel there is sufficient reasons for doing so. Random selection, by its
very nature, may result in employees being selected in successive selections or
more than once a calendar year.
      (2)   If an employee is selected at random, for either drug or alcohol
testing, a town official will notify the employee. Once notified, the employee
must proceed to the designated collection site immediately. If the employee
does not go to the collection site as soon as possible after notification, such
conduct may be considered a refusal to test.
   (D)   Post-accident testing.
      (1)   Following any accident, the employee must contact the town as soon
as possible. Employees who are covered under federal DOT required testing will
be tested for drugs and alcohol any time he or she is involved in an accident
where:
         (a)   A fatality is involved; or
         (b)   The employee receives a citation for a moving violation arising
from the accident that involved:
            1.   Injury requiring medical treatment away from the scene;
            2.   One or more vehicles having to be towed from the scene.
      (2)   The employee shall follow the instructions from the town or its
representative to complete required testing.
      (3)   In addition to the testing requirements outlined above for those
holding a CDL, all employees who are covered by this policy may be tested for
the following situations:
         (a)   Any accident/incident involving injury or death.
         (b)   Any accident/incident involving property damage.
         (c)   Any accident/incident where the employee receives a citation
under state or local law for a moving traffic violation arising from the
incident.
         (d)   Any accident/incident in which an employee’s involvement or
actions could have caused or contributed to the cause of the accident/incident.
      (4)   Any time a post-accident drug or alcohol test is required, it must
be performed as soon as practical. If no alcohol test can be made within eight
hours, attempts to perform an alcohol test shall cease. If no urine collection
can be obtained for the purpose of post-accident drug testing within 32 hours,
attempts to make such collection shall cease. An employee is prohibited from
consuming alcohol between the time of the accident and the test.
      (5)   In the event that federal, state, or local officials conduct breath
or blood test for the use of alcohol and/or urine tests for the use of
controlled substances following an accident, employees must comply with law
enforcement personnel requests, The town may request testing documentation from
such agencies and may ask the employee to sign a release allowing the town to
obtain such test results.
      (6)   In the event an employee is so seriously injured that the employee
cannot provide a sample of urine, breath, or saliva at the time of the
accident, the employee must provide necessary authorization for the town to
obtain hospital records or other documents that would indicate the presence of
controlled substances or alcohol in the employee’s system at the time of the
accident.
   (E)   Reasonable suspicion testing.
      (1)   Reasonable suspicion for requiring an employee to submit to drug
and/or alcohol testing shall be deemed to exist when an employee manifests
physical, behavioral, speech, or performance symptoms or reactions commonly
attributed to the use of controlled substances or alcohol. Such employee
conduct must be witnessed by a supervisor who is trained in compliance with
Part 382.603 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (49 CFR 382.603).
      (2)   A supervisor observing such conditions will take the following
actions immediately:
         (a)   Confront the employee involved, and keep under direct
observation until the situation is resolved.
         (b)   Secure the DER’s concurrence to observations. After discussing
the circumstances with the DER, arrangements will be made to observe or talk
with the employee. If he or she believes, after observing or talking to the
employee, that the conduct or performance problem could be due to substance
abuse, the employee will be immediately required to submit to a breath test or
urinalysis. If the employee refuses to submit to testing for any reason, the
employee will be informed that continued refusal would result in
disqualification from performing any safety-sensitive function.
         (c)   Employees will be asked to release any evidence relating to the
observation for further testing. Failure to comply may subject the employee to
subsequent discipline or suspension from driving duties. All confiscated
evidence will be receipted for with signatures of both the receiving
supervisor, as well as the provider.
         (d)   The DER shall, within 24 hours or before the results of the
controlled substance test are released, document in writing the particular
facts related to the behavior or performance problems that led to the
reasonable suspicion test and maintain this documentation in appropriate DOT
files.
         (e)   The DER shall remove or cause the removal of the employee from
the town-owned vehicle and ensure that the employee is transported to an
appropriate collection site and thereafter to the employee’s residence or,
where appropriate, to a place of lodging. Under no circumstances will that
employee be allowed to continue to drive a town vehicle or his or her own
vehicle until a confirmed negative test result is received.
(Ord. 2-2018, passed 3-25-2018)
§ 32.42  CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE TESTING PROTOCOL.
   (A)   Urine collection procedures.
      (1)   The testing procedure starts with the collection ofa urine
specimen.
      (2)   Collection procedures will follow the specific guidelines set forth
by the U.S. Department of Transportation as outlined in the published
collection procedures guidelines.
      (3)   Employees will be directed to empty their pockets and display the
contents to the collector.
      (4)   Employees will be allowed privacy during the collection process
except as noted in division (A)(5) below.
      (5)   Observed collections are required by DOT if:
         (a)   The specimen is determined invalid and there is no medical
explanation.
         (b)   The specimen is determined to be negative-dilute with a
creatinine value greater than 2 mg/dl but less than 5 mg/dl.
         (c)   The collector observes evidence of an employee’s attempt to
tamper with the specimen.
         (d)   The temperature of the specimen is out of range.
         (e)   The specimen appears to have been tampered with.
         (f)   The test is a return-to-duty or follow-up test.
      (6)   Observed collections may be required on return-to-duty and follow-
up tests.
      (7)   As part of the collection process, the specimen provided will be
split into two portions; a primary specimen and a secondary (split) specimen.
      (8)   If the employee is unable to provide 45 milliliters of urine, the
DOT “shy bladder” rule will apply. The employee will have up to three hours to
provide the required 45 milliliters, and may consume up to 40 ounces of fluids
during this time period. The employee will be required to be monitored during
the waiting period.
      (9)   After collection, the specimen will be submitted to a SAMHSA-
certified laboratory for testing.
   (B)   Laboratory procedures.
      (1)   Drug testing will be performed through urinalysis. Urinalysis will
test for the presence of drugs and/or metabolites of the following controlled
substances: marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine (PCP).
      (2)   The SAMHSA-certified laboratory will perform initial screenings on
all primary specimens. In the event that the primary specimen tests positive, a
confirmation test of that specimen will automatically be performed. If the
confirmatory test is positive it will be reported to the Medical Review Officer
(MRO) as a positive.
   (C)   Validity testing.
      (1)   The laboratory must also perform validity testing on each specimen
received. The purpose of validity testing is to determine whether certain
adulterants or foreign substances were added to the urine, if the urine was
diluted, or if the specimen was substituted. The following will be measured:
creatinine level, specific gravity, and pH. In addition, all specimens will be
tested for known adulterants. An initial validity test is performed first,
followed by a confirmation test if required.
      (2)   All laboratory results will be reported by the laboratory to a MRO
designated by the town or its agents.
   (D)   MRO procedures.
      (1)   All tests results will undergo a review process by the MRO.
      (2)   Negative test results will be reported directly to the town by the
MRO.
      (3)   Positive, adulterated, or substituted results will be handled in
the following manner by the MRO:
         (a)   Before reporting a positive, adulterated, or substituted test
result to the town, the MRO will attempt to contact the employee to discuss the
test result.
         (b)   The employee is required to discuss the result with the MRO. The
employee will be allowed to explain and present medical documentation to
explain any permissible use of a drug.
         (c)   For adulterated or substituted results, the employee must
demonstrate that he or she did produce or could have produced urine, through
physiological means, a specimen meeting the creatinine and specific gravity
criteria of a substituted or adulterated specimen.
         (d)   If the MRO is unable to contact the employee directly, the MRO
will contact the DER designated in advance by the town, who shall, in turn,
contact the employee and direct the employee to contact the MRO. Upon being so
directed, the employee shall contact the MRO immediately or, if the MRO is
unavailable, at the start of the MRO’s next business day.
         (e)   If, after failing to contact the MRO within 72 hours after being
instructed to do so by the DER, or if the employee cannot be contacted at all
within ten days, or the employee expressly declines the opportunity to discuss
the test, the MRO may verify the test as positive or a refusal.
         (f)   In the MRO’s sole discretion, a determination will be made as to
whether a result is verified as positive, negative, or considered a refusal.
         (g)   After any verified positive or refusal to test determination,
the employee may petition the MRO to reopen the case for reconsideration.
   (E)   Diluted specimens. If a test is reported as negative and diluted, it
will be the policy of the town to require an immediate recollect for another
test. The employee will be given the minimum possible advance notice to report
for another test. The result of this second test will become the test of
record. If the second test is also negative and diluted, the test will be
accepted as a valid test and no additional testing will be required. If the
employee is directed to take another test and declines to do so, this will be
considered a refusal to test and have the consequences of a refusal to test.
   (F)   Medical information disclosure. Pursuant to DOT regulations, if, in
the MRO’s opinion, any information provided may mean a medical disqualification
or represent a safety hazard, such as the use of certain prescription drugs,
the MRO must disclose this to the employer. Individual test results for
employee applicants and employees will be released to the town and will be kept
strictly confidential unless consent for the release of the test result has
been obtained. Any individual who has submitted to drug testing in compliance
with this procedure is entitled to receive the results of such testing upon
written request.
   (G)   Safeguards for the integrity of the drug testing process.
      (1)   The collector must obtain photo identification from the donor or
identification by supervisor prior to administering the test.
      (2)   The employee will be asked to wash his or her hands.
      (3)   The donor signs the chain of custody form signifying the
correctness of data for test reporting.
      (4)   Electronic communication of test results from the laboratory into
the MRO reporting system with no external human intervention.
      (5)   The specimen container and specimen bottles are individually
wrapped and unwrapped in employee’s presence.
      (6)   After the specimen is provided in a reasonable time, the collector
inspects it for sufficient volume, temperature, and signs of tampering. If a
specimen is not provided, the employee will be referred to a MRO to determine
whether there is a valid medical reason. If there is, the employee must still
attempt to provide a specimen each time his or her name is drawn.
      (7)   After the specimen is given to the collector, the remaining
collection procedures are conducted in donor’s view.
      (8)   The specimen bottles and shipping container are sealed with tamper
evident seals.
      (9)   The donor will be asked to sign the seals covering the specimen
bottles identifying they were sealed in his or her presence.
      (10)   The specimen bottle seals match the identifying seals on the chain
of custody form.
      (11)   The laboratory will check the specimen bottles upon receipt to
insure the seal has not been broken. If the seal has been broken the laboratory
will report the test as cancelled.
      (12)   Blind sample submission through the laboratory for quality
control.
      (13)   A collector who has completed the qualification training as
mandated in CFR Part 49 as amended will perform the collection.
(Ord. 2-2018, passed 3-25-2018)
§ 32.43  SPLIT SPECIMEN TESTING PROTOCOL.
   (A)   An employee may request that the “split” portion of his or her
specimen be tested at a different SAMHSA laboratory if he or she was notified
by the MRO that his or her test result was positive, adulterated, or
substituted. The request must be made to the MRO within 72 hours of being
notified of a verified positive, adulterated, or substituted result. The MRO
will arrange for all procedures to be done in accordance with split specimen
testing procedures.
   (B)   The cost of a split specimen test will be the responsibility of the
employee. The town will withhold the amount of the cost of testing the split
from the employee’s pay unless other arrangements are acceptable to both the
employee and the town. If the employee makes a timely request (within 72 hours)
to the MRO for the split portion to be tested, the MRO shall immediately make

§ 32.44  ALCOHOL TESTING.
   (A)   Protocol.
      (1)   Tests conducted by trained technicians. Alcohol tests will be
conducted by a trained breath alcohol technician (BAT) or screening test
technician (STT). Screening tests may be done using an evidential breath
testing device (EBT) or non-evidential screening device approved by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Confirmatory tests will be done
by a trained BAT using an evidential breath testing device. The employee shall
report to the alcohol testing site as notified by the town. The employee shall
follow all instructions given by the alcohol technician.
      (2)   Results. If the result of a screening test is a breath alcohol
concentration (BAC) of less than 0.02, no further testing is authorized. Any
initial test indicating a BAC of .02 or greater will be confirmed on an EBT
operated by a BAT. The confirmation test will be performed no sooner than 15
minutes and no later than 30 minutes following the completion of the initial
test. In the event the confirmation test indicates a BAC of .020 to .039, the
employee shall be removed from duty for 24 hours or until his or her next
scheduled on-duty time, whichever is longer. Employees with tests indicating a
BAC of .04 or greater are considered to have engaged in prohibited conduct,
which may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. All
alcohol tests shall be performed just prior to, during, or just after
performing a safety-sensitive function.
   (B)   Alcohol testing safeguards for employee’s protection.
      (l)   The BAT must obtain donor’s photo identification prior to
administering the test.
      (2)   An individually wrapped mouthpiece will be opened and inserted into
the EBT for the employee’s test.
      (3)   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration approves the EBT
that is used.
      (4)   Calibration checks are frequently performed to insure the EBT is
working efficiently.
      (5)   If the screening test indicates a 0.02 or greater, a confirmation
test will be administered.
      (6)   An air blank will be administered prior to the confirmation test
with a 0.000 reading.
      (7)   An individually wrapped mouthpiece will be inserted for the
confirmation test.
      (8)   The BAT has completed the required training course in the correct
operation of the EBT.
(Ord. 2-2018, passed 3-25-2018)
§ 32.45  EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS.
   (A)   The town shall provide educational materials that explain the
requirements of Part 382.601 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations
(49 CFR 382.601), consequences of violating the regulations, and the town’s
policies and procedures with respect to meeting these requirements. The
materials supplied to the employees may include information on additional town
policies with respect to the use or possession of alcohol or controlled
substances—for example, the consequences for an employee found to have
specified alcohol or controlled substances level based on the town’s authority
independent of Part 382.601 of the Federal Motor Carries Regulations (49 CFR
382.601). Materials will also be provided concerning the effects of alcohol and
controlled substances use on an individual’s health, work, and personal life.
   (B)   Employees are required to attend an educational meeting(s) to discuss
the town’s policies and procedures and to review all materials covered by this
procedure. Each employee is required to sign a statement (certificate of
receipt) certifying that he or she has received a copy of these materials
described in Part 382.601 of the Federal Motor Carrier Regulations (49 CFR
382.601). The town shall provide these materials to each employee prior to the
start of alcohol and controlled substance testing and to each employee
subsequently hired or transferred into a position requiring driving a
commercial vehicle.
(Ord. 2-2018, passed 3-25-2018)
§ 32.46  DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES FOR POLICY VIOLATIONS.
   Any employee who has a positive test for alcohol (.04 BAC or greater) or
controlled substances or has refused to test is considered in violation of this
policy. This employee is not qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle,
other town vehicle, or perform any duties for the town. Employees engaged in
safety-sensitive duties will be removed immediately from those duties. The
consequences of testing positive or refusing to test will result in termination
from employment with the town. Town employees who hold a CDL license will be
provided with the name, address, and telephone number of qualified substance
abuse professionals (SAPs) so they may pursue assistance in completing required
DOT rehabilitation should they choose to do this.
(Ord. 2-2018, passed 3-25-2018)
§ 32.47  VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.

problem with drug or alcohol misuse before it becomes a matter ofdiscipline
with the town. The town will assist any employee who voluntarily discloses to
the town that he or she believes that he or she has a drug or alcohol problem
in seeking professional help to address his or her problem. This voluntary step
of self-identification is the responsibility of the individual and, with the
exception of certain conditions, will alleviate the requirement for
disciplinary action if brought to the town’s attention prior to any testing
conducted by the town. Upon disclosure of a problem to town personnel, the
employee will be removed from all safety-sensitive duties without pay until
completion of the following rehabilitation steps are met.
   (B)   To be able to be returned to a CDL position or a non-regulated
position with the town, the following steps must be completed:
      (l)   Complete an initial evaluation with a SAP (substance abuse
professional).
      (2)   Complete any rehabilitation and/or education recommended by the
SAP.
      (3)   Complete a second evaluation with the SAP and obtain written
confirmation of satisfactory progress and/or completion of all recommendations.
      (4)   Complete a return-to-duty test that is issued with a negative
result.
      (5)   As a condition of continued employment, the employee will be
required to submit to a minimum of six unannounced follow up tests in the next
12 months after returning to work.
   (C)   Follow-up testing is separate from and in addition to the town’s
reasonable suspicion, post-accident, and random testing procedures. The
schedule for follow-up testing shall be unannounced and in accordance with the
instructions of the SAP.
   (D)   The employee will be responsible for all costs associated with this
process. If the employee makes no commitment to overcoming the problem and
achieving a satisfactory level of performance, attendance, or behavior, then
termination of employment will result.
(Ord. 2-2018, passed 3-25-2018)

Service Reserve Account created hereby as of the date of the refunding of the
refunded bonds. The town shall deposit as a reserve for the refunding bonds,

does not exceed the least of:
      (1)   The maximum annual debt service on the refunding bonds;
      (2)   One hundred twenty-five percent of average annual debt service on
the refunding bonds; or

Service Reserve Account shall never exceed the reserve requirement.
   (C)   The Debt Service Reserve Account shall constitute the margin for
safety and as protection against default in the payment of principal and
interest on the refunding bonds, and the monies in the Reserve Account shall be
promptly made up from the next available net revenues remaining after credits
into the Bond and Interest Account. If monies in the Debt Service Reserve
Account are transferred to the Bond and Interest Account to pay principal and
interest on refunding bonds, then this depletion of the balance in the Debt
Service Reserve Account shall be made up from the next available net revenues
after the credits into the Bond and Interest Account.
   (D)   Any monies in the Debt Service Reserve Account in excess of the
reserve requirement may be used for the prepayment of installments of principal
on the then outstanding bonds which are then callable or prepayable, or for the
purchase of outstanding bonds or installments of principal of fully registered
refunding bonds and accrued interest, or shall be transferred to the Sewage
Works Improvement Fund.

INTERNAL CONTROL STANDARDS
§ 33.55  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to communicate the Town Council’s internal
control objectives to all employees and elected officials of the town and to
firmly commit the town to the 17 principles of internal controls as established
by the Indiana State Board of Accounts.
(Ord. 7-2016, passed 6-27-2016)
§ 33.56  CONTROL ENVIRONMENT.
   (A)   Principle 1: The oversight body and management demonstrate a
commitment to integrity and ethical values.
      (1)   (a)   The town has the responsibility to establish and maintain an
adequate system of internal control and to furnish to the Town Council, various
boards and commissions, governmental agencies, creditors and others reliable
financial information on a timely basis. An adequate system of internal control
is necessary for the town to discharge these responsibilities.
         (b)   Controls help ensure that assets are not exposed to unauthorized
access and use, transactions are properly recorded in the financial records,
and the resultant financial information is reliable. External organizations and
stakeholders of the town rely on financial information to make decisions toward
appropriations, loans and other debt, grants, and other contractual
relationships. Town resources are dependent upon the system of internal
control. Auditors are required annually to report upon the adequacy of the
town’s systems for control over financial reporting and compliance per I.C. 5-
11-1-27(e). The safeguarding of town assets and the reliability which the town
and others can place upon its financial records is dependent upon the
effectiveness of the internal control process.
         (c)   As the fiscal body, the Town Council expects the town
administration to oversee implementation of internal control environment with
policies and procedures necessary to provide reasonable assurance that
practices cause effective and efficient operations, reliable financial
reporting, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
         (d)   The system of internal control is meant to keep the town on
course toward its mission and to minimize surprises. The system promotes
efficiency, minimizes risks of asset loss, helps ensure the reliability of
financial information, and compliance with applicable laws, rules, and
regulations.
         (e)   Internal control is a process; a means to an end, and not an end
unto itself. The control environment is the foundation upon which all
components of internal control are based. It sets the tone for town operations.
Internal control is about people, operations, communications, and the work
environment. It is not about policies and forms though it takes shape through
the implementation of relevant policies, procedures, and practices. Internal
control can provide reasonable assurance, but no system of control can provide
absolute assurance to the Town Council and other users of financial
information.
      (2)   The Town Clerk-Treasurer shall be charged with:
         (a)   Conveying periodic messages of the town’s internal control
philosophy and expectations to all employees;
         (b)   Evaluating the town’s internal control system for weaknesses on
a periodic (but no less frequently than annual) basis, providing solutions to
any discovered weaknesses, and inform employees of necessary changes in
procedures;
         (c)   Working with the Town Council to establish a confidential
reporting system for individuals to report suspected fraud and abuse of
internal control policies; and
         (d)   Working with the Town Council to institute procedures to address
violations of policies and consequences for violations.
   (B)   Principle 2: The oversight body oversees the entity’s internal control
system. As the fiscal body for the town, the Town Council is responsible for
setting the institutional expectations for internal control, ensuring
management is aware of the those expectations, requiring the upward
communications channels are open through all levels of management, and
evaluating management’s effectiveness toward monitoring the control environment
and implementing sound control policies and procedures. As the town’s Chief
Fiscal Officer, the Clerk-Treasurer will be the Town Council’s chief agent in
implementing and managing the internal control policies and procedures.
   (C)   Principle 3: Management establishes an organizational structure,
assigns responsibility, and delegates authority to achieve the entity’s
objectives.
      (1)   Individuals with delegated approval authority, e.g. elected
officials and department heads, are responsible for establishing, maintaining,
and supporting a system of internal controls within their areas of
responsibility and for creating the control environment that encourages
compliance with town policies and procedures.
      (2)   Adequate supervision is necessary to monitor that internal controls
are operating as intended, and to help ensure the reliability of accounting and
operational controls by pointing out errors, omissions, exceptions, and
inconsistencies in procedures.
      (3)   Staff in leadership roles are responsible for the application of
this policy and the design, development, implementation, and maintenance of
systems of internal controls focusing on the effectiveness of operations and
the safeguarding of assets within their respective areas of responsibility. All
levels of management and supervision are responsible for strengthening internal
controls when weaknesses are detected.
      (4)   Department heads should periodically review departmental procedures
to ensure that the general principles of internal control are being followed.
      (5)   The Clerk-Treasurer has the primary responsibility for internal
control over financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws, rules,
and regulations. The Clerk-Treasurer is the town’s chief source for information
and assistance to staff and department heads on this topic and will make
resources available to assist in administering this policy.
      (6)   The Town Council is responsible for internal controls over employee
recruitment, hiring, separation, promotion, job classification, employee
rights, and salary administration.
      (7)   All levels of internal control are subject to examination by
external auditors who are required to report on the adequacy of internal
controls over finance and compliance. Department heads are responsible for
prompt corrective action on all internal control findings and recommendations
made by internal and external auditors. The audit process is completed only
after department heads receive the audit results and take action to correct
internal control weaknesses, improve systems, or demonstrate that management
action is not warranted. Department heads have the responsibility to ensure
that those who report to them have adequate knowledge, skills, and abilities to
function within, and contribute to, an effective internal control environment.
This includes providing access to appropriate training on topics relevant to
their job responsibilities.
   (D)   Principle 4: Management demonstrates a commitment to recruit, develop,
and retain competent  individuals. The town Employee Handbook provides a
roadmap for recruiting and maintaining quality employees. Prior to employment
individuals may be subject to pre-employment background screening and/or a
credit history check. Job descriptions will be updated where necessary to
reflect internal control responsibilities and duties. Employees will be
regularly trained in internal control methods and all training will be
documented in employees’ personnel files. Employees will be regularly evaluated
by their supervisors on internal control duties and receive feedback on
possible improvements.
   (E)   Principle 5: Management evaluates performance and holds individuals
accountable for their internal control responsibilities. Individuals are held
accountable for their internal control responsibilities through a recognized
structure which includes relevant job descriptions, operating procedures,
periodic reviews, regular feedback, and a progressive disciplinary policy.
Additionally, town administration seeks to address issues in specific
departments and positions through regular one-on-ones with department heads.
(Ord. 7-2016, passed 6-27-2016)
§ 33.57  RISK ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   Principle 6: Management defines objectives clearly to enable the
identification of risks and risk tolerances.
      (1)   Through the creation of standard operating procedures and accurate
organizational reporting charts management conveys and identifies objectives,
missions, policies, and risk tolerances to employees. The Clerk-Treasurer will
lead a risk analysis of three major areas:
         (a)   The effectiveness and efficiency of operations.
         (b)   The reliability of reporting for internal and external use.
         (c)   Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
      (2)   For each category, the Clerk-Treasurer will define objectives in
specific measurable terms in order to enable the design of internal control for
related risk, increase understanding at all levels, assess performance,
identify what is to be achieved, who is to achieve it, how it will be achieved,
when it will be achieved and incorporate external requirements.
   (B)   Principle 7: Management identifies, analyzes, and responds to risks
related to achieving the defined objectives.
      (1)   The Clerk-Treasurer will identify, analyze and respond to the risks
identified in Principle 6 by determining:
         (a)   How likely is the risk to occur?
         (b)   How will it impact the objective?
         (c)   Is the risk based on complex or unusual transactions?
         (d)   Is the risk based on fraud?
      (2)   Once each risk has been identified and analyzed, the Clerk-
Treasurer will work with department heads to determine how to respond to each
risk with a specific solution and action.
   (C)   Principle 8: Management considers the potential for fraud when
identifying, analyzing, and responding to risks. Management is committed to
fraud prevention by utilizing a “trust but verify” approach. The potential for
fraud, misappropriation, and outright theft are contemplated as controls are 
designed for various town divisions. Fraud responses will include statutorily
required responses to fraud, including, but not limited to I.C. 5-11-1-27(l)
relating to the report of misappropriation of funds to State Board of Accounts
and prosecuting attorney and I.C. 5-11-1-27(j) relating to the report of
material variances, losses, shortages or thefts to the State Board of Accounts.
The town shall utilize a materiality threshold of $500.
   (D)   Principle 9: Management identifies, analyzes, and responds to
significant changes that could impact the internal control system. The Clerk-
Treasurer, in coordination with department heads, will regularly evaluate and
adjust internal control policies in order to accommodate for the impact of
future changes, including but not limited to, personnel changes, newly elected
officials, new programs, new technology, new laws and regulations, and
financial fluctuations.
(Ord. 7-2016, passed 6-27-2016)
§ 33.58  CONTROL ACTIVITIES.
   (A)   Principle 10: Management designs control activities to achieve
objectives and respond to risks.
The Town Clerk-Treasurer will establish and maintain a system of internal
controls that satisfies the town’s objectives in the following categories:
      (1)   Risks are identified and effectively managed.
      (2)   Safeguarding of town assets.
      (3)   Reliability and integrity of financial information.
      (4)   Compliance with town policy, plans, procedures, laws and
regulations.
      (5)   Economical and efficient use of town resources.
      (6)   Meeting established objectives and goals for town operations and
programs.
   (B)   General internal control principles for departments are:
      (1)   Separation of duties.
         (a)   Duties are separated so that one person’s work routinely serves
as a check on another’s work.
         (b)   No one person has complete control over more than one key
function or activity (e.g., authorizing, approving, certifying, disbursing,
receiving, or reconciling).
      (2)   Authorization and approval.
         (a)   Proposed transactions are authorized when proper and consistent
with town policy and the department’s plans.
         (b)   Transactions are approved by the person who has delegated
approval authority, which is usually delegated on the basis of special
competency or knowledge.
      (3)   Custodial and security arrangements.
         (a)   Responsibility for physical security/custody of town assets is
separated from record keeping/accounting for those assets.
         (b)   Unauthorized access to town assets and institutional data is
prevented.
      (4)   Timely and accurate review and reconciliation.
         (a)   Departmental accounting records and documents are examined by
employees who have sufficient understanding of the town accounting and
financial systems to verify that recorded transactions actually took place and
were made in accordance with town policies and procedures.
         (b)   Departmental accounting records and documentation are compared
with town accounting system reports and financial statements to verify their
reasonableness, accuracy, and completeness.
      (5)   The general internal control principles should be applied to all
departmental operations, especially accounting records and reports, payroll,
purchasing/receiving/disbursement approval, equipment and supply inventories,
cash receipts, petty cash and change funds, billing and accounts receivable.
   (C)   All town systems, processes, operations, functions, and activities are
subject to evaluations of internal control systems. The results of these
evaluations provide information regarding the town’s overall system of control.
   (D)   Information and communication. Information must be timely and
communicated in a manner that enables people to carry out their
responsibilities.
      (1)   All covered employees must be trained on internal controls
according to I.C.  5-11-127(g). All personnel must receive a clear message from
the town’s administration that control responsibilities are to be taken
seriously. Failure to comply with established practices will subject
individuals to the terms of disciplinary action or dismissal.
      (2)   Employees must understand their own roles in the internal control
system, as well as how individual activities relate to the work of others. To
this end, whenever a new budgetary unit, financial activity, etc. is set up,
the Clerk-Treasurer will provide notification to the appropriate parties of the
responsibilities incumbent on them for good business practices and sound
financial management, including reference to the principles within this policy.
      (3)   Employees must have a means of communicating significant
information to the town’s administration.
      (4)   The town must communicate effectively with external parties, such
as auditors, creditors, contractors, suppliers, regulators and other
stakeholders.
      (5)   Internal control is meant to keep the town focused on achieving its
mission while avoiding surprises. There is a balance between effective controls
and mission accomplishment. Costs associated with internal controls should not
exceed their benefit, nor should controls be allowed to stifle mission
effectiveness and timely action. All levels of management must assess the
costs, benefits, and risks when designing controls to develop a positive
control environment and compensate for the risks of non-compliance, loss of
assets, or unreliable reporting while accomplishing the town mission.
   (E)   The following specific internal control policies are adopted for use

are maintained in accordance with the town and state’s record retention
policies. Reports and policies are cross checked for accuracy, relevancy and
timeliness of information.
(Ord. 7-2016, passed 6-27-2016)
§ 33.60  MONITORING ACTIVITIES.
   (A)   Principle 16: Management establishes and operates monitoring
activities to monitor the internal control system and evaluate the results.
      (1)   Town administration monitors and evaluates compliance with internal
control policies via multiple vectors. Separation of duties, redundancy
polices, layered approval systems, monthly reports, allow management to both
review and evaluate control systems.
      (2)   The Town Clerk-Treasurer shall implement a system of monitoring
that includes:
         (a)   Periodic checks to determine if controls are in place and
working effectively;
         (b)   Reviewing control activities to determine if the actual
activities are in compliance with established procedures;
         (c)   Documenting deficiencies in the internal control processes and
remediating them quickly.
      (3)   Monitoring activities will be documented by signatures, initials,
or other appropriate methods.
   (B)   Principle 17: Management remediates identified internal control
deficiencies on a timely basis. Breaches of internal controls are subject to
significant levels of internal scrutiny. If informed of a material breach of

sewer system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess of 15,000
gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the town that a
portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not and cannot
enter the sanitary sewer system, then the owner or other interested party shall
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the town for the
determination of sewage discharge.
(1996 Code, § 9-51)  (Ord. 75, passed 3-23-1970)
§ 52.06  MULTIPLE LOTS WITH ONE METER.
   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewer system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and
the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each such
case, for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for
each user and the minimum charge and the sewage rates and charges shall apply
to each of the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate, or building
served through the single water meter.
(1996 Code, § 9-52)  (Ord. 75, passed 3-23-1970)
§ 52.07  CHARGES FOR MULTI-RESIDENTIAL USERS.
   (A)   In the event two or more dwelling units such as trailers, apartments,
or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other liquids into
the town’s sanitary sewer system, either directly or indirectly, are users of
water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in
such case billing shall be for a single service in the manner set out elsewhere
herein, except that an additional charge shall be added thereto in the amount
of one-half of the minimum charge per month for each dwelling unit over one
served through the single water meter.
   (B)   In the case of trailer parks, the number of dwelling units shall be
computed and interpreted as the total number of trailers located and installed
in said park plus any other dwelling units served through the meter.
   (C)   A dwelling unit shall be interpreted as a room or rooms or any other
space or spaces in which cooking facilities are provided.
(1996 Code, § 9-53)  (Ord. 75, passed 3-23-1970)
§ 52.08  SPRINKLING RATES.
   (A)   In order that domestic and residential users of sewage services shall
not be penalized for the sprinkling of lawns during the months or July, August,
and September, the billing for sewage services for residences and/or domestic
users for said months of July, August, and September shall be based on the
water usage for the previous months of January, February, and March. If the
water usage for the previous months of January, February, and March is greater
than the water usage for said months of July, August, and September, then the
billing for sewage service shall be computed on the actual water used in the
month for which the sewage service bill is being rendered. Domestic and/or
residential sewage service, as applicable to the sprinkling rate, shall apply
to each lot, parcel of real estate, or building which is occupied and used as a
residence.
   (B)   Said sprinkling rate shall not apply to any premises which are
partially or wholly used for industrial or commercial purposes. In the event a
portion of such premises shall be used for commercial or industrial purposes,
the owner shall have the privilege of separating the water service so that the
residential portion of the premises is served through a separate meter, and in
such case, the water usage as registered by the water meter serving such
portion of the premises used for residential purposes would qualify under the
sprinkling rate.

§ 52.10  CHARGES TO THE TOWN.
   For the service rendered to the town, the town shall be subject to the same
rates and charges hereinabove provided or to rates and charges established in
harmony therewith.
(1996 Code, § 9-56)  (Ord. 75, passed 3-23-1970)
§ 52.11  VOLUME AND STRENGTH.
   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably adjusted to
the services rendered, the town shall have the right to base its charges not
only on volume but also on the strength and character of the sewage and waste
of which it is required to dispose. The town shall have the right to measure
and determine the strength and content of all sewage and waste discharged,
either directly or indirectly, into the town’s sanitary sewer system in such
manner and by such method as may be deemed practical in the light of the
conditions and attending circumstances of the case in order to determine the
proper charge. Any and all commercial and industrial installations shall be so
controlled and/or treated as to the sewage strength that their effluent
discharge to the town’s sewers shall have a B.O.D. (biochemical oxygen demand)
not to exceed 300 parts per million at any time. The Town Council is authorized
to prohibit the dumping of wastes into the town’s sewer system which, in its
discretion, are deemed harmful.
(1996 Code, § 9-57)  (Ord. 75, passed 3-23-1970)
§ 52.12  BY-LAWS.
   The rates and charges shall be prepared and billed by the town monthly as
the town may deem appropriate and as determined by the by-laws and regulations
of the town as hereinafter provided for, and shall be collected in the manner
provided by law and ordinance. Said rates and charges will be billed to the
tenant or tenants occupying the property served unless otherwise requested in
writing by the owners, but such billing shall in nowise relieve the owner from
liability in the event payment is not made as herein required. The owner of the
properties served, which are occupied by tenants, shall have the right to
examine the collection records of the town for the purpose of determining
whether such rates and charges have been paid by such tenants, provided that
such examination shall be made in the office in which said records are kept and
during the hours that such office is open for business.
(1996 Code, § 9-59)  (Ord. 75, passed 3-23-1970)
§ 52.13  OTHER REGULATIONS.
   The town shall make and enforce such by-laws and regulations as may be
deemed necessary for the safe, economic, and efficient management of the town
sewer system and for the construction and use of house sewers and connections
to the sewer system, and for the regulation, collection, rebating, and
refunding of rates and charges.
(1996 Code, § 9-60)  (Ord. 75, passed 3-23-1970)
§ 52.14  PRETREATMENT.
   The town is authorized to prohibit dumping of wastes into the town’s sewer
system which, in its discretion, are harmful to the operation of the sewage
works, or to require methods affecting pretreatment of said wastes to reduce
the characteristics of the waste unsatisfactory to the town.

      (10)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
   (E)   (1)   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged, to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or
possess the characteristics enumerated in division (D) of this section, and
which in the judgment of the Superintendent may have a deleterious effect upon
the sewage works, processes equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise
create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent
may:
         (a)   Reject the wastes;
         (b)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers;
         (c)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/
or
         (d)   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions
of division (J) of this section.
      (2)   If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of

   (H)   When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a
suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his or her
expense, and shall be maintained by him or her so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
   (I)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this subchapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater,” published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples.)
   (J)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the town and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the town for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the
industrial concern.
