   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the county, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered, and consolidated into component codes,
titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the Adams
County Code, for which designation code of ordinances, codified ordinances, or

same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.

   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless

reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or division.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters, or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)

 § 10.06 SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   If any section of this code now enacted or subsequently amended or its

not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid section
or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is severable.
If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.

whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a section or amendment stating that the provisions of a

 § 10.07 REFERENCE TO OTHER SECTIONS.

or of the Board refers to any board, bureau, commission, division, department,
officer, agency, authority, or instrumentality of any government, and that name
designation is incorrectly stated; on the effective date of that ordinance or
following the effective date, the rights, powers, duties, or liabilities placed
with that entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named
board, bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority, or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date
or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which the duties,
liabilities, powers, and rights were transferred.
(I.C. 1-1-6-1)
 § 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
the error.

be a Saturday, Sunday, or a state holiday, it shall be excluded.
 § 10.11 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture, or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
 § 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected

Act (USERRA) of 1994, 38 U.S.C. §§ 4301 et seq., the county will not
discriminate against any employee on the basis of that person’s membership in
or obligation to perform service for any of the uniformed services of the

of the county who are members of the Indiana National Guard or reserves for the

respective duties in accordance with all applicable provisions of federal and
state law.
   (C)   Pursuant to I.C. 10-16-7-5 et seq., all county employees who are

personnel of the naval, air, or ground forces of the United States are entitled
to leave equal to the number of days that the member is on active duty. That
leave is in addition to the employee’s regular vacation period.
   (D)   In addition, full-time and part-time employees who are duly qualified
reserve members of the armed forces are entitled to paid military leave not to
exceed 15 days (meaning 120 hours) in any one calendar year for military
training, which may be used intermittently. Paid military leave will not be
charged against an employee’s PTO or other paid leave. Paid military leave is

absence.
   (E)   To receive paid military leave under this policy, the employee must

absence.
   (G)   The restoration or re-employment of employees returning from military
service to any county department or office shall be in accordance with
applicable federal and state law. These provisions have certain requirements in
order to be re-employed, including maximum length of military service, type of
discharge, re-employment period, and physical fitness. Employees for whom this
policy is applicable should familiarize themselves with such restoration
requirements. Seniority and seniority related benefits such as PTO, if
applicable, shall continue to accrue during a military leave of absence.
   (H)   Also, in accordance with state military leave law, the county will
provide up to ten days of unpaid leave to the spouse, parent, grandparent, or
sibling of the person who is ordered to active duty. To be eligible for this
leave, the employee must have been employed by the county for at least one year
and have worked in the last year for at least 1,500 hours.
   (I)   Due to varying work schedules within county departments, it is

special and extraordinary powers.

declared by the Chief Executive Officer pursuant to §

32.22, or such several component parts thereof as may be relevant to the
emergency.
      (4)   The Commissioners may assemble and utilize emergency management
forces, including personnel of the Department of Civil Defense, participating
emergency services, and any other forces at the disposal of the Commissioners
hereunder for emergency management purposes.
      (5)   The Commissioners may order volunteer forces to the aid of the
county, state, or political subdivision thereof as soon as practicable. Those
volunteer forces will be under the direction of the Department of Civil
Defense.
      (6)   The Commissioners may, to the extent provided by state and federal
law, command services from and/or requisition the use of equipment, facilities,
supplies, or other property belonging to other organizations, corporations, or
private persons as necessary to control the emergency and protect and provide
for the safety and welfare of the public as provided by I.C. 10-14-3-17.
      (7)   The Commissioners may order the evacuation of all or part of the
population from stricken areas of the county, and prescribe routes, modes of
transportation, and destinations for such evacuation.
      (8)   The Commissioners may make provision for availability and use of
temporary emergency housing, which housing need not necessarily comply with any
minimum housing standards, building or zoning regulations, and the like, which
would govern the use and location of premises for housing purposes during
normal times.
      (9)   The Commissioners may suspend, for the duration of the state of
emergency (or for a lesser period as they may determine), any provisions of or
procedures prescribed by ordinances of the county if they would be impractical
during the emergency, would interfere with the implementation and carrying out
of emergency plans, or would be inimical to actions necessary to protect the
public safety and welfare; provided, however, that except in accordance with
division (A)(10) below, the Commissioners may not suspend any provisions of
ordinances or procedures which are mandated by statute.
      (10)   In the event of enemy attack, or when a state of emergency has
been proclaimed by the Governor, the Commissioners may also waive any
procedures or requirements established by state statute or county ordinance
pertaining to the appropriation and expenditure of public funds, the incurrence
of obligations, the performance of public works, the entering into contracts,
the employment of workers (permanent or temporary), or the utilization of
volunteers, the rental of equipment, or the purchase and distribution of
supplies, materials, and facilities.
      (11)   The Commissioners may assign special emergency duties and
functions to any county offices, departments, and agencies irrespective of
their usual duties and functions and any unexpended and unencumbered moneys
budgeted and appropriated for the operation of such offices, departments, and
agencies and not otherwise dedicated by law to different and specified purposes
may, within the scope of each major budget and appropriation category (major
object classification), be utilized and expended for the purpose of carrying
out such special emergency duties and functions.
      (12)   The Commissioners may make and promulgate such emergency
regulations as may be deemed necessary to protect life and property, preserve
order, conserve critical resources, or implement and carry out the provisions
of the county’s or state’s disaster plans, including, but not limited to, the
power to order the roads closed, establish curfews, close business, or any
action that they deem necessary to save lives and recover from a declared
emergency. This power also includes the power to supplement, modify, or suspend
any general contingency regulations which may have been incorporated as part of
the county’s previously adopted Emergency Operations Plan. Any emergency
regulations adopted under this section shall not be effective until promulgated
by means of the filing of a signed, written declaration filed in the offices of
the County Clerk and the County Auditor. In the event that such filing is
impossible due to said emergency, such regulations shall be effective and
enforceable notwithstanding said filing and shall have the full force and
effect of law.
      (13)   The Commissioners may request the state or the United States, or
their agencies and political subdivisions, to send aid (including financial
assistance) if the situation is beyond the control of the regular and emergency
county forces and resources.
   (B)   All actions and regulations under this section may be by executive
order, and need not be made or adopted by ordinance or resolution but shall be
consistent with and subordinate to any actions, orders, or regulations made by
the Governor or a state agency implementing state emergency operations plans.

the county, and a state of emergency has not been declared by the Governor nor
is any person having the powers of the Chief Executive Officer of the county
present to declare such an emergency pursuant to §
32.37, the Director may temporarily presume the existence of a state of
emergency even though not officially declared and may, as his or her own
judgment dictates, invoke, implement, and carry out such provisions of the
county’s adopted comprehensive emergency management and disaster control plan
as are necessary to cope with the emergency and protect the public safety and
welfare, and shall be construed to have all powers necessary and dispensable to
doing so to the extent not specifically limited by statute or specifically
limited herein, until such time as a chief executive officer becomes available.

described above. Any person who commits an offense as described above shall be

      (2)   The length of the offender’s sentence prevents the offender from
achieving the minimum literacy standards before the expiration of the
offender’s sentence.

conditions of unlawful pollution will not be created, and injury to ground and
surface waters avoided which might interfere with legitimate water users.
Water-filled areas not directly connected to natural lakes, rivers, or streams

disposed of in a sanitary landfill unless special provisions are made for such
disposal through the Health Department. This provision in no way precludes the
right of a landfill operator to exclude any materials as a part of his or her
operational standards.
   (J)   The entire site, including the fill surface, shall be graded and
provided with drainage facilities to minimize runoff onto and into the fill, to
prevent erosion or washing of the fill, to drain off rainwater falling on the
fill, and to prevent the collection of standing water.
   (K)   Measures shall be provided to control dust and blowing paper. The
entire area shall be kept clean and orderly.
   (L)   Modification of the rules on sanitary landfills as applicable to
existing disposal areas may be made by the Health Officer. These modifications

two feet shall be placed over the entire surface of each portion of the final
fill not later than one week following the placement of refuse within that
portion.

to determine compliance with approved plans and specifications before the
earth-moving equipment is removed from the site. Any necessary corrective work
shall be performed before the landfill project is accepted as completed.
Arrangements shall be made for the repair of all cracked, eroded, and uneven
areas in the final cover during the first two years following completion of the
landfill.

shall be subject to the evaluation and approval of the Health Officer.

MARKET CATTLE TESTING PROGRAM
§ 90.25 PURPOSE.

cooperation needed in making the Market Cattle Testing Program (MCT) effective.
The MCT Program is to replace the much more expensive and burdensome program of

has been paid for by tax funds. This consisted of testing all eligible cattle
in the county once every six years.
   (B)   The MCT Program is a method of collecting blood for tests and the
examination of the carcass of all slaughter animals for evidence of brucellosis
or tuberculosis and by identification of the animals by a backtag, infected
animals can be traced to the herd of origin where the entire herd will be
tested. Negative animals will also be credited to the county of origin, until
such time as the entire state has qualified as a Certified Brucellosis Free
Area and as an Accredited Tuberculosis-Free Area (M. Bovis in cattle).
(Ord. 1, 1970, passed - -)
§ 90.26 AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)   It shall be the responsibility of the herd owners and livestock
dealers to allow an official backtag to be applied to all female bovine animals
two years of age and over, or any heifer showing udder development, and all
bulls over six months of age that are going to slaughter - further that cattle
owners insist this be done.
   (B)   Any public livestock marketing facility within the county shall
identify and apply official tags to all such bovine animals as described in
division (A) above. Identifying backtags will be supplied free of charge to the
auction markets for the purpose of identifying all species of animals for their
convenience.
   (C)   Slaughtering establishments within the county who buy identified
animals from a market of direct/untagged animals, to collect and identify all
blood samples from eligible animals as described in division (A) above and sent
to the Purdue Diagnostic Laboratory for testing (all necessary equipment and
postage will be supplied).
   (D)   Any livestock dealer purchasing untagged livestock within the county
shall identify and apply official tags to all such bovine animals described in
division (A) above unless a public livestock marketing facility agrees to
provide such service to the dealer. The dealer will identify the source of each
animal presented at the market.
   (E)   All persons required to identify animals in accordance with this
subchapter shall file reports of such identification on forms supplied by the
State Board of Animal Health.
   (F)   When reactor animals are disclosed by the Market Cattle Test, the herd
of origin shall be tested within 15 days, under supervision of the State Board
of Animal Health.
   (G)   If the owner fails to comply, a quarantine will be issued with
attending restrictions and penalties.
(Ord. 1, 1970, passed - -) Penalty, see §
90.99
§ 90.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter for which no
specific penalty is prescribed shall be subject to §
10.99 of this code of ordinances.
   (B)   Any person who shall violate §§
90.01 through
90.10 shall be fined an amount of not less than $50 for a first offense; $100
for a second offense; and an amount not to exceed $500 per offense thereafter

and sanitized, or be replaced when worn or soiled;
      (14)   Floors must be constructed in a manner that protects the dogs’
feet and legs from injury. If the floor is mesh or slatted, the floor may not
allow a dog’s feet to pass through openings in the floor; and
      (15)   Suspended floors must be strong enough so that the floor does not
sag or bend between the structural supports.
   (B)   Size of a primary enclosure. 
      (1)   Primary enclosures must provide sufficient space to allow each dog
to turn about freely, to stand, to sit and lie in a comfortable, normal
position, and to walk in a normal manner. Tethering as a primary enclosure is
prohibited. Wire cages are subject to additional requirements outlined in the
division (B)(2) below.
      (2)   For the purposes of this chapter, the length of a dog is determined
by measuring the dog from the tip of its nose to the tip of its tail.
   (C)   Calculating size requirements. The primary enclosure must be the
following size or larger.
      (1)   (a)   Each dog must be provided a minimum amount of floor space
calculated as follows: (Length of the dog in inches plus six inches) x (Length
of the dog in inches plus six inches) = required floor space in square inches.
         (b)   Required floor space in inches divided by 144 equals required
floor space in square feet.
      (2)   The minimum floor space for a bitch with nursing puppies must be
approved by the kennel veterinarian. The kennel veterinarian must determine the
minimum space after considering generally accepted husbandry practices and the
breed and behavioral characteristics of the bitch. The minimum floor space must
be at least 105% of the minimum floor space required for the bitch.
      (3)   The interior height of the enclosure must be at least six inches
higher than the head of the tallest dog in the enclosure when it is in a normal
standing position.
      (4)   The primary enclosure must be large enough to allow for reasonable
movement by the dog.
   (D)   Requirements for enclosures with wire floors. If the floor of a
primary enclosure is made of metal strands (wire), all of the following apply.
      (1)   The wire strands must be either:
         (a)   Greater than one-eighth of an inch in diameter (nine gauge); or
         (b)   Coated with a material such as plastic or fiberglass.
      (2)   The primary enclosure must include an area that allows the dog to
be off of the wire floor. The solid floor area must meet the following
standards.
(I.C. 15-21-4-1(b)(1))
         (a)   The area must be made of solid material. Rubber or plastic mats
and pieces of carpet can meet this requirement. Towels and rugs do not meet
this requirement.
         (b)   The area must be large enough for all dogs in the enclosure to
utilize the solid floor at the same time. Therefore, the size of the solid
floor area must be at least as big as the following: (The length of the dog in
inches) x (The length of the dog in inches) = required solid floor area in
square inches for each dog.

§ 111.56 EXERCISE.
   (A)   Requirements. Commercial dog breeders must develop, document, and
follow an appropriate plan to provide dogs with the opportunity for exercise.
The plan must be in writing. An attending veterinarian must determine the
frequency, method, and duration of the opportunity for exercise, and approve in
writing the entire plan. A commercial dog breeder is required to provide every
dog with a reasonable opportunity for exercise outside of a cage at least one
time per day. The opportunity for exercise must be outside the animal’s primary
enclosure. But, if a dog has access to a run that is connected to the animal’s
primary enclosure or if the animal’s primary enclosure includes a run, and the
run meets the requirements below, it is not necessary to remove the animal from
the primary enclosure for exercise. An exercise run must meet the following
requirements.
      (1)   The floor space of the run must be at least as big as the
following:
         (a)   For dogs housed individually, an area that is two times the

      (2)   Forced exercise methods or devices, such as swimming or treadmills,
may not be used to meet the exercise requirement.
   (B)   Exemptions. A commercial dog breeder is not required to provide a dog
with the opportunity for exercise if exercise would endanger the dog’s life or
health. If the attending veterinarian determines that any dog should not be
provided an opportunity for exercise, the commercial dog breeder does not have
to provide an opportunity for exercise for that dog. The veterinarian’s
determination must be in writing and reviewed at least every 30 days.

enclosures as often as necessary to prevent excessive accumulation, prevent
soiling of the dogs, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.
When water is used to clean an enclosure, the dogs must be removed unless the
enclosure is large enough to ensure the animals will not get wet or be
distressed by the process. Neighboring dogs should not get wet or be distressed
from the cleaning process. Standing water must be removed from primary
enclosures.
   (B)   Sanitization. Primary enclosures and food and water receptacles must
be cleaned and sanitized at the earliest of the following:
      (1)   Before they are used for another dog;
      (2)   At least once every two weeks; and

   (A)   The County Plan Commission has authority to regulate intensive
livestock operations within the county. The state has the authority to regulate
confined feeding operations. Consequently, there are different requirements for
each type of operation with varying setbacks to ensure the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   Each applicant shall have the option to comply with either the
county’s regulations or to apply for a state license to be issued by the
Department of Environmental Management. All applicants, regardless of whether
they elect to apply for a confined feeding operations license from the state,
shall be required to also submit an application to the Plan Commission for
purposes of ensuring compliance with all local applicable ordinances.
(Ord. 2019-02, passed 2-26-2019)
§ 112.36 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DESIGN.
   Each and every requirement contained in the intensive livestock operation
regulations as set forth in §§
112.02 and

§ 112.38 VARIANCE.
   (A)   An exception to the setbacks for new improvements established by and
in this chapter may be applied for by the filing of a variance application with
the County Board of Zoning Appeals. Such an application for variance will be
reviewed and discussed at a public meeting to determine if a new improvement is
properly located in relation to an intensive livestock ordinance. If or when
such a variance is granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals, the party obtaining
the variance shall be required to attach to the deed or other appropriate
document to be placed of record a covenant protecting the livestock enterprise
being encroached upon. Said covenant shall read as follows or contain words of
similar meaning as follows:
   “IN ACCEPTING THIS DEED, THE PROPERTY OWNER, AFFIANT, AND GRANTEES DO HEREBY
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SURROUNDING LAND IS AGRICULTURAL IN USAGE; AND, FURTHER, THE
PROPERTY OWNER, AFFIANT, AND GRANTEES, AND THEIR SUCCESSORS IN INTEREST, ARE
PRECLUDED FROM COMPLAINING AND/OR ATTEMPTING TO ENJOIN THE FARM OPERATION
BECAUSE OF NUISANCES WHICH MIGHT RESULT FROM SAID AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS AND
USAGE.”
   (B)   If an intensified livestock applicant finds he or she cannot
reasonably meet the established requirements, the applicant may request a
variance or special exception from the Board of Zoning Appeals. After hearing,
the Board of Zoning Appeals shall determine if the request is in harmony or
conflict with the purpose and intent of this chapter and/or is detrimental to
the owners of surrounding, adjacent property. In the granting of any special
exception or variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may impose such conditions
as deemed necessary in furtherance of the purposes and intent of this chapter.

documentation in a clear, succinct, and professional manner so as to aid the
Plan Commission in making its determination.
   (A)   Each applicant is expected to carry the burden of proof in both the
preparation and presentment of the application before the Plan Commission. The
Plan Commission Director and/or the Zoning Administrator shall not be
responsible for the preparation or presentment of any application as that is
the responsibility solely assumed by the applicant. However, the Plan
Commission Director may assist an applicant in a preliminary conference but
shall not be responsible for providing drawings or documentation.
   (B)   It is required that all applicants seek the assistance of counsel or
other professionals to assist them in the preparation and presentment of their
applications.

RURAL ADDRESS NUMBERING SYSTEM
§ 150.15 PURPOSE.
   The purposes of this subchapter are to create a uniform rural address
numbering system and to establish that all residential dwellings or business
structures, including any identifiable but vacant or unimproved lots or tracts
of land, whether currently existing or hereafter placed, erected, or created,
located within the rural areas of the county be identified by and be assigned a
number, which number shall be prominently displayed, on any occupied lot or
parcel, used as a means of address identification for said location and relied
upon by emergency personnel, businesses, utilities, the United States Postal
Service, local government, and residents as the legal address for said
location.
(Ord. 1991-4, passed 6-3-1991)
§ 150.16 SCOPE.
   This subchapter shall affect and apply to all residences, rural businesses,
and vacant or unimproved lots or tracts of land capable of being used as a
residence or business within the areas of the county not included in the
incorporated areas of the cities of Decatur or Berne or the incorporated areas
of the towns of Monroe and Geneva.
(Ord. 1991-4, passed 6-3-1991)
§ 150.17 ESTABLISHMENT.
   (A)   The rural address numbering system to be used in the county shall be
based upon a grid system developed by the County Plat Engineer.
   (B)   The county shall be divided into four quadrants and assigning a
numeric address according to the following:
      (1)   The division of the county into the north half and the south half
shall be along S.R. 124, which road shall be known as the division road. The
county shall be divided into the east and west halves by using U.S. Highway 27
in part and C.R. 000 in part as the meridian road.
      (2)   The numeric address assigned to each location will consist of two
to five digits.
         (a)   A numeric address having two or three digits indicates that the
address lies within the first mile from the meridian or division road.
         (b)   An address of four digits indicates that the location is between
the first and tenth mile of the meridian or division road.
         (c)   A five digit number indicates that the location lies between the
tenth and twelfth mile of County Line Road.
      (3)   In each address, the last digit indicates the side of the road upon
which the residence lies. Addresses ending with an odd digit lie upon the north
or east side of the road. Addresses ending with an even digit lie upon the
south or west side of the road.
      (4)   The second to last digit of the address indicates the hundredth
part of a mile from the last full numbered mile road. The third to last digit
indicates the tenth part of a mile from the full numbered mile road. The fourth
and fifth last digits indicate the whole mile measured from the meridian or
division road.
      (5)   Most addresses shall include after the numeric portion an initial
cardinal direction (symbols E, W, N, or S) corresponding to which direction
from the meridian or division road.
      (6)   In order to avoid conflict with adjoining counties using similar
numbered roads, the addresses in outlying post offices shall have affixed after
the identification of the road or street the figure “-1” to indicate that the
numerical address lies within the road system of the county and not in the
county in which the post office is located.
(Ord. 1991-4, passed 6-3-1991)
§ 150.18 ASSIGNMENT OF NUMBER.
   The initial assignment of a rural address number shall be assigned to each
existing or potential lot or tract of land capable of being used for a
residence or business within the rural county. Such assignment shall be made
based upon the recommendation of the County Plat Engineer, the United States
Postal Service, and other local governmental officials relied upon in the
development and implementation of the county-wide address numbering system.
After October 1, 1991, any future lots or tracts of land developed for
residential or business use within the rural areas of the county shall be
assigned a permanent address number by the County Plan Commission Director who
shall rely upon the grid system set forth in §
150.17 in determining and assigning such number.
(Ord. 1991-4, passed 6-3-1991)
§ 150.19 NOTICE OF NUMBER ASSIGNED.
   The County Auditor shall mail a notice of the rural address number to each
currently existing postal patron and shall acknowledge that the new rural
number so assigned shall serve as the new permanent, legal address for the
residence or business of said postal patron, effective October 1, 1991. The
County Plan Commission Director shall serve as the administrator of the rural
address numbering system, shall serve notice of assignment of new numbers to
occupants after the initial notice by the Auditor, and shall be the county
official to whom questions concerning the rural numbering system are to be
directed.
(Ord. 1991-4, passed 6-3-1991)
§ 150.20 DISPLAY OF NUMBER.
   The occupant of each parcel or lot currently used as a residence or business
shall prominently display the rural number assigned to said location in such a
manner so that said number is easily observable and readable from the public
road, street, or highway upon which such location is situated. While the
location, type of numbering, type of background, size of numbering, and
location of the number shall be totally within the discretion of the occupant
of said residence or business, to maximize the effectiveness and to ensure
prompt response in the event of emergency, it is recommended that said number
be staked at or nearest the edge of the road, beside the driveway entrance, on
the same side of the road where the residence or building is located, that the
lettering be black on a white illumines background, with the numbers placed in
a vertical configuration using numbers and letters at least three inches in
height.
(Ord. 1991-4, passed 6-3-1991) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 150.21 USE OF NUMBER.
    Upon the initial assignment of a rural address number and notification as
hereinabove required, said number shall become the permanent, legal address for
the site so identified as of the effective date of the county-wide rural
address numbering system. All future assignments shall be effective immediately
upon notification of such number by the County Plan Commission Director.

reconstruction of said side ditches and future maintenance of same.
(Ord. 1996-1, passed 2-5-1996)

   (B)   If the landowner refuses to restore the side ditches to such a
condition which allows for proper drainage of the county road, or unless the
landowner petitions within said 30-day period for a variance which allows for
proper drainage of the county road through means other than use of a side
ditch, which alternative means of drainage would allow filling and seeding

side ditch or repair and otherwise maintain the culvert and drainage tile used
in lieu of a side ditch in order to provide proper drainage of county roads to
ensure public safety and minimize maintenance costs.
   (B)   Should the County Highway Department incur expenses over and above
those normally incurred in the maintenance of county road side ditches, which
expenses were incurred as a result of farming, fencing, or landscaping within a
county road right-of-way, the Highway Department, upon approval by the Board of
Commissioners, shall serve notice on the landowner by certified mail, return
receipt requested, of the cost of additional materials and labor incurred with
a demand for payment.
   (C)   The landowner shall have 30 days from the date of receipt of said

through traffic. State and U.S. marked routes, as well as some county roads and
important intra-city streets, are considered under this classification. Where a
highway is a non-limited access route, these facilities also perform a
secondary function of providing direct access to abutting land and this
interconnect principal traffic generators.
      (2)   PRIMARY (MAJOR) ROUTES. These facilities serve to connect cities
with each other, as well as to link smaller towns or settlements with the
arterial thoroughfares system. PRIMARY ROUTES provide access to abutting land
and generally serve all principal traffic generators.
      (3)   SECONDARY (CONNECTOR) ROADS. These facilities serve intra-city
movements of traffic, such as that moving between a subdivision and major
street. The principal difference between the CONNECTOR ROAD and streets or
roads of higher classification is the length of trip each principally serves.
They are intended to supply the abutting property with the same degree of land
service as the local street, while at the same time serving larger volumes of
traffic.

to provide access to the immediately adjacent property. LOCAL ACCESS STREETS
are intended to carry low volumes of traffic.

Oil wells, derricks, and related equipment, including storage tanks, shall be
considered as STRUCTURES. A transmission line and its towers and associated
structures shall be permitted by the obtaining of one permit for the entire
construction project in the county. If not enforceable due to conflicts with
eminent domain, a map showing the location of lines and towers and other needed
information shall be requested.
   SUBDIVISION. The division of a root parcel of land. All SUBDIVISIONS shall
be classified as exempt subdivisions, minor subdivisions, or major
subdivisions. There shall be no further division of a subdivision (includes a
split off from a root parcel) unless the further division is an exempt
subdivision. Any SUBDIVISION of land, whether or not the same is exempt, shall
require an accurate plat of survey with improvements and the same shall be
placed of record upon recording said sold-off deed pursuant to the terms of §
153.081.
      (1)   SUBDIVISION, EXEMPT.

(This exemption does not include the division of land by estate personal
representatives or by requested court orders where the court order is not
merely fulfilling the terms of a testamentary or intestate transfer);
         (d)   The sale or exchange of parcels or parts thereof, between
adjoining lot owners where the sale or exchange cannot create additional
building sites (an example might be adjoining landowners exchanging land in
order to correct or straighten property lines);
         (e)   The division of land for purely agricultural purposes, not
involving any new public ways or easements, and not reasonably expected to
result in new building sites, whether presently or in the future, and includes
20 acres of land per parcel; and

employed as a means of instruction. This definition shall not be deemed to
include educational institution as defined in this chapter.

      (2)   USE, NON-CONFORMING. A use that is lawful prior to the adoption of
this chapter or by amendments that may later be adopted, but would be

occupancy may be issued by the Zoning Administrator for a period of not more
than six months during the completion of the construction of the building or of
alterations which are required under the terms of any law or ordinance. Such
temporary certificate may be renewed, but it shall not be construed in any way

§ 153.073 BOUNDARIES.
   (A)   Unless otherwise indicated, the zone boundary lines are land lines,
the centerlines of streets, parkways, alleys, or railroad rights-of-way, or
such lines extended. Other lines within blocks are rear or side lot lines, or
such lines extended.
   (B)   Where the physical layout existing on the ground varies from the
layout as shown on the zoning map due to the scale, lack of detail, or
eligibility of the zoning map, the Zoning Administrator shall interpret said
map according to the reasonable intent of this chapter.
(Ord. 2005-01, passed 2-17-2005)
§ 153.074 NON-CONFORMING.
   (A)   Generally. Within the districts or zones established by this chapter
or by amendments that may later be adopted, there exist non-conforming
structures, non-conforming uses of land, and non-conforming uses of structures
or of structures and land in combination which were lawful before this chapter
was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted
under the terms of this chapter or future amendments hereto. It is the intent
of this section to permit these non-conforming uses to continue until they are
removed but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this
section that non-conforming uses shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, or
extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses which are
prohibited elsewhere in the same zone. Illegal uses existing at the time this
chapter is enacted shall not be validated by virtue of its enactment.
   (B)   Continuation of non-conforming structures.
      (1)   Where a lawful structure exists, at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this chapter, that could not now be built under the terms of
this chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards,
its location on the lot, bulk, or other requirements concerning the structure,
such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful.
      (2)   A non-conforming structure may be repaired or altered, provided no
structural change shall be made.
      (3)   A structure, non-conforming as to height, yard, or lot area
requirements, shall not be added to or enlarged in any manner unless such
structure, including such addition or enlargement, is made to conform to the
height, yard, or lot area requirements of the zone in which it is located.
      (4)   No non-conforming structure shall be moved in whole or in part to
any other location on the lot unless every portion of each structure is made to
conform to all the regulations of the zone in which it is located.
   (C)   Continuation of non-conforming uses of land.
      (1)   Where, at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, lawful
uses of land exist which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by
this chapter, the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions.
      (2)   No such non-conforming uses shall be enlarged or increased nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
      (3)   No such non-conforming uses shall be moved in whole or in part to
any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
      (4)   No additional structure, which does not conform to the requirements
of this chapter, shall be erected in connection with such non-conforming uses
of land.
   (D)   Continuation of non-conforming uses of structures or of structures and
land in combination.
      (1)   If a lawful use of a structure or use of a structure and land in
combination exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter that would not now be allowed in the zone in which it is located under
the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
      (2)   A non-conforming use of a structure, designed for a conforming use,
shall not be expanded or extended into any other portion of such conforming
structure nor changed except to a conforming use.
      (3)   Any structure or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a non-conforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the zone, and the non-conforming use may not thereafter
be resumed.
      (4)   Where non-conforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the non-
conforming status of the land.
   (E)   Conforming mobile home park. Any mobile home park which exists upon
the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter and which is
located in a zone which permits a mobile home park, either as a permitted use
or as a special exemption, shall be regarded as a conforming use and may be
continued except that any change in layout, expansion, or extension shall be
subject to all provisions of this chapter.
   (F)   Non-conforming variance.
      (1)   The Board may authorize, upon appeals in specific cases, such
variance from the terms of this subchapter as will not be contrary to the
public interest, and where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement
of the provisions of this subchapter will result in unnecessary hardship, and
so that the spirit of the chapter shall be observed and substantial justice
done; provided, however, that no action shall be taken or decision made except
after public hearing.
      (2)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building
or development on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, and upon which actual
building construction has carried on diligently. Where demolition or removal of
an existing building has been substantially begun and/or preparatory to
rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction, provided that the work shall be carried on diligently. ACTUAL
CONSTRUCTION is hereby defined as work done which is beyond the preparation
stage and which is into the stage where changes or additions are made
permanent.
   (G)   Amortization of non-conforming uses of buildings.

industrial or commercial use not specifically set out in this section: At least
one parking area for each two employees plus sufficient areas to park all
company-owned or leased vehicles.
   (B)   Off-street parking miscellaneous.
      (1)   The distance to any parking area as herein required shall be
measured between the nearest point of the off-street parking facility and the
nearest point of the building said parking area or facility is to serve.
      (2)   In the case of any use not listed herein, the number of parking
areas required for such use shall be the same as for a similar use which is
listed. In the case of mixed uses in the same building or structure, the total
requirement for off-street parking facilities shall be the sum of the
requirements of the various uses computed separately from the items set out in
this section, and off-street parking facilities for one use shall not be
considered as providing required parking facilities for any other use except as
hereinafter specified for collective use.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent collective
provisions of any off-street parking facility for two or more buildings or uses
providing, however, that the total number of off-street parking areas shall not
be less than the sum of requirements for the various individual uses computed
separately in accordance with the items set out in this section.
      (4)   Any parking or loading areas established prior to the effective
date of this chapter and which is used or intended to be used in connection
with any main building, structure, or use or any areas designed and intended to

structure erected after such effective date, shall hereafter be maintained so
long as said building or structure remains, unless the owner provides and
maintains in another location an equivalent number of required areas in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
      (5)   All parking areas provided pursuant to this section shall normally
be on the same lot with the building; however, the Board may permit the parking
areas to be on any lot within 300 feet of the building, except for the
requirements of §
153.082(A)(19). If the Board determines that it is impractical to provide
parking on the same lot with the building, the requirements set forth in §§
153.082(A)(5),
153.082(A)(7) through (A)(10), and (A)(12) may be waived by the Board in the
case of a building erected or altered as a result of destruction by fire or
other natural disaster, or in the case whenever the Board determines that more
than 75% of the privately owned lands within 300 feet of the building to be
erected, enlarged, or altered are improved with such buildings.
   (C)   Off-street loading.
      (1)   On the same premises with every building, structure, or part
thereof hereafter erected, established, or enlarged and occupied for
manufacturing, storage, warehouse goods display, department store, wholesale
store, market, hotel, mortuary, laundry, dry cleaning, or other uses involving
the receipt of distribution by vehicles of material or merchandise, there shall
be provided and maintained adequate space for standing, loading, and unloading
in order to avoid undue interference with public use of the street or alley.
      (2)   Such space, unless otherwise adequately provided for, shall include
a 12-foot by 45-foot loading space with 14-foot height clearance for every
20,000 square feet or fraction thereof in excess of 3,000 square feet of floor
area used for above mentioned purposes, or for every 20,000 square feet or
fraction thereof in excess of 3,000 square feet of land used for the above
mentioned purposes. These requirements may, upon appeal, be increased,
modified, or waived by the Board where the conditions or circumstances justify
such action, provided it has obtained thereon recommendation from the County
Highway Supervisor.
   (D)   Public parking areas. Every parcel of land which, after the effective
date of this chapter, is changed to a public parking area, automobile or
trailer sales area, filling station, or garage, shall be developed as follows.
      (1)   Such area, where subject to wheeled traffic, shall be improved with
bituminous, concrete, crushed stone with an adequate base, or other equivalent
surfacing and shall have appropriate bumper guards where needed.
      (2)   Where such area adjoins a lot in an R zone or a residential
development, a solid wall, compact evergreen screen, or uniformly painted board
fence having a height of not less than four feet shall be erected and
maintained between such area and the property in residential areas and zones.
Such enclosures shall be at least five feet from the side of a lot in an R zone
or residential development, and all required front and side yards shall be
properly maintained as such. Where such area is across the street from an R
zone or a residential development, a compact evergreen screen having a height
of not less than three feet shall be erected and maintained between such area
and the property in the said zone or development, and all required front yards
shall be maintained as such.

153.999
§ 153.083 FLOOD ZONE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose of flood zone (F zone). The development of flood hazard areas
of the county could result in the potential loss of life and property, create
health and safety hazards, and lead to extraordinary public expenditures for
flood protection and relief. The development of these areas is not essential to
the orderly growth of the community, and such areas are suitable for open space
uses that do not require structures or fill.
   (B)   Basis for establishment. The floodplain or zone (areas subject to
inundation by the regulatory flood) as identified by the Federal Insurance
Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled, “The Flood
Insurance Study for the County of Adams, Indiana”, dated October 16, 2003, with
the accompanying flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary-floodway maps,
along with any subsequent revisions to the text or maps are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The flood insurance study
is on file in the office of the Auditor of the county and the Zoning
Administrator of the county.
   (C)   Permitted uses. The following uses have a low flood damage potential
and do not obstruct flood flows. These uses shall be permitted by right within
the flood zone to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other
ordinance and provided that they do not require structures, fill, or storage of
materials or equipment:
      (1)   Agricultural uses such as general farming, pasture, grazing,
orchards, plant nurseries, and vineyards;
      (2)   Forestry, wildlife areas, and nature preserves; and
      (3)   Parks and recreational uses, such as golf courses, driving ranges,
and play areas.
   (D)   Non-permitted uses. All development applications located in the
floodplain district or zone which are not permitted by right (division (C)
above) will require the review and approval by the Department of Natural
Resources prior to the issuance of a local permit. The applicant shall forward
all these applications along with plans and specifications to the Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
   (E)   Non-conforming uses. Any building, structure, or use of land in the
floodplain district or zone which is not in conformance with this chapter
constitutes a non-conforming use. All applications to repair, extend, or
enlarge a non-conforming use shall be forwarded to the Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment. All terms and conditions imposed by the State
Department of Natural Resources shall be incorporated into the issuance of any
local permit.
   (F)   Variances. Applications for variances to the provisions of this
ordinance shall be forwarded to the State Department of Natural Resources for
review and comment. All terms and conditions imposed by the State Department of
Natural Resources shall be incorporated into the issuance of any local permit.
   (G)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations. The Zoning
Administrator of the county, during his or her review of improvement location
permits, shall assure that all National Flood Insurance Program Regulations
pertaining to state and federal permits, subdivision review, mobile home tie-
downs standards, utility construction, record keeping (including lowest flood
level elevations), and watercourse alteration and maintenance have been met.
   (H)   Disclaimer. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Therefore, this chapter does not create any liability on the part of the
county, Natural Resources, or the state for any damages that result from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.

153.999
§ 153.084 AGRICULTURAL ZONE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose of agricultural zone (A zone). The agricultural zone is
intended to establish and preserve rural areas from urban encroachment until
such areas are adaptable to orderly urban expansion, and to permit the full
range of agricultural activities, including limited types of low density
residential development and other uses customarily conducted in agricultural
areas.
   (B)   Permitted uses.
      (1)   Any use permitted in the flood zone;
      (2)   Single-family detached dwellings, provided not more than two
dwellings shall be permitted;
      (3)   Manufactured homes and mobile homes (subject to the requirements of
§
153.078, where applicable);

153.006;
      (14)   (a)   Ponds, provided they meet the setback of 75 feet from the
toe of the mound or the water’s edge from the center of a publicly dedicated
roadway. In obtaining an improvement location permit as required by §
153.007, the contractor or excavator who is to install the pond shall make
application in the name of the owner of the pond and shall be responsible for
obtaining the permit and displaying the permit at the job site before
commencing any construction. No contractor or excavator shall do any work in
installing or modifying and making improvement to any pond requiring a permit
without informing the owner of the necessity thereof and personally obtaining
the permit on behalf of the owner. In addition to the foregoing, the
contractor, on behalf of the owner, shall obtain the written approval of the
County Surveyor that the proposed pond and location thereof does not disrupt
any located drainage within the county and that the pond does not create
drainage runoff problems which will overload or burden any existing tile and
drain.
         (b)   In granting said approval, the County Surveyor shall require
that the pond overflow does not discharge water onto adjoining lands of other
property owners and that all runoff water shall be either directed towards a
swale or located tile or redirected back into the pond, whichever is applicable
in order to safeguard neighboring lands from runoff water created by the
construction of the pond. The minimum setback from the toe of the mound or the
water’s edge, whichever is applicable, the setback from the adjoining property
line shall be a minimum of 20 feet except that the County Surveyor may require
a greater distance where conditions of the pond require a greater distance for
adequate drainage and protection of adjoining landowners. Further, in no event
shall the water’s edge of a pond or the toe of the mound be closer to any
existing septic tank or absorption field of the owner’s residence or any
adjoining neighbor’s residence be closer than 50 feet.
         (c)   The County Surveyor shall consider the requirements of State
Drainage Code 36-9-27 and the applicable requirements in granting approval for
any pond permit.
      (15)   Intensive livestock operations, subject to provisions of
Chapter 112.
   (C)   Building size regulations. No building shall be erected for
residential purposes having a floor area of less than 950 square feet per
primary dwelling unit exclusive of unenclosed porches, terraces, and garages.
The square footage minimum for a mobile home shall be 840 square feet exclusive
of unenclosed porches, terraces, and garages.
   (D)   Residential dwelling density. On a tract, parcel, or lot of land,
there shall be permitted two individual single-family dwellings subject to the
further regulations of §
153.088.
   (E)   Ingress and egress easements. Where an easement is desired or
necessary to serve a property not adjacent to a public road, the width of said
ingress/egress easement or the deeded portion of the lot which serves as
ingress and egress to said parcel shall be a minimum of 25 feet in width if the
same services one residence. In the case of ingress/egress ways serving more
than one lot, the minimum width shall be 50 feet.

topography, such regulations may be modified or determined by the Board, as
provided for in §
153.027(A)(4).
         (b)   Where a lot is situated between two lots, each of which has a
main building which projects beyond the ordinance established front yard line
and was so maintained when this chapter became effective, the front yard
requirement on such lot may be the average of the front yards of said existing
buildings, provided, however, the front yard of such lot shall be not less than
ten feet.
         (c)   Where a lot adjoins only one lot having a main building which
projects beyond the ordinance established front yard line and has been so
maintained since this chapter became effective, the front yard requirement on
such lot may be the average of the front yard of the existing building and the
established front yard line, provided, however, the front yard of such lot
shall be not less than ten feet.
         (d)   For the purpose of side yard regulations, the following
dwellings with common party walls shall be considered as one building occupying
one lot: semi-detached dwellings, row dwellings, and group dwellings.
         (e)   The front and side yards may be waived for dwellings, motels,
and lodging houses erected above the ground floor of a building when said
ground floor is designed and used exclusively for business and/or industrial
purposes.
         (f)   An accessory building, not exceeding 20 feet in height may
occupy not more than 30%of the area of a required rear yard, providing it is no
less than five feet from any side or rear lot line.
         (g)   Where a through lot has a depth of 200 feet or more, and an area
of 20,000 square feet or more, said lot may be assumed to be two lots with the
rear line of each approximately equidistant from the front lot lines, provided
all area requirements are complied with.
      (6)   Yard projections are as follows.
         (a)   A porte cochere may be permitted over a driveway in a side yard,
provided such structure is not more than one story in height and 20 feet in
length, and is entirely open on at least the front and rear sides, except for
the necessary supporting columns and customary architectural features;
provided, however, said porte cochere does not extend to within six feet of a
side lot line.
         (b)   A cornice, eave bolt course, sill, canopy, or other similar
architectural feature (not including bay window or other vertical protection)
may extend or project into a required front, side, or rear yard not more than
two feet, provided the width of such side yard is not reduced to less than
three feet.
         (c)   A fire escape may extend or project into any required front,
side, or rear yard not more than four feet.
         (d)   An open, unenclosed stairway or balcony, not covered by a roof

feet.
         (f)   A fence, lattice-work screen, or wall in connection with
residential use, not more than six feet in height, but not to extend into the
required front yard, or a hedge or thick growth of shrubs, maintained so as not
to exceed four feet in height, may be located in any required front or side
yard.
         (g)   A landscape feature such as trees, shrubs, flowers, or plants
shall be permitted in any required front, side, or rear yard, provided it does
not violate the provisions of §
153.088(E).
   (F)   Recreational space requirements.
      (1)   A recreational space requirement is required for all R-1 and R-
2 zones and any agricultural or other zone where residential housing is being
planned or proposed.
      (2)   (a)   The following standards are to be utilized in the evaluation
of all required recreation space in a Commission approved development plan and
in the approval of subdivisions requiring recreational space.
         (b)   The Commission approved recreation space shall be approved in
all zones as defined in §
153.088(F)(5). The purpose of providing this base shall be to meet the
immediate and future recreational needs of the development’s residence and a
neighborhood setting. Recreation space may be provided in a centrally located
site, in distinctly separate sites, as connecting links between separated
activity areas, or adjacent to other existing or proposed recreation spaces.
The Commission shall determine if the proposed recreation space is suitable for
the intended use. Consideration shall be given to the location of the proposed
recreation space, and it shall be reasonably close to and adjacent to
residential areas or centrally located between phased developments. Wasteland
or land undesirable for development shall not be substituted for recreational
space unless its location and suitability is consistent with recreational use.
      (3)   All developments with recreational space must contain acceptable
covenants which, in the opinion of the Commission, ensure adequate maintenance
of those recreation spaces.
      (4)   Recreational space shall be required when, in the opinion of the
Commission, it would be desirable for the proposed development considering the
surrounding area and the density of families benefitting from open space and
recreational uses. Therefore, a recreational space requirement may be required
by the Commission for minor subdivisions if, in the opinion of the Commission,
all the above criteria are present and it would be desirable for the proposed
development and surrounding area to have recreational space included as part of
the plan. Unless extenuating circumstances exist, recreational space will
generally not be required in the case of minor subdivisions.
      (5)   Recreational space shall be required in all major subdivisions of
more than ten lots and may be required in major subdivisions of ten or fewer
lots if, in the opinion of the Commission, it is determined that such
recreational space is desirable and necessary to the orderly development of the
area. In major subdivisions of over ten lots, the minimum amount of
recreational space which shall be required shall be a minimum of 10% of the
total area developed with a minimum of 32,670 square feet.
      (6)   The term RECREATIONAL SPACE shall be interpreted to mean void of
non-recreational structures, street rights-of-way, open parking areas, and
driveways for dwellings. The space qualified for RECREATIONAL SPACE shall be
made reasonably level and suitable for organized or unorganized play and
recreation by children and adults. The developer may, but is not required to,
provide specific playground equipment and physical improvements.
      (7)   Space intended for limited recreational activity or other uses,
such as a golf course, to which all residents of the development may not be
permitted free access because of the payment of a fee or charge, shall not
qualify in meeting the recreational space requirement herein.

§ 153.089 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   A planned unit zone is intended to encourage innovative
developments in certain zones that will not distract from the original zone
intent.
      (2)   Developers of land in a planned unit zone will be offered
flexibility in design and development. As a means to this flexibility,
regulations governing lot size, yards, and building location may be varied,
subsequent to approval by the Plan Commission through the development plan
process, §
153.092.
         (a)   Planned Unit Developments may be located only on lots, parcels,
or tracts of land of four acres or more in R-2, C-1, C-2, C-3, I-1 and I-
2 zones. Planned unit zones are identified by a “P” designation following the
permitted zone.
         (b)   Corresponding zones are as follows.
 
Regular Zones Corresponding Planned Unit Zone
C-1           C-1P
C-2           C-2P
C-3           C-3P
I-1           I-1P
I-2           I-2P
R-2           R-2P
 
   (B)   Planned residential zone.
      (1)   The intent of a planned residential zone (R-2P) is to encourage
innovative multiple-family residential communities and allow the developer of
such communities the maximum amount of flexibility in design and development.
      (2)   The uses permitted in the zone shall be the same as those permitted
within the R-2 zone as found in §
153.085(F).
   (C)   Planned commercial zone.
      (1)   The intent of a planned commercial zone (C-1P, C-2P, or C-3P) is to
provide for and encourage the grouping of businesses into centers and
complexes, incorporating modem concepts of service and design.
      (2)   The uses permitted in each zone shall be the same as those
permitted within the corresponding C-l, C-2, or C-3 zone as found in §
153.086.
   (D)   Planned industrial zone.
      (1)   The intent of a planned industrial zone (I-1P or I-2P) is to
provide a means for industrial land uses, regardless of overall size or
acreage, to develop in accordance with a set plan and in consideration of the
surrounding land use, especially within transitional areas.
      (2)   The uses permitted in each zone shall be the same as those
permitted within the corresponding I-1 or I-2 zone as found in §
153.087.

§ 153.090 DEVELOPMENT PLAN REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose of development plan. A development plan is intended to provide
all pertinent information about a proposed development so the Plan Commission
may make a knowledgeable decision whether or not the proposed development meets
all the requirements of this chapter and the goals and objectives of the County
Master Plan.
   (B)   Required developments for development plan.
      (1)   The development plan procedure, hereafter set forth, shall be
required for the following developments:
         (a)   All minor and major subdivisions of land;
         (b)   All mobile home parks. Additional requirements are provided for
in §
153.091;
         (c)   All planned unit developments. Additional requirements are
provided for in §
153.092;
         (d)   All intensive livestock operations. Requirements are provided in
Chapter 112;
         (e)   All commercial multiple-group dwelling developments on lots,
parcels, or tracts of land over two acres;
         (f)   All multiple-group dwelling development;
         (g)   All C-1 principal use developments on lots, parcels, or tracts
of land over two acres. Accessory buildings under 5,000 square feet are
excluded from the development plan procedures;
         (h)   All C-2 and C-3 principal use developments. Accessory buildings
under 5,000 square feet are excluded from the development plan procedures;
         (i)   All I-1 and I-2 principal use developments. Accessory buildings
under 5,000 square feet are excluded from the development plan procedures; and
         (j)   All uses contained in §
153.087(C)(3).
      (2)   A subdivision plat shall be required along with a development plan
as long as a subdivision of land, as defined, is occurring as a result of this
development. Both development plan and subdivision plat processes may be done
concurrently with any duplicated requirements being counted for both processes.
   (C)   Pre-application review. A pre-application review between Zoning
Administrator and developer is recommended at least 15 days prior to official
application for primary approval of a development plan. The purpose of this
pre-application review is as follows:
      (1)   To inform the applicant of the standards and requirements of all
applicable ordinances, including the Comprehensive Plan;
      (2)   To review the various procedures and submission requirements;
      (3)   To review with the applicant any inherent limiting characteristics
of the specific site or surrounding areas; and
      (4)   To reduce the time period between initial application and Plan
Commission approval.
   (D)   Application for primary approval of development plans.
      (1)   The application for primary approval of a development plan shall be

         (d)   To such other interested parties and in such manner as the
Commission may designate by rule.
      (2)   The public hearing for primary approval of the proposed development
plan shall be conducted in accordance with such procedures as the Commission
may adopt by rule.
      (3)   After public hearing upon the proposed development plan, the
Commission shall determine if it complies with and satisfies the standards
prescribed for primary approval under this chapter. Within a reasonable time
after such hearing, the Commission shall either grant, with or without
conditions, or deny primary approval of the proposed development plan and enter
written findings and decision in accordance with such action, signed by any one
of the following: the President, the Vice President, the Secretary, or the

furnished by the Zoning Administrator within five days after the Commission’s
decision in the manner prescribed by the Commission, by rule duly adopted.
      (5)   Primary approval of a development plan by the Commission shall be
valid for one year from the date of approval, unless the applicant, prior to
the expiration of such one-year period, shall have applied for and received the
Commission’s approval for an extension of time to obtain secondary approval.
If, by the expiration of such initial one-year period of time, or during any
period of extension approved by the Commission, the applicant does not obtain
secondary approval of all or part of the area included in the development plan
for which primary approval had been granted, then the primary approval granted
for the development plan shall lapse and be considered as null and void. In the
event the Commission grants secondary approval for only a portion of the
development plan, the applicant thereafter will not be obligated to adhere to
any time limitations for requesting secondary approval of the remainder of the
development plan.
   (F)   Application for secondary approval of development plans.
      (1)   The applicant shall have the responsibility to notify the Zoning
Administrator of the Commission in writing of his or her intent to seek
secondary approval of either all or a portion of the development plan. In the
event the applicant intends to seek secondary approval of only a portion of the
development plan, the applicant shall specifically describe and designate such
areas so as to reasonably identify the same. The applicant shall also at that
time file with the Commission Staff the development plan in the form and with
the contents prescribed hereinafter. The Zoning Administrator shall then cause
to be scheduled a meeting of the Plan Commission for the purpose of reviewing
the development plan and determining whether secondary approval shall be
granted, and provide notice to the applicant of the date and time of such
meeting. No other notice of such meeting need be given, except as required by
law. The Zoning Administrator shall then review all submissions made by the
applicant to ensure the requirements for secondary approval stated in this
chapter have been satisfied.
      (2)   The Commission will consider secondary approval of a development
plan only after the applicant has accomplished the following:
         (a)   Filed with the Commission a complete set of plans and

   (G)   Action by Plan Commission for secondary approval of development plans.
      (1)   Within a reasonable time following the applicant’s satisfaction of
all requirements for secondary approval stated under division (F) above, the
Plan Commission shall either grant, with or without conditions, or deny
secondary approval of the development plan. If secondary approval is denied,
the Plan Commission shall, within five days thereafter, furnish the applicant
with a written list of the reasons for such denial.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the requirements of the ordinance for submission to
the Plan Commission, the Plan Commission may, upon written request by the
applicant, supported by evidence that all submissions have been timely filed,
grant secondary approval of a development plan although one or more of such
approvals may not have been delivered to or received by the Plan Commission.
The Plan Commission may grant such secondary approval only when the applicant
provides a written statement made under oath and approved by the Plan
Commission or the Commission Staff, for recordation as a protective covenant or
supplement thereto, stating that the applicant will cause to be provided at his
or her cost all things necessary to attain or accomplish the delivery of the
required approval(s) which shall not then have been delivered to or received by
the Commission. If the applicant does not then deliver such approval(s) in a
timely fashion, the Commission is hereby empowered to refuse to issue either
improvement location permits or certificate of occupancy permits. Once the
applicant has thereafter secured and delivered to the Commission the required
approval(s), the Zoning Administrator shall then execute a recordable document,
which shall be recorded by the applicant at his or her expense, rescinding the
aforesaid recorded written statement.
   (H)   Issuance of permits.
      (1)   Prior to the issuance of an improvement location permit for any use
in a zone wherein a development plan is required, the following matters shall
be accomplished:
         (a)   The Commission shall have granted primary and secondary approval
of the development plan in accordance with this subchapter and the County
Comprehensive Master Plan; and
         (b)   The applicant shall have duly recorded in the office of the
Recorder of the county the utility easements, rights-of-way, plats, deed
restrictions, or any other legal instruments required, and in the form
approved, by the Commission.
      (2)   The requirement for such approval of a development plan, prior to
the issuance of an improvement location permit, shall also specifically apply
to any residential condominium development which is subject to the requirements
of I.C. 32-25, as the same may be amended from time to time, regardless of
whether the zoning district in which the subject real estate is located
required approval of the development plan for the intended use under this
chapter. Such a condominium development shall be subject to all requirements
set forth in division (F) above.
   (I)   Amendments to approved development plan.
      (1)   After the Commission has granted either primary or secondary
approval of a development plan, any amendments thereto shall be submitted by
the applicant to the Zoning Administrator by way of an amended application for
the type of approval sought, on a form prescribed by the Commission. Any such
application shall also be accompanied by the pertinent submissions required
under this chapter for the proposed amendments involved, together with the
requisite filing fee if a public hearing is required hereunder to be held upon
the amended application.
      (2)   Any application submitted for amendment of a development plan
following the granting by the Commission of primary approval, but prior to the
granting of secondary approval, need contain only the signature(s) of the
original applicant(s), or the successors in interest thereto. After secondary
approval of a development plan has been granted, any applications for proposed
amendments thereto shall contain the signatures of all owners of record, as
shown in the real estate master file maintained by the Auditor of the county,
at the time such application is filed, of the real estate included in that
portion of the development plan for which secondary approval had previously
been granted and for which amendment is being sought.
      (3)   If in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator, the amendment to the
development plan proposed in such application is substantial, in terms of the
scope of the overall project and/or the possible impact upon the community and
land uses, both existing and planned, which surround the area included in the
development plan, then the Zoning Administrator may either require the matter
to be heard by the Commission, at a public hearing, or defer such decision to
the Plan Commission for a determination of such public hearing. In the event
such determination is to be made by the Plan Commission, notice of the date and
time of the meeting of the Plan Commission at which such determination is to be
made shall be given by the Zoning Administrator to the applicant. No other
notice need be given, except as required by law. Any action by the Plan
Commission in determining whether a public hearing must be held before the
Commission upon the amendments proposed by the applicant shall be a final
decision, which may not be appealed to the Commission except by a dissenting
Plan Commission member as provided by rule.
      (4)   Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, nothing in this division
(I) shall preclude the Commission from requiring, as a condition for the
granting of primary approval of an overall development plan, that subsequent
public hearings be conducted before the Commission, as to any portions of the
overall development plan or any later amendments, alterations, or modifications
proposed with regard thereto. The Commission may, however, waive any procedural
or submission requirements otherwise provided under this chapter it may deem
necessary when reviewing a change to an approved development plan.
      (5)   If the Commission requests, or is required under the provisions of
this chapter, to conduct a second or subsequent public hearing for approval of
a development plan or an amendment thereto, then such hearing shall be
conducted and notice furnished in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter and the pertinent rules duly adopted by the Commission.
   (J)   Development plan design standards. The following minimum design
standards shall apply to all site improvements on real estate for which a
development plan is required. Individual zoning districts may also supplement
the following standards with more detailed standards pertinent to individual
districts.
      (1)   Environmental design.
         (a)   It is the intention of the Plan Commission to encourage the
preservation of natural site amenities and to minimize the disturbance to the
natural environment.
         (b)   Existing trees and other natural features shall be preserved
whenever possible. The location of these features must be considered when
planning common open space, location of buildings, underground services, walks,
paved areas, and finished grade levels. The Commission may inquire into the
means whereby natural features will be protected during construction.
      (2)   Building separation. In reviewing the location of all structures
within the development plan boundaries, the Commission shall determine that
said structures are located to allow adequate light, air, ease of entry, and
access by emergency vehicles. For those districts without specified yard
requirements, the Commission shall be guided by the following:
         (a)   That the open areas provided around the building be sufficient
to provide the occupants of the structure with adequate light and air from all
outside walls which contain windows or doors;
         (b)   That sufficient space is provided for access and entry to
buildings from all streets, parking lots, and other buildings; and
         (c)   That in the event lots for one-family or two-family dwellings
are to be sold prior to construction and the applicant cannot indicate
structures on the development plan, said structures shall be subject to the
yard provisions of the Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances for the R-1, R-2, and
R-3 districts or other Commission-approved minimums, unless specifically
waived.
      (3)   Vehicular circulation facilities. All present and future dedicated
right-of-way widths and street improvements shall meet the requirements of §§
153.140 through
153.165 as now or hereafter amended.
      (4)   Pedestrian circulation facilities. Pedestrian walkways shall be
constructed in a location and to specifications approved by the Commission.
Such walkways shall provide for pedestrian circulation throughout the
development and shall be separated from vehicular traffic. Where distance
separation cannot be achieved, physical separation may be required in cases
which the Commission deems necessary.
      (5)   Sanitary sewage disposal and water supply systems. All water supply
and sanitary sewage disposal systems, whether private or public in nature,
shall be subject to compliance with local, and where appropriate, state agency
requirements. Plans must be submitted to and approved by the appropriate
agencies.
      (6)   Recreation space requirements.
         (a)   Recreational space requirements and the criteria for approval in
the development plan and/or platting of applicable subdivisions are contained
in §
153.088(F). The following standards are to be utilized in the evaluation of all
required recreation space, in a Commission approved development plan.
            1.   Commission approved recreation space shall be provided in all
residential zones as defined in §
153.088(F). The purpose of providing this space shall be to meet the immediate
and future recreational needs of the development’s residents in a neighborhood
setting. Recreation space may be provided in a centrally located site, in
distinctly separated sites, as connecting links between separated activity
areas, or adjacent to other existing or proposed recreation spaces. The
Commission shall determine if the proposed recreation space is suitable for the
intended use. This requirement may be waived when, in the opinion of the
Commission, the applicant has satisfactorily demonstrated that he or she has
provided alternative methods for meeting the recreational needs of his or her
development’s residents.
            2.   All developments with recreation space must contain acceptable
covenants which, in the opinion of the Commission, ensure adequate maintenance
of those recreation spaces.
         (b)   The term RECREATION SPACE shall be interpreted to mean void of
non-recreational structures, street rights-of-way, open parking areas, and
driveways for dwellings.
         (c)   Space intended for limited recreational or other uses, such as a
golf course, to which all residents of the development may not be permitted
free access because of the payment of a fee or a charge, shall have a maximum
of three-fourths of said space utilized in meeting the recreation space
requirements of the total development.
      (7)   Paving. All access drives and off-street parking facilities shall
either be paved with concrete or with other approved surfacing material to
adequately provide a durable and dust-free surface.
      (8)   Parking standards.
         (a)   Parking areas may be required to be arranged so as to prevent
through traffic to other parking areas.
         (b)   Parking areas shall be screened from adjacent non-related
structures, roads, and traffic arteries with plantings, earth berms, walls, or
changes in grade, when deemed necessary by the Commission.
         (c)   All parking areas shall be marked so as to provide for orderly
and safe parking, storage, and movement.
         (d)   When it is in the interest of safety and better vehicle and
pedestrian circulation, the Plan Commission may require the use of landscape
elements to provide physical separation of use areas.
         (e)   All parking areas shall be adequately lighted. All such lighting
shall be so arranged as to direct the light away from adjoining real estate.
         (f)   All parking areas and off-street loading areas shall be graded
and drained to remove all surface water without erosion and flooding.
      (9)   Street lighting. Street lighting shall be provided in all
residential developments. Alternative street lighting proposals will be
considered by the Commission if found to be appropriate in scale and intensity.
Where pedestrian facilities are separated from streets to the extent that they
are not adequately lighted from the street light facilities, separate lighting
facilities shall be provided on such pedestrian facilities.

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
§ 153.105 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The State Legislature has, in I.C. 36-7-4 and I.C. 14-28 et seq., granted
the power to local government units to control land use within their
jurisdictions. Therefore, the county has adopted the following floodplain
management regulations for the purposes stated in §
153.107.
(Ord. 2020-7, passed 6-30-2020)
§ 153.106 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, creating health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-proofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 2020-7, passed 6-30-2020)
§ 153.107 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this subchapter to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
   (F)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the county by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2020-7, passed 6-30-2020)
§ 153.108 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this subchapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains; and
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
(Ord. 2020-7, passed 6-30-2020)
§ 153.109 CONFLICT OF PROVISIONS.
   Should there be a conflict between the terms and provisions of this
subchapter and the County Land Use Ordinance, this subchapter shall control.
(Ord. 2020-7, passed 6-30-2020)
§ 153.110 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A ZONES,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as zone A, zone AE, zones A1-A30,
zone AO, zone AH, zone AR, and zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are
presented as follows.
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   ZONE AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. (ZONE AE is on new and revised maps in place of ZONES
A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this subchapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH zone on the community’s
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. The portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular
program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which a slight chance of flooding might be
too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to, schools,
nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response installations,
installations which produce, use, or store hazardous materials or hazardous
waste.
   D ZONE. Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding
is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is
not required by regulation in this zone.
   DEVELOPMENT. 
      (1)   Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate
including, but not limited to:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any
addition to a structure;

         (c)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction
of roads, or similar projects;
         (d)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements, and the like;
         (e)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling
operations;
         (f)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
         (g)   Storage of materials; or
         (h)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
      (2)   DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the maintenance of
existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing, resurfacing
roads, or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent
structures.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter
walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or
columns (posts and piers).
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. A certified statement that verifies a structure’s
elevation information. This certification must be signed and sealed by a land
surveyor, engineer, or architect authorized by law to certify elevation
information.
   EMERGENCY PROGRAM. The first phase under which a community participates in
the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the

grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed prior to January 1, 2010.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOOD.)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See FREEBOARD.)
   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The FLOODPLAIN includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This subchapter, the County Land Use
Ordinance, the County Subdivision Ordinance, and other general ordinances,
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances,
and other applications of police power which control development in flood prone
areas, as they may be amended, replaced, or recodified. This term describes
federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide
standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN
MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to as FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS,
FLOODPLAIN ORDINANCE, FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ORDINANCE, and FLOODPLAIN
MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   FLOOD-PROOFING (DRY FLOOD-PROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the flood-proofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOOD-PROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP. As related to variances of under this subchapter, the EXCEPTIONAL
HARDSHIP that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
County Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional,
unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial
hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations,
physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors
likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP. All of these
problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even
if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURES. Any structures individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include letter of map amendment (LOMA), letter of map revision
(LOMR), and letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented as follows.
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in
a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is
only issued by FEMA.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision
by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA’s determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest elevation described among the following:
      (1)   The top of the lowest level of the structure;
      (2)   The top of the basement floor;
      (3)   The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of
the structure;
      (4)   The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or
pillars; and
      (5)   The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement,
below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;

(Ord. 2020-7, passed 6-30-2020) Penalty, see §
153.999
§ 153.125 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
153.112, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the State Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 (as may be
amended, replaced, or recodified) a permit for construction in a floodway from
the State Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of
a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or
obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation
activities such as filling, grading, clearing, paving, and the like, undertaken
before the actual start of construction of the structure. However, it does
exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences
in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26 allows construction of a
non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in a non-boundary river
floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the
State Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to
elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval for the fill is
required from the State Department of Natural Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
State Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in the
floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the State Department of Natural Resources, the
Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in §§
153.121 through
153.128 have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the State
Department of Natural Resources. However, a community’s more restrictive
regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This ADVERSE AFFECT is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
fifteen-hundredths of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood
elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway
condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees), the county shall submit the data and request that the Federal
Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping
standard regulations found at 44 C.F.R. § 65.12.

153.999
§ 153.126 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
153.121 through
153.128 have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of
any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.
(Ord. 2020-7, passed 6-30-2020)
§ 153.127 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the State Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the State Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued, provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the State Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in §§
153.121 through
153.128 have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
153.121 through
153.128 have been met.
   (C)   No adverse effect. The total cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development
shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity
of the floodway. This ADVERSE EFFECT is defined as an increase in the elevation
of the regulatory flood of at least fifteen-hundredths of a foot as determined
by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that
under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.

by the decision of the Board may seek judicial review of such decision
according to the provisions of I.C. 36-7-4-1600 Series.
   (D)   Variance procedures. In making decisions on a variance request
pursuant to the criteria established in I.C. 36-7-4-918.5 , the Board shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards
specified in other sections of this subchapter, and:
      (1)   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (2)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (3)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (4)   The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (6)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (7)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (8)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (9)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
of transport of the floodwaters at the site; and
      (10)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (E)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall only be granted when the Board can make positive
findings of fact based on the evidence submitted at the hearing on the variance
for the criteria in I.C. 36-7-4-918.5, and also for the following criteria in
terms of variances from the provisions of this subchapter;
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship as defined in §
153.110;
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances; and
         (d)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (2)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §§
153.125 or
153.127(A) may be granted.
      (3)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §§
153.125 or
153.127(A) will require a permit from the State Department of Natural
Resources.
      (4)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §
153.122 may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (6)   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of
any structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places
or the State Register of Historic Sites and Structures. (Refer to division (G)
below.)
      (7)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation. (See division (F) below.)
      (8)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the State Department of Natural Resources upon request. (See division (F)
below.)
   (F)   Variance notification.
      (1)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted that allows the lowest
floor of a structure to be built below the flood protection grade shall be
given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
         (a)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
flood protection grade will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
         (b)   Such construction below the flood protection grade increases
risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the
Floodplain Administrator in the office of the County Recorder and shall be
recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected
parcel of land.
      (2)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance.
   (G)   Historic structure. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as an “historic structure,” and the variance is the minimum to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (H)   Special conditions. Upon the consideration of the factors listed in
this section, and the purposes of this subchapter, the Board of Zoning Appeals
may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary
to further the purposes of this subchapter.

arterial thoroughfares and primary and secondary streets are designated on a
map developed and maintained by the Plat Officer in consultation with the
County Highway Department. For the purpose of this report, STREETS shall be
classified as follows:
      (1)   ARTERIAL THOROUGHFARES. These facilities serve to move traffic on
state and U.S. marked routes, as well as some county roads and important intra-
city streets. Where a highway is a non-limited access route, these facilities
also perform a secondary function of providing direct access to abutting land
and thus interconnect principal traffic generators.
      (2)   PRIMARY (MAJOR) ROUTES. These facilities serve to connect cities
with each other, as well as to link smaller towns or settlements with the
arterial thoroughfares system. PRIMARY ROUTES provide access to abutting land
and generally serve all principal traffic generators.
      (3)   SECONDARY (CONNECTOR) ROADS. These facilities serve intra-city
movements of traffic, such as that moving between a subdivision and major
street. The principal difference between the connector road and streets or
roads of higher classification is the length of trip each principally serves.
They are intended to supply the abutting property with the same degree of land
service as the local street, while at the same time serving larger volumes of
traffic.
      (4)   LOCAL (RESIDENTIAL) STREETS. The sole function of these streets is
to provide access to the immediately adjacent property. LOCAL ACCESS STREETS
are intended to carry low volumes of traffic.
      (5)   MARGINAL ACCESS STREET. A street designated to connect not more

§ 153.159 PRIMARY PLAT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Individual septic systems.
      (1)   A soils report shall be required for every minor or major
subdivision where lots are planned to be served by an individual septic system
to first determine the suitability of the soil in each proposed lot for a
permitted septic system according to the rules of the County Health Department
and applicable state regulations. The current methodology for determining the
suitability of a septic system is to secure the services of a certified soil
analyst who supervises the excavation of a hole in the ground to conduct visual
and tests of the soil to determine suitability for an approved septic system.
The methodology for conducting the tests and the tests that are required are
subject to change by the County Health Department and/or the state. The
approved methodology in testing in force at the time of the plat approval shall
govern.
      (2)   The purpose of this requirement is to alert the developer that this
determination should be made first as the suitability and location of an
approved septic system may determine the size and layout of the lot lines and
the suitability of any given lot for a building site. The requirements of this
testing prior to preliminary plat approval is set out in division (C)(2) below.
Once approval has been granted under this section for an approved septic
system, said approval shall be non-revocable for a period of one year from the
date of preliminary plat approval.
   (B)   Primary considerations. In order to make the most of opportunities
related to the subdivision and to conserve time, effort, and expense, the owner
or subdivider shall submit to the Plat Officer at an informal conference a
sketch plan of the proposed subdivision. He or she shall consult with the Plat
Officer, the County Surveyor, or appointed official, and other public officials
prior to the preparation of the primary plat for the subdivision; the Master
Plan for the county should be reviewed to determine how the primary plat will
fit into the Master Plan. Requirements for major and minor streets; school and
recreation sites; community facilities; shopping centers; sanitation, water
supply, and drainage; and the relationship to other developments, existing and
proposed, in the vicinity shall be determined in advance of the preparation of
the primary plat. No land shall be subdivided for residential use unless
adequate access to the land over improved streets or thoroughfares exists or
will be provided by the subdivider, or if such land is considered by the Plan
Commission, based upon recommendations of the State Department of Natural
Resources, to be unsuitable for such use by reason of flooding or improper
drainage.
   (C)   Primary plat. A subdivider desiring approval of a plat of a
subdivision shall submit a written application, therefore, to the Plan
Commission, such application shall be accompanied by the information,
requirements, and plans set forth in this division (C) and division (D) below,
all in accordance with the requirements set forth in this subchapter.
      (1)   Two copies of the completed application for minor or major
subdivision approval form shall be submitted to the Plan Commission by the
applicable filing deadline established by the Plan Commission by rule. At the
time of filing, a fee, also established by rule, shall be paid to the Plan
Commission. The Plan Commission shall retain one copy of the application which
shall be attached to the primary drawings, the second copy shall be receipted
and be retained by the subdivider as proof of payment. The subdivider shall
deliver at least four prints of the primary plat drawing, one digital version
of the primary plat along with four copies each of the soil survey map and the
location map which shall be submitted as part of the primary plat to the Plan
Commission office. The preferred size of a plat drawing shall be 36 by 24
inches, subject to staff review and approval. The Plan Commission may transmit
a copy of the primary plat for review and approval to the following officials
or agencies:
         (a)   County Highway Engineer and/or County Highway Supervisor, along
with construction plans;
         (b)   County Surveyor;
         (c)   School Superintendent in whose district said plat is located;
         (d)   County Board of Health;
         (e)   State Department of Natural Resources; and
         (f)   Any other agency the Plat Officer considers to have an interest
in the proposed subdivision, with request for comments from the agency.
      (2)   Each primary plat for a minor or major subdivision that is proposed
to be served by individual septic systems for each lot shall contain a
certification by the County Health Department that each lot has been tested by
an approved methodology to determine the suitability of the soil and location
for an authorized septic system for each lot. This provision for soil testing
for sewage purposes shall not apply where the subdivision of a lot or parcel is
ten acres or more. Each primary plat for a major subdivision shall connect to a
public sanitary sewer system. Each primary plat for a major subdivision, or a
minor plat that is to be served by a public sewer system, shall contain a
certification from the entity providing such service that sanitary sewer
service is available and has adequate capacity to serve the proposed
subdivision.
      (3)   (a)   The Plat Officer shall review the primary minor or major
subdivision and advise the Plan Commission or Design Committee, as the case may
be, as to whether the primary meets the requirements of the subchapter. The
Plat Officer shall provide the subdivider with a copy of any such report. The
subdivider shall then have the opportunity to correct any issues of non-
compliance.
         (b)   On minor subdivisions, the Design Committee may proceed with
primary review according to I.C. 36-7-4-701. On major subdivisions, the Plan
Commission shall conduct a public hearing on the primary plat according to its
rules, and I.C. 36-7-4-700 et seq.
         (c)   In making its decision, the Plan Commission or Design Committee,
as the case may be, shall issue written findings of fact detailing the reasons
for approval or denial. The findings shall be given to the subdivider. The Plan
Commission or Design Committee, as the case may be, may approve the primary
subject to conditions of approval that are reasonably necessary to satisfy the
requirements of this subchapter.
      (4)   If the primary plat is approved by the Plan Commission or Design
Committee, the applicant shall be authorized to proceed with the preparation of
the secondary plat.
      (5)   Primary approval shall confer upon the applicant the following
rights for a one- year period from the date of approval.
         (a)   The general terms and conditions under which the primary
approval was granted shall not be changed.
         (b)   The said applicant shall submit on or before the expiration of
the one-year period the whole or part, or parts, of said plat for secondary
approval. In the event the subdivider fails to submit within the prescribed
time a secondary plat, then the approval given the primary plat or the
remaining portion of the primary plat shall lapse and be considered null and
void.
   (D)   Primary plat requirements. A primary plat shall be provided by the
subdivider and consist of the following:
      (1)   Soil survey map (information shall be obtained from or be prepared
by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, also known as the NRCS) showing:

§ 153.160 SECONDARY PLAT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Filing of secondary plat. Pursuant to I.C. 36-7-4-710, the Plan
Commission delegates to the Design Committee the secondary approval of minor
subdivisions, or to staff, as the Design Committee may direct. Otherwise, a
subdivider desiring secondary plat approval shall submit the plat in the
following procedure:
      (1)   The secondary plat shall be submitted to the Plan Commission for
secondary approval by the applicable filing deadline established by the Plan
Commission by rule no later than 14 days prior to the Plan Commission meeting
at which secondary consideration is desired. The submission shall include the
plans and specifications for the required improvements as set forth in division
(B) below. All documents shall bear the approving signature of the County
Surveyor, and/or appointed officials, and the transmittal to the Plan
Commission and the Commissioners shall include a letter from the County
Surveyor and/or appointed officials, describing such approval and setting forth
an estimate to cover the cost of the proposed improvements for performance
guarantee purposes.
      (2)   Upon review by the Plan Commission, the secondary plat shall be
forwarded to the County Auditor for submission to the Commissioners with all
recommendations from the Plan Commission attached. If the plat is given
secondary approval by the Plan Commission, in a form acceptable for recording,
the plat shall bear on the face of the plat the signatures of either the
President, or Vice President, or the Executive Secretary (Director) of the Plan
Commission along with the official seal of the Plan Commission, certifying
secondary approval.
      (3)   In the event of disapproval, the Plan Commission shall set out in
the Plan Commission minutes, and attach to a copy of the plat, the reasons for
and specify the aspects of non- conformance with existing ordinances and notify
the subdivider of the same no later than ten days following the date of the
hearing. No plat shall be forwarded to the Commissioners until it has been
approved by the Plan Commission.
      (4)   In instances where the subdivider proposes to construct a common
sewage treatment facility or a common water supply system, or both, the Plan
Commission shall not give secondary plat approval until the State Department of
Environmental Management gives approval to the final engineering and
construction plans for the facility and the Public Service Commission, in the
instance where a common sewage treatment facility is to be constructed, has
granted the subdivider or the appropriate corporation a certificate of
territorial jurisdiction. Furthermore, where the subdivider proposes to
construct a common sewage treatment facility and/or a common water supply
system, the Plat Officer, upon receipt of the construction plans required in §
153.148, shall immediately deliver one copy of each of these plans to the
County Health Officer.
      (5)   In the event secondary approval is denied, because of the
interpretation of data supplied by the United States Department of Agriculture
Soil Conservation Service or because of the recommendation of the State
Department of Environmental Management, the subdivider may request in writing
another hearing at which he or she shall provide additional evidence attesting
to the adequacy of said plat. Said hearing shall be scheduled no later than 62
days after the hearing at which the original secondary plat was denied. Part of
the said additional evidence shall be in the form of a certification from a
professional civil engineer and/or land surveyor registered in the state,
obtained at the subdivider’s costs, stating in effect that he or she, the
engineer, has performed the tests and/or surveys, in the presence of a
representative of, or in a manner meeting the approval of, the body whose
recommendations caused disapproval, necessary to determine that in the
engineer’s opinion, the area in question will provide adequate public health,
safety, convenience, and general welfare of present or future owners of any
lots, parcels, or tracts of the subdivision, providing that all improvements
are installed according to the drawings submitted with the original secondary
plat.
      (6)   The approval of the secondary plat improvements design by the
Commissioners shall be indicated on the original tracing of the plat, to be
filed for record, by the affixing of the signatures of the Commissioners; in
the event of disapproval, the Commissioners shall set out and attach to a copy
of the plat the reasons for and specify the aspects of nonconformance with
existing ordinances and notify the subdivider of the same. A copy of the plat
showing the Commissioners’ action shall be filed in the office of the Plan
Commission.

developer of a subdivision may develop a subdivision as presented at the
primary plat approval stage in phases of lesser size to enable the developer to
construct onsite water, sewer, streets, and other improvements required by this
subchapter in phases that match the phase being sought for secondary approval
and place said improvements upon the real estate prior to requesting secondary
plat approval for that phase. The number and size of lots to be encompassed
with any phase shall be at the option of the developer subject to Plan
Commission approval and it is contemplated that all improvements required for
that phase shall be installed and located upon the real estate affected by that
phase prior to the granting of secondary plat approval after which time the
plat for that phase may be recorded and transfers of title may be sought
subject to the recording of said secondary plat. In no case shall a certificate
of occupancy be issued if the required streets and utilities are not installed
to serve the affected lot being sold.

§ 153.161 MINIMUM DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   The subdivider shall conform to the following principles and
standards of land subdivision in the design of each subdivision or portion
thereof which has not been officially recorded in the office of the Recorder of
the county on or before the effective date of this subchapter.
      (2)   The design standards will encourage good development patterns and
particularly the principles and standards which are generally exhibited on a
map or maps developed and maintained by the Plat Officer in consultation with
the County Highway Department. All proposed arterial thoroughfare locations as
shown on such maps are recommendations only and shall not be used in
determining the acceptability of a proposed subdivision. Every subdivision
designed shall be in harmony with all applicable sections of the current Zoning
Ordinance for the county.
   (B)   Streets.
      (1)   The street and alley layout shall provide access to all lots and
parcels of land within the subdivision. Street jogs of less than 125 feet shall
be avoided. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 500 feet in length, unless
necessitated by prevailing conditions which create undue hardship, said
hardship to be determined by the Plan Commission upon adequate showing by the
subdivider.
      (2)   Local streets shall be designed so as to discourage through
traffic.
      (3)   Proposed streets shall be adjusted to the contour of the land so as
to produce usable lots and streets of reasonable gradient.
      (4)   Certain proposed streets, where appropriate, shall be extended to
the boundary of the tract to be subdivided so as to provide for normal
circulation of traffic within the vicinity.
      (5)   Wherever there exists a dedicated or platted portion of a street or
alley adjacent to the proposed subdivision, the remainder of the street or
alley shall be platted to the width herein prescribed within the proposed
subdivision, unless the Plan Commission finds it unnecessary.
      (6)   Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited
except where their control is definitely placed with the Board under conditions
approved by the Plan Commission.
      (7)   Widths of street rights-of-way shall conform to the widths
specified by the County Highway Department, attached hereto and made a part of
this subchapter. These widths may be increased, or decreased, or varied in
usual circumstances by the Plan Commission and the County Surveyor or appointed
official.
      (8)   Half streets shall not be permitted.
      (9)   No dead end street shall be permitted where the same is in conflict
with the Master Plan. Temporary dead end streets will be permitted where the
approved primary plat shows that the street will be extended to conform to the
provisions of this subchapter and/or to provide access to adjacent property
where deemed necessary by the Plan Commission to provide for adequate flow of
future traffic, provided the length of said dead end shall be not greater than
250 feet. A circular right-of-way in excess of the required street right-of-way
at the termination of a dead end street shall not be required.
      (10)   Subdivisions that adjoin or include existing streets that do not
conform to the required widths shall dedicate the adequate width along either
side or both sides of said street so said street shall be in conformity with
all provisions of this chapter.
      (11)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly at the
right angles as possible.
      (12)   If the smaller angle of intersection of two streets is less than
60 degrees, the radius of the arc of the intersection of the property lines
shall be as deemed advisable by the Plan Commission.
      (13)   (a)   At the intersection of two streets, the property line
corners shall be rounded by arcs with radii of not less than 20 feet or radius
of such arcs.
         (b)   When one or more of the streets involved in an intersection is a
limited access street, highway, thoroughfare, boulevard, or parkway, the
foregoing minimum standards may be increased by the Plan Commission.
      (14)   At the intersection of a street with an alley, the property line
corners shall be rounded by arcs with radii of not less than 15 feet or radius
of such arcs.
      (15)   Intersection of more than two streets at one point shall be
avoided.
      (16)   Where parkways or special types of streets are involved, the Plan
Commission may apply special standards to be followed in the design of such
parkways or streets.
      (17)   Whenever the subdivision contains or is adjacent to a railroad
right-of-way or a highway designated as a “limited access highway” by the
appropriate highway authorities, provision shall be made for a marginal access
street, or a parallel street at a distance acceptable for the appropriate use
of the land between the highway or railroad and such streets.
      (18)   Horizontal visibility on curved streets and vertical visibility on
all streets shall be maintained along the center lines as specified by the
County Highway Department.
      (19)   Horizontal curvature measured along the center line shall have a
minimum radius as specified by the County Highway Department.
      (20)   All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves of
sufficient radii to provide smooth transitions and required sight distances.
      (21)   Between reversed curves on all streets, there shall be a minimum
tangent as specified by the County Highway Department.
      (22)   Maximum grades for streets shall be as specified by the County
Highway Department.
      (23)   The minimum grade of any street gutter shall not be less than
0.25%.
      (24)   No street shall have a name which will duplicate or so nearly
duplicate as to be confused with the name of an existing street within the
county; unless a proposed street is an extension of or in alignment with
existing streets, in which case the duplication shall be mandatory. In no
instance shall any street name include the word “North,” “South,” “East,” or
“West” unless it denotes that geographical direction.
      (25)   Alleys shall be discouraged in residential areas but shall be
included in commercial and industrial areas where needed for loading and
unloading or access purposes; and, where platted, shall be at least 20 feet in
width.
      (26)   Dead end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but, if
unavoidable, shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead
end, as determined by the Plan Commission.
   (C)   Blocks.
      (1)   Blocks shall not normally exceed 1,320 feet in length, unless
unusual circumstances justify greater length.
      (2)   Blocks shall be of sufficient width to permit two tiers of lots of
appropriate depth, except where an interior street parallels a limited access
highway, major street, or railroad right-of-way.
      (3)   No other specific rule is made concerning the shape of blocks, but
blocks shall fit easily into the overall plan of the subdivision, and their
design must evidence consideration of lot planning, traffic, flow, and public
areas.
      (4)   Within blocks of over 700 feet in length, the Plan Commission may
require, at or near the middle of the block, a public walk connecting adjacent
streets or other public areas, shopping centers, and the like. Width of right-
of-way for such walks shall be at least ten feet and shall be intended for the
use of pedestrians only.
   (D)   Lots.
      (1)   All lots shall abut on a street which is accessible to an
established public street already in use.
      (2)   Side lines of lots shall be at approximately right angles to
straight streets and on radial lines on curved streets. Some variation from
this rule is permissible, but pointed or very irregular lots shall be avoided.
      (3)   Double frontage lots shall not be platted, except that where
desired among primary or secondary streets, lots may face on an interior street
and back on such thoroughfare. In that event, a planting strip, or a planting
screen, at least 20 feet in width shall be provided along the rear of the lot,
and the design shall be such that access to those lots shall be only from an
interior street.
      (4)   Lot dimensions, areas, and building setback lines shall conform to
and be not less than the minimum specified by the County Zoning Ordinance, as
now or hereafter amended, for the district in which the lot is located; except
where a main water supply system or a sanitary system is not available, and the
lot area necessary to adequately provide for the efficient operation of a
private water supply and/or sewage disposal system on the lot, would be
greater, to be in accord with the County Board of Health and/or the State
Department of Environmental Management, then their area recommendation shall
become the minimum lot area.
      (5)   Wherever possible, a unit shopping center, based on sound
development standards, should be designed in contrast to the platting of lots
for individual commercial use.
      (6)   Corner residential lots should be wider than normal to permit
appropriate setbacks from both streets. Interior residential lots abutting a
corner lot should be wider than the average interior lot in order to permit a
wider side yard adjacent to the corner lot.
      (7)   Residential lots fronting on arterial, primary, or secondary
streets shall have extra depth to permit deeper building setbacks from such
traffic arteries, as specified by the Zoning Ordinance.
   (E)   Utility easements.
      (1)   Where alleys are not provided, easements for utilities shall be
provided. Such easements shall have a minimum width of 15 feet, and where
located along interior lot lines, one-half the width should be taken from each
lot. Before determining the location of easements, the plan shall be discussed
with the local utility companies to assure the proper placing for the
installation of services.
      (2)   Whenever a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way,
channel, or stream, there shall be provided a drainage right-of-way which shall
be for the purpose of widening, improving, or protecting the stream at the
subdivider’s expense. To ensure proper drainage right-of-way width, the
following requirements shall be incorporated in the plat.
         (a)   In order to protect stream banks and/or located tile and allow
for maintenance, an easement of 75 feet or more, as may be required by the
County Surveyor, measured from the normal high bank on each bank of any ditch
or creek, or centerline of located tile shall be provided.
         (b)   In order to protect riverbanks and allow for maintenance, an
easement of 75 feet (or more as may be required by the County Surveyor),
measured from the normal high bank on each bank of any river shall be provided.
         (c)   In order to allow for the creation of a new channel or drainage
way, relocation of an existing channel, an easement of 100 feet (or more as may
be required by the County Surveyor), measured from the normal high bank on both
sides of said proposed channel shall be provided.
         (d)   The width of the drainage rights-of-way shall be adequate for
any necessary channel relocations and straightenings and to determine adequacy,
the drainage right-of-way shall be reviewed by the County Drainage Board. The
drainage right-of-way shall relate as closely as possible to the requirements
of the Master Plan. Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection
therewith.
      (3)   A guy line easement of sufficient width and length, as determined
by the utility company, shall be provided. Said easement length shall be
measured from the apex of the deflection angle.
   (F)   Ingress/egress easements. Where an easement is desired or necessary to
serve a property not adjacent to a public road, the width of said ingress/
egress easement or the deeded portion of the lot which serves as ingress and
egress to said parcel shall be a minimum of 30 feet in width if the same
services one lot. In the case of ingress/egress ways serving more than one lot,
the minimum width shall be 60 feet.
   (G)   Public use areas. Where sites for parks, schools, playgrounds, or
other public use areas, as shown in the Master Plan, or recreational space as
required by §
153.088(F) are located within the subdivision area, the Plan Commission shall
require that such areas be so designated on the secondary plat. (See §
153.088(F).)
   (H)   Topography, natural vegetation, and flooding.
      (1)   In the subdividing of any land within the jurisdiction, due regard
shall be shown for all natural features, such as tree growth, watercourses, or
other similar elements which, if preserved, would add attractiveness to the
proposed development.
      (2)   The natural topography shall be retained wherever possible in order
to reduce excessive runoff onto adjoining property and to avoid extensive
regrading of the site.
      (3)   Floor elevations of all buildings shall be carefully studied in
relation to existing 12-inch and larger caliper trees, and other pertinent site
features.
      (4)   Consideration shall be given to varying the setback line required
in the zoning district where the subdivision is proposed in order to retain
wherever possible existing topography, rock formations, and large trees.
Consideration shall be given only after the Board of Zoning Appeals has granted
a building line variance for the affected subdivision.
      (5)   Where there is a question as to the suitability of a lot or lots
for their intended use due to factors such as rock formations, flood
conditions, or similar circumstances, the Plan Commission shall consider
withholding approval of such lots.
      (6)   The Plat Officer shall review all proposed subdivisions to
determine whether the subdivision lies in a flood prone area as defined in §§
153.105 through
153.129. If the Plat Officer finds the subdivision to be so located, the Plan
Commission shall forward pertinent plans and materials to the State Department
of Natural Resources for review and comment. The Plat Officer or Plan
Commission may require appropriate changes and modifications to the subdivision
proposal in order to comply with the requirements of §§
153.105 through
153.129.
      (7)   All subdivision plats containing lands identified elsewhere by
ordinance as flood prone areas shall have the elevation of the 100-year flood
listed thereon.

§ 153.162 IMPROVEMENT REGULATIONS.
   (A)   General. Utility and street improvements shall be provided by the
subdivider in each new subdivision in accordance with the standards and
requirements described in the following sections.
   (B)   Streets, street lighting, and signs.
      (1)   Streets shall be completed in accordance with the plans, profiles,
specifications, and cross-sections prepared for the subdivider by a
professional civil engineer and/or registered land surveyor duly registered in
the state and as approved by the County Highway Supervisor or Highway Engineer,
or appointed officials. In no event shall any street plan be approved unless
the entire improvement width is proposed to be installed within the proposed
subdivision.
         (a)   The streets shall be surfaced to a minimum width according to
the type of street, as specified by the County Highway Department.
         (b)   Curb and gutter shall not be permitted to be installed along the
edges of streets having a total improvement width of less than 27 feet, except
in the case of marginal access streets. However, curb and gutters shall be
installed in conformity with specification provided by the County Highway
Department.
         (c)   The streets shall be graded, surfaced, and improved to the
dimensions required by the cross-sections, and the work shall be performed in

         (d)   The street surface shall be of concrete or a flexible pavement
and shall be constructed in accordance with design characteristics at least
equal to those specified by the County Highway Department.
         (e)   Prior to the construction of street or alley pavements, adequate
surface and subsurface (if required) drainage shall be installed by the
subdivider. Pipe used for drainage purposes shall be of a treated corrugated
metal, reinforced concrete, or extra strength vitrified clay of an approved
design, size, and strength to meet the requirements of the specific conditions
which may be encountered. Minimum diameters of pipe to be used shall meet the
requirements of the specific conditions which may be encountered, and shall be
approved by the County Highway Supervisor or Engineer, or appointed official.
         (f)   All construction shall be completed in accordance with the
specific conditions in the agreement for improvements and the accepted plans
and specifications, and in a manner acceptable to the authorities having
jurisdiction. When changes from the accepted plans and specifications become
necessary during construction, written approval from the authorities having
jurisdiction shall be secured prior to the execution of such changes and four
copies of the approved revised drawings shall be submitted to the Plat Officer
for distribution.
         (g)   Adequate provision shall be made for the continuous maintenance
of all street improvements by dedication to and acceptance by the Board of
Commissioners as provided in §§
153.160(D) and
153.164(B).
      (2)   Provisions for easements shall be made by the subdivider for the
future lighting of public streets within the subdivision in accordance with the

      (3)   (a)   Appropriate metallic street signs and guide and regulatory
signs with reflectorized lettering mounted on metallic posts and as specified
by the county shall be installed by the subdivider at all street intersections
on diagonally opposite corners so that they will be on the far right-hand side
of the intersection for traffic on the more important streets. Signs indicating
both streets shall be erected at each location mounted as close to the corner
as practical, facing traffic on the cross street, with the nearest portion of
each sign not less than one foot nor more than ten feet back from the curb
line.
         (b)   Before the secondary plat is approved, the subdivider shall
submit to the Plan Commission a statement from the local postmaster approving
the names of the proposed streets and of the proposed systems of postal address
along such streets.
   (C)   Curbs and gutters.
      (1)   Concrete curb and gutter shall be provided along the outside edge
of all street pavements in subdivisions where the density of development is one
and one-half lots per gross acre or greater.
      (2)   Curbs and gutters, if necessary, shall be installed by the
subdivider in compliance with the approved plans, profiles, and cross-sections.
They shall be constructed of concrete, and they shall be at least 24 inches
wide and not less than six inches thick where the curb abuts the street
pavement.
      (3)   Curbs and gutters shall be constructed in conjunction with the
street pavements on all streets where parking is to be permitted.
      (4)   Curb construction for concrete pavements shall be integral. Roll-
type curbs shall be permitted where the distance between the back of the curb
and the nearest sidewalk is at least three feet on residential and feeder
streets.
      (5)   All plans for the installation of the curb and gutter shall conform
to all applicable sections of this subchapter and shall be approved by the
County Highway Supervisor or Highway Engineer, the Plan Commission, and the
Board of Commissioners prior to the installation.
   (D)   Sidewalks.
      (1)   Sidewalks on each side of a street shall be provided within a
subdivision when the major subdivision averages two lots or more per gross
acre. Sidewalks on both sides of the street shall be provided within a major
subdivision when the subdivision averages less than two lots per gross acre,
provided, however, the Plan Commission may waive the above requirements in
those subdivisions with less than two lots per gross acre and only upon showing
by the developer that the sidewalks will serve no specific purpose or future
need. Sidewalks shall be of cement concrete with a minimum thickness of four
inches with six-by-six #10 wire mesh or three-eighths of an inch metal
reinforcement rod 18 inches on center both ways on a four foot, and the edge of
walks adjacent to the property line of the street shall be placed at least one
foot from the property line within the street right-of-way.
      (2)   Crosswalks within the blocks shall be improved with a four-foot
walk of either concrete four inches thick or four-inch compacted aggregate
base. The base should be extended beyond sidewalk on either side to a distance
equal to depth of base.
      (3)   If for any reason sidewalks are not provided, the street grade
shall be completed so that the minimum amount of additional grading would be
necessary for any future provisions of sidewalks.
   (E)   Sewage disposal. The developer shall install or cause to be installed
a system for the disposal of sanitary sewage in the subdivision by one of the
following means.
      (1)   A complete sanitary sewer system which shall convey the sewage into
an established municipal or other public agency sanitary sewage disposal and
treatment system, at a point and in a manner approved in writing by the
municipal or other public agency involved. The plans for the complete
installation of the sewage system showing all locations, material, size,
profiles, and any connections thereto shall be prepared by a registered
engineer and/or registered land surveyor at the expense of the subdivider or
developer and shall be approved by and meet the requirements of the affected
municipal or other public agency and the County Board of Health and State
Department of Environmental Management.
      (2)   (a)   A complete sanitary sewage system to convey the sewage to a
treatment plant provided by the developers or others in accordance with the
requirements of the County Board of Health or the State Department of
Environmental Management.
         (b)   A complete sanitary sewer system which shall connect into the
sanitary sewage disposal system of a sewage disposal company which shall hold,
at the time of plat submission, a certificate of territorial authority issued
by the Public Service Commission of the state authorizing such sewage disposal
service for the area in which the subdivision is located. The plans for the
complete installation of the sewer system both within the subdivision and any
off-site installations serving said subdivision showing all locations, size,
material, profiles, and capacities, shall be submitted to and approved by the
County Board of Health and/or the State Department of Environmental Management.
         (c)   If the developer submits proper evidence to the County Health
Department that neither of the above forms of sewage disposal and treatment is
possible or economically feasible, then the developer shall be permitted to use
a private sanitary sewage disposal system on each individual lot when installed
in accordance with the design standards and approval of the County Board of

grant smaller lot minimum sizes than those in division (L)(2) above, provided
that the sanitary systems are approved by the County Board of Health and/or the
State Department of Environmental Management, or appointed official, that the
overall density does not exceed that permitted within the zoning district in
which the land occurs or that the layout is not detrimental to the health and
general welfare of the community.
      (4)   (a)   The balance of the land not contained in the lots or within
the road rights-of-way shall be contiguous and of such condition, size, and
shape as to be usable for recreation. Such land shall be held in corporate
ownership by the owners of lots within the development, and the developer shall
incorporate into the deeds of all property within the development a clause
giving to the owners an interest in such open land which shall be used for
recreational purposes only. (No structure except those incidental to the
recreational use shall be permitted thereon.)
         (b)   Open land shall be a minimum of one and one-half acres (and

relocating, lining and significant removal of bottom or woody vegetation.
CHANNEL MODIFICATION does not include the clearing of dead or dying vegetation,
debris, or trash from the channel. CHANNELIZATION is a severe form of channel
modification typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g.,
straightening).
   COMPENSATORY STORAGE. An excavated volume of storage within a floodplain
used to balance the loss of natural flood storage capacity when fill or

under a roadway, railroad, canal, or other impediment.
   CURVE NUMBER (CN). The Soil Conservation Service index that represents the
combined hydrologic effect of soil, land use, land cover, hydrologic condition,
and antecedent runoff condition.
   DAM. All obstructions, wall embankments, or barriers, together with any
abutments and appurtenant works, constructed to store, direct water, or create
a pool (not including underground water storage tanks).
   DAMAGE. Measurable rise in flood heights on buildings currently subject to
flooding, flooding of buildings currently not subject to flooding, and
increases in volume or velocity to the point where the rate of land lost to
erosion and scour is substantially increased.

application of this subchapter.
   (B)   The release rate of stormwater from developments and redevelopments
may not exceed the peak five-year return period stormwater runoff from the land
area in its present state of development.
   (C)   The developer shall submit to the County Surveyor and the County
Drainage Board detailed computations of runoff before and after development or

§ 153.192 RUNOFF QUANTITIES.
   (A)   Runoff quantities shall be computed for the area of the parcel under
development plus the area of the watershed flowing into the parcel under
development. The quantity of runoff which is generated as the result of a given
rainfall intensity shall be computed by a method, as approved by the County
Surveyor.
   (B)   Various parts of a drainage facility shall accommodate runoff water as
follows:
      (1)   The minor drainage system such as inlets, catch basins, street
gutters, swales, sewers, and small channels which collect stormwater shall
accommodate, at a minimum, peak runoff from a ten-year return frequency storm.
      (2)   These minimum requirements shall be satisfied:
         (a)   The allowable spread of water on collector streets is limited to
maintaining two clear ten-foot moving lanes of traffic. One lane is to be
maintained on local roads, while other access lanes (such as a subdivision cul-
de-sac) can have a water spread equal to one-half of their total width.

§ 153.194 STORM SEWER DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Design standards.
      (1)   All storm sewers, whether private or public, and whether
constructed on private or public property, shall conform to the design
standards and other requirements contained herein.
      (2)   The minimum diameter of all storm sewers shall be 12 inches. The
rate of release for detention storage shall be controlled by an orifice plate
or other device, subject to approval of the Drainage Board, when the minimum
12-inch diameter pipe will not limit the rate of release to the required
amount.
      (3)   Sewer grade shall be such that, in general, a minimum of one and
one-half feet of cover is maintained over the top of the pipe. If the pipe is
to be placed under pavement, then the minimum pipe cover shall be two feet.
Pipe cover less than the minimum may be used only upon approval of the Drainage
Board. All pipe crossings involving a county highway, street, or road shall
require the approval of the County Engineer. Uniform slopes shall be maintained
between inlets, manholes, and inlets to manholes. Final grade shall be set with
full consideration of the capacity required, sedimentation problems, and other
design parameters. Minimum and maximum allowable slopes shall be those capable
of producing velocities of between two and one-half and 15 feet per second,
respectively, when the sewer is flowing full.
      (4)   Storm sewers shall be straight between manholes.
      (5)   Manholes shall be installed to provide access to continuous
underground storm sewers for the purpose of inspection and maintenance.
Manholes shall be provided at the following locations:
         (a)   Where two or more storm sewers converge;
         (b)   Where pipe size changes;
         (c)   Where a change in horizontal alignment occurs;
         (d)   Where a change in grade occurs; and
         (e)   At intervals in straight sections of sewer, not to exceed the
maximum allowed.
      (6)   The maximum distance between storm sewer manholes shall be as
follows:
 
Size of Pipe (Inches) Maximum Distance (Feet)
12 through 42         400
48 and larger         600
 
      (7)   Inlets or drainage structures shall be utilized to collect surface
water through grated openings and convey it to storm sewers, channels, or
culverts. The inlet grate opening provided shall be adequate to pass the
culverts. The inlet grate opening provided shall be adequate to pass the design
ten-year flow with 50% of the sag inlet areas clogged. An overload channel from
sag inlets to the overflow channel or basin shall be provided at sag inlets, so
that the maximum depth of water that might be ponded in the street sag shall
not exceed seven inches. Inlet design and spacing may be done using the
hydraulic equations by manufacturers or orifice/weir equations. Gutter spread
on continuous grades may be determined using equations or methods approved by
the County Surveyor.
   (B)   Workmanship and materials.
      (1)   The specifications for the construction of storm sewers shall not
be less stringent than those set forth in the latest edition of the State
Department of Transportation “Standard Specifications.” Additionally, ductile
iron pipe shall be laid in accordance with American Water Works Association
(AWWA) C-600 and clap pipe shall be laid in accordance with either American
Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) C-12 or the appropriate American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO)
specifications.
      (2)   (a)   Storm sewer manholes and inlets shall be constructed of
masonry, cast in place concrete, or precast reinforced concrete. Material and
construction shall conform to the State Department of Transportation “Standard
Specifications,” § 720.
         (b)   Pipe and fittings used in storm sewer construction shall be
extra-strength clay pipe (ASTM C-76). Other pipe and fittings not specified
herein may be used only when specifically authorized by the Drainage Board.
Pipe joints shall be flexible and watertight and shall conform to the
requirements of § 715.02 - Materials, of the latest edition of the State
Department of Transportation “Standard Specifications.”
         (c)   Special hydraulic structures required to control the flow of
water in storm runoff drainage systems include junction chambers, drop
manholes, inverted siphons, stilling basins, and other special structures. The
use of these structures shall be limited to those locations justified by
prudent planning and by careful and thorough hydraulic engineering analysis.

§ 153.195 OPEN CHANNEL DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Design standards.
      (1)   All open channels, whether private or public, and whether
constructed on private or public land, shall conform to the design standards
requirements of the County Surveyor.
      (2)   The required channel cross-section and grade are determined by the
design capacity, the material in which the channel is to be constructed, and
the requirements for maintenance. A minimum depth may be required to provide
adequate outlets for subsurface drains, tributary ditches, or streams. The
channel grade shall be such that the velocity in the channel is high enough to
prevent siltation but low enough to prevent erosion. Velocities less than one
and one-half feet per second should be avoided since siltation will take place
and ultimately reduce the channel cross-section. The maximum permissible
velocities in vegetal-lined channels are shown in Table 1. Developments through
which the channel is to be constructed shall be considered in the design of the
channel section.
      (3)   Earthen channel side slopes shall be no steeper than two horizontal
to one vertical. Flatter slopes may be required to prevent erosion and for ease
of maintenance. Where channels will be lined, side slopes shall be no steeper
than one and one-half horizontal to one vertical with adequate provisions made
for weep holes. Side slopes steeper than one and one-half horizontal to one
vertical may be used for lined channels, provided that the sidelining is
designed and constructed as a structural retaining wall with provisions for
live and dead load surcharge.

is greater. In no case shall it be necessary to check channel stability for
discharges greater than that from a 100-year frequency storm.
      (5)   Vegetated waterways that are subject to low flows of long duration
or where wet conditions prevail shall be drained with a tile system or by other
means such as paved gutters. Tile lines may be outletted through a drop
structure at the ends of the waterway or through a standard tile outlet.
      (6)   When the Drainage Board determines it is necessary to establish a
new regulated drain, each developer shall provide the necessary information and
meet the requirements of the 1965 Indiana Drainage Code, being I.C. 36-9-27, as
amended, for the establishment of a new regulated drain. The Drainage Board
shall determine necessary easements for adequate maintenance of any new
regulated drain.
      (7)   (a)   The design of channels will include provisions for operation
and maintenance and the proper functioning of all channels, laterals,
travelways, and structures associated with the project. Recessed inlets and
structures needed for entry of surface and subsurface flow into channels
without significant erosion or degradation shall be included in the design of
channel improvements. The design will also provide for necessary flood gates,
water level control devices, and any other appurtenance structure affecting the
functioning of the channels and the attainment of the purpose for which they
are built.
         (b)   The effects of channel improvements on existing culverts,
bridges, buried cables, pipelines, and inlet structures for surface and
subsurface drainage on the channel being improved and laterals thereto shall be
evaluated to determine the need for modification or replacement. Culverts and
bridges which are modified or added as part of channel improvement projects
shall meet reasonable standards for the type of structure and shall have a
minimum capacity equal to the design discharge or governmental agency design
requirements, whichever is greater.
      (8)   Spoil material resulting from clearing, grubbing, and channel
excavation shall be disposed of in such a manner which will:
         (a)   Minimize overbank wash;
         (b)   Provide for the free flow of water between the channel and
floodplain boundary unless the valley routing and water surface profiles are
based on continuous dikes being installed;
         (c)   Not hinder the development of travelways for maintenance;
         (d)   Leave the right-of-way in the best condition feasible,
consistent with the project purposes, for productive use by the owner;
         (e)   Improve the aesthetic appearance of the site to the extent
feasible; and
         (f)   Be approved by the IDNR or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(whichever is applicable), if deposited in the floodway.

§ 153.196 STORMWATER DETENTION.
   The following shall govern the design of any improvement with respect to the
detention of stormwater runoff.
   (A)   Acceptable detention methods. The increased stormwater runoff
resulting from a proposed development should be detained onsite by the
provisions of appropriate wet bottom retention or dry bottom detention
facilities, storage on flat roofs, parking lots, streets, lawns, or other
acceptable techniques. Measures which retard the rate of overland flow and the
velocity in runoff channels shall also be used to partially control runoff
rates. Detention/retention facilities shall be sized to store excess flows from
storms with a 100-year return period. Control devices shall limit the discharge
to a rate no greater than that prescribed by this subchapter.
   (B)   Design storm. Design of stormwater detention/retention facilities
shall be based on a storm with a 1% chance of occurrence every year, also know
as a 100-year storm. The storage volume and outflow rate shall be sufficient to
handle stormwater runoff from a 24-hour duration storm.
   (C)   Allowable release rate.
      (1)   Only methods approved by the County Surveyor shall be used to
determine the five-year return period pre-development release rate for
development sites controlled by this subchapter.
      (2)   In the event the natural downstream channel or storm sewer system
is inadequate to accommodate the release rate provided above, then the
allowable release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted by the capacity
of the receiving downstream channel or storm sewer system and additional
detention as determined by the County Surveyor.
      (3)   If more than one detention/retention facility is involved in the
development of the area upstream of the limiting restriction, the allowable
release rate off of the site from any one detention basin shall be in direct
proportion to the ratio of its drainage area to the drainage area of the entire
watershed upstream of the restriction.
   (D)   Drainage system overflow design. Drainage systems, including all
ditches, channels, conduits, swales, and the like, shall have adequate capacity
to convey the stormwater runoff from all upstream tributary areas (offsite land
areas) through the development under consideration for a 100-year return period
design storm calculated on the basis of the upstream land in its present state
of development. Swales between privately owned residential lots shall not be
used to convey the above referenced stormwater runoff unless the discharge
paths are confined within the drainage easements and/or common areas. An
allowance, equivalent to the reduction in flow rate provided, may be made for
upstream detention when such upstream detention and release rate have
previously been approved by the Drainage Board and evidence of its construction
and maintenance can be shown.
   (E)   Acceptable outlet.
      (1)   Design and construction of the stormwater facility shall provide
for the discharge of the stormwater runoff from offsite land areas as well as
the stormwater from the area being developed (onsite land areas) to an
acceptable outlet(s) having capacity to receive upstream (offsite) and onsite
drainage.
      (2)   The acceptable outlet for stormwater discharge shall be a regulated
open (ditch) drain or a “Blue Line” open drain as shown on the USGS Quadrangle
Maps. “Blue Line” open drains shall have adequate available capacity to handle
design runoff; Roadside ditches may be acceptable provided permission is
granted from right-of-way owner, roadside ditch is in a maintained condition,
and the outlet for the roadside ditch is a regulated open drain or “Blue Line”
open drain.
      (3)   In case of extreme hardship, the Drainage Board has final authority
over the acceptable outlet.
      (4)   Where the outfall from the stormwater drainage system of any
developer flows through real estate owned by others prior to reaching a
regulated drain or natural waterway, no approval shall be granted for such
stormwater drainage system until all impacted owners consent in writing to such
use of their real estate or are notified of such use in writing of a hearing by
the Drainage Board to review such use. The notification shall include the time
and place of a hearing and be delivered, either personally or by certified
mail, at least five days prior to the hearing thereon, and proof of such notice
to each landowner shall be filed with the Drainage Board prior to such hearing,
which proof shall be by affidavit.
   (F)   Determination of storage volume. The required volume of stormwater
storage for development sites shall be approved by the County Surveyor.
   (G)   General detention basin design requirements. Basins shall be
constructed to temporarily detain the stormwater runoff which exceeds the
maximum peak release rate authorized by this subchapter. The volume of storage
provided in these basins, together with such storage as may be authorized in
other onsite facilities shall be sufficient to control excess runoff from the
100-year storm. The following design principles shall be observed.
      (1)   The maximum volume of water stored and subsequently released at the
design release rate shall not result in a storage duration in excess of 48
hours from the start of the storm unless additional storms occur within the
period.
      (2)   All stormwater detention facilities shall be separated by not less
than 25 feet from any building or structure to be occupied.
      (3)   All excavated excess spoil to be spread onsite shall be spread so
as to provide for aesthetic and recreational features such as sledding hills,
sports fields, decorative mounds, and the like. Slopes no steeper than six
horizontal to one vertical for safety, erosion control, stability, and ease of
maintenance shall be permitted.
      (4)   Safety screens having a maximum opening of four inches shall be
provided for any pipe or opening to prevent children or large animals from
crawling into the structures.
      (5)   Outlet control structures shall be designed to operate as simply as
possible and shall require little or no maintenance and/or attention for proper
operation. They shall limit discharges into existing or planned downstream
channels or conduits so as not to exceed the predetermined maximum authorized
peak flow rate.
      (6)   Emergency overflow facilities such as a weir or spillway shall be
provided for the release of at least 100-year storm runoff (or, if applicable,
the minimum required under the IDNR dam safety criteria) or in emergency
conditions should the normal discharge devices become totally or partially
inoperative. The overflow facility shall be of such design that its operation
is automatic and does not require manual attention.
      (7)   Grass or other suitable vegetative cover shall be provided
throughout the entire detention storage basin area. Grass should be cut
regularly at approximately monthly intervals during the growing season or as
required to maintain the facility.
      (8)   Debris and trash removal and other necessary maintenance shall be
performed on a regular basis to assure continued operation in conformance to
design.
      (9)   Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to substantiate all
design features.
      (10)   No detention facility or other water storage area, permanent or
temporary, shall be constructed under or within ten feet of any pole or high
voltage electric line. Likewise, poles or high voltage electric lines shall not
be placed within ten feet of any detention facility or other water storage
area.
      (11)   No residential lots or any part thereof, shall be used for any
part of a detention basin or for the storage of water, either temporary or
permanent.
   (H)   Dry bottom facility design requirements. Detention facilities which
will not contain a permanent pool of water shall comply with the following
requirements.
      (1)   Provisions shall be incorporated into facilities for complete
interior drainage of dry bottom facilities, including the provisions of natural
grades to outlet structures, longitudinal and transverse grades to perimeter
drainage facility, paved gutters, or the installation of subsurface drains.
      (2)   The detention facility may, whenever possible, be designed to serve
as a secondary or multipurpose function. Recreational facilities, aesthetic
qualities (open spaces), or other types of use shall be considered in planning
the detention facility.
      (3)   In excavated detention facilities, a minimum side slope of three to
one shall be provided for stability. In the case of valley storage, natural
slopes may be considered to be stable.
   (I)   Wet bottom facility design requirements. Where part of a detention
facility will contain a permanent pool of water, all the items required for
detention storage shall apply except that the system of drains with a positive
gravity outlet required to maintain a dry bottom facility will not be required.
A controlled positive outlet will be required to maintain the design water
level in the wet bottom facility and provide required detention storage above
the design water level. However, the following additional conditions shall
apply.
      (1)   Facilities designed with permanent pools or containing permanent
lakes shall, if fish are to be used to keep the pond clean, have a minimum
depth of approximately eight feet over at least 25% of the pond area.
      (2)   In excavated ponds, the underwater side slopes in the lake shall be
stable. In the case of valley storage, natural slopes may be considered to be
stable.
      (3)   A safety ledge four to six feet in width at a slope of five to one
is required and shall be installed in all ponds.
      (4)   Periodic maintenance is required in lakes to control weed and
larval growth. The facility shall also be designed to provide for the easy
removal of sediment which will accumulate during periods of reservoir
operation.
      (5)   For emergency use, facility cleaning, or shoreline maintenance,
additional facilities may have to be provided or plans prepared for auxiliary
equipment to permit emptying and drainage.
   (J)   Rooftop storage. Detention storage requirements may be met in total or
in part by detention on flat roofs. Details of such design to be included in
the building permit application shall include the depth and volume of storage,
details of outlet devices and downdrains, elevations of emergency overflow
provisions, and certification of the structural portion of the building design
plans by a structural engineer.
   (K)   Parking lot storage. Paved parking lots may be designed to provide
temporary detention storage of storm waters on all or a portion of their
surfaces. Outlets will be designed so as to empty the stored waters slowly.
Depths of storage shall be limited to a maximum depth of seven inches so as to
prevent damage to parked vehicles and so that access to parked vehicles is not
impaired. Ponding should in general be confined to those positions of the
parking lots farthest from the area served.
   (L)   Facility financial responsibilities. The construction cost of
stormwater control systems and required facilities which are identified in the
Stormwater Ordinance of the county shall be accepted as part of the cost of
land development.
   (M)   Facility maintenance responsibilities. Maintenance of detention/
retention facilities during construction and thereafter, shall be the
responsibility of the land developer/owner. Assignment of responsibility for
maintaining facilities serving more than one lot or holding shall be documented
by appropriate covenants to property deeds, unless responsibility is formally
accepted by a public body, and shall be determined before the final drainage
plans are approved.
   (N) Inspections. All public and privately owned detention storage facilities
may be inspected during construction by representatives of the county.
   (O)   Corrective measures. If deficiencies are found by the inspector prior
to final approval of the drainage facility, the owner of the detention/
retention facility will be required to take the necessary measurements to
correct such deficiencies. If the owner fails to do so, the Drainage Board will
undertake the work and collect the cost of maintenance or repair from the owner
using lien rights if necessary.
   (P)   Joint development of control systems. Stormwater control systems may
be planned and constructed jointly by two or more developers as long as
compliance with this subchapter is maintained.
   (Q)   Detention facilities in floodplains. If detention storage is provided
within a 100-year floodplain, only the net increase in storage volume above
that which naturally existed on the floodplain shall be credited to the
development. No credit will be granted for volumes below the elevation of the
regulatory flood at the location unless compensatory storage is also provided.
