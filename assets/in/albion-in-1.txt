titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the “Town of

previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to

originally enacted, or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered
by the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official

are for organizational purposes only, and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only, and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)

usual sense. Technical words and phrases having a peculiar and appropriate

construed as imputing authority to a majority of these persons, unless
otherwise declared in the section giving the authority.
      (3)   Where a section requires an act to be done which, by law, an agent
or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.
      (4)   Words denoting the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the
feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,
and words in the plural shall include the singular; the use of a verb in the

not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid section
or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is severable.
If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or

member of the Police Department evidence of his or her identity and right to
possession of the vehicle, sign a receipt for its return, pay the cost of

§ 34.18 SNOW AND ICE CLEARING FROM FIRE HYDRANTS REQUIRED.
   (A)   The occupant of any premises located within the town or the owner of
any unoccupied premises within said town, when removing or clearing snow and
ice from their premises, are hereby prohibited from causing or allowing snow or
ice to be deposited against or around fire hydrants in such a way as to
obstruct or hinder immediate access to said fire hydrants in the event of fire
or public emergency requiring their use. The word OCCUPANT, as used in this
section, shall be deemed to mean the person occupying for business, residence
or other purposes the first floor of any building situated on the premises so
occupied; and if the first floor of any building is not occupied, then such
premises shall be deemed and held to be unoccupied and the owner or lessee of
the entire premises shall be required to keep said fire hydrants cleared from
snow and ice.
   (B)   Each 24-hour period shall be treated separately for consideration of
whether or not this section has been violated, and therefore separate
violations may occur in separate 24-hour periods.
   (C)   Any person violating this section shall, upon conviction, be fined the
sum of $300, provided however that in the event that said ordinance violation
is admitted before the Ordinance Violation Bureau on or before 30 days from the

(Ord. 2003-02, passed 3-25-03)
§ 34.19 DECLARATION OF SNOW EMERGENCY.
   (A)   Title. This section shall be known as the snow emergency ordinance for
the town and shall apply to all streets, alleys or right-of-ways maintained by
the Town Street Department.
   (B)   Procedure. 
      (1)   The Town Council President, after consultation with the Town
Council members, the Town Manager, the Town Marshal, and the Street
Superintendent, if available, or the respective representative designated by
each as the person to consult in his or her absence for the purpose of
recommending a snow emergency declaration, may declare a snow emergency by
executive order when, in the President’s judgment, such order would be in the
best interest of the public safety and welfare of the residents in the town.
      (2)   If the Council President is not available, any Council member may
declare a snow emergency if at least two of the above-mentioned officials (or
the respective designated representatives of each) also recommend a
declaration.
      (3)   If no Council members are available to declare a snow emergency,
then all three of the above-mentioned officials (or the respective designated
representatives of each) may declare a snow emergency.
      (4)   The above-mentioned officials or their respective designees who
declare a snow emergency shall designate whether it is a Level 1 (declared)
Snow Emergency, a Level 2 (Warning) Snow Emergency or a Level 3 (Watch) Snow
Emergency, based on the criteria set forth in division (C) below.
      (5)   Such emergency shall continue in effect until the above-mentioned
officials or their respective designees who declared the emergency thereafter
determine an emergency no longer exists and terminate the emergency order.
   (C)   Levels defined. A snow emergency declaration pursuant to this section
shall consist of three levels in order to keep the residents in the town
informed of the weather and town street conditions, and to assist the Street
Department in the clearing of municipal streets by eliminating stranded
vehicles:
 
      (1) Snow Emergency "Advisory" (formerly referred to as Level 3 -
Yellow).  ADVISORY, the lowest level of local travel advisory, means that
routine travel or activities may be restricted in areas of the town because of
a hazardous situation; and individuals should use caution or avoid those areas.
 
      (2)   Snow Emergency "Watch" (formerly referred to as Level 2 -
Orange).  WATCH means that conditions are threatening to the safety of the
public. During a "watch" local travel advisory, only essential travel such as
to and from work or in emergency situations, is recommended, and emergency
 
 
 
 
2012 S-4
30B   Albion - Administration
 
 
action plans should be implemented by businesses, schools, government agencies
and other organizations.
 
      (3)   Snow Emergency "Warning" (formerly referred to as Level 1 -
Red).  WARNING, the highest level of local travel advisory, means that travel
may be restricted to emergency management workers only. During a "warning"
local travel advisory, individuals are directed to:
 
         (a)   Refrain from all travel;
 
         (b)   Comply with necessary emergency measures;
 
         (c)   Cooperate with public officials and disaster services forces in
executing emergency operations plans; and
 
         (d)   Obey and comply with the lawful directions of properly
identified officers. Further and more specific restrictions, including parking
restrictions, may be included in a "warning" local travel advisory.
 
      (4)   Issuance authority; “advisory” or “watch” level travel advisory. If
the emergency management agency director or the principal executive officers
identified in Ord. 2009-12 determine that conditions in the town have created
the need for travel advisory restrictions without a local disaster emergency
declaration under I.C. 10-14-3-29, the emergency management agency director or
principal executive officers may issue an "advisory" or a "watch" level travel
advisory.
 
      (5)   Issuance authority; "warning" level travel advisory. A "warning"
level travel advisory may be issued only after local disaster emergency is
declared under I.C. 10-14-3-29.
 
   (D)   Publication. Publication and broadcast of a Level 1, 2, or 3 Snow
Emergency declaration order shall be made or caused to be made by the Council
or other officials designating the level of the snow emergency by contacting
local law enforcement agencies, fire departments, E911 dispatch office, news
media, the Noble County Emergency Management Office and posting the notice on
the town website at albion-in.org.
 
   (E)   Exemptions. Those vehicles exempt from this section shall include
medical assistance, law enforcement, fire department, emergency management,
public utility, and fuel hauling vehicles, and employees of any of the above
exempt services, if engaged in performing their respective duties. Any other
vehicles violating this section are subject to removal by towing or other means
at the expense of the owner of the vehicle, when such towing and/or removal is
deemed necessary by any one or more of the following: the Town Street
Department, the Town Police Department, the Noble County Sheriff’s Department,
a State Conservation Officer, or the Indiana State Police.

   Town Policies   30B-1
 
 
   (F)   Penalties. Persons violating any provisions of this section shall be
guilty of committing an infraction and may be fined the sum of $25 for the
first offense and an amount not to exceed $100 for all other offenses and such
shall be enforceable in any court of law, duly authorized by Indiana state law,
and in addition to the fine the court shall be authorized to direct the
violator to repay the town any monetary losses or expenses incurred in the
incident.

FIXED ASSET CAPITALIZATION POLICY
§ 34.30 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates otherwise or requires a different meaning.
   CAPITAL ASSETS.
      (1)   Land and/or land improvements, including monuments, buildings,
building improvements, construction in progress, machinery and equipment,
vehicles and infrastructure. All land will be capitalized but not depreciated.
All items with a useful life of more than one year, and having a unit cost of
$5,000 or more shall be capitalized (including acquisitions by lease-purchase
agreements or donated items). A capital asset meeting the criteria will be
reported and depreciated in the government-wide financial statements.
      (2)   Assets that are not capitalized (items having a unit cost of less
than $5,000) are expensed in the year of acquisition. An inventory will be kept
on all computers and other equipment with a capitalized cost of less than
$5,000. Exceptions are:
         (a)   Items costing less than the above-described limits which are
permanently installed as a part of the cost of original construction or
installation of a larger building or equipment unit will be included in the
cost of the larger unit;
         (b)   Modular equipment added subsequent to original equipment
construction of a larger building or equipment unit which may be put together
to form larger units costing more than the prescribed limits will be charged to
capital assets even though the cost of individual items is less than such
limits; and
         (c)   Cabinets, shelving bookcases, and similar items added subsequent
to original construction, which are custom-made for a specific place and
adaptable elsewhere will be capitalized.
NOTE: Purchases made using grant funds must comply with grant requirements or
the above procedures, whichever is most restrictive.
   CAPITAL OUTLAYS. Expenditures which benefit both the current and future
fiscal periods. This includes costs of acquiring land or structures,
construction or improvement of buildings, structures or other fixed assets and
equipment purchases having an appreciable and calculable period of usefulness.
These are expenditures resulting in the acquisition of or addition to the
town’s general fixed assets.
   ENTERPRISE FUNDS. 
      (1)   Those funds used to account for operations 1) that are financed and
operated in a manner similar to private business enterprise where the intent of
the Town Council is that the costs (expenses, including depreciation) of
providing goods or services to the general public on a continuing basis be
financed or recovered primarily through user charges; or 2) where the Town
Council has decided that periodic determination of revenues earned, expenses
incurred, and/or net income is appropriate for capital maintenance, public
policy, management control, accountability and other purposes.
      (2)   The ENTERPRISE FUND of the town shall include the municipally-owned
water and wastewater utilities. Operation of the utilities shall require
enterprise fund accounting and reporting.
   FIXED ASSETS. Tangible assets of a durable nature employed in the operating
of activities of the town and that are relatively permanent and are needed for
the production and sale of goods or services are termed property, plant and
equipment or FIXED ASSETS.
   HISTORICAL COST. The cash equivalent price exchanged for goods or services
at the date of acquisition. Land, buildings, equipment and most inventories are
common examples of items recognized under the HISTORICAL COST attribute.
   LAND. Specified land, lots, parcels, or acreage.
   MACHINERY and EQUIPMENT. An apparatus, tool or conglomeration of pieces to
form a tool. The tool will stand alone and not become part of a basic structure
or building. This category also includes any other asset or type of physical
property not otherwise classified in this subchapter.
   TANGIBLE ASSETS. Assets that can be observed by one or more of the physical
senses. These assets may be seen and touched and, in some environments, heard
and smelled.
(Ord. 2009-19, passed 12-22-09; Am. Ord. 2010-03, passed 1-26-10)
§ 34.31 SPECIFIC CAPITALIZATION PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Land. 
      (1)   The town will capitalize all land purchases, regardless of cost.
Exceptions to land capitalization are land purchased outright, as easements, or
right-of-way for infrastructure. Examples of infrastructure include roads and
streets, street lighting systems, curbs, parking meters, street signs,
viaducts, wharfs and storm water collection.
      (2)   Original cost of land will include the full value given to the
seller, including relocation, legal services incidental to the purchase
(including title work and legal opinion), appraisal and negotiation fees,
surveying and costs for preparing the land for its intended purpose (including
contractors and/or town employees (salary and benefits)), such as demolishing
buildings, excavating, clean up and/or inspection. Land is not depreciated
under generally accepted accounting principles.
   (B)   Machinery and equipment. 
      (1)   The town will capitalize items with an individual value equal to or
greater than $5,000. Machinery combined with other machinery to form one unit
with a total value greater than the above-mentioned limit will be one unit.
      (2)   Improvement or renovations to existing machinery and equipment will
be capitalized only if the result of the change meets all of the following
conditions:
         (a)   The total costs exceed $5,000;
         (b)   The useful life is extended two or more years; and
         (c)   The total cost will be greater than the current book value and
less than the fair market value.
      (3)   Salvage value of machinery or equipment will be determined on an
asset-by-asset basis. Depreciation will be calculated at year-end.
   (C)   Buildings. 
      (1)   A department will capitalize buildings at full cost with no
subcategories for tracking the cost of attachments. Examples of attachments are
roofs, heating, cooling, lighting or sprinkler systems, or any part of the
basic building. The department will include the cost of items designed or
purchased exclusively for the building.
      (2)   A department’s new building will be capitalized only if it meets
the following conditions:
         (a)   The total cost exceeds $5,000; and
         (b)   The useful life is greater than two years.
      (3)   A department improving or renovating an existing building will
capitalize only if the result meets all of the following conditions:
         (a)   The total cost exceeds $5,000;
         (b)   The useful life is extended two years or more; and
         (c)   The total cost will be greater than the current book value and
less than the fair market value.
      (4)   Any land, building, improvements, or equipment that has been
donated will be recorded at fair market value on the date of transfer.
   (D)   Improvements other than buildings. These assets are defined as
improvements to land for better enjoyment, attached or not easily removed, and
which will have a life expectancy of greater than two years. Examples are
walkways, parking areas and drives, golf cart paths, fencing, retaining walls,
pools, outside fountains, planters, underground sprinkler systems, water supply
mains, collection sewers, wells, dams, intake pipes, manholes, fire hydrants,
and other similar items. Improvements do not include roads, streets, or assets
that are of value only to the public. Roads or drives upon town-owned land that
provide support to town facilities are assets. A sidewalk down the road for
public enjoyment is an infrastructure improvement and is not capitalized.
However, sidewalks installed upon the town-owned land for use by the public and
for the support of town facilities are capital assets.
   (E)   Recording and accounting. The town and its various departments shall
classify capital expenditures as capital outlays within the fund from which the
expenditure was made in accordance with the Chart of Accounts of the Cities and
Towns Accounting Manual. The cost of the property, plant and equipment includes
all expenditures necessary to put the asset into position and ready for use.
For purposes of recording fixed assets of the town and its departments, the
valuation of assets shall be based on historical costs, or where the historical
cost is indeterminable, by estimation for those assets in existence.
   (F)   Composite/group network. A network of assets is composed of all assets
that provide a particular type of service for government. A subsystem of a
network of assets is composed of all assets that make a similar portion or
segment of a network of assets.
      (1)   “Composite depreciation” refers to calculation of depreciation for
a collection of similar assets. A single composite rate is applied annually to
the acquisition cost of the collection as a whole. At year-end, an adjustment
will be made to the total cost to account for any additions/disposals
throughout the year. The accumulated depreciation associated with it will also
be adjusted. A gain or loss will never be reported on the asset when using the
composite method. A full year’s depreciation will be taken when the asset is
placed in service and no depreciation will be recorded in the year it is sold
or disposed of. Dissimilar assets will be grouped by useful lives.
      (2)   To determine the appropriate depreciation rate for the composite
rate, divide one by the number of years the assets are depreciated. For
instance, a group of assets with a 25 year life will be depreciated at 4% each
year (1/25).
      (3)   The following is a list of asset groups and useful lives that will
be used for depreciation purposes:
         (a)   Street lights: 35 years;
         (b)   Traffic signals: 25 years;
         (c)   Flood walls/gates: 50 years;
         (d)   Roads:
            1.   Cement: 10 years;
            2.   Gravel: 15 years;
            3.   Concrete: 30 years;
            4.   Asphalt concrete: 20 years;
            5.   Brick stone: 50 years.
         (e)   Building and improvements: 50 years;
         (f)   Sewer lines: 50 years;
         (g)   Combined sewer overflow: 50 years;
         (h)   Lift station: 50 years;
         (i)   Treatment plant/equipment: 10 years;
         (j)   Office equipment: 5 years;
         (k)   Miscellaneous operating equipment: 5 years;
         (l)   Vehicles: 5 years;

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 35.001 MISSION STATEMENT.
   The town strives to provide the best possible services efficiently,
effectively, and ethically to all residents of the town and customers of town
services; and seeks sustainable growth that protects and enhances the town’s
natural and historic resources while preserving the town’s values, qualities,
and culture.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.002 INTRODUCTORY STATEMENTS.
   (A)   For purposes of these work guidelines all employees will be referred
to as “employee(s).” The Town of Albion, Indiana will be referred to as the
“town.”
   (B)   These work guidelines have been designed to acquaint employees with
the town and provide them with information about working conditions, employee
benefits, and some of the policies affecting their employment. Employees are
responsible for reading, understanding, and complying with all provisions of
this chapter. It describes many of the responsibilities for employees and
outlines the programs developed by the town to benefit employees. One of
management’s objectives is to provide a work environment that is conducive to
both personal and professional growth.
   (C)   No employee handbook may anticipate every circumstance or question
about policy. As the town continues to grow, the need may arise and the town
reserves the right to revise, supplement, or rescind any policies or portion of
this handbook from time to time as it deems appropriate, in its sole and
absolute discretion. The only exception to any changes is the employment-at-
will policy permitting employees of the town to end their professional
relationship for any reason at any time. Employees will be notified of such
changes to this chapter as they occur and employees will be expected to
acknowledge in writing that they have received those changes. Nothing in this
chapter shall be interpreted to prohibit or otherwise restrict concerted
activities by employees that are protected by law.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.003 RESIDENT AND CUSTOMER RELATIONS.
   (A)   Residents and customers of town services are among the town’s most
valuable assets. Every employee represents the town to the residents, customers
of town services, and the public. The way employees do their jobs presents an
image of the entire town. Residents and customers of town services judge all of
the employees by how they are treated with each employee contact. Therefore,
one of the first business priorities for all employees is to assist any
resident, potential resident, or customer of town services. Employees should
not engage in arguments, debates, or lengthy discussions with residents or
customers of town services regarding the town’s policies, procedures, or
services. Nothing is more important than being courteous, friendly, helpful,
and prompt in the attention that employees give to residents and customers of
town services. Any employee who receives a complaint from a resident or
customer of town services should refer the individual to the Town Manager.
   (B)   Should the town need to perform work, or approve others to perform
work on or around a citizen’s property that could damage areas of the property
including, but not limited to: trees, sod, or other related areas, the town
will notify the property owner in writing prior to the commencement of work,
unless there is an emergency situation that must be dealt with immediately. In
an emergency situation, every effort will be made to contact the property owner
by phone prior to the commencement of work.
   (C)   Personal contact with the public, manners on the telephone, and the
communications sent to residents and customers of town services are reflections
not only of each employee, but also of the professionalism of the town.
Positive relations with residents and customers of town services not only
enhance the public’s perception or image of the town, but also pay off in
greater loyalty.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
EMPLOYMENT
§ 35.010 NATURE OF EMPLOYMENT.
   (A)   Employment with the town is voluntarily entered into, and the employee
is free to resign at will at any time, with or without cause. Similarly, the
town may terminate the employment-at-will relationship at any time, with or
without notice or cause, so long as there is no violation of applicable federal
or state law.
   (B)   Policies set forth in this chapter are not intended to create a
contract, nor are they to be construed to constitute contractual obligations of
any kind or a contract of employment between the town and any of its employees.
The provisions of this chapter have been developed at the discretion of
management and, except for its policy of employment-at-will, may be amended or
cancelled at any time, at the town’s sole discretion.
   (C)   These provisions supersede all existing policies and practices and may
not be amended or added to without the express written approval of the Town
Council. When Police and Fire Department policies differ from what is written
in this chapter, Police and Fire Department policies will prevail.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.011 EMPLOYEE RELATIONS.
   (A)   The town believes that the work conditions, wages, and benefits it
offers to its employees are competitive with those offered by other
municipalities and employers in the area. If employees have concerns about work
conditions or compensation, they are strongly encouraged to voice these
concerns openly and directly to their department heads.
   (B)   When employees deal openly and directly with department heads, the
work environment can be excellent, communications can be clear, and attitudes
can be positive. The town believes that it amply demonstrates its commitment to
employees by responding effectively to employee concerns.
   (C)   Determination as to changes or alterations in salary, leave or other
special circumstances may be made at the discretion of the Town Council.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.012 EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY.
   (A)   In order to provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to
all individuals, employment decisions at the town will be based on merit,
qualifications, and abilities. The town does not discriminate in employment
opportunities or practices on the basis of race, color, religion, sex
(pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), national origin, age (40
and over), disability, genetic information as referenced in the Genetic
Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), military service veteran status, or
any other characteristic protected by federal, state and local laws.
   (B)   The town will make reasonable accommodation for qualified individuals
with known disabilities unless doing so would result in an undue hardship. This
policy governs all aspects of employment, including selection, job assignment,
compensation, discipline, termination, and access to benefits and training.
   (C)   Employees with questions or concerns about any type of discrimination
in the workplace are encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of their
department head, the Town Manager, or the Clerk-Treasurer. Employees may raise
concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal. Anyone found to be engaging
in any type of unlawful discrimination may be subject to disciplinary action,
up to and including termination of employment.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.013 BUSINESS ETHICS AND CONDUCT.
   (A)   The successful business operation and reputation of the town is built
upon the principles of fair dealing and ethical conduct of our employees. The
town’s reputation for integrity and excellence requires careful observance of
the spirit and letter of all applicable laws and regulations, as well as a
scrupulous regard for the highest standards of conduct and personal integrity.
   (B)   The continued success of the town is dependent upon residents’ trust
and those serving the town are dedicated to preserving that trust. Employees
owe a duty to the town, its residents, and the customers of town services to
act in a way that will merit the continued trust and confidence of the public.
   (C)   The town will comply with all applicable laws and regulations and
expects its employees to conduct business in accordance with the letter,
spirit, and intent of all relevant laws and to refrain from any illegal,
dishonest, or unethical conduct. Nothing in this policy shall be interpreted to
prohibit or otherwise restrict concerted activities by employees that are
protected by law.
   (D)   In general, the use of good judgment, based on high ethical
principles, will guide employees with respect to lines of acceptable conduct.
If a situation arises where it is difficult to determine the proper course of
action, the matter should be discussed openly with a department head, the Town
Manager, or the Clerk-Treasurer for advice and consultation.
   (E)   Compliance with this policy of business ethics and conduct is the
responsibility of every town employee. Disregarding or failing to comply with
this standard of business ethics and conduct may be subject to disciplinary
action, up to and including termination of employment.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.014 NEPOTISM IN THE WORKPLACE.
   (A)   The employment of relatives in the same area of an organization may
cause serious conflicts and problems with favoritism and employee morale. In
addition to claims of partiality in treatment at work, personal conflicts from
outside the work environment may be carried over into day-to-day working
relationships. Accordingly, the town will follow all resolutions as outlined by
I.C. 36-1-20.2 with regards to nepotism.
   (B)   For purposes of this policy, a RELATIVE is defined as a spouse, parent
or stepparent, child or stepchild (including an adopted child or stepchild), a
brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister (including a brother or sister by
half-blood), a niece or nephew, aunt or uncle, daughter-in-law or son-in-
law. EMPLOYED means an individual who is employed by the town on a full-time,
part-time, or temporary basis. The term does not include an individual who
holds an elected office. The term includes an individual who is a party to an
employment contract with the town. The performance of the duties of a PRECINCT
ELECTION OFFICER (as defined in I.C. 3-5-2-40.1), or a volunteer firefighter,
that are imposed by I.C. Title 3 is not considered employment by the town.
   (C)   DIRECT LINE OF SUPERVISION is defined as an elected officer or
employee who is in a position to affect the terms and conditions of another
employee’s employment, including making decisions about work assignments,
compensation, grievances, advancement, or performance evaluation. The term does
not include the responsibilities of the executive, legislative body, or fiscal
body of the town, as provided by law, to make decisions regarding salary
ordinances, budgets, or personnel policies of the town.
   (D)   Individuals who are relatives may not be employed by the town in a
position that results in one relative being in the direct line of supervision
of the other relative. This applies to an individual who is employed by the
town on the date that the employee’s relative begins serving a term of an
elected office of the town and is not exempt from the application under
exemptions of the policy. This policy does not abrogate or affect an employment
contract with the town that an individual is party to and is in effect on the
date the employee’s relative begins serving a term of an elected office of the
town.
   (E)   Employees who are employed by the town on July 1, 2012 are not subject
to this policy unless they have had a break in employment with the town. The
following are not considered a break in employment: the employee is absent from
the workplace while on paid or unpaid leave, including any paid time off,
medical leave or workers’ compensation and the employee’s employment with the
town is terminated followed by immediate reemployment by the town, without loss
of payroll time.
   (F)   Employees should contact the Clerk-Treasurer’s office for additional
information regarding nepotism in the workplace.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.015 EMPLOYEE MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS.
   (A)   To help ensure that employees are able to perform their duties safely,
medical examinations may be required in certain job categories. After an offer
has been made to an applicant entering a designated job category, a medical
examination may be performed at the town’s expense by a health professional of
the town’s choice. The offer of employment and assignment to duties is
contingent upon satisfactory completion of the exam and a satisfactory or
negative drug test.
   (B)   After employment begins, employees may be required to submit to
medical examinations for certain purposes during their period of employment
with the town. The examination is intended to ensure that the employee
continues to be physically able to perform the duties of his or her position.
Such examples may include, but are not limited to: mandatory drug and alcohol
testing, examination to assess eligibility for workers’ compensation or as
required by occupational safety and health programs, and the like. The town
will be responsible for all costs related to mandatory employee medical
examinations as required.
   (C)   Information on an employee’s medical condition or history will be kept
separate from other employee information and maintained confidentially in
accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA). Access to this information will be limited to those who have a
legitimate need to know. Refer to Policy #214—Medical Information Privacy (§
35.042) for additional information.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.016 IMMIGRATION LAW COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   The town is committed to employing only United States citizens and
aliens who are authorized to work in the United States and does not unlawfully
discriminate on the basis of citizenship or national origin.
   (B)   In compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986,
each new employee, as a condition of employment, must complete the Employment
Eligibility Verification Form I-9 and present documentation establishing
identity and employment eligibility. Former employees who are rehired must also
complete the form if they have not completed an I-9 with the town within the
past three years, or if their previous I-9 is no longer retained or valid. In
addition, the town utilizes E-Verify, an internet-based system that compares
information from an employee’s Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 to
data from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Social Security
Administration records to confirm employment eligibility.
   (C)   The I-9 may be completed by the employee prior to his or her first day
of work but federal law requires that this form be completed no more than three
days after the employee starts his or her employment. Failure to complete this
form will cause the employee not to be established as an employee with the town
and he or she will not be able to be paid through the town’s payroll system
until the form is properly completed.
   (D)   Employees are encouraged to contact the Clerk-Treasurer’s office for
additional information on immigration law issues. Employees may raise questions
or complaints about immigration law compliance without fear of reprisal.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.017 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
   (A)   Employees have an obligation to conduct business within guidelines
that prohibit actual or potential conflicts of interest. This policy
establishes only the framework within which the town wishes the business to
operate. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide general direction so
that employees may seek additional clarification on issues related to the
subject of acceptable standards of operation.
   (B)   Transactions with outside firms must be conducted within a framework
established and controlled by the Town Council. Business dealings with outside
firms should not result in unusual gains for those firms. Unusual gain refers
to bribes, product bonuses, special fringe benefits, unusual price breaks, and
other windfalls designed to ultimately benefit the employer, the employee, or
both. Promotional plans that could be interpreted to involve unusual gain
require specific approval from the Town Council.
   (C)   An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when an employee is
in a position to influence a decision that may result in a personal gain for
that employee or for a dependent as a result of the town’s business dealings.
For purposes of this policy, a RELATIVE is defined as a spouse, parent or
stepparent, child or stepchild (including an adopted child or stepchild), a
brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister (including a brother or sister by
half-blood), a niece or nephew, aunt or uncle, daughter-in-law or son-in-law.
ELECTED OFFICIAL refers to the Clerk-Treasurer, or any other elected town
official.
   (D)   The town may enter into a contract or renew a contract for the
procurement of goods and services or a contract for public works with an
individual who is a relative of an elected official or a business entity that
is wholly or partially owned by a relative of an elected official. The town may
also enter into a contract or renew a contract with an individual or business
entity if all of the following are satisfied: the elected official files with
the town a full disclosure, which must be in writing, describe the contract or
purchase to be made, describe the relationship that the elected official has to
the individual or business entity that contracts or purchases, be affirmed
under penalty of perjury, be submitted to the Town Council and be accepted by
the Town Council in a public meeting prior to final action on the contract or
purchase and be filed, not later than 15 days after final action on the
contract or purchase with the State Board of Accounts and the Clerk of the
Circuit Court in the county where the town takes final action on the contract
or purchase. The appropriate agency of the town must make a certified statement
that the contract amount or purchase price was the lowest amount or price bid
or make a certified statement of the reasons why the vendor or contractor was
selected. In addition, the town must satisfy all other requirements under I.C.
5-22 or I.C. 36-1-12. The elected official must comply with the disclosure
provision of I.C. 35-44.1-1-4, if applicable. This does not affect the initial
term of a contract in existence at the time the term of office of the elected
official of the town begins.
   (E)   No presumption of guilt is created by the mere existence of a
relationship with outside firms. However, if employees have any influence on
transactions involving purchases, contracts, or leases, it is imperative that
they disclose to the Town Council as soon as possible the existence of any
actual or potential conflict of interest so that safeguards may be established
to protect all parties.
   (F)   While this policy is comprehensive it is not all-inclusive. Employees
who are in violation of any portion of this policy may be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Nothing in
this policy shall be interpreted to prohibit or otherwise restrict concerted
activities by employees that are protected by law.
   (G)   Employees may contact the Clerk-Treasurer for additional information
regarding conflicts of interest.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.018 OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT.
   (A)   Employees may hold outside jobs as long as they meet the performance
standards of their job with the town. All employees will be judged by the same
performance standards and will be subject to the town’s scheduling demands,
regardless of any existing outside work requirements.
   (B)   If the town determines that an employee’s outside work interferes with
performance or the ability to meet the requirements of the town as they are
modified from time to time, the employee may be asked to terminate the outside
employment if he or she wishes to remain as an employee with the town. Any
conflict, policy infraction, or other specific offense which is the direct
result of an employee’s participation in outside employment will subject the
employee to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment
in a manner that is otherwise consistent with the policies set forth in this
chapter.
   (C)   Outside employment that constitutes a conflict of interest is
prohibited. Employees may not receive any income or material gain from
individuals outside the town for materials produced or services rendered while
performing their jobs. Refer to Policy #108—Conflicts of Interest (§ 35.017)
for additional information.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.019 NON-DISCLOSURE.
   (A)   The protection of confidential information is vital to the interests
and the success of the town. I.C. 5-14-3-4 states what is considered to be
public record and the town will comply with all guidelines. Such confidential
information includes information acquired in the course of one’s work, and may
include:
      (1)   Citizen information and preferences.
      (2)   Computer processes.
      (3)   Computer programs and codes.
      (4)   Facilities security.
      (5)   Financial information.
      (6)   Marketing strategies.
      (7)   Pending projects and proposals.
      (8)   Research and development strategies.
      (9)   Technological data.
      (10)   Vendor lists.
   (B)   Employees who are exposed to confidential information may be required
to sign a non-disclosure agreement as a condition of employment. Employees who
improperly use or disclose confidential information may be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment and legal
action, even if they do not actually benefit from the disclosed information.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.020 DISABILITY ACCOMMODATIONS.
   (A)   The town is committed to complying fully with the Americans with
Disabilities Act and its Amendments Act (ADAAA) and ensuring equal opportunity
in employment for qualified persons with disabilities. All employment practices
and activities are conducted on a non-discriminatory basis in accordance with
both federal and state laws.
   (B)   Hiring procedures have been reviewed and provide persons with
disabilities meaningful employment opportunities. Pre-em ployment inquiries are
made only regarding an applicant’s ability to perform the duties of the
position.
   (C)   Reasonable accommodation is available to all disabled employees, where
their disability affects the performance of job functions. All employment
decisions are based on the merits of the situation in accordance with defined
criteria, not the disability of the individual.
   (D)   Qualified individuals with disabilities are entitled to equal pay and
other forms of compensation (or changes in compensation) as well as in job
assignments, classifications, organizational structures, position descriptions,
benefits, and training.
   (E)   The town is also committed to not discriminating against any qualified
employees because they are related to or associated with a person with a
disability. The town will follow any state or local law that provides
individuals with disabilities greater protection than the ADAAA.
   (F)   This policy is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. The town is committed
to taking all other actions necessary to ensure equal employment opportunity
for persons with disabilities in accordance with the ADAAA and all other
applicable federal, state, and local laws.
   (G)   Employees are encouraged to contact their department head, the Town
Manager, or the Clerk-Treasurer or for additional information regarding the
ADAAA. Employees may raise questions or complaints about the ADAAA compliance
without fear of reprisal.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.021 LACTATION ACCOMMODATIONS.
   (A)   The town supports breastfeeding mothers by accommodating the mother
who wishes to express milk during her workday when separated from her newborn
child. Any full-time employee who is breastfeeding will be provided up to two
break periods of 20-minutes each to express milk for her newborn. Also, a
reasonable place to express milk, other than a restroom, will be provided for
the mother. The employee and her department head will agree on the times for
these breaks. In addition, the town will provide an area for the milk to be
stored.
   (B)   Employees should contact the Clerk-Treasurer’s office for additional
information regarding lactation accommodations.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.022 JOB POSTINGS.
   (A)   The town makes every effort to post a job when one becomes vacant and
is designated by the Town Council to be filled.
   (B)   Vacant jobs will be advertised among the existing town employees for
ten days before advertising them to the public. Current employees who have an
interest in the open position may complete an application at the Clerk-
Treasurer’s office. The department heads and Town Manager are responsible for
reviewing all applications. For current employees applying for a job within
another department, the department head has the authority to review personnel
records and talk with the current department head regarding the employee’s
performance and attendance prior to the initial interview. The Clerk-Treasurer
is responsible for interviewing and hiring for the Clerk-Treasurer’s office.
   (C)   All applications will be kept in the Clerk-Treasurer’s office for a
period of three years from the date of application. The Town Council has the
sole authority to approve all department head recommendations for the hiring of
either external candidates or internal employees to fill vacant jobs within the
town.
   (D)   Employees may contact the Town Manager for additional information
regarding a job posting.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
EMPLOYMENT STATUS AND RECORDS
§ 35.035 EMPLOYMENT CATEGORIES.
   (A)   It is the intent of the town to clarify the definitions of employment
classifications so that employees understand their employment status and
benefit eligibility. These classifications do not guarantee employment for any
specified period of time. Accordingly, the right to terminate the employment-
at-will relationship at any time is retained by both the employee and the town.
   (B)   Each employee is designated as either “nonexempt” or “exempt” from
federal and state wage and hour laws. Nonexempt employees are entitled to
overtime pay under the specific provisions of federal and state laws. Exempt
employees are excluded from specific provisions of federal and state wage and
hour laws. Exempt employees are paid on a salary basis that does not vary from
week-to-week based upon the quality or quantity of work performed or the
location in which work is performed. In other words, exempt employees are paid
“to get the job done.” Thus, an exempt employee’s pay will not be reduced in
any fashion for partial day absences, except when permitted by law, such as
unpaid intermittent FMLA leave. Any deductions from an exempt employee’s salary
will be in compliance with acceptable parameters for such deductions.
   (C)   For example, the following types of deductions are permissible with
regard to exempt employees’ pay:
      (1)   No work is performed in a workweek;
      (2)   Absences of one or more full days for personal reasons other than
sickness or disability if all accrued paid time off, e.g. vacation, sick leave
benefits, and personal hour benefits has been exhausted;
      (3)   Fees received by the employee for jury or witness duty or military
leave may be applied to offset the pay otherwise due to the employee for the
week;
      (4)   Penalties imposed by infractions of safety rules of major
significance;
      (5)   Unpaid disciplinary suspensions of one or more full days in
accordance with the town’s disciplinary policy;
      (6)   Deductions for the first and last week of employment, when only
part of the week is worked by the employee; and
      (7)   Deductions for unpaid leave taken in accordance with an approved
absence under the Family and Medical Leave Act.
   (D)   Complaint procedure.
      (1)   Employees who believe their pay has been improperly reduced should
immediately contact the Clerk-Treasurer’s office.
      (2)   The town will investigate the employee’s concern and determine
whether an inadvertent improper deduction has been made. If the deduction was
in fact improper, the town will reimburse the employee as promptly as possible.
The town complies with all applicable laws concerning the payment of wages and
will correct any inadvertent improper deduction, should it occur and monitor
the situation to ensure no further issues arise.
   (E)   An employee’s exempt or nonexempt classification may be changed only
upon written notification by the Town Council.
   (F)   In addition to the categories of “exempt” and “nonexempt,” each
employee will belong to one other employment category:
      (1)   “Regular full-time” employees are those who are not in a temporary
or introductory status and who are regularly scheduled to work a full-time
schedule of 40 hours per week. Generally, employees in this category are
eligible for the town’s benefits package, subject to the terms, conditions, and
limitations of each benefit program. Refer to each benefit policy for
eligibility requirements.
      (2)   “Regular part-time” employees are those who are not assigned to a
temporary or introductory status and who are regularly scheduled to work less
than 40 hours per week. Employees in this category may be eligible for some of
the town’s benefits, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each
benefit program. Refer to each benefit policy for eligibility requirements.
      (3)   “Introductory” employees are those Police and Fire Department
employees whose performance is being evaluated to determine whether further
employment is appropriate. The introductory period is six months after the
completion of the minimum basic training requirements adopted by the Law
Enforcement Training Board under I.C. 5-2-1-9. Refer to Policy
#205—Introductory Period (§
35.039) for additional information.
      (4)   “Temporary/seasonal” employees are those who are hired as interim
replacements to temporarily supplement the workforce, or to assist in the
completion of a specific project. Employment assignments in this category are
of a limited duration. Employment beyond any initially stated period does not
in any way imply a change in employment status. Temporary employees retain that
status unless and until notified of a change. While temporary employees receive
all legally mandated benefits, they are ineligible for any of the town’s other
benefit programs.

§ 35.036 ACCESS TO PERSONNEL FILES.
   (A)   The town maintains a personnel file on each employee. The personnel
file includes such information as the employee’s job application, resume,
records of training, documentation of performance evaluations and salary
increases, and other employment-related records.
   (B)   Personnel files are the property of the town and access to the
information they contain is restricted. Generally, only department heads and
management personnel of the town who have a legitimate reason to review
information in a file are allowed to do so.
   (C)   Employees should contact the Clerk-Treasurer’s office if they wish to
review their own file. With reasonable advance notice, employees may review
their own personnel file in the town offices and in the presence of an
individual appointed by the Town Council to maintain the files.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.037 EMPLOYMENT REFERENCE CHECKS.
   The Clerk-Treasurer’s office will respond to those reference check inquiries
that are submitted in writing and over the phone. Responses to such inquiries
will confirm only dates of employment, wage rates, and position(s) held. No
employment data will be released without a written authorization and release
signed by the individual who is the subject of the inquiry.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.038 PERSONNEL DATA CHANGES.
   It is the responsibility of each employee to notify the town of any changes
in personal data within five days of any change. Personal mailing addresses,
telephone numbers, number and names of dependents, individuals to be contacted
in the event of emergency, educational accomplishments, loss of license, loss
of insurability, and other such status reports should be accurate and current
at all times. Employees should notify the Clerk-Treasurer’s office if any
personal data has changed.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.039 INTRODUCTORY PERIOD.
   (A)   New employees in the Police and Fire Departments will have a six-month
(180-day) introductory period after the completion of the minimum basic
training requirements adopted by the Law Enforcement Training Board under I.C.
5-2-1-9. The town uses this period to evaluate employee capabilities, work
habits, and overall performance. Either the employee or the town may end the
employment-at-will relationship at any time during or after the introductory
period, with or without cause or advance notice. Upon satisfactory completion
of the introductory period, Police Department employees enter the “regular”
employment classification and will be entitled to the rights and protections,
if any, afforded to a police officer pursuant to the I.C. 36-8-3.
   (B)   During the introductory period, new employees in the Police Department
are eligible for those benefits that are required by law, such as workers’
compensation insurance and social security. They may also be eligible for other
benefits provided by the town, subject to the terms and conditions of each
benefit program. Employees should read each Summary Plan Description (SPD) for
each specific benefit program for additional information on eligibility
requirements.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.040 FALSIFICATION OF EMPLOYMENT APPLICATIONS.
   The town relies upon the accuracy of information contained in the employment
application, as well as the accuracy of other data presented throughout the
hiring process and employment. Any misrepresentations, falsifications, or
material omissions in any of this information or data may result in the
exclusion of the individual from further consideration for employment or, if
the person has been hired, immediate termination of employment.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.041 JOB DESCRIPTIONS.
   (A)   The town makes every effort to create and maintain accurate job
descriptions for all positions within the municipality. Each job description
includes a job information section, a job summary section (giving a general
overview of the job’s purpose), an essential duties and responsibilities
section, a supervisory responsibilities section, a qualifications section
(including education and/or experience and any certification required), a
physical demands section, and a work environment section.
   (B)   The town maintains job descriptions to aid in identifying the
requirements of each position, establishing hiring criteria, orienting new
employees to their jobs, setting standards for employee performance
evaluations, and establishing a basis for making reasonable accommodations for
individuals with disabilities.
   (C)   Department heads prepare job descriptions for their departments when
new positions are created. Existing job descriptions are also reviewed and
revised in order to ensure that they are up-to-date. Job descriptions may also
be rewritten periodically to reflect any changes in the position's duties and
responsibilities. All employees are expected to help ensure that their job
descriptions are accurate and current, reflecting the work being done.
   (D)   Employees should remember that job descriptions do not necessarily
cover every task or duty that might be assigned, and additional
responsibilities may be assigned as necessary. Employees may contact their
department head if they have any questions or concerns about their job
description. Job descriptions will be kept in the Town Manager’s office once
approved by the Town Council.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.042 MEDICAL INFORMATION PRIVACY.
   (A)   This medical information privacy policy describes how health
information about employees may be used and disclosed by the town and how
employees may obtain access to this information. The townis committed to
maintaining and protecting the confidentiality of our employees’ personal
information in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA). The Clerk-Treasurer is the designated privacy
officer for all employee medical information.
   (B)   This policy of privacy practices applies to the health plans of the
town that are covered by privacy regulations, e.g., the health insurance plans,
(collectively referred to as the “benefit plans”). The benefit plans are
required by federal and state law to protect the privacy of employees’
individually identifiable health information and other personal information and
to provide employees with notice about their policies, safeguards, and
practices. When the benefit plans use, or disclose employees’ protected health
information, the benefit plans are bound by the terms of this policy, or a
revised policy, if applicable.
   (C)   The benefit plans will not use employees’ protected health information
or disclose it to others without the employees’ authorization, except for the
following purposes:
      (1)   Treatment. The benefit plans may disclose an employee’s protected
health information, or an employee’s covered dependents’ protected health
information, to a health care provider or administrator for its provision,
coordination, or management of the employee’s health care and related services.
For example, prior to providing a health service to an employee, the employee’s
doctor may ask for information concerning whether and when the service was
previously provided to the employee. The benefit plans may use and disclose an
employee’s protected health information for treatment activities of a health
care provider.
      (2)   Payment. The benefit plans may use and disclose an employee’s
protected health information to facilitate payment of premiums for an
employee’s coverage, and to determine and fulfill their responsibility to
provide an employee’s health insurance benefits. For example, an employee’s
protected health information may be used to make coverage determinations,
administer claims, and coordinate benefits with other coverage employees may
have. The benefit plans may also disclose an employee’s protected health
information to a health plan or administrator to determine an employee’s
eligibility for coverage, or for the health care provider to obtain payment for
health care services provided to the employee.
      (3)   Health care operations. The benefit plans may use and disclose an
employee’s protected health information for their health care operations, or
the health care operations of a third-party administrator of the benefit plans.
For example, the benefit plans may use protected health information to conduct
quality assessment and improvement activities. Other health care operations may
include providing appointment reminders, or sending an employee’s information
about treatment alternatives or other health-related benefits and services. The
benefit plans also may disclose an employee’s protected health information to
another health plan or provider that has a relationship with an employee, so
that it may conduct quality assessment and improvement activities (for example,
to perform case management).
      (4)   Disclosure to employer or operating company. The benefit plans may
disclose an employee’s protected health information to the town, or to a
company acting on the behalf of the town, so that it may monitor, audit, and
otherwise administer the employee health benefit plan in which employees
participate. The town and its operating companies are not permitted to use
protected health information for any purpose other than administration of an
employee’s health insurance plan benefits. The benefit plans will not disclose
protected health information to the town for the purposes of employment-related
actions or decisions, or in connection with any other benefit or employee
benefit plan. The benefit plans will identify employees who are authorized to
receive and use protected health information.
      (5)   Disclosure to health care vendors and accreditation organizations.
The benefit plans may disclose an employee’s protected health information to
companies with whom they contract, if they need it to perform requested
services. For example, the benefit plans may provide protected health
information to vendors who provide important information and guidance to plan
members with chronic conditions such as diabetes and asthma. Protected health
information may be disclosed to accreditation organizations such as the
National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) for quality measurement
purposes. When the benefit plans enter into these arrangements, they will
obtain a written agreement to protect an employee’s protected health
information.
      (6)   Public health activities. The benefit plans may disclose an
employee’s protected health information for the following public health
activities and purposes:
         (a)   To report health information to public health authorities that
are authorized by law to receive such information for the purpose of
controlling disease, injury, or disability;
         (b)   To report child abuse or neglect to a government authority that
is authorized by law to receive such reports;
         (c)   To report information about a product or activity that is
regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to a person
responsible for the quality, safety, or effectiveness of the product or
activity; and
         (d)   To alert a person who may have been exposed to a communicable
disease, if the benefit plans are authorized by law to give this notice.
      (7)   Health oversight activities. The benefit plans may disclose an
employee’s protected health information to a government agency that is legally
responsible for oversight of the health care system or for ensuring compliance
with the rules of government benefit programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid, or
other regulatory programs that need health information to determine compliance.
      (8)   For research. The benefit plans may disclose an employee’s
protected health information for medical research purposes, subject to strict
legal restrictions.
      (9)   To comply with the law. The benefit plans may use and disclose an
employee’s protected health information to comply with the law.
      (10)   Judicial and administrative proceedings. The benefit plans may
disclose an employee’s protected health information in a judicial or
administrative proceeding, or in response to a legal order.
      (11)   Law enforcement officials. The benefit plans may disclose an
employee’s protected health information to the police or other law enforcement
officials, as required by law or in compliance with a court order or other
process authorized by law.
      (12)   Health or safety. The benefit plans may disclose an employee’s
protected health information to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat
to employees’ health or safety, or the health and safety of the general public.
      (13)   Government functions. The benefit plans may disclose an employee’s
protected health information to various departments of the government such as
the U.S. Military, or the U.S. Department of State.
      (14)   Workers’ compensation. The benefit plans may disclose an
employee’s protected health information when necessary to comply with workers’
compensation laws.
      (15)   Other. The benefit plans may disclose an employee’s protected
health information when necessary to file claims with re-insurers or stop-loss
carriers, or to obtain coverage with re-insurers or stop-loss carriers. The
benefit plans may also disclose an employee’s protected health information to
subrogation vendors to recoup payments made by the benefit plans that were
reimbursed by other insurance arrangements.
      (16)   Uses and disclosures with employees’ written authorization. The
benefit plans will not use or disclose an employee’s protected health
information for any purpose other than the purposes described in this policy
without the employees’ written authorization. For example, the benefit plans
will not supply protected health information to another company for its
marketing purposes or to a potential employer with whom an employee is seeking
employment without the employee’s signed authorization. Employees may revoke an
authorization that has previously been given by sending a written request to
the Clerk-Treasurer, but not with respect to any actions the benefit plans have
already taken.
   (D)   Employees may request restrictions on the use and disclosure of the
employee’s protected health information for the treatment, payment, and health
care operations purposes explained in this policy. While the benefit plans will
consider all requests for restrictions carefully, the benefit plans are not
required to agree to a requested restriction.
   (E)   Employees may ask to receive communications of their protected health
information from the benefit plans by alternative means of communication, or at
alternative locations. While the benefit plans will consider reasonable
requests carefully, they are not required to agree to all requests.
   (F)   Employees may ask to inspect or to obtain a copy of their protected
health information that is included in certain records the benefit plans
maintain. Under limited circumstances, the benefit plans may deny employees
access to a portion of their records. If employees request copies, the benefit
plans may charge employees copying and mailing costs.
   (G)   Employees have the right to ask the benefit plans to amend protected
health information that is contained in the benefit plans’ records. If the
benefit plans determine that the record is inaccurate, and the law permits the
benefit plans to amend it, the benefit plans will correct it. If the employee’s
doctor or another person created the information that the employee wants to
change, the employees should ask that person to amend the information.
   (H)   Upon written request, employees may obtain an accounting of
disclosures the benefit plans have made of their protected health information.
The accounting that the benefit plans provide will not include disclosures made
before April 14, 2003, disclosures made for treatment, payment or health care
operations, disclosures made earlier than six years before the date of the
request, and certain other disclosures that are exempted by law. If employees
request an accounting more than once during any 12-month period, the benefit
plans may charge those employees a reasonable fee for each accounting statement
after the first one.
   (I)   Employees may contact the Clerk-Treasurer to obtain a paper copy of
this policy, even if the employees previously agreed to receive notices
electronically. Employees must also contact the Clerk-Treasurer, if they wish
to make any of the requests listed above.
   (J)   If employees want additional information about privacy rights, do not
understand their privacy rights, are concerned that the benefit plans have
violated their privacy rights, or disagree with a decision that the benefit
plans made about access to protected health information, they may contact the
Clerk-Treasurer. Employees may also file written complaints with the Secretary
of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The town will not take any
action against employees if they file a complaint.
   (K)   The town may change the terms of this policy at any time. If the town
changes this policy, the town may make the new policy terms effective for all
protected health information that the benefit plans maintain, including any
information the benefit plans created or received before the town issued the
new policy. If the town makes any changes to the medical information privacy
policy, notice of the changes will be provided to employees.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.043 SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER POLICY.
   (A)   To protect an employee’s personal information, the town prohibits the
use of employees’ social security numbers for identification purposes, except
as allowed by both federal and state laws. The town will not:
      (1)   Publicly post or publicly display in any manner an employee’s
social security number. PUBLICLY POST or PUBLICLY DISPLAY means to
intentionally communicate or otherwise make available to the general public.
      (2)   Print an employee’s social security number on any card required for
the employee to access products or services provided by the town.
      (3)   Require an employee to transmit his or her social security number
over the internet, unless the connection is secure or the social security
number is encrypted.
      (4)   Require an employee to use his or her social security number to
access an internet website, unless a password or unique personal identification
number or another authentication device is also required to access the internet
website.
      (5)   Print an employee’s social security number on any materials that
are mailed to the employee, unless law requires the social security number to
be on the document to be mailed.
   (B)   However, social security numbers may be included in applications and
forms sent by mail, including documents sent as part of an application or
enrollment process; or to establish, amend, or terminate an account, contract,
or policy; or to confirm the accuracy of the social security number. In all
cases, the town will follow all applicable federal and state laws.
   (C)   In instances where the town previously used an employee’s social
security number in a manner inconsistent with this policy, it will continue
using that employee’s social security number in that manner, if all of the
following conditions are met:
      (1)   The use of the social security number is continuous. If the use is
stopped for any reason, the conditions listed above will apply.
      (2)   The employee is provided an annual disclosure that informs the
employee that he or she has the right to stop the use of his or her social
security number in a manner prohibited by those conditions listed above.
   (D)   A written request by an employee to stop the use of his or her social
security number in a prohibited manner will be implemented within 30 days of
the receipt of the request. There will be no fee or charge for implementing the
request. The town will not deny services to an employee because the employee
makes a written request to stop the use of his or her social security number.
   (E)   The town will continue to collect, use, or release social security
numbers as required by federal or state law, and may use social security
numbers for internal verification or administrative purposes. Employees should
contact the Clerk-Treasurer if they have questions about this policy or feel
that their social security number has been used inappropriately.

§ 35.056 VACATION BENEFITS.
   Vacation time off with pay is available to eligible employees to provide
opportunities for rest, relaxation, and personal pursuits. Employees in the
following employment classification(s) are eligible to earn and use vacation
time as described in this policy:
   (A)   Regular full-time employees. The amount of paid vacation time
employees earn each anniversary year increases with the length of then-
employment as shown in the following schedule:
 
LENGTH OF EMPLOYMENT                NUMBER OF HOURS PER YEAR
After 90 days of employment         16 hours

   (B)   Vacation benefits may be used in minimum increments of one hour. If

hours or more of vacation benefits at least two weeks in advance of the
requested time off. No more than two consecutive weeks of vacation may be taken
at any one time. Requests will be reviewed based on a number of factors,
including business needs and staffing requirements and other extenuating
circumstances. The department head, the Town Manager, and the Clerk-Treasurer
have the authority to approve or deny vacation requests for their respective
departments.
   (C)   Vacation benefits shall be utilized during the benefit year in which
they are earned. Otherwise, earned but unused vacation benefits will be
forfeited. If, however, in the opinion of his or her direct supervisor, the
employee was unable to take his or her vacation benefits due to the workload of
the town, at the discretion of his or her supervisor the employee may be
allowed to extend and use his or her vacation benefits without penalty as soon
as the workload slows down. In such cases, the employee must use the vacation
benefits within 30 calendar days from that time and his or her supervisor must
immediately notify the Clerk-Treasurer’s office of their approval to extend the
employee’s vacation benefits. Payment for these unused vacation benefits will
occur on the payroll period of the extension rather than during the payroll
associated with the employee’s anniversary date.
   (D)   There will be no advances for vacation benefits granted. The town will
pay any employee for earned but unused vacation benefits if the employee elects
to receive pay rather than take time off of work. Payment will be made during
the pay period in which the employment anniversary falls. The total amount of
vacation benefits eligible for payment shall not exceed ten days.
   (E)   Upon voluntary termination of employment, employees shall be entitled
to be paid for up to 80 hours of unused earned vacation benefits, provided the
employee has been employed by the town at least one full year. Vacation
benefits are “earned” upon reaching the employment anniversary date and not
prorated during the year.
   (F)   Vacation benefits are paid at the employee’s base pay rate at the time
of vacation and will be counted as hours worked for the purposes of determining
overtime calculations.

schedule planned personal hours, an employee should request advance approval
from his or her department head. Requests will be reviewed based on a number of
factors, including business needs and staffing requirements.
   (B)   Personal hours will not be accumulative and must be used within the
calendar year. Upon termination of employment unused personal hours will be
forfeited. Personal hours are paid at the employee’s base pay rate at the time
of absence. It does not include overtime, or any special forms of compensation

the preceding Friday. A recognized holiday that falls on a Sunday may be
observed on the following Monday. When Christmas Eve day, or Christmas day
falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the town will designate either the preceding
Friday or following Monday as the official holiday. If a recognized holiday
falls during an eligible employee’s paid time off absence, holiday pay will be
provided instead of the paid time off benefit that would otherwise have
applied.
         (b)   To be eligible to receive holiday pay, the employee must be
present the working day preceding the paid holiday and the first working day
following the paid holiday, or have an excused paid absence.
         (c)   Holiday pay will be calculated based on the employee’s straight-
time pay rate (as of the date of the holiday) times the number of hours the

employees work on a recognized holiday, they will receive holiday pay plus
wages at a rate of time and one-half for the hours worked on that day. Paid
time off for holidays will be counted as hours worked for the purposes of
determining overtime calculations.

§ 35.059 WORKERS’ COMPENSATION INSURANCE.
   (A)   The town provides a comprehensive workers’ compensation insurance
program at no cost to employees. This program covers any injury or illness
sustained in the course of employment that requires medical, surgical, or
hospital treatment. Subject to applicable federal and state legal requirements,
workers’ compensation insurance may provide benefits after a short waiting
period or, if the employee is hospitalized, immediately.
   (B)   An employee who sustains work-related injuries or illnesses must
inform his or her department head, the Town Manager, and the Clerk-Treasurer
immediately. No matter how minor an on-the-job injury may appear, it is
important that it be reported immediately. This will enable an eligible
employee to qualify for coverage as quickly as possible. At the time the injury
occurs, the need to see a doctor will be determined. Within 72 hours of the
incident report being submitted, a workers’ compensation insurance form must be
completed by the involved employee, or if necessary, by the department head. A
person assigned by the department head may help the employee in the completion
of the appropriate forms. The town may select the physician and/or facility
seeing all workplace injuries and in accordance with state laws. Reports of
injury are necessary to comply with federal and state laws and initiate
insurance and workers’ compensation benefits. Failure to notify a department
head, the Town Manager, and the Clerk-Treasurer about a work-related injury or
illness immediately may result in an employee losing workers’ compensation
benefits with regards to that particular injury or illness. In addition,
disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment may be
initiated when failing to report an injury.
   (C)   Any employee injured on the job, who must leave the worksite, may be
subject to a drug and alcohol test. Refusal to submit or positive results may

   (D)   The town maintains an aggressive return-to-work program. Following an
appointment with a physician, the physician will communicate to the Clerk-
Treasurer’s office any restrictions the employee may have as a result of the
injury or illness. The department head, the Town Manager, or the Clerk-
Treasurer will determine what accommodations may be made to assign the employee
to restricted work duty. If no work is available to satisfy the restrictions,
the Clerk-Treasurer’s office will maintain close communications between the
employee and physician to ensure proper and timely treatment for the injury or
illness. The town will return the employee to work as soon as he or she is
either released with restrictions that may be accommodated by the town or fully
released, whichever comes first. The employee must be accompanied by a

release from the health care provider will be considered to have voluntarily
terminated employment as of the date of the release.

for any other employer during a workers’ compensation disability leave must
report such work immediately to his or her department head, the Town Manager,
or the Clerk-Treasurer’s office. An employee who works in one of the above
capacities at any time during his or her workers’ compensation disability leave
performing work of a like or similar character or exertion as that which the
employee performed for the town may be considered to have voluntarily
terminated his or her employment as the date such employment began.
   (G)   Employees may not benefit from the disability any greater than they
would have during normal work conditions. The town will follow all other
federal and state employment-related policies that run concurrent with workers’
compensation guidelines, such as FMLA, ADAAA, and the like.
   (H)   Employees may contact the Clerk-Treasurer’s office for additional
information regarding workers’ compensation insurance.

WORK CONDITIONS AND HOURS
§ 35.100 SAFETY.
   (A)   To assist in providing a safe and healthful work environment for
employees, residents, customers of town services, and visitors, the town has
established a workplace safety program. This program is a top priority for the
town. Individual departments have responsibility for implementing,
administering, monitoring, and evaluating the safety program. Its success
depends on the alertness and personal commitment of all.
   (B)   Each employee is expected to comply with occupational safety and
health standards and all rules and regulations governed by the state, and
orders issued relative to the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), which
are applicable to his or her own actions.
   (C)   All employees must wear the appropriate personal protective equipment
(PPE) required to perform their job safely or while in certain designated areas
of the work environment. If an employee is unsure what PPE he or she is
required to wear at any given time he or she should consult his or her
department head, or the Town Manager.
   (D)   If an accident results in an injury, no matter how minor the injury
may be, employees are required to report the incident to their department head,
the Town Manager, or the Clerk-Treasurer. At the time the injury occurs, the
need to see a doctor will be determined. All workplace injuries will be seen by
a physician and/or facility selected by the town and in accordance with state
laws. Reports of injury are necessary to comply with both federal and state
laws and initiate insurance and workers’ compensation benefits. In the event
that an employee does not report an accident or injury, there may be a delay in
the benefits paid, including the possibility that medical bills will not be
paid at all. Refer to Policy #306—Workers’ Compensation Insurance (§
35.059) for additional information.
   (E)   Any employee injured on the job may be subject to a drug and alcohol
test. Refusal to submit or positive results may result in disciplinary action,
up to and including termination of employment. Refer to Policy #702—Drugs and
Alcohol Use/Testing (§
35.151) for additional information.
   (F)   Some of the best safety improvement ideas come from employees. Those
with ideas, concerns, or suggestions for improved safety in the workplace are
encouraged to discuss them with their department head, or with the Town
Manager. Reports and concerns about workplace safety issues may be made
anonymously if the employee wishes. All reports may be made without fear of
reprisal.
   (F)   Each employee is expected to obey safety rules and to exercise caution
in all work activities. Employees must immediately report any unsafe condition
to the appropriate department head. Employees who violate safety standards, who
cause hazardous or dangerous situations, or who fail to report, or remedy such
situations, may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment.

town services, and visitors.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.103 OVERTIME/COMPENSATORY TIME/FLEX-TIME.
   (A)   (1)   When operating requirements or other needs cannot be met during
regular working hours, employees will be given the opportunity for overtime
work assignments. All overtime work must receive the department head’s prior
authorization and approval. Overtime assignments will be distributed as
equitably as practical to all employees qualified to perform the required work.
      (2)   Overtime compensation will be paid to nonexempt employees in
accordance with federal and state wage and hour restrictions for any time
worked over 40-hours in a standard workweek. Overtime pay is based on actual
hours worked. Vacation, holidays, and bereavement leave will be considered
hours worked for purposes of performing overtime calculations. However, all
other paid time off, e.g., sick leave benefits, personal hour benefits, and the
like, will not be considered hours worked for the purpose of performing
overtime calculations.
   (B)   Compensatory time.
      (1)   In lieu of paying overtime to eligible employees, the town may
recognize the use of “compensatory time” for nonexempt employees. Compensatory
time will be paid at one and one-half hours for each hour worked over 40-hours
in a standard workweek. Employees must request the use of compensatory time
from their direct supervisor. Department heads will keep verifiable records of
overtime worked which will include the date, hours worked, reason for the
overtime and a record of compensatory time used. Employees will be permitted to
use compensatory time off as long as the use of compensatory time does not
“unduly disrupt” the operation of the town.
      (2)   All compensatory time must be used during the year in which it was
earned and may not be carried over from year-to-year. Nonexempt employees will
be paid out for any unused compensatory time at the end of the calendar year.
Upon termination of employment, employees will be paid for all accrued, but
unused compensatory time in accordance with the standards set forth in the Fair
Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
      (3)   Eligible employees will receive compensation based on their regular
pay rate in effect when the compensatory time off is actually taken. The town
may also elect to apply earned compensatory time off to hours missed due to a
personal leave of absence, short workweeks, layoffs, and medical leaves, if not
covered by paid vacation, sick leave benefits, or personal hour benefits. In
periods of slow work, it may be necessary to schedule time off, to which earned
compensatory time will be applied.
   (C)   Flex time. In certain situations, an employee may request permission
from his or her direct supervisor to work an adjusted or flexible work
schedule. The schedule must not cause a reduction in the ability of that
employee’s department to properly perform its duties and responsibilities and
is considered time for time taken within the same workweek. Further, the
establishment of a flexible schedule will not result in the need to hire other
employees, or the use of overtime to cover those “traditional” hours not worked
by the employee working a flexible schedule. A flexible schedule may allow for
nonexempt employees to work more than eight-hours in a day but must not exceed
40 hours in a week. Nonexempt employees will be eligible for overtime pay for
all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in one workweek.
   (D)   Police Department employees.
      (1)   Police officers are required to provide protection 24 hours a day,
seven days per week. In light of the special responsibilities that the Police
Department has in providing continuous, uninterrupted service, special policies
apply to the methods in which overtime is provided.
      (2)   Full-time police officers of the Police Department who are engaged
in law enforcement activities will be compensated in accordance with the
Section 7(k) partial overtime pay exemption of the Fair Labor Standards Act
(FLSA), In conjunction with the use of Section 7(k), the town further adopts
the use of a 14-day “work period” for the purposes of determining compensation
for overtime hours worked. Based upon the forgoing, the annual base pay rate
for full-time employees of the Police Department as set forth in the town’s
annual salary ordinance constitutes straight-time compensation for all
regularly scheduled hours of employment during each “work period.” Full-time
police officers of the Police Department will be paid straight time
compensation for up to 86 hours of regular employment during each “work
period.” Overtime pay will be accrued for all time worked in excess of 86 hours
during a “work period.” Overtime earned during a “work period” will be paid in
the first regularly scheduled paycheck issued subsequent to the “work period”
in which the extra compensation was earned.
   (E)   Fire Department employees.
      (1)   The responsibility and work schedule of employees of the Fire
Department are dramatically different compared to those of other municipal
departments. In light of the special demands placed on members of the Fire
Department, certain special policies and procedures have been adopted to fairly
address the needs of the Department.
      (2)   Full-time employees of the Fire Department who are engaged in fire
protection activities may be compensated in accordance with the Section 7(k)
partial overtime pay exemption of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). In
conjunction with the use of Section 7(k), the town further adopts the use of a
14-day “work period” for the purposes of determining compensation for overtime
hours worked. Based upon the forgoing, the annual base pay rate for full-time
employees of the Fire Department as set forth in the town’s annual salary
ordinance constitutes straight-time compensation for all regularly scheduled
hours of employment during each “work period.” All full-time employees of the
Fire Department will be paid overtime pay at the rate of one and one-half times
the regular rate for all hours worked in excess of 106 hours during the work
period. Overtime earned during a “work period” will be paid in the first
regularly scheduled paycheck issued subsequent to the “work period” in which
the extra compensation was earned.

§ 35.104 USE OF TOWN-OWNED EQUIPMENT, MACHINES, TOOLS, AND VEHICLES.
   (A)   Equipment, machines, tools, and vehicles essential in accomplishing
job duties are expensive and may be difficult to replace. When using town
property, employees are expected to exercise care, perform required
maintenance, and follow all operating instructions, safety standards, and
guidelines. Employees should notify a department head if any town-owned
equipment, machines, tools, or vehicles appear to be damaged, defective, or in
need of repair. Prompt reporting of damages, defects, and the need for repairs
could prevent deterioration of equipment and possible injury to employees or
others. Department heads may answer any questions about an employee’s
responsibility for maintenance and care of equipment, machines, tools, and
vehicles used on the job.
   (B)   It is expected that employees return all town-owned equipment,
machines, tools, and vehicles to the town in a clean manner and in proper
working condition. The improper, careless, negligent, destructive, or unsafe
use or operation of equipment, machines, tools, or vehicles, as well as
excessive or avoidable traffic and parking violations, may result in
disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
   (C)   Employees who are assigned or have access to a town-owned vehicle must
at all times maintain a current valid Indiana operator’s license. Employees
failing to maintain a current valid operator’s license will be prohibited from
operating any motor vehicle while performing any duties on behalf of the town.
Employees are responsible for knowing the status of their operator’s license
and shall immediately notify his or her immediate supervisor if his or her
operator’s license has been suspended, revoked or become invalid in any way.
   (D)   In order to ensure compliance with the foregoing requirements, each
employee driver shall provide the Town Manager, and the Clerk-Treasurer a copy
of his or her operator’s license and in January of each year, shall consent to
a driver’s license record check. It is the responsibility of the Town Manager
and the Clerk-Treasurer to obtain and review an Indiana Bureau of Motor
Vehicles driver’s license abstract for all existing employee drivers in January
of each year and more frequently if it is determined to be necessary.
   (E)   Prior to obtaining the driver record of an employee driver, a written
authorization will be obtained from that employee driver. Any time any of the
above actions are taken, the employee driver will be provided with a Pre-
Adverse Action Disclosure which includes a copy of the driver’s Driving History
Report (MVR) and a copy of A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit
Reporting Act. In addition, that employee driver will be given notice either
orally; in writing or electronically that the action has been taken in an
Adverse Action Notice.
   (F)   Each employee driver is required to operate motor vehicles in a safe
and legal manner whether on or off duty with the town. This includes the use of
seatbelts by all employee drivers and their passengers at all times required by
law and compliance with any restrictions on the employee driver’s operator’s
license. Any employee who is found guilty, determined to have committed, or had
a bond forfeited for or in regard to an offense for which points may be charged
under 140 IAC 1-4.5-10 shall immediately report that fact to the Clerk-
Treasurer and Town Manager. This requirement shall apply to all offenses
described above regardless of whether the offense is committed while the
employee driver is on or off duty with the town.

§ 35.105 TAKE-HOME VEHICLES.
   (A)   The town allows employees in certain management and professional
positions to take town-owned vehicles home on a regular basis. In general, the
town extends this benefit to Public Safety employees whose responsibilities
include a 24-hour on-call requirement, and other employees who would be
required to return to the town in the event of an emergency or serious
incident. The purpose of this policy is to set forth the guidelines under which
town-owned vehicles may be used.
   (B)   Only employees who have the responsibility to respond to an emergency
on a 24-hour a day basis are authorized to take home a town-owned vehicle. If
such responsibilities are rotated, the individual on-call is authorized to take
a town-owned vehicle home.
   (C)   Take-home vehicles are to be driven to and from work only and not for
personal use. An employee may be allowed to pick up or drop off family members
while either traveling to work from home or to home from work. The exception
must create a minimal interruption in the initial route of travel. Also allowed
may be stops at pharmacies, gas stations, grocery stores or other essential
locations, provided that they create a minimal interruption in the original
route of travel. The employee is not to give permission for the vehicle to be
driven by any other person at any time, including family members.
   (D)   Employees shall not consume any alcoholic beverages before or while
operating any town owned vehicle at any time. Employees must always also remain
in compliance with the town’s Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (section 6.021)
when operating a vehicle. Smoking is prohibited in all town vehicles. Refer to
Policy #702—Drug and Alcohol Use/Testing (§
35.151) and Policy #505—Non-Smoking (§
35.102) for additional information.
   (E)   Excluding Police Department and Fire Department employees, employees
living outside a 20-mile radius from the town’s jurisdictional boundaries are
not entitled to use a take-home vehicle unless otherwise approved by the Town
Manager. Any vehicle owned by the town and used by an employee will display a
town decal except for those vehicles designated by the department head and
approved by the Town Manager.
   (F)   IRS guidelines. According to the U.S. Department of Internal Revenue
Services (IRS) certain take-home vehicle benefits are treated as taxable
income. The IRS guidelines require employers to include in employee wages $3
per workday for this taxable fringe benefit. The Payroll Department will apply
$3 of taxable fringe benefit for each day the participating employee uses a
take-home vehicle in the bi-weekly paycheck.
   (G)   Police Department.
      (1)   With the continued emphasis on community policing and reduction of
crime in the town, a take-home car program is available for full-time members
of the Police Department to be used while on-duty and to and from his or her
residence. Full-time officers who live within a ten mile radius of the town
limits have the opportunity to participate in the take-home vehicle program.
      (2)   While operating the police vehicle on duty, officers are bound by
provisions of all written directives to the operations of a departmentally
owned vehicle. In addition to existing Police Department policy, town
ordinances, and state laws, and the guidelines set forth in this policy must be
observed by all members of the Police Department. Officers will not operate any
Police Department vehicle if they have been taking restrictive prescription
medicine or are under the influence of any alcohol. (Refer to SOP 2-4.03 - 2-
4.06).
      (3)   The vehicle may be operated only by the assigned officer, police
reserves, or a mechanic. Vehicles will be permitted outside the limits upon
approval from the Town Marshal, or his or her designee. This includes any
school or official business to be attended by Police Department members.
Officers must have their vehicle radio on, approved firearm, handcuffs,
identification, and clip on badge at all times when operating the vehicle.
Officers must assist with any incident or situation requiring immediate action,
e.g., the giving of first aid, standing by a hazardous scene until other
officers arrive, or the commission of a felony or other serious offenses with
due regard.
      (4)   Officers must be dressed in an appropriate manner when operating
the vehicle. Attire should be sensible in nature and not to cause embarrassment
to the Police Department. Shirt and shoes must be worn at all times.
      (5)   Officers are responsible for maintaining the entire vehicle in a
clean condition and will ensure the vehicle receives preventative maintenance
as scheduled. The vehicle will be inspected every 30 days by the Town Marshal
and an inspection form will be filled out and placed into the vehicle record.
Vehicles must have preventative maintenance every 3,000 to 4,000 miles at the
Police Department services center, and should be serviced, fueled, and washed
during on-duty time. No overtime will be given for preventative maintenance,
washing, or fueling of take-home vehicles. Any services work outside of
preventative maintenance shall be made by a maintenance request and approved by
the Town Marshal.
      (6)   Officers are responsible for obtaining and maintaining the
equipment and supplies required by written directives for the vehicle. An
officer may install additional equipment but, must not interfere with the
operation of the air bag system. All equipment additions or modifications will
be requested in writing and approved by the Town Marshal prior to installing
the equipment in the vehicle.
      (7)   The sworn police officer is financially responsible for all
negligent damages to the take-home vehicle while it is parked at the officer’s
place of residence. Officers leaving town for one week or more will secure the
take-home vehicle at the Police Department.
      (8)   If an officer is suspended, it is the Town Marshal’s responsibility
to secure the vehicle at the police station until the suspension is no longer
in effect.
      (9)   If the vehicle must be taken out of service, the Town Marshal will
be contacted and arrangements will be made for a commission to be used. The
take-home vehicles may be taken away temporarily or permanently for failing any
component of inspection or any violation of the Police Department. The Town
Marshal may reassign the use of an issued take-home vehicle on a temporary or
permanent basis.

§ 35.107 EMERGENCY CLOSINGS.
   (A)   At times, emergencies such as severe weather, fires, power failures,

circumstances may require the closing of a work facility. In the event that
such an emergency occurs during nonworking hours the town will notify employees
of the closing via text message.
   (B)   When the decision to close is made after the workday has begun,
employees will receive official notification from their department head. In
these situations, time off from scheduled work will be unpaid. When the

work will be unpaid. However, with approval from a department head, employees
may use available vacation or personal hour benefits to cover the absence.
   (C)   Employees in essential operations may be asked to work on a day when
operations are officially closed. In these circumstances, employees who work
will receive regular pay for all hours worked on that day.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.108 TELECOMMUTING EMPLOYEES.
   (A)   Telecommuting allows employees to work from home occasionally or for a
portion of their regular workweek. Telecommuting is a voluntary work
alternative that may be appropriate for certain employees and certain jobs.
Telecommuting is not an entitlement or a town-wide benefit and it in no way
changes the terms and conditions of employment with the town.
   (B)   Telecommuting arrangements are made on a case-by-case basis, focusing
first on the business needs of the town. All telecommuting arrangements must
have the advanced approval from the Town Manager, or the Town Council prior to
implementation. The employee and his or her supervisor may agree on the number
of days of telecommuting allowed each week, the work schedule the employee
customarily maintains, and the manner and frequency of communication. The
employee agrees to be accessible by phone within a reasonable time period
during the agreed-upon work schedule. The Town Manager, or the Town Council,
reserves the right to terminate any telecommuting arrangement with any employee
at any time. For employees who are permitted to telecommute, the guidelines
contained in this policy should be followed.
   (C)   Each telecommuting employee must make arrangements with the Town
Manager, or the Town Council, regarding the use of company-owned equipment in
the employee’s home or in a satellite location. In no event may the use of that
equipment impede the town’s access to the equipment, nor change the town’s
ownership of the equipment. Town-owned equipment is to be used for work
purposes only. The employee may be required to sign an inventory of all
company-owned equipment and must agree to take appropriate action to protect
the items from damage and theft.
   (D)   Telecommuting employees should be aware that the town is not
responsible for insuring the telecommuter’s equipment in their home and that
the town reserves the right to make determinations as to appropriate equipment,
subject to change at any time. If the employee is using his or her own
equipment and it breaks while performing work for the town, the town is not
liable for incurred replacement costs. Upon termination of employment all town-
owned equipment must be returned to the town unless other arrangements have
been made.
   (E)   The town may reimburse the employee for other work-related expenses
such as phone calls and shipping costs that are reasonably incurred in
accordance with job responsibilities.
   (F)   Employees who work remotely may refer to Policy #516—Computer and
Email Usage (§
35.112) and Policy #517—Internet Usage ( §
35.113) for additional information. Employees may contact the Town Manager for
additional information regarding telecommuting.

   (A)   The town may reimburse employees for reasonable business travel
expenses, e.g., meal, lodging, mileage, and air travel expenses while traveling
on approved town-related business. Employees whose travel plans have been
approved are responsible for making their own travel arrangements or may ask
for assistance from the Clerk-Treasurer’s office.
   (B)   When approved, the actual costs of travel, meals, lodging, and other
expenses directly related to accomplishing business travel objectives may be

public transportation for other ground travel.
      (4)   Taxi fares, only when there is no less expensive alternative.
      (5)   Mileage costs for use of personal cars, only when less expensive

ordinance.
      (6)   Cost of standard accommodations in low to mid-priced hotels, or
similar lodgings.
      (7)   Per diem of $10 per meal, if the meal is not included in the

leased, or rented by the town may not be used for personal use.
   (D)   With prior approval, employees on business travel may be accompanied
by a family member or friend, when the presence of a companion may not
interfere with successful completion of business objectives. Spouses or family
members who accompany an employee are not covered by the policy and are not
entitled to any reimbursement expenses. Generally, employees are also permitted
to combine personal travel with business travel, as long as time away from work
is approved. Additional expenses arising from such non-business travel are the
responsibility of the employee.
   (E)   When travel is completed, employees should submit completed travel
expense reports within ten days to the Clerk-Treasurer’ office. Department
heads must review and sign all expense reports before submission for payment to
the Clerk-Treasurer’s office. Reports must be accompanied by receipts for all
individual expenses.
   (F)   Employees should contact their supervisor for guidance and assistance
on procedures related to travel arrangements, expense reports, reimbursement
for specific expenses, or any other business travel issues.
   (G)   Abuse of this business travel expenses policy, including falsifying
expense reports to reflect costs not incurred by the employee, may be grounds
for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

unauthorized visitors helps maintain safety standards, protects against theft,
ensures security of equipment, protects confidential information, safeguards
employee welfare, and avoids potential distractions and disturbances.
   (B)   VISITORS are defined as persons at a town-owned facility for social
reasons or any purpose other than directly job related. Employees are
responsible for the conduct and safety of their visitors. All visitors should
enter at the main entrance of each facility. Authorized visitors will receive

carrying the town brand identity are and will be owned and licensed by the
town, as appropriate. Personal accounts, blogs, web pages and related content
that do not carry the town’s brand identity may be owned, licensed and operated
by any employee. If the town is referenced in any media as approved by the Town
Council, all social media guidelines must apply or employees may be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
   (C)   All employees should consider the following guidelines when posting on

both the employee and the town.
      (5)   Do respect the laws regarding copyrights, trademarks, rights of
publicity and other third-party rights. To minimize the risk of a copyright
violation, employees should provide references to the source(s) of information
they use and accurately cite copyrighted works they identify in our online
communications. Do not infringe on town logos, brand names, taglines, slogans,
or other trademarks.
      (6)   If a negative post or comment is found online about the town or an
employee, try not to counter with another negative post. Remedy the situation
through a positive action.
      (7)   If an employee publishes content to any website outside of the
town’s official online presence (this may include town websites as well as the
town’s presence on third-party sites) and it has something to do with subjects
associated with the town, consider a disclaimer such as this:
         “The postings are my own and do not necessarily represent the town’s
positions, strategies or opinions.”

employees should not expect privacy of any information transmitted. Employees
are also required to provide the town with all passwords used to access the
internet via town equipment, services and technology, as requested by a
department head, the Clerk-Treasurer, or the Town Manager.
   (E)   While this policy is comprehensive, it is not all inclusive. Employees

disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Nothing in
this policy shall be interpreted to prohibit or otherwise restrict concerted
activities by employees that are protected by law.

an ethical and respectful manner.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.115 SPEAKING TO THE MEDIA.
   (A)   The town strives to anticipate and manage crisis situations in order
to reduce disruption to employees and to have met and to maintain the town’s

speaking to the media.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.116 WORKPLACE VIOLENCE PREVENTION.
   (A)   The town is committed to preventing workplace violence and to
maintaining a safe work environment. The town has adopted the following
guidelines to deal with intimidation, harassment, or other threats of (or
actual) violence that may occur during working hours or on its premises.
   (B)   Employees should be treated with courtesy and respect at all times.
Employees are expected to refrain from fighting, “horseplay,” or other conduct
that may be dangerous to others. Firearms, weapons, and other dangerous or
hazardous devices or substances are prohibited from being brought into the
facilities operated by the town without proper authorization.
   (C)   All threats of (or actual) violence, both direct and indirect, should
be reported as soon as possible to a department head, the Town Manager, or the
Clerk-Treasurer. This includes threats by employees, as well as threats by
residents, customers of town services, vendors, solicitors, or other members of
the public. When reporting a threat of violence, employees should be as
specific and detailed as possible.
   (D)   All suspicious individuals or activities should also be reported as
soon as possible to a department head, the Town Manager, or the Clerk-
Treasurer. Employees should not place themselves in harm’s way. If an employee
sees or hears a commotion or disturbance near his or her workstation, they
should not try to intercede or see what is happening.
   (E)   The town will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of
threats of (or actual) violence and of suspicious individuals or activities.
The identity of the individual making a report will be protected as much as is
practical. In order to maintain workplace safety and the integrity of its
investigation, the town may suspend employees, either with or without pay,
pending investigation. Refer to Policy #716—Progressive Discipline (§
35.159) for additional information.
   (F)   Anyone determined to be responsible for threats of (or actual)
violence or other conduct that is in violation of these guidelines may be
subject to prompt disciplinary action up to and including termination of
employment.
   (G)   The town encourages employees to bring their disputes or differences
with other employees to the attention of their department head before the
situation escalates into potential violence. The town is eager to assist in the
resolution of employee disputes, and will not discipline employees for raising
such concerns.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.117 MOBILE DEVICE USAGE.
   (A)   The town may provide a mobile device allowance for some employees, as
approved by the Town Council, where the urgency of communication requires the
use of such device as a business tool. The allowance is provided to assist
employees in communicating with management and other employees, residents,
customers of town services, vendors, and others with whom they may conduct
business. Departments may establish policies restricting the possession and/or
use of mobile devices in the workplace.
   (B)   Employees may have access to a mobile device while in automobiles and
should remember that their primary responsibility is driving safely and obeying
the rules of the road. Employees are prohibited from using mobile devices to
conduct the town’s business or personal matters while driving a town-owned
vehicle and should safely pull off the road and come to a complete stop before
emailing, texting, accessing data, dialing, or talking on the mobile device.
   (C)   As a representative of the town, mobile device users are reminded that
the regular business etiquette employed when speaking from office phones or in
meetings applies to conversations conducted over a mobile device.
   (D)   Employees are required, as a respect to others in the workplace to
keep the ringers on their personal devices in a silent mode. During working
hours, employees are urged to keep their personal conversations, emailing,
texting, or data access activities brief and kept to only urgent matters when
approved by a department head. Employees are required to conduct lengthy
conversations, emailing, texting and data access activities on their lunch
breaks or during non-working hours. If mobile device usage, to include personal
conversations, emailing, texting, or data access usage is abused, the first
infraction may result in a verbal warning. A second infraction may result in a
written warning and a third or subsequent violation and continued abuse may
result in continued disciplinary action, up to and including termination of
employment. The town reserves the right to ban all mobile device usage during
working hours, if usage becomes problematic.
   (E)   Text messaging with a town-issued device.
      (1)   The term TEXT MESSAGING includes all electronic messages, or
graphics; whether sent by email, instant messaging, mobile device texting, or
other similar technology utilizing a town-issued mobile device.
      (2)   The town recognizes the benefits of text messaging for convenient,
and expedient real-time business communications. These modes of communication
have the potential to be abused, however, resulting in such problems as lost
productivity, harassment, security concerns, and even possible legal liability.
Town employees are strictly prohibited from transmitting messages with obscene,
profane, lewd, derogatory, or potentially harassing/discriminatory content.
Employees may not send messages that they know, or have reason to believe, may
be false or misleading.
      (3)   Furthermore, any text messages sent using a town-issued device
should not be considered private. The town reserves the right to monitor all
such messages. Employees should be aware that these messages are subject to
disclosure to outside third parties. These parties include the court system and
law enforcement agencies. Employees should report any known or suspected
violations of this policy to management for investigation. Violations may
result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
LEAVES OF ABSENCE
§ 35.130 PERSONAL LEAVE.
   (A)   (1)   The Town of Albion may provide leaves of absence without pay to
eligible employees who wish to take time off from work duties to fulfill
personal obligations.
      (2)   Employees in the following employment classification(s) may be
eligible to request a personal leave as described in this policy: regular full-
time employees.
   (B)   A leave of absence may be granted for any reason that is deemed to be
in the best interest of the town or the employee. Examples include job-related
education or medical needs not covered by the FMLA. Written requests must be
submitted to a department head who must then submit the request to the Town
Council for its approval.
   (C)   A leave of absence shall not normally exceed six months, but in
special circumstances and with the approval of the Town Council, may be granted
for a period of up to one year. Each case will be decided on an individual
basis. All paid leave must be exhausted prior to taking a personal leave of
absence. During a personal leave of absence, an employee shall remain eligible
for benefits. However, such benefits shall not accrue for the duration of the
personal leave. An employee may retain his or her insurance benefits through
COBRA if the leave is greater than 90 days and must make arrangements with the
Clerk-Treasurer’s office for the payment of premiums.
   (D)   When a personal leave ends, every reasonable effort will be made to
return the employee to the same position if it is available, or to a similar
available position for which the employee is qualified. However, the town
cannot guarantee reinstatement in all cases. If an employee fails to report to
work promptly at the expiration of the approved leave period, the town will
assume the employee has voluntarily terminated his or her employment. The town
will comply with state laws regarding the use of personal leave.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.131 FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE.
   Under the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended (FMLA),
an employee may be eligible for a period of job-protected unpaid leave if they
meet the criteria set forth in the FMLA.
   (A)   General eligibility. To qualify for FMLA leave an employee:
      (1)   Must be an employee of the town;
      (2)   Must have worked at the town for at least 12 months;
      (3)   Must have worked at least 1,250 hours (paid time off does not count
towards the 1,250 hours) during the past 12-month period before the leave is to
begin; and
      (4)   Must work at a worksite at which the town employs at least 50
employees within a 75-mile radius.
   (B)   Types and duration of FMLA leave; basic FMLA leave and active duty
leave. An employee may be eligible for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in a
rolling 12-month period for the following reasons:
      (1)   The birth of a child and to care for such child or placement for
adoption or foster care of a child;
      (2)   To care for an immediate family member (spouse, child under 18
years old or 18 and over that is incapable of self-care, or parent) with a
serious health condition;
      (3)   Because of a serious health condition which renders an employee
unable to work; or
      (4)   ACTIVE DUTY LEAVE, defined as leave due to any qualifying exigency
arising out of the fact that an employee’s spouse, son (of any age), daughter
(of any age) or parent is a “covered military member.” COVERED MILITARY MEMBER
means a member of the Armed Forces or a member of the Reserves (including the
National Guard or Reserves) who is on “covered active duty,” or has been
notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty. For members of
the Aimed Forces, COVERED ACTIVE DUTY means duty during deployment of the
member with the Armed Forces to a foreign country. For members of the Reserves,
COVERED ACTIVE DUTY means duty during deployment of the member with the Armed
Forces to a foreign country under a call or order to active duty in a
contingency operation.
   (C)   Military caregiver leave.
      (1)   An employee also may take military caregiver leave to care for a
spouse, son (of any age), daughter (of any age), and parent or next of kin
(i.e., closest living relative) who is a “covered service member.” A COVERED
SERVICE MEMBER is (i) a current service member of the Armed Forces or Reserves,
including the National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment,
recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on
the temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness, or (ii)
a veteran of the Armed Forces (including the National Guard and Reserves) who
is discharged (other than dishonorably discharged) within the five-year period
before the eligible employee takes military caregiver leave to care for the
veteran and who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy for a
serious injury or illness. For a current service member, SERIOUS INJURY OR
ILLNESS means an injury or illness incurred or aggravated by the covered
service member in the line of duty on active duty that may cause the service
member to be medically unfit to perform the duties of his or her office, grade,
rank, or rating. For a veteran, SERIOUS INJURY OR ILLNESS means an injury or
illness that rendered the veteran medically unfit to perform his or her
military duties, or an injury or illness that qualifies the veteran for certain
benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs or substantially impairs the
veteran’s ability to work, regardless of whether the injury or illness
manifested before or after the individual became a veteran.
      (2)   Eligible employees are entitled to a total of 26 weeks of unpaid
military caregiver leave during a single 12-month period. This single 12-month
period begins on the first day an eligible employee takes military caregiver
leave and ends 12-months after that date.
      (3)   The leave entitlement described in this division (C) applies on a
per-covered service member, per-injury basis. However, no more than 26 weeks of
leave may be taken within a single 12-month period by any covered employee.
Even in circumstances where an employee takes other leave covered by the
federal FMLA under the basic FMLA leave and active duty leave provisions
(division (B) above, the combined leave may not exceed 26 weeks during that 12-
month period.
   (D)   Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.

medical care facility (including any period of incapacitation or any subsequent
treatment in connection with such in-patient care);
         (b)   A period of incapacitation of more than three consecutive full
calendar days, and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacitation
relating to the same condition that also involves (i) treatment two or more
times by a health care provider or under the supervision of a health care
provider within 30 days of the start of the incapacitation, or (ii) treatment
by a health care provider on at least one occasion within seven days of the

care provider or under the supervision of a health care provider, either for
restorative surgery after an accident or other injury, or for a condition that
will likely result in a period of incapacitation of more than three consecutive
calendar days in the absence of medical intervention or treatment.
   (E)   When spouses work together. A husband and wife, when both are eligible
for FMLA and both work at the town, are eligible for either a combined 12 weeks
of unpaid leave for the birth or placement of a child or to care for a parent
who has a serious health condition. A husband and wife will be eligible for a
combined 26 weeks of unpaid military caregiver leave as discussed above. If the
husband or wife taking military caregiver leave also takes leave for the birth
or placement of a child or to care for a parent who has a serious health
condition, that leave also may count toward the 26 weeks of combined military
caregiver leave during a single 12-month period.
   (F)   Notice of need for FMLA leave.
      (1)   If the leave is foreseeable (birth or placement, planned medical
care, leave due to active duty of immediate family member), the employee must
provide at least 30 days’ advance notice. If circumstances prevent providing
the 30 day’s advance notice, then the employee should provide as much notice as
possible.
      (2)   If an employee fails to give the required notice for foreseeable
leave with no reasonable excuse, the employee may be denied the taking of the
leave until the employee provides adequate notice of need for the leave.
Employees should make every reasonable effort to schedule medical treatments so
as not to disrupt the ongoing operations of the department.
   (G)   Intermittent FMLA leave.
      (1)   Intermittent leave also may be available depending upon an
employee’s serious health condition or an employee’s immediate family member’s
serious health condition. Intermittent or reduced schedule leave for the birth
or placement of a child for adoption or foster care may be taken only with
approval from the Town Council in writing. Military caregiver leave may be
taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically necessary.
Intermittent or reduced leave may not exceed the total hours an employee would
have worked during his or her regular 12-week schedule. If intermittent or
reduced leave is approved, the town may require the employee to schedule the
leave so as not to unduly disrupt its operations, or the employee may be placed
in an alternate position which better accommodates the intermittent leave
schedule.
      (2)   Employees taking intermittent leave must follow the town’s standard
call-in procedures absent unusual circumstances.
   (H)   Documentation supporting FMLA leave.
      (1)   An employee’s reason for the leave must be covered under FMLA and
they must provide a completed FMLA certification of health care provider form
supporting the need for the leave. A request for reasonable documentation of
family relationship verifying the legitimacy of a FMLA leave may also be
required.
      (2)   The employee will have 15 days in which to return a completed
certification form following receipt of the form from the town. If the employee
fails to provide timely certification after being required to do so, they may
be denied the taking of the leave under the FMLA. If the certification form is
incomplete or insufficient, an employee will be given written notification of
the information needed and will have seven days after receiving such written
notice to provide the necessary information.
      (3)   If there is reason to doubt the validity of the medical
certification, a second opinion, at the expense of the town, related to the
health condition may be required. If the original certification and the second
opinion differ, a third opinion, at the expense of the town, may be required.
The opinion of the third health care provider, which the town and the employee
jointly select, will be the final and binding decision.
      (4)   A request for active duty leave must be supported by the
certification of qualifying exigency for military family leave form as well as
appropriate documentation, including the covered military member’s active duty
orders, A request for military caregiver leave must be supported by the
certification for serious injury or illness of covered service member form as
well as any necessary supporting documentation.
   (I)   Recertification. Under certain circumstances as provided by law,
including (but not limited to) situations in which the need or nature of the
approved leave changes, the town may, in its sole discretion, require
recertification of an employee’s serious health condition.
   (J)   Return to work. If an employee’s position is eliminated during his or
her FMLA leave time, e.g., layoff, departmental restructuring, and the like,
the employee will not be entitled to return to his or her former or an
equivalent position. Employees whose FMLA leave was for their own personal
medical condition must, prior to reinstatement, submit a medical certification
to the Clerk-Treasurer as to their ability to return to work, subject to a
second medical opinion as deemed necessary by the town, or a third medical
opinion as provided in the FMLA. Employees who do not return to work
immediately following release from the health care provider as fully restored
to perform all the essential functions of his or her position, will be
considered to have voluntarily terminated employment as of the date of the
release. Employment will be terminated if an employee is not able to return to
work at the end of the FMLA. There may be exceptions to termination
requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act and its amendments
(ADAAA) and the town will comply as appropriate.
   (K)   Substitution of paid leave. Employees must substitute all accrued
vacation, sick leave benefits, and personal hour benefits for unpaid FMLA
leave. FMLA and any paid time off, run concurrently. The entire 12-week FMLA is
not in addition to the paid leave, however, is any remaining portion after the
paid leave time is subtracted. If an employee requires leave in excess of the
weeks for which they are eligible, they will not be assured a position with the
town upon his or her return.
   (L)   Benefits during FMLA leave. During the approved FMLA leave, the
employee’s coverage under the town’s benefits will continue, but if the
employee goes without pay, he or she must pay his or her share of health,
dental, vision, and other-related insurance premiums, if applicable. It is the
employee’s responsibility to make arrangements with the Clerk-Treasurer’s
office to pay his or her portion of the monthly benefit premiums during the
unpaid period of absence. All other benefits will be suspended during the
leave.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.132 MILITARY LEAVE.
   (A)   A military leave of absence will be granted to employees who are
absent from work because of service in the U.S. Uniformed Services in
accordance with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act
(USERRA). Advance notice of military service is required, unless military
necessity prevents such notice or it is otherwise impossible or unreasonable.
   (B)   Employees will continue to receive full pay while on leave for 15-day
training assignments and shorter absences. The portion of any military leaves
of absence in excess of 15 days will be unpaid. However, employees may use any
available vacation or personal hour benefits for the absence.
   (C)   Continuation of health insurance benefits is available as required by
USERRA based on the length of the leave and subject to the terms, conditions
and limitations of the applicable plans for which the employee is otherwise
eligible.
   (D)   Benefit accruals, such as vacation, sick leave benefits, personal hour
benefits, or holiday benefits will be suspended during the leave after the
first 30 days and will resume upon the employee’s return to active employment.
   (E)   Employees on military leave for up to 30 days are required to return
to work for the first regularly scheduled shift after the end of service,
allowing reasonable travel time. Employees on longer military leave must apply
for reinstatement in accordance with USERRA and all applicable state laws.
Employees returning from military leave will be placed in the position they
would have attained had they remained continuously employed or a comparable one
depending on the length of military service in accordance with USERRA. They
will be treated as though they were continuously employed for purposes of
determining benefits based on length of service.
   (F)   Employees may contact the Clerk-Treasurer’s office for additional
information about military leave.

(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.151 DRUGS AND ALCOHOL USE/TESTING.
   (A)   It is the town’s desire to provide a drug-free, healthful, and safe
workplace. To promote this goal, employees are required to report to work in
appropriate mental and physical condition to perform their jobs.
   (B)   While conducting business on behalf of the town no employee may
manufacture, distribute, dispense, possess, purchase, sell, use, or be under
the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs or in possession of drug
paraphernalia. In addition, the unauthorized use or possession of prescription
drugs, CBD oils, or over-the-counter drugs is prohibited. Using or being under
the influence of drugs or alcohol on the job may pose serious safety and health
risks.
   (C)   To help ensure a safe and healthful working environment the town may
utilize a third-party to conduct drug and alcohol testing for the town under
any one of the following circumstances:
      (1)   Reasonable suspicion of current employees;
      (2)   Medical examinations for applicants or current employees, if
appropriate;
      (3)   Post-accident of current employees in accordance with OSHA
regulations;
      (4)   Random testing in accordance with DOT guidelines;
      (5)   Return-to-duty for current employees;
   (D)   Employees may be asked to provide body substance samples, such as
urine, blood, hair and/or saliva, to determine the illicit use of drugs and/or
alcohol. The legal use of prescribed drugs is permitted on the job only if it
does not impair an employee’s ability to perform the essential functions of the
job effectively and in a safe manner that does not endanger other individuals
in the workplace. Employees who are utilizing prescription drugs or CBD oils at
the time of the testing will be required to inform the testing facility of
those legally prescribed drugs or CBD oils that they are currently taking. This
information will be considered confidential under the guidelines of the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Refer to Policy
#214—Medical Information Privacy (§
35.042).
   (E)   Employees who are not able to provide sufficient body substance
samples will be evaluated by a physician selected by the town. If the physician
cannot find a legitimate medical explanation for the inability to provide a
body substance sample, it will be considered a refusal to test. In that
circumstance, the employee has violated one of the prohibitions of the policy.
   (F)   Both drug and alcohol testing may be performed on an employee
following any accident involving a fatality or any accident in which the driver
receives a citation under any state or local law for a moving traffic violation
arising from an accident and in accordance with OSHA regulations. An ACCIDENT
is defined as an incident involving a vehicle in which there is a fatality, an
injury treated away from the scene, or where the vehicle is towed from the
scene. When a post-accident drug or alcohol test is required it should be
performed as soon as possible following the accident. If no alcohol collection
may be made within eight hours, attempts to collect a breath sample will cease
and if no urine collection may be obtained for within 32 hours, attempts to
make such a collection will cease. As with any accident or injury, employees
are required to contact their department head, the Town Manager, or the Clerk-
Treasurer immediately. Refer to Policy #501—Safety (§
35.100) and Policy #306—Workers’ Compensation Insurance (§
35.059) for additional information.
   (G)   Random testing may result in employees being selected in successive
selections or more than once in a calendar year. Alternatively, some employees
may not be selected in a calendar year. Any employee scheduled for a random
test will be required to immediately proceed to the testing facility to submit
for the test. If the employee is not present at work on that day, they are
required to proceed to the testing facility on the next day that they are at
work. Refusal to participate will be considered as the employee violating one
of the prohibitions of the policy.
   (H)   Return-to-duty testing may be required for employees who want to
return to work after being off of work due to a leave of absence, suspension,
or other long-term reason. Testing in this circumstance will be determined at
the discretion of the department head, the Town Manager, or the Clerk-
Treasurer.
   (I)   However, refusal to participate will be considered as the employee
violating one of the prohibitions of the policy.
   (J)   Violations of this policy and/or substitution, adulteration or refusal
to submit to drug and/or alcohol testing may lead to the rescinding of an
employment offer to an applicant, disciplinary action, up to and including
immediate termination of employment, and/or required participation in a
substance abuse rehabilitation or treatment program for current employees. Such
violations may also have legal consequences and the town will cooperate with
all law enforcement officials.
   (K)   When a positive test is received by the town a first offense means
that the employee may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment.
   (L)   If the employee receives either a verbal or written documented form of
progressive discipline or is suspended after a positive test result, he or she
must submit to another test and have a negative result within six weeks from
the date he or she was tested positive for drugs and/or alcohol. The town will
decide when the test will be administered. Before the employee returns to work,
after the testing, he or she will be required to sign a reinstatement agreement
that states under what conditions the employee will be reinstated and that
random drug testing may be conducted on that employee up to one year. Any
subsequent positive results will result in immediate termination of employment.
   (M)   If the employee believes that the drug and/or alcohol test has
produced a false positive, the employee may at his or her own expense submit
for another drug test. If the re-test produces a negative result, the employee
may be reinstated if the town is satisfied that the re-test conforms to the
scientifically accepted methods and procedures for collection.
   (N)   Under the Drug-Free Workplace Act, an employee who performs work for a
government contract or grant must notify his or her department head, the Clerk-
Treasurer, or the Town Manager of a criminal conviction for drug-related
activity occurring in the workplace. The report must be made within five days
of the conviction.
   (O)   Employees should contact their department head, the Town Manager, or
the Clerk-Treasurer if they have questions on this policy or issues related to
drugs or alcohol use/testing. Employees may raise their concerns without fear
of reprisal.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.152 SEXUAL AND OTHER UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT.
   The town is committed to developing a work environment free of unlawful
harassment and discrimination. Each individual has the right to work in a
professional atmosphere that promotes equal employment opportunities and
prohibits discriminatory practices, including harassment. Therefore, the town
expects that all relationships among persons will be business-like and free of
bias, prejudice, and harassment.
   (A)   Equal employment opportunity. It is the policy of the town to ensure
equal employment opportunity without discrimination or harassment on the basis
of race, color, religion, sex (pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual
orientation), national origin, age (40 and over), disability, genetic
information as referenced in the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act
(GINA), military service veteran status, or any other characteristic protected
by federal, state and local laws. The town prohibits any such harassment or
discrimination.
   (B)   Definitions of harassment.
      (1)   (a)   Sexual harassment constitutes discrimination and is illegal
under federal, state and local laws. For the purpose of this policy, SEXUAL
HARASSMENT is defined, as in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
Guidelines, as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other
verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when, for example: (1) submission
to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of
an individual’s employment; (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by
an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such
individual; or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating
or offensive working environment.
         (b)   SEXUAL HARASSMENT may include a range of subtle and not so
subtle behaviors and may involve individuals of the same or different gender.
Depending on the circumstances, these behaviors may include, but are not
limited to: unwanted sexual advances or requests for sexual favors; sexual
jokes and innuendo; improper use of email or voicemail; verbal abuse of a
sexual nature; comments about an individual’s body, sexual prowess or sexual
deficiencies; leering, whistling or touching; insulting or obscene comments or
gestures; display in the work place of sexually suggestive objects or pictures
including screen savers or improper emails or attachments; and other physical,
verbal or visual conduct of a sexual nature.
      (2)   (a)   Harassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic
is also strictly prohibited. Under this policy, HARASSMENT is verbal or
physical conduct that derogates or shows hostility or aversion toward an
individual on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (pregnancy, gender
identity, or sexual orientation), national origin, age (40 and over),
disability, genetic information as referenced in the Genetic Information
Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), military service veteran status, or any other
characteristic protected by federal, state, or local laws or that of his or her
relatives, friends, or associates, and that: (1) has the purpose or effect of
creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; (2) has the
purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work
performance; or (3) otherwise adversely affects an individual’s employment
opportunities.
         (b)   Harassing conduct includes, but is not limited to: epithets,
slurs, or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating or hostile acts;
derogatory jokes; and written or graphic material that derogates or shows
hostility or aversion toward an individual or group or that is placed on walls
or elsewhere on the employer’s premises or circulated in the workplace.
      (3)   Individuals found to be performing such harassing conduct may be
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
   (C)   Individuals and conduct covered.
      (1)   These policies apply to all employees, whether related to conduct
engaged in by fellow employees or someone not directly connected to the town
such as a resident, customer of town services, outside vendor, or consultant.
      (2)   Conduct prohibited by these policies is unacceptable in the
workplace and in any work-related setting outside the workplace, such as during
business trips, business meetings, and business-related social events.
   (D)   Retaliation is prohibited. The town encourages reporting of all
perceived incidents of harassment or discrimination. It is the policy of the
town to investigate such reports. The town prohibits retaliation against any
individual who reports harassment or discrimination, or participates in an
investigation of such reports.
   (E)   Reporting an incident of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation.
      (1)   The town encourages reporting of all perceived incidents of
harassment, discrimination, or retaliation, regardless of the offender’s
identity or position. Individuals who believe that they have been the victims
of harassing conduct should discuss their concerns with their department head,
the Town Manager, or the Clerk-Treasurer.
      (2)   In addition, the town encourages individuals who believe they are
being subjected to such conduct to promptly advise the offender that his or her
behavior is unwelcome and request that it be discontinued. Often this action
alone will resolve the problem. The town recognizes, however, that an
individual may prefer to pursue the matter through informal or formal complaint
procedures.
   (F)   Complaint procedures.
      (1)   If for any reason an individual does not wish to address the
offender directly, or if addressing the offender does not successfully end the
offensive conduct, the individual should notify his or her department head, the
Town Manager, or the Clerk-Treasurer. In addition, there may be instances in
which an individual seeks only to discuss matters with one of the town
designated representatives, and such discussion is encouraged.
      (2)   An individual reporting harassment, discrimination, or retaliation
should be aware however, that the town may find it necessary to take action to
address such conduct beyond an informal discussion. This decision will be
discussed with the individual.
      (3)   As noted above, individuals who believe they have been the victims
of conduct prohibited by this policy statement or believe they have witnessed
such conduct should discuss their concerns with their department head, the Town
Manager, or the Clerk-Treasurer.
      (4)   The town encourages the prompt reporting of complaints or concerns
so that rapid and corrective action may be taken before relationships become
irreparably damaged. Therefore, while no fixed reporting period has been
established, early reporting and intervention have proven to be the most
effective method of resolving actual or perceived incidents of harassment.
      (5)   Any reported allegations of harassment, discrimination, or
retaliation will be investigated promptly. The investigation may include
individual interviews with the parties involved and, where necessary, with
individuals who may have observed the alleged conduct or may have other
relevant knowledge.
      (6)   Retaliation against an individual for reporting harassment or
discrimination, or for participation in an investigation of a claim of
harassment or discrimination is a serious violation of this policy and, like
harassment or discrimination itself, may be subject to disciplinary action, up
to and including termination of employment. Acts of retaliation should be
reported immediately and will be investigated and corrective action taken
promptly. Corrective action may include retraining, referral to counseling,
and/or disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment,
withholding of a promotion or pay increase, reassignment, or temporary
suspension without pay as deemed appropriate under the circumstances.
      (7)   If a party to a complaint does not agree with its resolution, that
party may appeal to the Town Council.
   (G)   Confidentiality. The town will make all reasonable efforts to maintain
the confidentiality of all parties involved in a harassment investigation.
Confidentiality, however, cannot be guaranteed. For example, some details or
identities may need to be revealed in order to fully investigate the harassment
complaint.
   (H)   False claims of sexual harassment, retaliation, and/or discrimination.
In order to cover all possibilities of misconduct, the town reserves the right
to discipline employees who have falsely accused another of sexual harassment,
retaliation, and/or discrimination. This does not mean that a complaint will be
considered false solely because it cannot be corroborated.
   (I)   Conclusion.
      (1)   The town has developed this policy to ensure that all its employees
may work in an environment free from harassment, discrimination, and
retaliation. The town will make every reasonable effort to ensure that all
necessary persons are familiar with these policies and aware that any complaint
in violation of such policies will be investigated and resolved appropriately.
      (2)   Finally, these policies should not, and may not, be used as a basis
for excluding or separating individuals of a particular gender, or any other
protected characteristic, from participating in business or work-related social
activities or discussions. In other words, no one should make the mistake of
engaging in discrimination or exclusion in order to avoid allegations of
harassment. The law and the policies of the town prohibit disparate treatment
on the basis of sex or any other protected characteristic, with regard to
terms, conditions, privileges and prerequisites of employment. The prohibitions
against harassment, discrimination, and retaliation are intended to complement
and further those policies, not to form the basis of an exception to them.
Nothing in this policy shall be interpreted to prohibit or otherwise restrict
concerted activities by employees that are protected by law.
      (3)   Employees should speak with the Town Manager, or the Clerk-
Treasurer if they have questions or concerns regarding sexual and other
unlawful harassment.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.153 ATTENDANCE AND PUNCTUALITY.
   (A)   To maintain a safe and productive work environment, the town expects
employees to be reliable and to be punctual in reporting for scheduled work.
Absenteeism and tardiness place a burden on the business operations of the
town.
   (B)   In the rare instances when employees cannot avoid being late to work
or are unable to work as scheduled, they should notify their direct supervisor
prior to the start of their shift, or as soon as possible in advance of the
anticipated tardiness or absence. To cover this missed time, employees may use
available vacation or personal hour benefits. Nonexempt employees may use
available compensatory time. TARDINESS is defined as late arrivals past the
stated starting time for the workday. Thus, late arrivals in a pay period may
result in a written warning. Three written notices in any 12-month period may
result in termination of employment.
   (C)   The Town Manager may occasionally approve flexible working
arrangements for department heads when they are completing administrative
duties.
   (D)   Poor attendance and excessive tardiness are disruptive. Failure to
appear at work without notification and without a reasonable explanation will
be considered as absent without leave and may lead to disciplinary action, up
to and including termination of employment.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.154 PERSONAL APPEARANCE.
   (A)   Dress, grooming, and personal cleanliness standards contribute to the
morale of all employees and affect the business image the town presents to its
residents, customers of town services, and visitors. During working hours or
when representing the town, employees are expected to present a clean, neat,
and tasteful appearance. Employees should dress and groom themselves according
to the requirements of their position and accepted social standards. This is
particularly true if a job involves dealing with residents, customers of town
services, or visitors in person.
   (B)   (1)   Utility, Park, Police, and Fire Department employees are
required to wear uniforms that meet OSHA standards and shall keep, maintain,
and wear said uniform as specified by the supervisor and approved by the Town
Council as a result of the annual budget process. Said uniform is not to be
worn in public, when off-duty, except when traveling to and from work, unless
expressly authorized by the department head.
      (2)   The town supplies uniforms to all Utility and Park Department
employees. Utility Department uniforms are laundered by a professional laundry
services weekly at the town’s expense. When an individual terminates his or her
employment with the town, his or her uniforms must be returned to the
department head. Each Utility Department employee is also issued a coat.
Laundering of the coat is the responsibility of the employee. Replacement of
the coat will be done as needed, upon the Town Manager’s approval.
   (C)   Department heads are responsible for establishing a reasonable dress
code appropriate to the job employees perform. If a department head feels that
an employee’s personal appearance is inappropriate, he or she may be asked to
leave the workplace until they are properly dressed or groomed. Under such
circumstance, nonexempt employees will not be compensated for the time away
from work. Employees should consult with a department head if they have
questions as to what constitutes appropriate appearance. Where necessary a
reasonable accommodation may be made to a person with a disability. Without
unduly restricting individual tastes, the following personal appearance
guidelines should be followed:
      (1)   Shoes must provide safe, secure footing, and offer protection
against hazards.
      (2)   Tank tops and tube or halter tops may not be worn under any
circumstances.
      (3)   Mustaches and beards must be clean, well-trimmed, and neat.
      (4)   Unnaturally colored hair and extreme hairstyles, such as spiked
hair, do not present an appropriate professional appearance.
      (5)   Long hairstyles should be worn with hair pulled back off the face
and neck to avoid interfering with job performance.
      (6)   Excessive make-up is not permitted.
      (7)   Offensive body odor and poor personal hygiene is not professionally
acceptable.
      (8)   Perfume, cologne, and after shave lotion should be used moderately
or avoided altogether, as some individuals may be sensitive to strong
fragrances.
      (9)   Jewelry should not be functionally restrictive, dangerous to job
performance, or excessive.
      (10)   Facial jewelry, such as eyebrow rings, nose rings, lip rings, and
tongue studs, are not professionally appropriate and must not be worn during
working hours.
      (11)   Torso body piercings with visible jewelry or jewelry that may be
seen through or under clothing must not be worn during working hours.
      (12)   Visible excessive tattoos and similar body art must be covered
during working hours.
   (D)   Nothing in this policy shall be interpreted to prohibit or otherwise
restrict concerted activities by employees that are protected by law.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.155 RETURN OF PROPERTY.
   (A)   Employees are responsible for all the town issued to them or in their
possession or control, to include:
      (1)   Materials;
      (2)   Written information.
      (3)   Identification badges.
      (4)   Mobile devices.
      (5)   Tools.
      (6)   Keys.
      (7)   Uniforms.
   (B)   Employees must return all the town property immediately upon request
or upon termination of employment. The town may withhold from the employee’s
check or final pay check the cost of any items that are not returned when
required provided the employee has signed an authorization form allowing the
town to do so. The town may also take legal action deemed appropriate to
recover or protect its property.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.156 RESIGNATION.
   Resignation is a voluntary act initiated by the employee to terminate
employment with the town. Although advance notice is not required, the town of
Albion requests at least two weeks’ written resignation notice from all
employees. Prior to an employee’s departure, an exit interview may be scheduled
to discuss the reasons for resignation and the effect of the resignation on
benefits. If an employee does not provide advance notice as requested, the
employee may be considered ineligible for rehire. Refer to Policy
#405—Employment Termination (§
35.087) for additional information.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.157 SECURITY INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   The town wishes to discourage theft or unauthorized possession of the
property of employees, the town, residents, customers of town services, and
visitors. To facilitate enforcement of this policy, the town, its
representative, or law enforcement officials may inspect not only desks and
file cabinets, but also persons entering and/or leaving the premises and any
packages or other belongings. Any employee who wishes to avoid inspection of
any articles or materials should not bring such items onto the town’s premises.
   (B)   The town wishes to maintain a work environment that is free of illegal
drugs, alcohol, illegal firearms, explosives, or other improper materials. To
this end, the town prohibits the manufacturing, distribution, dispensing,
possession, transfer, sale, or use of such materials in its facilities, or on a
job site. The town requires the cooperation of all employees in administering
this policy. Refer to Policy #702—Drugs and Alcohol Use/Testing (§
35.151) for additional information.
   (C)   Computers, desks, laptops, mobile devices, file cabinets, and other
storage devices may be provided for the convenience of employees but remain the
sole property of the town. Accordingly, they, as well as any articles found
within them, may be inspected by any agent or representative of the town at any
time, either with or without prior notice. This includes purses, briefcases,
personal devices, and motor vehicles located on the town’s property, based on
reasonable cause, as well as all town-owned property used by employees, whether
secured or unsecured by a lock or locking device provided by the employee,
based on reasonable suspicion. An employee’s personal items may be held so that
law enforcement officials may conduct the search.
   (D)   Employees may contact the Town Manager, or the Clerk-Treasurer for
additional information regarding security inspections.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.158 SOLICITATION.
   (A)   In an effort to ensure a productive and harmonious work environment,
persons not employed by the town may not solicit or distribute literature in
the workplace at any time for any purpose.
   (B)   The town recognizes that employees may have interests in events and
organizations outside the workplace. However, employees may not solicit or
distribute literature concerning these activities during working time. Working
time does not include lunch periods, work breaks, or any other periods in which
employees are not engaged in performing his or her works tasks.
   (C)   In addition, the posting of written solicitations on town-owned
bulletin boards is prohibited. Bulletin boards are reserved for official town
communications on such items as:
      (1)   Employee announcements.
      (2)   Internal memoranda.
      (3)   Job openings.
      (4)   Town announcements.
      (5)   Payday notice.
      (6)   Workers’ compensation insurance information.
   (D)   If an employee has a message of interest to the workplace, they may
submit it to his or her department head, or the Town Manager for approval. All
approved messages will be posted by an employee specifically designated by the
town. Nothing in this policy shall be interpreted to prohibit or otherwise
restrict concerted activities by employees that are protected by law.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.159 PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE.
   (A)   The purpose of this policy is to state the town’s position on
administering equitable and consistent discipline for unsatisfactory conduct in
the workplace. The best disciplinary measure is the one that does not have to
be enforced and comes from good leadership and fair supervision at all
employment levels.
   (B)   The town’s own best interest lies in ensuring fair treatment of all
employees and in making certain that disciplinary actions are prompt, uniform,
and impartial. The major purpose of any disciplinary action is to correct the
problem, prevent recurrence, and prepare the employee for satisfactory service
in the future.
   (C)   Although employment with the town is based on mutual consent and both
the employee and the town have the right to terminate the employment-at-will
relationship, with or without cause or advance notice, the town may use
progressive discipline at its discretion.
   (D)   Disciplinary action may call for any of four steps— verbal warning,
written warning, suspension with or without pay, or termination of
employment—depending on the severity of the problem and the number of
occurrences. There may be circumstances when one or more steps are bypassed.
Department heads are responsible for taking action in a progressive
disciplinary situation with employees or may face disciplinary action
themselves. Copies of all written warnings and/or coaching/counseling notes
must be placed in the employee’s personnel file in the Clerk-Treasurer’s
office.
   (E)   PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE means that, with respect to most disciplinary
problems, these steps will normally be followed:
      (1)   A first offense may call for a verbal warning.
      (2)   Should the offense be repeated within 36 months after a verbal
warning is given, the result will then be a written warning.
      (3)   A third offense may lead to a suspension when the employee needs to
be removed from the workplace for investigation procedures to continue.
      (4)   A fourth offense may then lead to termination of employment.
   (F)   The town recognizes that there are certain types of employee problems
that are serious enough to justify either a suspension with or without pay, or,
in extreme situations, termination of employment, without going through the
usual progressive disciplinary action steps.
   (G)   While it is impossible to list every type of behavior that may be
deemed a serious offense, Policy #701—Employee Conduct and Work Rules (§
35.150) includes examples of problems that may result in immediate suspension
or termination of employment. However, the problems listed are not all
necessarily serious offenses, but may be examples of unsatisfactory conduct
that will trigger progressive discipline. By using progressive discipline, it
is hoped that most employee problems may be corrected at an early stage,
benefitting both the employee and the town.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.160 PROBLEM RESOLUTION.
   (A)   It is the policy of the town to ensure that employees who have
questions and complaints arising from misunderstandings and the application of
policies, procedures, and work rules be promptly heard, answered and action
taken to resolve or clarify each situation.
   (B)   Any employee who has a question or complaint with the town or any
employee should follow these steps:
      (1)   The employee should talk with the person with whom they have an
issue in order to try and come to resolution of the problem or situation.
      (2)   If talking with the employee does not satisfy the problem or
situation, then the employee should contact his or her Supervisor to discuss
the problem or situation, as soon as possible.
      (3)   If the problem or situation is not satisfactorily resolved or the
problem or situation is with the supervisor, the employee may contact his or
her department head to discuss the situation.
      (4)   If the problem or situation is still not satisfactorily resolved,
the employee may request a meeting with the Town Council President to discuss
the issue or complaint for a final resolution.
   (C)   Employees should contact their department head, the Town Manager, or
the Clerk-Treasurer for additional information regarding problem resolution.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.161 WORKPLACE ETIQUETTE.
   (A)   The town strives to maintain a positive work environment where
employees treat each other with respect and courtesy. Sometimes issues arise
when employees are unaware that their behavior in the workplace may be
disruptive or annoying to others. Many of these day-to-day issues may be
addressed by politely talking with a coworker to bring the perceived problem to
his or her attention. In most cases, common sense will dictate an appropriate
resolution. The town encourages all employees to keep an open mind and
graciously accept constructive feedback or a request to change behavior that
may be affecting another employee’s ability to concentrate and be productive.
   (B)   The following workplace etiquette guidelines are not necessarily
intended to be hard and fast work rules with disciplinary consequences. They
are simply suggestions for appropriate workplace behavior to help everyone be
more conscientious and considerate of coworkers and the work environment.
Employees should:
      (1)   Return copy machine and printer settings to their default settings
after changing them.
      (2)   Replace paper in the copy machine and printer paper trays when they
are empty.
      (3)   Retrieve print jobs in a timely manner and be sure to collect all
pages.
      (4)   Be prompt when using the manual feed on the printer.
      (5)   Keep the area around the copy machine and printers orderly and
picked-up.
      (6)   Be careful not to take or discard others’ print jobs or faxes.
      (7)   Avoid public accusations or criticisms of others in the workplace.
Address such issues privately with those involved or a department head, the
Town Manager, or the Clerk-Treasurer.
      (8)   Try to minimize unscheduled interruptions of other employees while
they are working.
      (9)   Communicate by email or phone whenever possible, instead of walking
unexpectedly into someone’s office or workspace.
      (10)   Be conscious of how voices travel, and try to lower the volume
when talking on the phone or to others in open areas.
      (11)   Keep socializing to a minimum, and try to conduct conversations in
areas where the noise will not be distracting to others.
      (12)   Minimize talking between workspaces or over cubicle walls.
Instead, conduct conversations with others in their workspace.
      (13)   Try not to block walkways while carrying on conversations.
      (14)   Refrain from using inappropriate language (swearing) that others
may overhear.
      (15)   Avoid discussions of personal lives/issues in public conversations
that may be easily overheard.
      (16)   Monitor the volume when listening to music, voice mail, or a
speakerphone that others may hear.
      (17)   Clean up after and do not leave behind waste or discarded papers.
      (18)   Keep all desks and work areas neat and orderly.
      (19)   Thoroughly clean up after utilizing break and kitchen areas.
   (C)   Employees should contact a department head, the Clerk-Treasurer, or
the Town Manager if they have comments, concerns, or suggestions regarding
these workplace etiquette guidelines. Nothing in this policy shall be
interpreted to prohibit or otherwise restrict concerted activities by employees
that are protected by law.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
MISCELLANEOUS
§ 35.175 POLITICAL ACTIVITY.
   (A)   Employees of the town are encouraged to support governments in our
political system. However, there are limits on employee political activity.
Town employees may join civic, partisan or political organizations, may attend
political meetings and advocate the principles or policies of civic or
political organizations in accordance with the Constitution and federal and
state laws.
   (B)   Although any solicitation, refer to Policy #713—Solicitation (§
35.158), by employees of the town during working hours is strictly prohibited,
employees must make every effort to avoid the appearance of impropriety when
engaging in political activities on their own time. Employees must note that
they are engaging in political activity on their own time and not on behalf of
the town. Employees must also refrain from using town-owned vehicles,
equipment, etc. or wearing a municipal uniform, while campaigning or attending
campaign events. Employees must also refrain from discussing municipal business
during political discussions. No town employee should be required to contribute
money or anything of value to any candidate for nomination or election to any
office, campaign or political committee or be required to take part in any
political campaign. In addition, receiving gifts, remuneration of any type or
monetary reward in exchange for political activities while conducting or that
conflict with municipal business is prohibited. Nothing in this policy shall be
interpreted to prohibit or otherwise restrict concerted activities by employees
that are protected by law.
   (C)   Employees should contact the Town Manager, or the Clerk-Treasurer if
they have specific questions regarding appropriate political activity
behaviors.
(Ord. 2020-26, passed 1-12-21)
§ 35.176 SUGGESTION PROGRAM.
   (A)   Employees of the town have the opportunity to contribute to their
future success and growth by submitting suggestions for practical work-
improvement or cost-saving ideas. All employees are eligible to participate in
the suggestion program. A suggestion is an idea that will benefit the town by
solving a problem, reducing costs, improving operations or procedures,
enhancing customer service, eliminating waste or spoilage, or making the town a
better or safer place to work.
   (B)   Statements of problems without accompanying solutions or
recommendations concerning coworkers and management are not appropriate
suggestions. All suggestions should contain a description of the problem or
condition to be improved, a detailed explanation of the solution or
improvement, and the reasons why it should be implemented. Employees may talk
with their department head, the Town Manager, or the Clerk-Treasurer, if they
have questions or need advice about an idea.
   (C)   Employees should submit their suggestions to a department head, the
Town Manager, or the Clerk-Treasurer. They will be notified as soon as possible
of the adoption or rejection of their suggestion. Special recognition will be
given to employees who submit a suggestion that is implemented. Nothing in this
policy shall be interpreted to prohibit or otherwise restrict concerted
activities by employees that are protected by law.

assets of the sewer utility. At the passage of Ord. 2011-01, the sewer utility
real and personal property assets are estimated to be $1,679,067. The town’s

to the Corporation General Fund. First payment is due and payable on June 1,
2012. Thereafter, all payments are due and payable on June 1 of each
consecutive year. Computation of the PILOT amount shall be as follows:
Total assets of sewer utility on Dec. 31st multiplied by tax rate of current
year = gross tax due (PILOT).
Example:
 
Total Assets - Net 12/31/08 Balance 2010 Albion Tax Rate Gross Tax
$1,679,067                          0.9905               $16,631.16

§ 90.02 CLEARING OF SNOW AND ICE FROM SIDEWALKS.
   (A)   The occupant of any premises, specified in the area in division (D)
below, and the owner of any unoccupied premises in the area, are required to
keep the sidewalks in front of or adjacent to the premises cleared, so far as
is practicable and reasonable, from snow and ice in order to facilitate
pedestrian use of the sidewalks. The word OCCUPANT as used in this section,
shall be deemed to mean the person occupying for business, residence, or other
purposes the first floor of any building situated on the premises so occupied;
and if the first floor of any building is not occupied, then premises shall be
deemed and held to be unoccupied and the owner or lessee of the entire premises
shall be required to keep the sidewalks in front of or adjacent to the premises
reasonably cleared from snow and ice.
   (B)   In case snow or ice is accumulated or fallen on any sidewalk or is
continuing to fall after 7:00 p.m. it shall be removed, if practical to do so,
or a sufficient path be cleared by the occupant or owner of the real estate
upon which the sidewalk is located before 9:00 a.m. of the following day. If
any snow or ice has fallen or accumulated on any sidewalk after 9:00 a.m., it
shall be removed or a path cleared by the occupant or owner of the real estate
upon which the snow or ice has fallen or accumulated by 7:00 p.m. of such day,
if the snow has ceased to fall by that time. In either of the foregoing events,
the occupant or owner shall be deemed to be held and to have complied with the
provisions of this section.
   (C)   Each 24-hour period shall be treated separately for consideration of
whether or not this section has been violated, and therefore separate
violations may occur in separate 24 hour periods.
   (D)   This section shall apply to all areas zoned: Commercial Courthouse
Square (CS), Commercial Highway (CH), Commercial Office (CO) and Commercial

compliance with this chapter.
(`76 Code, § 11-16) Penalty, see §
90.99
§ 90.16 METHODS; SAFETY REQUIREMENTS.
   All material removed from an excavation shall be immediately removed from
the site if it is not to be reused as fill, and material to be reused as fill
shall be laid in a neat pile adjacent and parallel to the excavation, extending
not more than eight feet to the street from the curb without scattering. All
openings must be maintained by the person licensed to make the opening, and
proper barricades and danger lights shall be maintained by this person until
the excavation has been restored.
(`76 Code, § 11-17)
§ 90.17 RESTORATION AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   All openings shall be closed immediately after completion of the work
for which the opening is made, and openings must be compacted as filled. Tree
lawns shall be filled with soil, topsoil and either resodded or reseeded, and
all other openings shall be backfilled with clean pit run gravel or equal
quality material, except that all street and alley openings having improved
services must be sealed with cold patch blacktop. Openings not to be so sealed
are to be returned to the condition existing prior to opening. (`76 Code, § 11-
18)
   (B)   All street and alley openings are to be maintained by the person
opening the same for 30 days after fill, or in the alternative, the permittee
may authorize the Street Commissioner to maintain the backfill at a cost to be
determined by the Street Commissioner. If during the 30-day maintenance period
it becomes necessary for the Street Commissioner to take corrective action with
respect to the fill, then the maintenance fee will be assessed by the Building
Commissioner. (`76 Code, § 11-19)
§ 90.18 PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Permit required. No excavation shall be made into any street, alley,
tree, lawn, or public place, or into or through any pavement thereon, until an
opening permit therefor shall be granted by the Building Commissioner of the
town. The permit shall define the nature of the work to be done. Several
openings may be grouped upon a single permit, without additional fee, if the
several openings are within the same lineal block and are to be made within 60
days of the first opening, and if determined by the Building Commissioner to be
of a single job function. A permit for grouped openings will not be a permit
for blocking of streets and alleys for the entire 60-day period. (`76 Code, §
11-26)
   (B)   Application; fee. Any person desiring to make an opening or excavation
described above in division (A) shall file with the Building Commissioner of
the town an application for a permit, which shall definitely state the location
for the proposed opening, the purpose thereof, and which shall define the
nature of the work to be done, together with a fee of $2. (`76 Code, § 11-27)
   (C)   Bond required. Every person applying for the permit required herein
shall, prior to its issuance, file a bond with the town to cover the costs of
compliance with the provisions of this subchapter, and conditioned on the
permittee doing so. The amount of the bond shall be as determined by duly
adopted resolution of the Town Council. (`76 Code, § 11-28)
SIDEWALK REPLACEMENT
§ 90.25 50/50 SIDEWALK REPLACEMENT PROGRAM.
   (A)   The Town Manager will receive requests for sidewalk replacement,
inspect the affected property, determine the condition and need for replacement
and keep an up-to-date list of interested and eligible participants.
   (B)   The Town Manager will annually invite quotes from a minimum of three
contractors on the replacement of eligible sidewalks.
   (C)   The Town Manager, along with the contractors, will inspect the
requested sidewalk replacement locations, measure and mark the area to be
replaced during a mandatory pre-quote conference. A sidewalk section may not be
split, if any portion of a section is on the adjoining property, the complete
section will be replaced as if it were the participants. The sidewalk program
is intended to replace complete sidewalks. The replacement of only one or two
sections is expensive, due to minimum charges, and is not encouraged by the
town.
   (D)   Town Council will receive the quotes and take same under advisement.
   (E)   The Town Manager will review the quotes and contact the interested
participant to determine if he or she desires to complete the project or wait
until a following year. The applicant is responsible to pay for 50% of the
total cost of project quote.
   (F)   The Town Manager reports findings to Council and recommends action.
Council awards project to the lowest responsive and responsible quoter.
   (G)   Within two weeks of Council awarding the project, the participant must
submit payment to the Clerk-Treasurer by check, cashier's check or money order,
payable to the contractor, for one-half of the total project cost. The Clerk-
Treasurer will hold this payment until work is completed and accepted. Payment
may be delivered in person to Town Hall or mailed to P.O. Box 27, Albion, IN
46701.
   (H)   Upon receipt of payment from the participant, the contractor will be
notified by the Town Manager to proceed with the work. All work must be
completed within 45 days from the date the notice to proceed is issued. The
contractor will be subject to a 10% penalty for work that is not completed
within 45 days, unless otherwise agreed upon by the Town Manager.
   (I)   Handicap accessible sidewalks shall be installed, paying special
attention to ramping at intersections, meeting ADA Federal Standards for slope
and width.
   (J)   Replacement will be limited to a minimum width of four-foot sidewalks
and a maximum width matching the existing sidewalk found on the property,
running the length of the property in the public right-of-way. This requirement
applies to all sidewalks in all zoning districts of town.
(Res. 2006-11, passed 4-25-06)
§ 90.26 INSPECTIONS AND PAYMENTS.
   Two inspections by the Town Manager are required, the first when the
sidewalk is formed and before it is poured; the second is the final inspection
when the work is completely finished, including all grade work and re-seeding
of grass. The Town Manager is authorized by the Town Council to inspect the
project site and, upon satisfactory completion of the work, authorize payment.
Payment will consist of the 50% paid by the participant and 50% paid by the
town.
(Res. 2006-11, passed 4-25-06)
§ 90.27 REPLACEMENT OF SIDEWALKS BY OWNERS.
   (A)   The Town Council recognizes the fact that some property owners may
want to replace sidewalks on their own property. The Town Manager is authorized
to inspect, determine the condition of existing sidewalk and need for
replacement. If determined eligible, the town will notify the property owner
and request they obtain an estimate on concrete cost to complete the
replacement work. The town will not reimburse the owner for his or her labor in
replacing the sidewalk. If estimated cost is acceptable to the Town Manager,
and money to fund the project is appropriated, notice to proceed will be given
to the property owner.
   (B)   Upon completion of work by the property owner and acceptance of work
by the Town Manager, the property owner shall submit receipts for concrete to
the Clerk-Treasurer. Within 30 days from the date of receiving acceptable
receipts, the property owner is reimbursed for 50% of the total cost for
concrete.
(Res. 2006-11, passed 4-25-06)
§ 90.28 NEW SIDEWALKS.
   The responsibility for construction of new sidewalks within the town limits
and the zoning boundary of the town is with the developer or owner of an
undeveloped lot. In established areas without sidewalks, the Town Council will
review individual sidewalk requests for new construction. The construction of
new sidewalks must have a definite benefit for the citizens and the town.
Primary consideration will be given to access provided for citizens of the town
to schools; churches; parks and shopping areas. The provisions of the 50/50
program will apply to this section.
(Res. 2006-11, passed 4-25-06)

utilities located within the town's right-of-way shall be placed underground or
buried.
   (D)   All existing overhead poles, wires and/or utility transmission lines
may remain within the town's right-of-way and shall not be replaced or
relocated without prior written authorization of the Works Board.
(Res. 2017-08, passed 4-20-17)

§ 98.02 POLICY.
   State law and town ordinances regulate the use of real property in the town.
Generally, these laws/ordinances establish both the structures that may be
constructed on land, and the activities that may be conducted thereon. The town
receives requests to allow activities, and occasionally structures, on a
temporary basis. The town has an interest in allowing certain types of
conditionally allowed uses on a temporary basis. Some of these types of uses
may allow private individuals, businesses, or not-for-profit organizations to
hold special events which may temporarily alter the character of a particular
area.

§ 111.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general
welfare of the citizens of the town, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses within the town. The provisions of this chapter have neither the
purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or
reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by
the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor the effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution
of obscene material.
   (B)   Findings. Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of adult
uses in Albion and in other communities, presented in hearings and in reports
made available to the Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of
Pap's A.M. v. City of Erie, 2000 U.S. LEXIS 2347 (Mar. 29, 2000); City of
Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini
Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560
(1991), Schultz v. City of Cumberland, 26 F.Supp.2d 1128 (W.D. Wisc. 1998),
aff'd in part, rzv'd in part, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 23773 (7th Cir. 2000); Berg
v. Health & Hospital Corp., 865 F.2d 797 (1989); Chulchian v. City of
Indianapolis, 633 F.3d 27 (7th Cir. 1980); DiMa Corp. v. Town of Hallie, 185
F.3d 823 (1999); Entertainment Concepts v. Maciejewski, 631 F.2d 497 (1980);
Genusa v. City of Peoria, 619 F.2d 1203 (1980); Graff v. City of Chicago,
9 F.3d 1309 (1993); North Avenue Novelties, Inc. v. City of Chicago, 88 F.3d
441 (1996); and other cases; and on reports of secondary effects occurring in
and around sexually oriented businesses, both in Albion and in other
communities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona - 1984;
Minneapolis, Minnesota-1980; Houston, Texas -1997; Indianapolis, Indiana -
1984; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California - 1991; Los Angeles, California
- 1977; Whittier, California - 1978; Austin, Texas - 1986; Seattle, Washington
- 1989; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma - 1986; Cleveland, Ohio; and Dallas, Texas -
1997; St. Croix County, Wisconsin - 1993; Bellevue, Washington, - 1998; Newport
News, Virginia - 1996; New York Times Square study - 1994; and also on findings
from the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of
Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Council
finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the unlicensed
operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism in
this town to make the owners and operators of these establishments responsible
for the activities that occur on their premises.
      (2)   Certain employees of unregulated sexually oriented businesses
defined in this chapter as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher
incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments.
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at unregulated sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide
private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live
sex shows.
      (4)   Offering and providing such unregulated space encourages such
activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually oriented businesses, or for the purpose of purchasing
or selling illicit dings.
      (6)   Numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis salmonella, campylobacter and shigella infections,
chlamydial, myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections, trichomoniasis and
chancroid.
      (7)   According to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation, an
estimated 650,000 to 900,000 Americans are infected with HIV. The number of new
HIV infections occurring each year is now about 41,000. Men and women of all
races are most likely to be infected by sexual contact.
      (8)   Relevant statistics revealed that a total of 5,419 AIDS cases had
been reported in Indiana as of January 1, 1999. Indiana has required HIV case
reporting since July of 1988 and shows 5,561 people currently living with HIV
(3,109) or AIDS (2,452) in the state.
      (9)   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that as
many as one in three people with HIV do not know they are infected.
      (10)   The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982
and 45,200 through November of 1990.
      (11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over 500,000 cases being reported in
1990.
      (12)   The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      (13)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
See, e.g. Findings of U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services.
      (14)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
      (15)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented
films.
      (16)   The findings noted in subdivisions (1) through (15) raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (17)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (18)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health,
safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the
town. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is
the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and
control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (19)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres.
      (20)    Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments.
      (21)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to- day operation and maintenance of the sexually
oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
      (22)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who
are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
      (23)   The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of
the town will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT,
PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Town Council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 2014-08, passed 10-28-14)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstruction
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately floodproofed or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 2014-08, passed 10-28-14)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safely and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters.
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage.
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (F)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2014-08, passed 10-28-14)
§ 152.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in floodplains;
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
(Ord. 2014-08, passed 10-28-14)
§ 152.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt or a combination of both. In A zones,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   ZONES AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown withn these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones
A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the Regular
Program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response
installations. Installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   D ZONE. Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding
is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is
not required by regulation in this zone.
   DEVELOPMENT.
      (1)   Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate including
but not limited to:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any
addition to a structure;

manufactured home or installing a recreational vehicle on a site for more than
180 days;
         (c)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction
of roads, or similar projects;
         (d)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements, etc.;
         (e)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling
operations;
         (f)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
         (g)   Storage of materials; or
         (h)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
      (2)   DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the maintenance of
existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing, resurfacing
roads, or gardening, plowing and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation or the construction of permanent
structures.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter
walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings or
columns (posts and piers).
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. A certified statement that verifies a structure's
elevation information.
   EMERGENCY PROGRAM. The first phase under which a community participates in
the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to he affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable) and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOOD)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See FREEBOARD)
   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The floodplain includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans,
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances and other applications of police power which control development in
flood prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. Floodplain management regulations are also referred to
as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention
ordinance and floodplain management requirement.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP (AS RELATED TO VARIANCES OF THIS CHAPTER). The exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Board of
Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual and peculiar
to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is NOT
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURES. Any structures individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition or any combination thereof. All renewal and new business
flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997, will
include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR). and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in
a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is
only issued by FEMA.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision
by letter to an effective NFIP map, A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support or basement entryway
immediately next to the structure.

the structure;
      (4)   The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or
pillars;
      (5)   The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement,
below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and
         (c)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. MANUFACTURED HOME
does not include a recreational vehicle.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE. The building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or
adjusted assessed values.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.

installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds

other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration
of an historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure.

the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.

displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above
the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. 2014-08, passed 10-28-14)
§ 152.34 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established §
152.11, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in this subchapter have been met. The
floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit for
construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory
flood elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-
floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR 65.12.
(Ord. 2014-08, passed 10-28-14)
§ 152.35 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in this subchapter have been met. The key provision is
that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure
shall be at or above Ihe FPG.
(Ord. 2014-08, passed 10-28-14)
§ 152.36 STANDARDS FOR SFHAs WITHOUT ESTABLISHED FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in this subchapter have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this
subchapter have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and shall not increase flood
damages or potential flood damages.
