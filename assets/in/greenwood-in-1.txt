A Brief History of Greenwood, Indiana
"Pride and Progress"
The City of Greenwood, Indiana, is located in northern Johnson County. It is
bordered on the north by Marion County and the City of Indianapolis. It is
immediately accessible from I-65, U.S. 31, and S.R. 135, and is just five miles
south of I-465 which connects to the major interstate highways crossing the
State of Indiana, I-70, I-74 and I-69. The following is a brief history of this
wonderful community.
On September 30, 1823, John B. Smock and Isaac Smock, brothers who migrated
from the State of Pennsylvania to Mercer County, Kentucky, settled in what is
now known as Greenwood, Indiana. These settlers each purchased 160 acres of
land for $1.25 an acre at the Federal Land Office. John B. Smock built the
first log cabin; Isaac Smock settled near the creek that runs through what is
now known as the Old City Park.
The settlement was first known as "Smocktown" because the majority of first
settlers were people by the name of Smock, including the first postmaster,
James Smock.
Madison Road was built in 1824 by the Federal Government. A historical plaque
on what is now Madison Avenue marks the site of the first church in the
community, established on December 31, 1825 by Isaac Reed, a pioneer
Presbyterian minister.
The first post office was established in 1828 and was named "Greenfield". The
town was renamed "Greenwood" in 1833 when it was discovered that there already
was a Greenfield in the State. Dr. Benjamin S. Noble, a native of Virginia, was
the first person to practice medicine in the town, establishing his practice in
1840.
The first railroad built west of the Allegheny Mountains and the first to run
in Indianapolis came through Greenwood on October 1, 1847. The railroad system
was an important component in the shipping of grain, livestock and lumber from
the area.
It was nearly forty years before the Village of Greenwood formally organized a
town government, which it did on June 25, 1864. The first Town Board Members
were E.C. Smith, F.S. Wilson, Turner B. Hungate, S. Mayfield and A.W.
Gilchrist. Other officers of the Town included F.M. Teague, Town Clerk; James
McGuire, Town Marshal; W.H. Thornton, Town Assessor; and A. Holloway, Town
Treasurer. The Town had a population of approximately 300 people at the time of
incorporation.
Shortly before 1864, a school building was erected on the corner of Broadway
and Meridian Streets. It was a frame building with two rooms, and was furnished
with seats instead of the usual long benches. In later 1864 a brick school was
erected upon the site of the Central School building. It measured forty feet by
sixty feet, and contained four rooms. During the winter of 1865 this building
was destroyed by fire. A new two-story brick building with four rooms was
erected in 1868. Greenwood's first high school building was erected in 1928.
This building was also destroyed by fire, in January of 1942.
It is reported that in April of 1865, the Town Board met in Hilory Shryock's
Tailor Shop on Main Street, and each Trustee was allowed 50 cents for each
meeting he attended and was fined 50 cents for each meeting he missed. In
December of 1865, the allowance was changed to $1.00. The Town Board met every
two to three months.
One of the most important early growth factors for the community was the James
T. Polk Canning Factory, established by the man of the same name, a native of
Princeton, Indiana, who settled in Greenwood after the Civil War. It became the
largest cannery west of Baltimore. "Polk's Best" brand of corn, peas and
tomatoes had a world-wide reputation and sales.
When James T. Polk died in 1919, he left a will bequeathing $75,000 to
Greenwood for the building of a "suitable place for the meeting or congregating
of the people who have helped make him what he was ..." The Harvey Brewer home,
at the northwest corner of Madison Avenue and Broadway, was purchased and
razed. On February 5, 1920, the James T. and Laura Polk Memorial Community
House was dedicated.
The canning factory burned in 1906, but was rebuilt and resumed full
operations. The plant was sold to Stokely's in 1930 and remained in operation
until 1959. During the acute labor shortage of World War II, Italian prisoners
of war from Camp Atterbury were used to keep the factory operational.
In 1888 the first newspaper, the Graphic, was published. It was owned and
operated by Sumner Rose and sold one year later to W. J. Spruce.
The first Town Park was built in either 1898 or 1899 and was called "Beech
Park". It was located just south of where Beech Park Drive is currently
located. On May 30, 1902, the second Town Park was dedicated and known as
"Forest Park". The 1900 census listed Greenwood with a population of 1,800.
In early 1891, James T. Polk, Grafton Johnson and other prominent citizens of
Greenwood formed a corporation for the construction of an electric railway to
connect Greenwood and Indianapolis, with construction completed in 1899. The
"interurban" had approximately 100 cars in and out of Indianapolis daily in
1902, and grew to over 400 cars by 1910.
Greenwood's last Town Board of Trustees was composed of Boyd Betts, Don Totten,
Joseph Reichart, and S. Garfield Green, Clerk, and served through 1959 when the
Town of Greenwood determined that it should become a fifth-class city. Wayne
Burkhart was elected as the first Mayor of the City of Greenwood, and the first
City Council consisted of Morris Clark, Ray Ritchey, Robert Terhune, James
Garrison and Fred Kinnick. The first City Clerk-Treasurer was Byron Rodgers.
The City dedicated a new Department of Public Works Building in 1985. In
keeping with the preservation of Greenwood's heritage, there was a major
renovation of the James T. and Laura Polk Memorial Community House, which was
rededicated as the City Building in November of 1986. A new Fire Station with a
Training Center was completed in 1987 on Stop Road 18 .
Today, the City of Greenwood is listed as a third-class city with a population
of more than 26,000 residents. The City is governed by a Mayor elected every
four years, a seven-member Common Council and a Clerk-Treasurer. Additionally,
it has a three-member Board of Public Works & Safety. The City has a strong
public safety presence through law enforcement and fire protection services.
The City has nine municipal parks with seven playgrounds, seven ball diamonds,
and eleven shelters and picnic areas covering a total of one hundred thirty-
five acres. It also has a swimming pool, thirteen tennis courts, and golf
courses.
The following individuals have served with distinction as Mayor of the City of
Greenwood, Indiana:
      Wayne Burkhart      1960-1963
      W.B. "Mike" Myers      1964-1967
      Harold "Jack" Smith      1968-1972
      John O. Boner         1972-1975
      Lawrence W. Myers      1976-1979
      Vaino Grayam         1980-1983
      Jeanette Surina      1984-1991
      Margaret A. McGovern   1991-present
Jeanette Surina made history when she was the first woman to be elected as
Mayor, and again when she was re-elected to become the first Greenwood Mayor to
serve two terms. During her administration, the Skyway Airport was purchased,
and a new Community Center, Police Station Headquarters and Fire Station
Headquarters were built in what is now known as "Surina Square".
Greenwood continues to experience rapid increase in population and growth.
Because of the hard-working, dedicated citizens, volunteers and public
officials, Greenwood, Indiana has truly become a City of "Pride and Progress".

"this Chapter," "this Article," "this Division," etc., as the case may be, or
to "Sections _______ to _______" (inserting Section numbers to indicate the
Sections of this Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance
incorporated into the Code); and

Caregiver Leave, that family member will be deemed next of kin. In such
circumstances, only that designated next of kin may take FMLA leave to care for
that covered service member. When a covered service member does not make such a
designation, and there are multiple family members with the same level of
relationship to the covered service member, all such family members shall be
considered the covered service member's next of kin. The City shall require an
employee to provide reasonable documentation of the family relationship.
   (h)   Intermittent Leave - In the case of unpaid leave for reasons other
than the birth, care, or placement of a child, the leave may be taken
intermittently or on a reduced hours basis only if such leave is medically
necessary. Where an employee requests foreseeable intermittent leave or leave
on a reduced hours basis, the City reserves the right to require the employee
to transfer to a temporary alternative job for which the employee is qualified
and which better accommodates the intermittent leave or reduced hours leave
than the employee's regular job. The temporary position will have equivalent
pay and benefits as the employee's regular job.
   (i)   Paid Leave and FMLA Leave - Employees may substitute accrued paid
leave (i.e. PTO time) during the FMLA leave period. The elected paid leave runs
concurrently with unpaid FMLA leave.
(Ord. No. 12-14, § 2, 5-21-12)
Employees who are receiving disability or workers' compensation benefits during
their FMLA leave are not required, but may elect to use their PTO during the
FMLA leave. Leave covered by short term disability benefits and workers
compensation runs concurrently with FMLA leave.
   (j)   Notification by Employee.
      (1)   When the necessity of leave is foreseeable due to the expected
birth or placement of a child, the employee must provide Human Resources at the
City at least thirty (30) days notice of his/her intention to take leave. If
the date of birth or placement of a child requires the employee's leave to
begin in less than thirty (30) days from the date of notice to Human Resources,
the employee must provide such notice as soon as practical.
      (2)   When the need for leave is for reasons relating to a family
member's Armed Forces active duty and such leave is foreseeable, the employee
must give notice to Human Resources as soon as is reasonable and practicable.
The City may require that the employee provide a copy of the family member's
active duty orders or other reasonable documentation.
      (3)   When the necessity for leave is due to a family member's or an
employee's own serious health condition and is foreseeable, the employee must:
(i) give at least thirty (30) days notice, or as soon as practical if the leave
starts in less than thirty (30) days; and(ii) consult with his or her
Department Head and make a reasonable effort to schedule any treatment so as
not to unduly disrupt operation of the City, subject to the approval of the
health care provider.
      (4)   When the need for leave is unforeseeable, employees are required to
inform the City of such need within forty-eight (48) hours and follow the
City's established call-in procedures for reporting absences. Employees failing
to give such notice will normally have their FMLA leave delayed or denied. When
an employee seeks leave due to an FMLA qualifying reason for which the City has
previously provided FMLA leave, the employee must specifically reference the
FMLA qualifying reason when notifying Human Resources.
   (k)   FMLA Leave Procedure - Initial requests for FMLA leave may be oral,
however, all requests for FMLA leave of absence must be initiated by requesting
leave through the employee’s Department Head. Human Resources will help the
employee complete the correct form for processing. The employee must provide a
completed certification to Human Resources within fifteen (15) calendar days.
All appropriate information must be provided on the City’s health care
certification form. Failure to provide the certification in a timely manner
will result in a denial of leave. Human Resources will notify the employee if
the certification form is incomplete and the employee will be given seven (7)
calendar days to remedy the deficiency. The may require an employee to
recertification from time to time regarding his or her status, intent to return
to work, and approximate date of return to work as permitted by the federal
statute.
      (1)   If an employee files for disability or workers' compensation
benefits, the employee must comply with the certification requirements of the
disability or workers' compensation benefit plan. Employees who fail to meet
the disability or workers' compensation certification requirements may not be
eligible for those benefits. The employee may still be eligible for FMLA leave,
provided the FMLA requirements have been satisfied.
      (2)   Each time an employee initially requests leave due to a qualifying
exigency arising out of a covered service member's active duty or call to
active duty, certification by the employee is required. The certification
process will include, but may not be limited to, providing a copy of the
covered military member's active duty orders or other military documentation
showing active duty status or notification of an impending call to active duty
and dates of active duty status.
   (l)   Notification by City. Once the City has sufficient information to
determine whether the leave is being taken for an FMLA qualifying reason and
approval has been granted by the City's Benefits and Appeals Committee, the
City will provide the employee with a Designation Notice advising the employee
whether the leave qualifies for FMLA leave. If the employee is not eligible for
FMLA leave, the employee shall be informed of that fact.
      (1)   Each employee taking leave which meets the requirements for FMLA
leave will be provided with a Notice of Eligibility and Rights &
Responsibilities which will inform the employee of the specific expectation and
obligations of the employee. This notice will be provided orally within five
(5) of receipt of the employee's request for FMLA leave or acquiring knowledge
that the leave may be FMLA qualifying and in writing by the payday following
the date leave is designated as FMLA leave (if the following payday is less
than one week from the date leave is designated as FMLA leave, the City shall
provide written notice by the next payday), if proper and timely notice has
been completed by the employee.
      (2)   All medical documents, including medical certificates, shall be
maintained in the employee's separate confidential medical file. All other
documents shall be maintained in the employee's personnel file. The City shall
keep a record of all FMLA leave on its payroll records.
   (m)   Employee Benefits. If applicable, during FMLA leaves of absence, the
City shall continue to pay its portion of the health insurance premium and the
employee must continue to pay his or her share of the premium. Failure of the
employee to pay his or her share of the health insurance premium may result in
loss of coverage subject to the provisions of the federal statute. During the
approved FMLA leave, benefits will continue to accrue. If an employee fails to
return to work for reasons other than those beyond his or her control after the
expiration of FMLA leave for a period of at least ninety (90) calendar days,
the employee may be required to reimburse the City for the premiums it paid for
the employee while on leave.
   (n)   Employee's Reporting Requirements.
      (1)   The City reserves the right to require an employee on FMLA leave to
report periodically on his or her status and the intention of the employee to
return to work, as well as periodic recertification of the medical condition.
Human Resources will notify the employee in writing of the initial request for
medical certification. If necessary, the City will advise the employee of its
need for additional medical certification in writing. If the employee is
covered by workers' compensation, workers' compensation procedures will be
followed.
      (2)   An employee taking leave due to the employee's serious health
condition is required to obtain certification that the employee is able to
resume work prior to the return from FMLA leave.
         Such certification must assess the employee's ability to return to
work and perform the essential functions of the job as identified in writing by
the City.
      (3)   If the circumstances of an employee's leave change and the employee
is able to return earlier than scheduled or is unable to return to work on the
date originally indicated by the certifying health care provider, the employee
is required to notify Human Resources at least two (2) days prior to the date
the employee is able to return to work or was scheduled to report for work. If
the employee requires additional leave, the employee must provide an updated
Health Care Certification form in order to obtain approval for his/her
continued need to be absent from work.
      (4)   Failure of the employee to return to work on the date indicated by
the certifying health care provider is considered voluntary abandonment of
employment and is grounds for termination of employment on the date the
employee was expected to return from leave of absence.
   (o)   Restoration of Employees Returning from FMLA Leave - Employees who
return to work from FMLA leave of absence within or on the business day
following the expiration of the approved FMLA leave are entitled to return to
their job or an equivalent position without the loss of benefits or pay in
accordance with FMLA.
   (p)   Emergency Family Medical Leave - The City shall provide emergency
family and medical leave to employees for certain absences related to novel
coronavirus COVID-19 who meet the criteria set forth in, and in accordance
with, the Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act, H.R. 6201, Division
C, as may be amended or extended from time to time, who have not exhausted the
EFMLA benefit as of January 1, 2021. The City shall provide the EFMLA benefit
to eligible employees for the remaining number of weeks available for the leave
for a period up to, and including, January 31, 2021. The provisions of that Act
are incorporated herein by reference.

will be allowed to have compensatory time off for all hours worked in excess of
forty (40) hours per week. However, during work weeks where an actual work week
of forty (40) hours is not possible because the work week includes a paid
holiday or holidays set by the Mayor and Common Council, mall exempt employees
excluded from the overtime provisions of the FLSA shall be allowed compensatory
time off for hours worked in excess of the employee’s total regular non-holiday
work hours that week. Said compensatory time must be taken by an employee
within the calendar year in which it is accrued except that not more than

employees not excluded from the overtime provisions of the FLSA shall be paid
one and one-half (1-1/2) times their hourly rate as defined in the FLSA for

Sec. 2-82 Qualified Retired Employees' and Spouses' Participation in Group
Health Insurance Program. (Ord. 03-52, § 1, 12-1-03)
   (a)   Board of Public Works and Safety Resolution No. 89-4, allowing retired
employees and their spouses meeting the conditions set forth in the state law
to participate in the City’s group health insurance program completely at their
own expense, is ratified except to the extent it is inconsistent with this
ordinance.
   (b)   The City will pay fifty percent (50%) of the monthly group health
insurance premium for a retired employee of the City of Greenwood who retires
after December 31, 1998 and is at least fifty-five (55) years of age at
retirement for a PERF-eligible (non-public safety) employee, and at least
fifty-two (52) years of age at retirement for a public safety employee, except
that Robert Dine, Gary Neeman, and David Payne, who are members of the 1925
Police Pension Fund and will therefore be eligible under State law to draw
pensions before age fifty-two (52), will be eligible under this ordinance at
that time if the other requirements are satisfied; and who has given the City
at least twenty years of continuous full-time service; until the retired
employee reaches Social Security Normal Retirement Age (SSNRA) and becomes
eligible for Medicare Part A.
   A retired employee who is retired due to permanent disability or becomes
disabled while retired prior to SSNRA and is enrolled in the City's group
health plan for retirees, must apply for Medicare Part A under the Social
Security Act. The City will recommend a Social Security Representative and or
legal counsel to assist in the application of Social Security benefits at the
City's discretion. The City will pay the reasonable fee associated with this
advice as long as the member is an eligible and enrolled the retiree group
health plan. Disabled retirees who fail to apply for Social Security benefits
within 60 days of disability or when granted retirement due to disability will
not be eligible for the group health plan. If Medicare benefits are awarded to
the retiree, the retiree would remain eligible for the group health plan and
Medicare would be primary under Medicare's secondary payor rules until SSNRA.
Premiums for the retiree group health plan will be the same as nondisabled
employees cited in section (b). Failure to notify the City of a disability or
normal retirement age could result in a retroactive termination of benefits.
   (c)   If the spouse of a retired employee meeting the conditions set forth
in paragraph (b) above chooses to participate in the City's group health
insurance program, the City will also pay fifty percent (50%) of the additional
cost of the monthly premium incurred as a result of the spouse's participation,
until the retired employee becomes eligible for Medicare Part A coverage. If
the retired employee's spouse becomes eligible for Medicare Part A coverage or
obtains access to health insurance through employment or remarriage, or if the
retired employee and his or her spouse divorce before the retired employee
becomes eligible for Medicare Part A coverage, the City's payment of fifty
percent (50%) of the portion of the premium for the spouse will terminate upon
the occurrence of the terminating event. If the retired employee dies before
becoming eligible for Medicare Part A coverage, the City's payment of fifty
percent (50%) of the portion of the premium for the spouse will terminate two
(2) years after the date of the retired employee's death, or upon the
occurrence of one of the terminating events set forth in the previous sentence,
whichever is earlier.
   (d)   The City reserves the right to repeal or amend this ordinance and the
Greenwood Municipal Code section created herein at any time, and this ordinance
is not intended to create any vested rights. Nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to constitute a contract or to authorize any City official or employee
to enter into such a contract.
   (e)   In addition to the terminating events specified above, a retired
employee's or spouse's eligibility to participate in the City's group health
insurance program and to have the City pay fifty percent (50%) of the premium
will terminate if and when the City ceases to provide a group health insurance
program for active employees, and if and when the retired employee or spouse is
ten (10) business days late with his or her portion of the premium payment. The
premium is payable monthly on the twentieth (20th) day of the month." (Ord. 20-
42, § 1, 1-4-21)

Sec. 2-121 Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) Policy Statement.
   (a)   The following policy statement is adopted for the City of Greenwood,
acting by and through its Boards, Commissions, agents and departments:
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
      The Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") provides civil rights
protection to qualified individuals with disabilities in five (5) areas of
public and private life:
   Employment: Employers may not discriminate against an individual with a
disability in employment provided the person can perform the "essential
functions" of the job with or without reasonable accommodation. Employers must
provide reasonable accommodations unless doing so represents undue hardship for
the employer. The effective date for the City of Greenwood is July 26, 1992,
because the City employs twenty-five (25) or more employees.
   Public accommodations: Public accommodations must be available to disabled
persons through nondiscriminatory practices and accessible facilities. Affected
businesses include, for example, doctors, lawyers and accountants, zoos, parks,
banks, libraries, theaters, museums, restaurants, bars, schools, day care
centers, hotels and motels, stores and shopping centers, gas stations, and
other businesses and facilities which invite the public to do business.
Effective date is January 26, 1992.
   Public and private transportation: Transportation services, even if provided
by private companies and individuals, must not discriminate against individuals
with disabilities. That includes bus, rail and other conveyances that provide
service to the general public. It does not include air travel, and special
effective dates apply to "over the road" buses. Effective date is January 26,
1992.
   Telecommunication relay services: Providers of telephone services must
provide hearing and speech impaired individuals with telecommunications
services which enable them to communicate with hearing individuals. Effective
date is July 26, 1993.
   Services provided by State and local governments: State and local
governments must comply with the employment and public accommodation provisions
listed above, and must ensure that all programs and services provided or made
available by them do not discriminate against individuals with disabilities.
Effective date is January 26, 1992, with structural alterations to City's
buildings to be completed by January 26, 1995.
   Complaints, enforcement and remedies: An individual who believes that he or
she has been discriminated against may file a grievance with the City of
Greenwood ADA Coordinator or may file a complaint with the appropriate agency
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the date of alleged discrimination,
unless good cause for delay is shown. Pursuit of a complaint through the City's
grievance procedure is the kind of "good cause" which delays the start of the
one hundred eighty (180) days. Individuals may also initiate lawsuits against a
municipality as a means of compelling compliance with the ADA.
   It is the policy of the City of Greenwood to not exclude qualified
individuals with disabilities from participation in or benefiting from the
services, programs or activities of the municipality.
   Also, it is the policy of this municipality not to discriminate against a
qualified individual with a disability in its job application procedures; the
hiring, advancement or discharge of employees; employee compensation; job
training and other terms, conditions and privileges of employment. It is the
intention of this municipality to comply with all applicable requirements of
the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
   Members of the public, including individuals with disabilities and groups
representing individuals with disabilities, are encouraged to submit
suggestions to municipal officials on how the municipality might better meet
the needs of individuals with disabilities pursuant to its stated policy.
   To meets its obligations under the ADA, the City of Greenwood will, to the
extent possible:
   1. Ensure that services provided by the City are equally available to
individuals with disabilities;
   2. Ensure that individuals with disabilities are able to participate in City
sponsored programs and activities;
   3. Remove structural and architectural barriers to participation by
individuals with disabilities in City owned and leased buildings;
   4. Take steps to ensure that vendors, contractors and other who do business
with the City do not discriminate against individuals who have disabilities;
   5. Reaffirm that the City is an equal opportunity employer, and that hiring
is done without reference to race, gender, religion, natural origin or
disability;
   6. Provide a grievance system by which individuals with disabilities might
make known to the City problems that exist in the provision of City services,
so that such problems may be resolved quickly and fairly.
   7. Appoint an ADA Coordinator who shall be responsible for oversight of all
ADA compliance activities, and shall receive complaints through the grievance
system, and investigate and resolve them.
   The ADA Coordinator for the City of Greenwood is:
         James Peck
         City Engineer
         300 S. Madison Avenue
         Greenwood, Indiana 46143

   (b)   The Greenwood Common Council delegates the authority to the Greenwood
Board of Public Works and Safety to amend this policy when required by Federal
law, to make all reasonable rules and regulations to comply with this policy
and the ADA, as amended, to adopt a grievance procedure under the ADA, and do

disrupts or prevents simultaneous communication between a member not physically
present at the meeting and the Common Council or disrupts or prevents a member
of the public who is not present at the meeting from attending and observing

      (1)   Be in writing;
      (2)   Include a description of the real estate sufficient for

notice may be posted at the property at the time of abatement instead of by
equivalent service as required by subsection (d). A continuous abatement notice
shall serve as notice to the real property Owner and/or Responsible Party that
each subsequent violation during the same year for which the initial notice of

00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. on any day except Sunday. All inspections shall be
subject to the following standards and conditions:
         a.   An inspection of an interior of a Structure may take place only
if a complaint has been received by the City and such complaint, in the opinion
of the Code Enforcement Official, provides reasonable grounds for the belief
that a violation exists, or if such inspection is undertaken as part of a
regular inspection program whereby certain areas of the City are being
inspected in their entirety at the direction of the Board of Public Works and
Safety.
         b.   The Code Enforcement Official shall furnish to the Owner, Tenant,

involved in carrying out the provisions of this code, the Code Enforcement
Official shall have the authority, upon approval of the Board of Public Works
and Safety, to grant modifications for individual cases, provided the Code

lessen health, life and fire safety requirements or modify the rules of the
Fire Prevention and Building Safety Commission. The details of action granting
modification shall be recorded and entered in the department files. (Ord. 12-
82, §1E, 12-17-12)
   (f)   Violations.
      (1)   Unlawful acts. It shall be unlawful for a Person, firm or
corporation to be in conflict with or in violation of any of the provisions of
this code.

with subsections (g)(3) and (g)(4) below.
      (3)   Prosecution of violation. Any Person failing to comply with a
notice of violation and request for abatement served in accordance with
subsections (g)(3) and (4) shall be deemed guilty of a violation of this code
and the violation shall be deemed a Strict Liability Offense. If the notice of

the first offense of a violation of this code, a fine of $50. Each day that a
violation continues after due notice has been served shall be deemed a separate
offense subject to a daily fine of $50 per day. Daily fines shall continue to
accumulate until the total of said fines reaches the small claims
jurisdictional limit of the Johnson Circuit and Superior Courts, Magistrate
Division, and/or compliance with this Property Maintenance Code is achieved.
      (5)   Repeat offenses. Any Person who is found to have committed a
separate offense of this code after having been found to commit an earlier
offense no sooner than 30 days but within a two-year period shall be assessed a
fine of $100 per day. Daily fines shall continue to accumulate until the total
of said fines reaches the small claims jurisdictional limit of the Johnson
Circuit and Superior Courts, Magistrate Division, and/or compliance with this
Property Maintenance Code is achieved. The purpose of this provision is to
double the fines assessed against those Persons.
      (6)   Abatement of violation. The imposition of the penalties herein

      (8)   In the event that the Owner or Responsible Party fails to remedy
the violation within the time frame stipulated in the notice, the City reserves
the right to remedy the violation and collect such costs together with
reasonable attorney fees, consultant fees and collection fees, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, by suing the Owner or Responsible Party in a court
of competent jurisdiction or in the alternate, by certifying said costs of
correction as any other special assessment upon the Premises from which said
remedy of said violation was made.
   (g)   Notice and orders.
      (1)   Warning citation. It is the policy of the City of Greenwood to use
fair and reasonable judgment in the administration of its enforcement actions.
To this end, a warning citation may be issued for a violation of this code. The
warning citation shall be worded so as to sufficiently identify the Premises
and the nature of the violation. If the Premises Owner or Person being cited
fails to correct the violation in the time allotted by a Code Enforcement
Official, then a notice of correction order shall be issued. In his or her
discretion, a Code Enforcement Official shall have the right to forego issuing
a warning citation and may proceed to issue a notice of correction order. The
issuance of a warning citation shall not be a prerequisite to the issuance of a
notice of correction order. There shall be no right of appeal from the issuance
of a warning citation.
      (2)   Notice to Owner or to Person or Persons responsible. Whenever the
Code Enforcement Official determines that there has been a violation of this
code or has grounds to believe that a violation has occurred, a notice of
correction order ("correction order") shall be given to the Owner or the Person
or Persons responsible therefore in the manner prescribed in subsections (g)(3)
and (g)(4) of this section. The City will take enforcement action only with the
Owner or Responsible Party at the time the violation is identified.
      (3)   Notice of correction order. Such notice prescribed in subsection
(g)(2) of this section shall:
         a.   Be in writing;
         b.   Include a description of the real estate sufficient for
identification;
         c.   Include a statement of the violation or violations and section(s)
violated and why the notice is being issued and include a description of the
actions necessary to correct the violation or violations;
         d.   Include a correction order allowing a reasonable amount of time,
of at least ten days (excepting cases of Emergency or Safety Concerns), but not
more than 60 days, from the time when the correction order is served, to make
the repairs and Improvements required to bring the Dwelling Unit, Structure or
Improvement into compliance with the provisions of this code; and
         e.   Include a notice containing the right to appeal the Code
Enforcement Official's determination to the Board of Public Works and Safety in
accordance with subsection (h) of this section.
      (4)   Emergency or Safety Concerns. When a Code Enforcement Official
finds that a condition existing on a property qualifies as an Imminent Danger
and/or an Emergency or Safety Concern as defined in Section 6-286(d) below, the
Code Enforcement shall include on the Notice of Correction Order a statement
indicating such a finding and allowing a period of time of not less than
twenty-four (24) hours to abate the Nuisance.
      (5)   Method of service. Notice shall be deemed to be properly served if
a copy is sent by certain return receipt mail, hand delivered by an employee of
the City, or leaving a copy of the Notice at the location of the property in a
conspicuous location and mailing a copy of the Notice by first class mail to
the last known address of the Person to whom Notice must be given.
      (6)   Duplicate Notice to Property Maintenance Company. When a Code
Enforcement Official has reason to believe that there is a property maintenance
or servicing company monitoring a given property on behalf of the Owner, a bank
holding mortgage rights to the property, or a corporate Operator, the Code
Enforcement Official may provide duplicate Notice to said property maintenance
or servicing company. Provision of additional Notice under this subsection
shall not eliminate any Notice requirement for the Owner or Responsible Party
of the property and shall not render the property maintenance or servicing
company liable for failure to abate unless otherwise provided in this Code.
(Ord. 13-62, § 2, 10-28-13)
   (h)   Means of appeal.
      (1)   Appeal to Board of Public Works and Safety. Any Person aggrieved by
a determination of the Code Enforcement Official to the effect that a notice of
violation or order served in accordance with subsection (g) of this section is
in error, or should, due to hardship, be modified or entitled to a variance
from enforcement, or that a reasonable extension of time for the compliance
should be granted upon the grounds of a demonstrated case of hardship and
evidence of an actual undertaking to correct the violation, together with a
legitimate intent to comply within a reasonable time period, may appeal to the

Sec. 6-381 Appointment and Removal of Police Department Members.
   (a)   The Commission shall appoint and may remove member of the Police
Department, except for the chief, the assistant chief, and the two (2) deputy
chiefs of police. The Mayor of the City shall have the right to appoint these
four (4) positions, who serve at the pleasure of the Mayor. Upon the expiration
of the term or removal from office of any chief, assistant chief, or deputy
chief of police, such person shall be appointed by the Commission to the rank
in the Police Department which he held at the time of appointment to the
position of chief, assistant chief, or deputy chief of police. In the event the
chief, assistant chief, or deputy chief of police has qualified in accordance
with the promotional procedure as prescribed by the Commission in its rules and
procedures for any rank which is higher than the rank held at the time of his
appointment, then he shall, upon expiration of his term or removal as chief,
assistant chief, or deputy chief of police, be appointed by the Commission to
the rank for which he has qualified under the promotional procedures
established. (Ord. 99-10, § 2, 4-5-99; Ord. No. 15-21, § 1, 5-18-15)
   (b)   A person appointed to the position of chief, assistant chief, or
deputy chief of police must have at least five (5) years of continuous service
with the department immediately before his appointment; however, this
requirement may be waived by majority vote of the Common Council on the request
of the City executive, although the person must still have at least five (5)
years of service on a full-time paid police department or agency. (Ord. 99-10,
§ 2, 4-5-99)
   (c)   The rules and procedures shall provide that all promotions to any rank
be from the next immediate lower rank and that person shall have qualified in
time of service required by this section. The promoted ranks in the department
shall be captain, lieutenant, and sergeant.
   (d)   A police officer must have satisfactorily served at least one (1) year
in rank by January 1 of an even numbered year before being eligible for
promotion to the next higher rank. The Chief shall certify on or before
September 1 of odd numbered years all police officers that may sit for the next
promotional test and interviews. A police officer must have been on the Police
Department of the City for a minimum of three (3) years before he is eligible
for the rank of sergeant. A sergeant must have been a police officer on the
department for a period of not less than four (4) years before he is eligible
for the rank of lieutenant. A lieutenant must have been a police officer on the
Department for a period of not less than five (5) years before he is eligible
for the rank of captain.
   (e)   No police officer may take a promotional test or participate in the
promotional process for the practice. (Ord. 93-3, § 1, 6-21-93)
Sec. 6-382 Persons Eligible for Appointment.  29

licensed physician or licensed psychologist in accordance with I.C. 36 8 8 19
(c).
      (4)   Other Selection Criteria.
         Applicants may also be rated on other selection criteria which may
include mental alertness, character, habits and reputation, pursuant to testing
methods adopted by the Commission. The Commission shall adopt rules for grading
the applicants, including the establishment of a passing score. The Commission
shall determine the appropriate weight to be given to the general aptitude
test, to the extent it exceeds a passing score, and to the other selection
criteria in determining the scores.
   (e)   Applicants for appointment or reappointment to the Police Department
must pass the general aptitude test described in subsection (d)(1) above, which
shall be conducted according to procedures adopted by the Commission. The
examination results shall be filed with the Commission.
   (f)   If the Commission finds that an applicant lacks the proper
qualifications, it shall reject the applicant. Applicants not rejected shall
then be rated on the other selection criteria according to methods adopted by
the Commission, as described in subsection (d)(4). The Commission shall place
the names of applicants with passing scores on an eligibility list in order of
their scores and shall certify the list to the Clerk. (Ord. 11-37, §1, 11-21-
11)
   (g)   (1)   When a vacancy occurs in the Police Department, the Commission,
upon a written request by the Chief, shall administer the Physical Agility Test
to the applicant having the highest score on the Eligibility List.
      (2)   Prior to administering the Physical Agility Test, the Commission
shall require the applicant to provide an authorization form, to be signed by
the applicant's physician, regarding the applicant's ability to participate in
the physical agility test. Such authorization shall:
         (A)   list the elements of the Physical Agility Test;
         (B)   require the physician to certify only that the applicant may
safely participate in the test; and
         (C)   not inquire as to the applicant's health or physical condition.
      (3)   The Commission shall certify the results of the Agility and General
Aptitude Tests to the Local Pension Board prior to extending a conditional
offer of employment.
      (4)   The Commission shall develop and maintain a list of area physicians
willing to examine applicants who do not have a family physician, and shall
make that list available to applicants upon request. The maintaining of such a
list is in no way an endorsement of such physicians. The applicant shall bear
the entire costs of any examination required by the physician.
   (h)   If the applicant passes the Physical Agility Test, and is still of
good moral character, the Commission shall extend a conditional offer of
employment.
   (i)   If a conditional offer of employment is accepted, the baseline
statewide physical exam and baseline statewide mental exam, as prescribed by
PERF, shall be administered to the applicant by the physicians named by the
Local Pension Board. The applicant shall also execute a release regarding
physical and mental status and history. The medical exam may include a drug and
alcohol screen. At least one-half the cost of these exams shall be paid for by
the Commission.
   (j)   Persons currently employed in a law enforcement capacity by another
law enforcement agency who have successfully completed the Indiana Law
Enforcement Academy (ILEA) Tier 1 basic academy, or successfully completed a
Police Office Standards and Training (POST) certified law enforcement academy
in another State (480 hour minimum), and have at least one year full-time paid
post academy law enforcement service are eligible for consideration for
appointment as a lateral entry to the Greenwood Police Department. All lateral
entry applicants must successfully meet and complete the requirements and
process set forth in Sec.
6-382(a) through (i); additionally, out of state lateral entry applicants must
also meet the requirements of, and be approved by, the Indiana Law Enforcement
Training Board (LETB).
   (k)   The Local Pension Board shall determine if the applicant has passed
the baseline statewide physical exam and the baseline statewide mental exam. If
the applicant passed both such exams, the Local Pension Board shall send copies
and certification of the results of the baseline statewide physical examination
as well as certification of the results of the Physical Agility and baseline
statewide mental examination to the PERF Board, pursuant to I.C. 36 8 8 19. If
the applicant fails to pass either or both the baseline statewide physical exam
and the baseline statewide mental exam, he has failed to meet the conditions of
the conditional offer of employment.
   (l)   To the extent required by the ADA, all records containing medical
information about either an applicant or employee shall be kept confidential,
and shall be maintained by the Clerk in separate files which shall be kept in a
secure location. Such information shall be made available for review only by:
(Ord. 11-37, §1, 11-21-11)
      (1)   the applicant or employee;
            (2)    the Chief;
            (3)    the Commission in performance of its official functions;
            (4)    the Local Pension Board in performance of its official
functions;
            (5)    PERF in performance of its official functions; and
            (6)    other persons or entities, pursuant to state and federal
law.
      Supervisors or safety personnel may be given medical information as is
necessary to provide workplace accommodations or possible emergency first aid.
      The Clerk shall maintain a permanent log or other record which shall be
signed and dated by each person who reviews medical information in any file.
(Ord. 11-37, §1, 11-21-11)
   (m)   All announcements regarding applications and testing will state that
the City of Greenwood Police Department is an equal opportunity employer and
that upon reasonable notice by the applicant, accommodations regarding testing
and the application process will be made. The Commission shall consider and
develop alternative methods for giving tests and accepting applications as may
be required under the ADA, such as, but not limited to, employing readers,
giving tests orally, and testing at accessible locations.
   (n)   All appointments are probationary for a period of one (1) year. If the
Commission finds, upon the recommendation of the department during the
probationary period, that the conduct or capacity of a probationary member is
not satisfactory, the Commission shall notify him in writing that he is being
reprimanded, that he is being suspended, or that he will not receive a
permanent appointment. If a member is notified that he will not receive a
permanent appointment, his employment immediately ceases. Otherwise, at the
expiration of the probationary period the member is considered regularly
employed. (Ord. 93-3, § 1, 6-21-93; Ord. 20-38, § 1, 10-19-20)

Sec. 6-383 Promotions in Rank. 30
30. I.C., 36-8-3.5-13, addresses promotions, and I.C., 36-8-3.5-14, address
competitive examinations.
   (a)   Rules governing promotions in rank from the next lower rank shall be:
      (1)   The score received by the police officer on a written competitive
examination shall be considered in rating as forty five percent (45%) of the
overall rating.
      (2)   The score received by a police officer on an oral competitive
interview conducted by the Commission shall be considered as fifteen percent
(15%) of the overall rating. When considering the percentage of an oral
interview, the Commission shall devise the method of computing this percentage
and the manner in which it is awarded. If any police officer receives four
percent (4%) or less, the Commission members must explain in writing the
reasons for the score. Such shall be placed in the officer's file.
      (3)   The score received by a police officer on a competitive interview
conducted by police professionals shall be considered as fifteen percent (15%)
of the overall rating. The police professionals conducting this interview shall
be individuals of a command level from law enforcement agencies in the central
Indiana area as chosen by the Commission. When considering the percentage of
said interview, the Commission shall devise the method of computing this
percentage and the manner in which it is awarded. If any police officer
receives four percent (4%) or less, the interview members must explain in
writing the reasons for the score. Such shall be placed in the officer's file.
      (4)   The performance record of the police officer shall be considered as
fifteen percent (15%) of the overall rating. This will include all past
performance ratings subsequent to the establishment of the previous eligibility
list. All police officers shall receive an equal past performance rating during
the establishment of the first eligibility list only, or when the Commission
determines that equity and fairness demands it because of a change in the past
performance rating system adopted by the Board of Public Works and Safety. New
past performance rating systems cannot be adopted more frequently than once
every two (2) years.
      (5)   A police officer's length of continuous service shall be considered
at one half percent (1/2%) per year of service up to a maximum of ten percent
(10%) of the rating. The appropriate fraction of one half percent (1/2%) will
be used for less than any full anniversary year in computing seniority rights.
Seniority rights scores will be fixed at the date of the written examination
and remain fixed on the promotion list until such time as examinations are
administered and a new promotion list is posted. For purposes of this section,
continuous service means service which is uninterrupted by periods during which
the officer is not considered as being a full time police officer of the Police
Department. The Commission will determine the procedures for determining the
fractional year of service. The score for service (seniority) will be
determined as of the date of the written examination.
      (6)   For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) and (3) above, the Commission
shall determine the questions and the manner in which the interview shall be
conducted.
   (b)   The Commission shall set a date in November of each odd numbered year
to give a competitive written examination for each rank and all eligible police
officers shall be notified of written materials from which they can study. The
Commission may employ instructors, purchase materials and make other
expenditures to provide information for applicants for promotion examinations.
The Commission shall also select and designate an appropriate person and/or
agency or service outside the Police Department to prepare, administer and
grade all written examinations conducted hereunder.
   (c)   The identity of the police officer taking the written examination
shall be withheld from the person or persons grading the examination, and all
written examinations are confidential. Any oral interview administered pursuant
to paragraphs (a)(2) or (3) shall be given and scored prior to the scores on
any written exam being disclosed to the Commission.
   (d)   The examination papers shall not be placed under the control of the
Commission nor shall members of the Commission see the examinations until after
the tests have been taken, and all oral interviews are completed and scored.
   (e)   All written examination papers and scores and oral interview scores
shall be made part of the permanent file of the officer taking the examination
and shall be maintained under the supervision of the Chief. The Commission
shall notify each police officer in writing of the scores received on the oral
interview and written examination. If any police officer is aggrieved by the
score received on a written examination or oral interview, he shall have the
right to appeal to the Commission for a review of that score within ten (10)
calendar days after notice of the score has been sent. The Commission, after
reviewing the score and examination, shall have the authority to affirm or
correct the score based upon written findings of its review. If a police
officer's score is changed because of erroneous scoring of the written
examination, written examinations of all other police officers which were also
erroneously scored shall be changed by the Commission, regardless of whether
those police officers appealed their scores or not. (Ord. 93-3, § 1, 6-21-93)
Sec. 6-384 Performance Ratings System.  31
   (a)   The Board of Public Works and Safety shall adopt a performance rating
system for the Police Department which shall be implemented by the Police
Department. A performance rating under said system shall be made once every six
(6) months for each police officer, including probationary officers, except as
provided for in Sec. 6-383 (a)(3). The rating shall be accomplished as provided
for in the performance rating system adopted by the Board of Public Works and
Safety, except that the Chief and Assistant Chief of police shall have the
performance rating system administered to them by the Board of Public Works and
Safety or its designee. Each police officer must sign and receive a copy of
each performance rating.
   (b)   Any police officer who is aggrieved by the performance rating given
may appeal to the Commission for a review of the rating. The appeal must be in
writing and filed with the Commission within ten (10) days after notice of
rating has been given to the police officer. The Commission shall hold a
hearing and may either affirm or change said rating upon written findings.
   (c)   All ratings shall become part of the police officer's personnel
record, and each police officer must sign and receive a copy of each rating.
   (d)   No ratings scores shall be disclosed to the Commission until after the
scoring for the oral interviews has been completed. (Ord. 93-3, § 1, 6-21-93)

Sec. 6-385 Probationary Promotions.  32
   (a)   Subject to the provisions of subsection (d) below, when a vacancy in
rank occurs, the Chief may in writing request the Commission to fill a
particular rank. The Commission shall fill said rank from the eligibility list
with the applicant with the highest overall score, within forty five (45) days
of the Chief's request.
   (b)   The eligibility list heretofore created shall be maintained for a
period of two (2) years, or until exhausted, at which time there shall be
another eligibility list established for every rank as previously prescribed.
If, after an eligibility list is established, any disciplinary action other
than an oral reprimand is taken against an officer on the eligibility list,
then the Commission shall review the past performance and other factors as
provided in Sec. 6-383 in determining eligibility for promotion, and the
Commission may adjust or remove said officer's position on said eligibility
list as a result of said review.
   (c)   All promotions are probationary for a period of one year. At the end
of this period, a probationary police officer's performance shall be reviewed
by his immediate superior and the Chief who shall recommend to the Commission
one of the following:
      (1)   The promotion be made permanent.
      (2)   The promotion be revoked.
      The Commission shall review the recommendation and decide what action
should be taken. The probationary police officer is entitled to appear before
the Commission and be heard on any matter detrimental to the police officer in
the supervisor's report. If the promotion is revoked, the police officer shall
be returned to the rank last held before the promotion. If such rank is not
open, the police officer is entitled to the pay of the rank in any subordinate
capacity until such rank is open.
   (d)   A police officer whose probationary promotional rank is revoked will
be removed from any eligibility list for promotion and will be ineligible to
test for promotion for two (2) years. (Ord. 93-3, § 1, 6-21-93)

Sec. 6-386 Disciplinary Actions.  33
   (a)   Disciplinary action by the Chief. The Chief may reprimand or suspend
an officer without pay for five (5) days or less for any of the following
reasons:
      (1)   neglect of duty;
      (2)   neglect or disobedience of an order or orders;
      (3)   violation of departmental rules and regulations as established by
the Board of Public Works and Safety;
      (4)   incapacity;
      (5)   absence without leave;
      (6)   immoral conduct;
      (7)   conduct injurious to the public peace or welfare;
      (8)   conduct unbecoming of an officer;
      (9)   unjust persecution of a subordinate police officer;
      (10)    furnishing information, other than public information, to an
applicant for an appointment or promotion that may give that person an
advantage over another applicant; and
      (11)   other breaches of discipline.
   (b)   Notice of discipline. The Chief shall file with the Commission within
seventy-two (72) hours after imposing discipline, a report of any disciplinary
action taken involving a written reprimand or a suspension without pay,
describing the offense committed, and any other facts relevant to the decision
of which the Commission should be advised. Copies of said report shall be
provided to the officer disciplined and shall be placed in the officer's
personnel file. The Chief may, in addition, file disciplinary charges with the
Commission.
   (c)   Statement of discipline. Whenever discipline consisting of a written
reprimand or suspension without pay of five (5) days or less is imposed by the
Chief, he shall provide a written statement of discipline to the officer
stating the following:
      (1)   offense committed;
      (2)   a description of the investigation conducted;
      (3)   the reasons for the discipline; and
      (4)   the facts supporting the decision.
   (d)   Review of procedure. Any officer subjected to a written reprimand or
suspension without pay for less than three (3) days may request the Commission
to review the discipline imposed by filing with the Commission and the Chief,
within five (5) calendar days of receipt of the written statement of
discipline, a written request for review, which shall state why the police
officer believes the specific procedures employed to investigate the offense
and impose the discipline were unfair. At its meeting next following the filing
of a written request for review pursuant to this section, the Commission shall
review the officer's statement as contained in his request and the written
statement of discipline provided by the Chief, and if the procedures used by
the Chief were fair, and the penalty imposed is not unreasonable on its face,
the Commission shall affirm the Chief's decision. If the Commission determines
that the procedure used was unfair, or that the penalty was manifestly
unreasonable, it shall remand to the Chief for corrective action. No further
review shall be had, except upon the Commission's own motion pursuant to
subsection (h).
   (e)   Request for review. Any officer subjected to a suspension without pay
for a period of three (3) to five (5) days may request the Commission to review
the discipline imposed, by filing with the Commission and the Chief, within ten
(10) calendar days of receipt of the written statement of discipline, a notice
of request for review. Within twenty (20) days thereafter, the officer shall
submit a written statement which sets forth specific facts tending to negate
the charges made, facts found or penalty imposed, and any documents or other
evidence in support thereof. The officer's statement will be under oath, or
verified.
   (f)   Commission's review upon request. The Commission shall review the
decision of the Chief based upon the written statement of discipline and any
supporting documents not heretofore presented which are submitted by the Chief,
and the verified statement or affidavit of the officer, along with any
supporting documents submitted. The Commission may, in its discretion, hold a
hearing upon any issue regarding the discipline imposed, including the penalty,
and may accept evidence on any matter; however, the Commission may not accept
evidence which could have been provided to the Chief in his initial
investigation, but was not, except for good cause shown.
   (g)   Standard for review. If, after review or hearing pursuant to
subsection (f), above, the Commission decides that the discipline imposed by
the Chief is not supported by the evidence, is arbitrary and capricious or an
abuse of discretion, the decision may be modified or set aside, provided,
however, that the Commission may not discharge, demote or suspend a police
officer for more than five (5) days unless the Commission has held a hearing
pursuant to subsection (l). The Commission's decision must be supported by a
preponderance of the evidence and by written findings, as required in
subsection (p), below.
   (h)   Commission may review upon its own motion. The Commission may, upon
its own motion, review the decision of the Chief to impose discipline
consisting of a written reprimand or a suspension without pay for five (5) days
or less, whether the officer requests review or not, to prevent manifest
injustice, or when the public interest requires it, according to the procedures
set forth in subsections (e), (f) and (g), above, except that:
      (1)   Such motion must be made at the regular or special meeting which
next follows the Chief's notification of discipline imposed pursuant to
subsection (b), and must include specific findings of manifest injustice or the
public interest which require the Commission's intervention.
      (2)   The Chief and the officer shall have twenty (20) calendar days
thereafter to submit the statements and documents required by subsections (e)
and (f), above.
      (3)   The Commission may uphold the decision of the Chief or may increase
the penalty imposed. The Commission may not overturn the decision of the Chief
or decrease the penalty imposed, nor may the Commission take such action in
lieu of a request for review pursuant to subsection (e).
   (i)   Suspension pending hearing. Notwithstanding subsection (a), above, the
Chief may suspend a police officer without pay up to the date of the next
meeting of the Commission, even though the suspension will last for more than
five (5) days, when the Chief has filed charges with the Commission pursuant to
subsection (b). At the Commission's next meeting, the Commission shall, in
addition to setting the date of the hearing, continue the suspension, terminate
the suspension, or order that the officer be reimbursed for the pay lost while
suspended without pay. Both the officer and the Chief may make either a
personal or written statement to the Commission regarding the propriety of
suspension without pay pending the hearing. If a member is suspended or placed
upon administrative leave, the member is entitled to the member's allowances
for insurance benefits to which the member was entitled before being suspended
or placed on administrative leave.
   (j)   Authorization for discipline. Any police officer may be disciplined by
the Commission for any reason authorized by I.C. 36-8-3-4, as amended, by this
Ordinance, as amended, or by department rules and regulations existing at the
time of the act constituting the alleged offense..
   (k)   Disciplinary action that may be taken. The Commission may take the

Assistant Chief of police:
      (1)    Reprimand;
      (2)    Suspension with or without pay;
      (3)    Demotion;
      (4)    Dismissal;
      (5)    Forfeiture;
      (6)    Administrative leave.

charges in the trial court. Any other action by the Commission is stayed until
the disposition of the charges in the trial court. An administrative leave may
be with or without pay, as determined by the Commission. If the member is
placed on leave without pay, the Commission, in its discretion, may award back
pay if the member is exonerated in the criminal matter.
   (l)   Hearing before the Commission. Upon receipt of charges filed by the
Chief, or where the Commission elects to hold a hearing pursuant to a request
for review as authorized by subsection (f), or on its own motion pursuant to
subsection (h), the Commission shall schedule a hearing, and written notice of
the hearing shall be served on the police officer at least fourteen days in
advance of the date set for the hearing. Notice must be served upon the police
officer by service upon the member in person or by a copy left at the member's
last and usual place of residence. The notice must state:
      (1)   the time and place of the hearing;
      (2)    the charges against the police officer;
      (3)    the specific conduct that comprises the charges;
      (4)    that the police officer is entitled to be represented by counsel;
      (5)    that the police officer is entitled to have subpoenas issued and
executed;
      (6)    that the police officer is entitled to call and cross-examine
witnesses; and

      (2)    examine witnesses under oath; and
      (3)    order the production of books, papers, and other evidence by
issuance of subpoenas.
   (n)   Compelling testimony of witness. If a witness refuses to appear at a
hearing of the Commission after having received notice requiring his
attendance, or refuses to produce evidence that the Commission has requested in
writing, the Commission may file an affidavit in the circuit court of the
county setting forth the facts of the refusal. Upon the filing of the
affidavit, a summons shall be issued from the circuit court and served by the
sheriff of the county requiring the appearance of the witness or the production
of information or evidence to the Commission.
   (o)   Contempt of court, expenses. Disobedience of a summons constitutes
contempt of the circuit court from which the summons has been issued. Expenses
related to the filing of an affidavit and the issuance and service of a summons
shall be charged to the witness against whom the summons has been issued,
unless the circuit court finds that the action of the witness was taken in good
faith and with reasonable cause. In that case, and in any case in which an
affidavit has been filed without the issuance of a summons, the expense shall
be charged to the Commission.

presence of the adverse party. The term does not include the formal written
submission submitted to the Commission (and served upon opposing parties) and
testimony and evidence presented at the hearing. A Commissioner who is exposed
to ex parte communication (or attempts) shall immediately inform the other
Commissioners and the adverse party. A Commissioner who has received ex parte
information may be excluded from any participation in the subject matter of the
ex parte communication upon the motion of either party and majority vote of the
remaining Commissioners. A Commissioner’s failure to disclose ex parte
communication (including attempts which he or she rebuffs) shall subject the
Commissioner to the disciplines found in Section 6-378 of this Article as well
as any other discipline provided for by law. An officer who participates in ex
parte communication or attempts at ex parte communication shall be subject to
discipline through the merit process up to termination. Nothing in this section
shall be construed to prevent the Chief or the Chief's delegate from
communicating with the Commission pursuant to the Indiana Code or Greenwood
ordinances.
   (q)   Decision of Commission. A decision by the Commission to discipline a
police officer may be made only if supported by a preponderance of the evidence
presented at the hearing, or submitted for review, and upon written findings.
   (r)   Appeal to court. A police officer who is aggrieved by a decision of
the Commission to suspend for a period of greater than five (5) working days,
demote a police officer or dismiss a police officer, may appeal to the circuit
court of the county. The appeal shall be made in accordance with I.C. 36-8-3-4,
as amended.

Chief against a police officer shall be investigated promptly, according to the
following procedure:

complaint. The investigation board shall be made up of three (3) police
officers and a chairperson who may or may not be a police officer. The
chairperson shall keep order, maintain documents and transcripts, schedule
witnesses, advise the board as to procedure and other matters, and perform
other administrative functions, but shall not investigate the complaint, vote,
or otherwise participate in the decision-making process.
      (2)   Within ten (10) working days of the filing of the complaint, the
board, if appointed, or the Chief, if no board is appointed, shall investigate
and file a written report of the findings and conclusions of the investigation
in the office of the Chief. Such time for investigation may be extended up to
sixty (60) days, if the Chief deems it necessary.

Works and Safety, and this Ordinance.
   (t)   Notice requirements. Whenever, in this Ordinance, notice is required
to be given to the Commission, or reports or other documents are required to be
filed or served, service upon the President of the Commission or the
Commission’s counsel shall be deemed to be service upon the Commission.
Whenever notice is required to be given to the Chief, or reports or other
documents are required to be filed or served, service upon the Chief, Assistant
Chief, the Chief’s executive secretary or the Corporation Counsel shall be

temporary leave of absence without pay or financial obligation to the City, to
the appropriate police officers. The police officer with the least time of
service shall be put on leave of absence first, with other police officers also
put on leave of absence in their same service order until the desired level of
police officers is achieved. If two (2) or more police officers have the same
service date, the Commission shall consider past evaluations to determine who
should be put on leave first.
   (b)   If the Police Department is increased in number again, the police
officer on leave of absence shall be reinstated before an applicant on the
eligibility list is appointed. The reinstatements begin with the last member
granted a leave.
   (c)   A police officer on leave of absence shall keep the Commission advised
of his current address. A police officer shall be informed of reinstatement by
written notice sent by certified mail with return receipt requested. Within ten
(10) calendar days after a police officer receives notice of reinstatement, the
police officer must accept reinstatement and must commence employment within
thirty (30) calendar days after receiving said notice. All reinstatement rights
granted to a police officer terminate upon failure of a police officer to
accept reinstatement within that period.
   (d)   If it is necessary for economic reasons to reduce the number of police
officers holding a specific rank in the department, the police officer with the
least time of service in rank shall be reduced in rank and placed on a
reinstatement list until the desired level of police officers in that rank is
achieved. The Commission shall reduce in rank the police officer with the
lowest past performance rating during the immediate two (2) year period in the
event the length of service in rank is the same for more than one police
officer.
   (e)   A police officer on the reinstatement list will be reinstated to a
vacant position prior to any police officer on the promotion eligibility list
being promoted to the vacant position. The promotion shall begin with the last
police officer placed on the reinstatement list for that rank. (Ord. 93-3, § 1,

Commissioners and the adverse party. A Commissioner who has received ex parte
information may be excluded from any participation in the subject matter of the
ex parte communication upon motion of either party and majority vote of the
remaining Commissioners. A Commissioner’s failure to disclose ex parte
communication (including attempts which he or she rebuffs) may subject the

   (e)   Security Required of Permit Applicants. The following shall be
required of each applicant to obtain a permit:
      (1)   Every applicant shall post with the Community Development Services
Department a performance security in the form of an individual or blanket bond
naming the City as obligee, or an irrevocable letter of credit signed by a bank
officer naming the City as sole beneficiary, to be honored upon presentment.
Such security shall remain with the City until the completion and acceptance of
the work performed and the posting of a maintenance bond or security as
hereafter set out. Furthermore, said performance security shall not be released
without a statement from the Community Development Services Department or its
designee indicating that the work is complete.
      (2)   A performance security for a public roadway excavation/cut or push/
bore under a public roadway shall be in an amount of Fifteen Thousand Dollars
($15,000.00) or as otherwise prescribed by applicable law. Security for all
other right-of-way disturbances shall be in an amount not less than One
Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00). In the event that a cut or
excavation is within five feet of the pavement and/or runs lengthwise along
such street, the applicant shall be required to post a performance security on
the basis of $10 per square foot of pavement cut or $5 per square foot if
outside of the actual pavement; provided, however, the performance security
shall be in an amount not less than Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00). If
applicant is using sub-contractors to complete the work specified in the
permit, all such sub-contractors must meet the same security requirements as
outlined herein.
      (3)   Said performance security shall be released only after the
completion of the work, inspection and approval by the Community Development
Services Department and the posting of a maintenance bond or security in the
amount hereafter set out. Such approval shall be based on the requirement that
the City's property disturbed be repaired to as good or better condition than
was its condition prior to work's commencement, and in compliance with the city
standards, and upon the further requirement that the work shall be in
conformance with the stated conditions of the permit.
      (4)   A maintenance security required under this section shall be equal
to the initial performance security amount. Said maintenance security shall be
posted with the Community Development Services Department and shall be for a
period of three (3) years from the date of work approval by the Community
Development Services Department for a public roadway excavation/cut or push/
bore under a public roadway disturbance and six (6) months for all other types
of right-of-way disturbances. Said maintenance security shall be released by
the Community Development Services Department at the required period's
expiration and upon permittee's request. Performance security posted by an
applicant can be used as a maintenance security.
   (f)   Insurance. A permittee, prior to the commencement of work hereunder,
shall obtain general liability coverage in effect from the effective date of
the right-or-way disturbance permit and until the applicable statute of
limitations has run in an amount not less than One Million and no/100 Dollars
($1,000,000.00) ("Coverage Period"). Proof of General Liability Insurance shall
be filed with the Community Development Services Department prior to or with
the application for the permit.
   (g)   Rights-of-Way Restoration.
      (1)   The work to be done under the permit, and the restoration of the
rights-of-way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified
in the permit. If work is performed between November 1 st and March 1 st,
restoration of vegetation may be postponed until favorable weather conditions,
but must commence no later than April 1. In addition to its own work, the
permittee must restore the general area of the work and the surrounding areas,
including trench backfill, paving and its foundations, to as near as is
reasonably possible to the right-of-way's original condition or better and must
inspect the area of the work and use reasonable care to maintain the same
condition for 12 months thereafter, natural wear excepted. All materials and
methods of restoration, unless specifically stated otherwise in applicable City
ordinance(s), policies, or regulations, shall be in accordance with current
Indiana Department of Transportation Standard Specifications. Any waste
generated during performance of work shall be disposed of following all
applicable City ordinances, federal, and state statutes. Under no circumstances
is debris to be left in the right- of- way.
      (2)   If the permittee fails to restore the rights-of-way in the manner
and to the condition required by this section, the permittee, upon notification
from the City Engineer or his/her authorized representative, and within a
reasonable and acceptable time frame, not to exceed 30 days, shall correct all
restoration work to the extent necessary. If the permittee does not perform
restoration work to the required standard or within the time frame, the Board
of Public Works and Safety may authorize the Street Department to perform the
restoration with City resources or hire an independent contractor to perform
such restoration. In that event, the permittee shall pay to the City, within 30
days of billing, the City's cost incurred in restoring the rights-of-way.
      (3)   At all times while the work is in progress, the permittee shall
maintain at the job location a sign, barricade, or other device bearing the
permittee's name in such a manner as to be clearly visible. The permittee shall
maintain traffic control in accordance with the Indiana Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices, latest edition, and all other applicable local, state
and federal laws.
      (4)   The Community Development Services Department or its designee may
inspect the work-site at any time.
      (5)   The Board of Public Works and Safety or its authorized
representative may order stoppage of work for deviations by the permittee from
the permit or permit conditions, or when continuation of work poses a serious
threat to the life, health, safety, or well-being of the public.
      (6)   Steel Plates Requirements. Steel plates may only be utilized to
temporarily cover cuts during emergency repairs or repairs expected to take
more than one week. The use of steel plates must comply with the following
requirements: (1) The Street Department must be notified when a steel plate
will be utilized; (2) Plates should be marked with the owners name or other
identifier readily visible on each plate; (3) Plates must be tacked down on all
4 comers with hot mix asphalt and at least one foot long ramp provided to
reduce the transition from pavement onto the plate; (4) Plates remaining in the
roadway for more than 7 days must be countersunk to allow for a smooth
transition; (5) From December 1 through April 1, countersinking of all plates
is required regardless of the duration of the work.
   (h)   Scope of Permit. The permit is valid only for the area of the right-
of-way specified therein. Except in case of an emergency, no permittee may
perform any work outside the area specified in the permit. Any permittee that
determines that it must excavate in an area other than that specified in the
permit must, before working in that area, apply for a permit extension and pay
any additional fees necessitated thereby. The permit is valid only for the
dates specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the
permit start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the
permit end date. If the permittee is unable to complete the work within the
specified time, he/she shall, prior to the permit’s expiration date, present to
the Community Development Services Department a request for an extension of
time, setting forth therein the reasons for the requested extension.
   (i)   Weather Conditions. Except in case of an emergency, or with the
approval of the Community Development Services Department or its authorized
representative, no work shall be performed when weather conditions make such
work unsafe to any person or if conditions exist that, if such work were
performed, would cause degradation or damage to the rights-of-way that would
not normally occur if such conditions did not exist.
   (j)   Noise, Dust and Debris. Each permittee shall conduct and carry out
right-of-way disturbance work in such manner as to avoid unnecessary
inconvenience and annoyance to the general public and property occupants. The
permittee shall take appropriate measures to reduce to the fullest extent
practicable noise, dust and debris. Except in emergency situations hereunder,
the permittee shall not perform any work during the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 7:00
a.m. unless express written permission by the Board of Public Works and Safety
or its designee has been given.
   (k)   Emergency Situations. In the event of emergency in which a sewer main,
water main, pipe, conduit or utility (collectively “facilities”) in or under
any road breaks, bursts or otherwise is in such condition as to immediately
endanger the property, life, health or safety of individuals, the person or
entity owning or controlling such facility, without first applying for and
obtaining a right-of-way disturbance permit hereunder, shall immediately take
proper emergency measures to cure or remedy such dangerous conditions. However,
such person or entity owning or controlling such facility shall apply for a
right-of-way permit and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring
itself into compliance with this section for the actions it took in response to
the emergency not later than the end of the next business day, and shall not
proceed with permanent repairs without first obtaining the permit hereunder.
Additionally, a person or entity responding to the emergency shall notify an
authorized City representative by calling an emergency line at 1-317-883-8081.
Such person or entity shall leave a voicemail if representative cannot be
reached or the emergency occurred outside of regular business hours. The
voicemail shall include the following information: (1) Caller’s identification
and contact, including callback, information; (2) Nature of the emergency,
including information regarding any necessary street closures or affected
traffic; (3) Exact location of the emergency; (4) Scope of expected repairs;
(5) Contact information for the person or entity owning facilities or equipment
that caused the emergency; (6) Identification and contact information for the
contractor hired to fix the emergency; and (7) Approximate time required to fix
the emergency. In the event that the City becomes aware of the emergency
regarding facilities not owned by the City, the City may attempt to contact the
local representative of each facility affected, or potentially affected, by the
emergency. In any event, the City may take whatever action it deems necessary
in order to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the
owner of the facilities whose equipment occasioned the emergency.
   (l)   Denial of Permit. Except in the case of an emergency or when required
by law, the Community Development Services Department may deny issuing a permit
to any applicant who has failed within the past twelve months to comply or is
presently not in full compliance with the requirements of this chapter; to any
person as to whom there exists grounds for the revocation of a permit under
this chapter; and, if the issuance of a permit for the particular date or time
would cause a conflict or interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival,
or any other scheduled event. In determining whether a conflict or interference
exists, the Community Development Services Department or its designee shall be
guided by the safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the
rights-of-way, and by considerations relating to the public health, safety, and
welfare. The Community Development Services Department or its designee may deny
a permit to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to prevent
interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the
rights-of-way, or when necessary to protect the rights-of-way or its users. The
Community Development Services Department or its designee, in its discretion,
may consider one or more of the following factors: the capacity of the rights-
of-way to accommodate additional facilities; the availability of other
locations in the rights-of-way capable of supporting additional facilities; the
degree of disruption to surrounding communities and businesses that will result
from the proposed use of the rights-of-way; the condition and age of the
rights-of-way; whether and when such rights-of-way are scheduled for total or
partial reconstruction; this section; and other applicable ordinances and
regulations.
   (m)   Work Done Without a Permit. Except in the case of an emergency, any
person or entity who performs right-of-way disturbance work without a permit
must subsequently obtain a permit, pay applicable permit fee, pay an applicable
fine as outlined in the fine schedule below, correct any damage to the right-
of-way as specified in this section, post applicable maintenance bond or
acceptable security, and otherwise comply with all of the requirements of this
section.
      Fine schedule for doing work without a permit per incident:
         First violation:               $100.00
         Second violation:               $500.00
         Third and any subsequent violation:      $1,000.00
   (n)   Revocation of Permits. Permittees hold permits issued pursuant to this
chapter as a privilege and not as a right. The City reserves its right, as
provided herein, to revoke any permit, without refund of the permit fee, in the
event of a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any law or any
condition of the permit. A substantial breach by permittee shall include, but
shall not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   Violation of any material provision of the permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the
permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the city or its citizens;
      (3)   Failure to maintain the required bonds or insurance;
      (4)   Failure to complete the work in a timely manner; or
      (5)   Failure to correct a condition indicated on an order issued
pursuant to this chapter.
      If the Community Development Services Department or its authorized
representative determines that the permittee has committed a substantial breach
of any applicable law or any condition placed on the permit, the Community
Development Services Department or its representative shall make a written
demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. An e-mail or other
electronic communication shall satisfy this requirement. The demand shall state
that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. Further, a
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the Community Development
Services Department or its authorized representative to place additional or
revised conditions on the permit. Within 48 hours of receiving notification of
the breach, the permittee shall contact the Community Development Services
Department or its authorized representative with a plan, acceptable to the
Department, for correction of the breach. The permittee’s failure to submit an
acceptable plan or to reasonably implement the approved plan shall be cause for
immediate revocation of the permit.
      If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall reimburse the City for
reasonable costs, including restoration costs, the costs of collection and
reasonable attorneys’ fees, if authorized by applicable law, incurred in
connection with such revocation.
   (o)   Liability of City. Except due to gross negligence by the City, neither
the City nor any officer or employee thereof shall be held responsible for any
damages caused by any excavations in any rights-of-way made by any person under
the authority of a permit issued pursuant to the provisions of this section.
The permittee shall be solely liable for any damage or loss occasioned by any
act or omission occurring in connection with the excavation, and shall fully
indemnify, hold harmless and defend the City, its officers and employees from
and against any and all suits, actions, judgments, losses, costs, demands,
claims, expenses (including attorney’s fees), damages, and liabilities of every
kind to which the City, its officers or employees may be subjected for injury
of any type, death or property damage arising from or connected with any such
act or omission.
   (p)   Violations and Penalties. In addition to any available legal remedies,
any person or entity violating any provision(s) of this section, for which no
specific penalty is otherwise provided, shall be fined, upon proper
determination, notice, and opportunity to correct, by the City Engineer or his/
her designee in an amount of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00) for each day
such violation is committed or permitted to continue.
   (q)   Appeal of Violation Determinations. All persons and entities found to
be violating the provisions of this section may appeal such determination to
the Board of Public Work and Safety. The Board shall hear all appeals at its
next regularly scheduled meeting. The Board may confirm, reverse or modify such
decision or action. The order of the Board shall be final and appealable to the
court of competent jurisdiction within thirty (30) days from the issuance date.

and the nature of the violation. If the premises owner or person being cited
fails to correct the violation in the time allotted by a Code Enforcement
Official then a citation and order of abatement shall be issued. The issuance
of a warning citation is not required and shall not be a prerequisite to the
issuance of a citation and order for abatement. There shall be no right of
appeal from the issuance of a warning citation.
   Whenever a Code Enforcement Official determines there has been a violation
of this section, a citation and order of abatement shall be given to the owner
or the person or persons responsible. The citation and order of abatement must
be in writing, include the parcel address where the violation occurred, include
a statement of the violation or violations and sections violated and why the
citation is being issued and actions necessary to correct the violation, and
include a notice stating that the violator must pay the fine to the Ordinance
Violations Clerk within seventy-two (72) hours.
   If the violation is deemed to be a threat to public health or safety by the
Code Enforcement Officer, the Code Enforcement Officer or his designee may
order the parking or storage activity to cease and desist immediately,
regardless of whether a warning ticket or citation has been issued.
   The citation and order of abatement shall be in a form approved by the Board
of Public Works and Safety and shall be deemed properly served if a copy is
sent by certified return receipt mail, hand delivered by an employee of the
City, placed in a conspicuous place on the property where the violation
occurred, or by any other method of service acceptable pursuant to Ind. Code §
1-1-7-1.
   The citation shall contain language advising that a person who receives one
may elect to stand trial rather than pay the fine. In order to do so, a person
receiving the citation, must return a copy of the citation within seventy-two
(72) hours to the Ordinance Violations Bureau Clerk advising of his/her intent
to stand trial. The Ordinance Violations Bureau Clerk shall inform Corporation
Council of all such intents received. Upon receipt, monetary fines shall be
stayed pending trial in the City of Greenwood City Court.
      (2)   Remedies. If a person fails to pay the fine within seventy-two (72)
hours and fails to give notice within seventy-two (72) hours of his/her intent
to stand trial, the Office of Corporation Counsel may commence enforcement
activities, up to and including the filing of a civil lawsuit and/or pursue any
other legal remedies at the City's disposal.
      (3)   Fines and Penalties. Each day a violation remains uncorrected is a
distinct and separate violation subject to an additional citation and fine in
the amount prescribed below.
   The monetary fine for each violation shall be Fifty Dollars ($50.00), except
that for repeated violations, the following fines shall apply:
 
Second Citation:                $ 75.00
Each Citation in Excess of Two: $100.00
 
   A person adjudged to have committed a violation of this Section is liable
for the court costs and fees. No costs shall be assessed against the
enforcement agency in any such action.
   (l)   Waivers
      (1)   Property owners may appeal to the Board of Public Works and Safety
for a waiver from the requirements of this Section. The Board of Public Works
and Safety shall adopt a written resolution outlining the procedure and process
it will use in evaluating and granting such waivers. Any waiver application
must state with particularity the subsections for which the applicant is
requesting a waiver. Any waiver granted by the Board of Public Works and Safety
must be in writing and a copy kept on file with the City Clerk. Such a waiver
shall terminate upon transfer of ownership of the property and/or a material
change in the condition of the property.
      (2)   In determining whether to grant a waiver, the Board of Public Works
and Safety may consider the following factors: 1) unique physical
characteristics of the property; 2) the lot size and spacing between homes in
the neighborhood; 3) the impact upon surrounding property values; 4) the
duration of the arrangement; 5) whether the arrangement existed prior to the
passage of the ordinance; 6) public safety and visibility concerns; 7) the
condition/appearance of the boat, trailer, RV, or commercial vehicle; and 8)
the surface upon which the parking is occurring. These factors should be
cumulatively considered and weighed and should not be viewed as an exhaustive
list.

discharge shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user's own cost and
expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide
this protection shall be available to the City or Indianapolis for review. All
existing industrial users shall complete such a plan within six (6) months
after the effective date of this Chapter. No industrial user who commences
contribution to the POTW after the effective date of this Chapter shall be
permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge
procedures are available. Such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve
the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the industrial user's
facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this Chapter.
   a.   In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the
industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the Director of Sanitation
Department - Field Operations, of the incident. In the case of a significant
accidental discharge, it is the further responsibility of the industrial user
to immediately telephone and notify the Industrial Waste/Emergency Response
Section of the Department of Public Works of Indianapolis. A significant
accidental discharge is a discharge as defined in Section
9-10 (c), (d), or (e) or a discharge in violation of its permit. The
notification shall include:
      1.   Name of company;
      2.   Location of discharge;
      3.   Type of waste discharge;
      4.   Concentration and volume of waste discharged;
      5.   Corrective actions taken to minimize the impact of the discharge to
the POTW.
   b.   The industrial user shall notify the City if it is unable to comply
with any requirement of this Chapter because of a breakdown of its treatment
equipment, accidents caused by human error, or upsets. The notification should
include the information required in subsection (a) above.
   c.   Within five (5) days, unless extended by the Director of Sanitation
Department - Field Operations or the Board of Public Works and Safety in
writing, the industrial user shall submit to the Director a detailed written
report describing the accidental discharge including:
      1.   The cause of the accidental discharge;
      2.   The period of the accidental discharge, including exact dates and
times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected
to continue;
      3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate or prevent
recurrence of the accidental discharge.
   d.   Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such
notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability
which may be imposed by this Chapter or other applicable law.
   e.   In any enforcement proceeding the industrial user seeking to establish
the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. An industrial user
who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate,
through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant
evidence that:
      1.   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the specific
cause(s) of the upset;
      2.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
      3.   The industrial user has submitted to the City the information
required in subsections (b) and (c) above.
   An upset defense is only available for violations of categorical
pretreatment standards.
   f.   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising affected employees whom to call in the event of
a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause
or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency
notification procedure. (Ord. No. 92-6, § 17-14, 3-2-92)
Sec. 9-17 Liability for Damage.
   If any person discharges or causes to be discharged a waste which causes
interference, obstruction, damage or any other impairment to the POTW, the
Board may assess a charge against said person for:
   a.   The work required to clean or repair the wastewater works; and
   b.   Any fine imposed against the City as a result of such interference,
obstruction, damage or impairment;
and add such charges to said person's regular charge. (Ord. No. 92-6, § 17-15,
3-2-92)
Sec. 9-18 Special Agreements.
   Special agreements and arrangements between the Board and any person may be
established, when in the opinion of the Board, unusual or extraordinary
circumstances compel special terms and conditions. The Board shall consider the
total cost of application of technology in relation to the pollutant reduction
benefits to be achieved from such application, the quality of pollutants that
will be included in the discharge, the impact of those pollutants on the POTW
and the receiving stream and such other factors as the Board deems appropriate.
There cannot be special agreements and arrangements where Federal Categorical
Pretreatment Standards and requirements apply. (Ord. No. 92-6, § 17-16, 3-2-
92).
Sec. 9-19 Monitoring Devices; Metering Equipment.
   a.   Installation and Maintenance at User's Expense. The Director may
require, as is necessary to carry out the requirements of this Chapter, any
person to construct at his/her own expense, monitoring facilities to allow
inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building drain or sewer and
may also require sampling or metering equipment to be provided, installed and
operated at the user's expense. The monitoring facility should normally be
situated on the user's premises, but the Director may, when such a location
would be impractical or cause undue hardship, upon his/her approval allow the
facility to be constructed in the public right-of-way; provided, however, the
Greenwood Street Department shall be the authority, through its director and
the City Engineer, to determine the locations on the public right-of-way, on or
below which the monitoring device and facility shall be placed.
   b.   Temporary Right-of-Way Permit. The owner of the property abutting the
public right-of-way to be used for the installation of the monitoring device
shall submit to the Board of Public Works and Safety a temporary right-of-way
use permit request and the site plan. The staff of the Board of Public Works
and Safety shall review the temporary right-of-way use request and site plan
prior to issuing the permit.
   c.   Industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall
have the option to designate a sampling location at a point containing only
regulated process wastewaters or at a point containing the combined wastestream
to demonstrate compliance with the applicable standard. The industrial user
shall prove to the satisfaction of the Director that the selected self-
monitoring location contains all regulated wastestreams. This option does not
relieve the industrial user of the requirements specified in Section
9-19 (a).
   d.   An industrial user shall obtain written approval of the Director prior
to changing the point of self-monitoring activities. (Ord. No. 92-6, §17-17, 3-
2-92)
Sec. 9-20 Right to Inspect.
   Whenever required to carry out the objectives of this Greenwood Municipal

authorized officer or employee of the City of Indianapolis Department of Public
Works, upon presentation of his/her credentials, shall have a right of entry
to, upon, or through any premises for purpose of reviewing relevant records or
inspecting, measuring, and sampling of the discharges. This right of entry
shall include, but not be limited to, any equipment necessary to conduct said
inspections, measuring, and sampling. It shall be the duty of the person whose
premises are the subject of inspection to provide all necessary clearance
before entry and not to unnecessarily delay or hinder the Director in carrying
out the review of relevant records, inspection, measuring, and sampling. The
right of entry shall exist at any time. (Ord. No. 92-6, § 17-18, 3-2-92; Ord.

the Director, during the months of June and December unless required more
frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the Director, a report indicating
the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by
such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of
all daily flows which, during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily
flow reported in Section
9-83. At the discretion of the Director and in consideration of such factors as
local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Director may
agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted.
   b.   Reports of permittees shall contain the results of sampling and
analyses of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration,
or production and mass, where requested by the Director, of pollutants
contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards.
The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment
standard. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with 40 CFR, part 136
and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the
Director. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques

Sec. 9-97 Billing Estimates and Reports.
   a.   In the event a nonindustrial user subject to such rates and charges is
not served by a public water supply or water used is not completely metered,
the Director shall have the authority to estimate the volume and strength of
the waste and use such estimate for the purposes of billing rates and charges
described above. The estimates shall be based upon analyses and volumes of a
similar installation or the volume and analysis as determined by measurements
and samples taken by the Director or an estimate determined by the Director or
by any combination of the foregoing or other equitable method.
   b.   Unless otherwise established by the Director, each industrial user
subject to the rates and charges described above shall report to the Director
by the tenth day of the following month on a form prescribed by the Director an
estimate of the volume discharged in the prior month and a representative value
of the strength of the waste, including but not limited to BOD, SS and
(ammonia) nitrogen. All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics
of such waste shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of
"Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewage" as published jointly
by the American Public Health Association and the Water Pollution Control
Federation consistent with 40 CFR part 136 or by other methods generally
accepted under established sanitary engineering practices and approved by the
Director. The reports submitted shall be subject to verification by the
Director but may serve as the basis for billing with all necessary adjustments
in the amounts to be made after verification. In the event an analysis and
volume of the industrial waste is not furnished to the Director by the
aforementioned time, the charges shall be based upon estimates made by the
Director, as provided in subsection (a) above.
   c.   In the event that an industrial user fails to submit the report
required by Section
9-97 (b) by the tenth (10) day of the following month, the industrial user
shall pay late reporting charges according to the following schedule:
 
Late Reports Filed in any Year Charge
First Late Report              No Charge
Second Late Report             No Charge
Each Subsequent Late Report    $100.00
 
   These late reporting charges shall be due and payable as provided in this
Chapter. The imposition of such late reporting charges shall in no way limit
the operation of penalties provided elsewhere in this Chapter.
   d.   The Director shall have the right to enter upon the land of the
industrial user and to set up such equipment as is necessary to certify the
reports submitted. It shall be the duty of the industrial user to provide all
necessary clearance before entry and not to unnecessarily delay or hinder the
Director in carrying out the measuring and sampling. The right of entry shall
exist during any time the industrial user is operating or open for business.
   e.   In cases where measurements are difficult to make, or the industrial
waste composition changes frequently, or representative samples are difficult
to collect, or where other methods of measurement are necessitated for other
sound engineering reasons as determined by the Director, the Director shall
have the authority to use such other basis for determining said charges as
shall be reliably indicative of volume and BOD, SS and nitrogen strengths of
particular industrial waste, such as, but not limited to, water purchase or
usage, character of products, and comparisons between the industrial user data
and collected data from like industries. (Ord. No. 10-26, §17, 10-4-10)
   f.   The cost of all tests, measurements and analyses taken by the Director
pursuant to the Department of Sanitation's responsibility to perform industrial
monitoring programs, defined and directed by local, state and federal agencies,
shall be charged to the industrial user tested, in an amount equal to the
actual cost of said tests, measurements or analyses. These costs shall be due
and payable as provided in this Chapter as determined at the close of each
calendar year. (Ord. No. 92-6, § 17-88, 3-2-92)

provision only applies to utility bills appearing on the same bill.
   c.   Collection. The Board of Public Works and Safety is authorized to
determine the methods and procedures to administer and collect the fees

Sec. 9-121 Meters, Weirs, Volumetric Measuring Devices Acceptable to the City.
   a.   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building, other than a
domestic user, that discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or
other liquids into the City's sanitary sewage system, either directly or
indirectly, is not a user of water supplied by a private, public or municipal
water utility, and the water used thereon or therein is not measured by a water
meter, or is measured by a water meter not acceptable to the City, then the
owner or other interested party, at his expense, shall install and maintain
meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devises or other adequate and approved
method of measurement acceptable to the City.
   b.   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building, other than a
domestic user, that discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or
other liquids into the City's sanitary sewage system, either directly or
indirectly, is a user of water supplied by a private, public or municipal water
utility and, in addition, uses water from another source which is not measured
by a water meter or is measured by a meter not acceptable to the City, then the
owner or other interested party, at his expense, shall install and maintain
meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devises or other adequate and approved
method of measurement acceptable to the City.
   c.   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the City's
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess
of twenty thousand (20,000) gallons per month, and it can be shown to the
satisfaction of the City that a portion of water as measured by the water meter
or meters does not and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner
or other interested party shall install and maintain meter, weirs, volumetric
measuring devices or other adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the City for determination of sewage discharge. (Ord. No. 90-24,
§ 4, 6-4-90; Ord. No. 97-45, §1, 12-15-97)
Sec. 9-122 Strength and Character of Sewage and Wastes.
   In order that the rates and charges computed hereunder may be justly and
equitably adjusted to the service rendered, the City shall base its charge not
only on the volume, but also on the strength and character of the sewage and
wastes which it is required to treat and dispose. The City may require the
owner or other user to determine the strength and content of all sewage and
wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly, into the sanitary sewage
system, in such manner and by such method as the City may deem practicable in
the light of the conditions and attending circumstances of the case, in order
to determine the proper charge. Upon request by the City, the owner or other
user shall furnish a central sampling point available to the City at all times.
   Extra charges based on the strength of the sewage and liquid wastes shall be
made on the following basis:
   Rate Surcharge Based Upon Suspended Solids. There shall be an additional
charge of $.0970 per pound of suspended solids for suspended solids in an
excess of three hundred (300) milligrams per liter of fluid; and
   Rate Surcharge Based Upon BOD. There shall be an additional charge of $.0859
per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for BOD received in excess of two
hundred fifty (250) milligrams per liter of fluid; and
   Rate Surcharge Based Upon NH3-N. There shall be an additional charge of
$.4474 per pound of ammonia for NH3-N received in excess of twenty (20)
milligrams per liter of fluid.
   To determine the strength of the sewage and wastes, samplings and analysis
shall be made from time to time whenever it is deemed desirable by the City of
Greenwood. After charges have been established based upon the strength of
sewage and wastes, an owner may request reconsideration of the charges by the
City by submitting analysis of composite samples of the sewage and wastes
subject to such charges, certified by a Registered Engineer or a qualified
graduate chemist. The City may then adjust the charges to the Ordinance rates
required by such analysis or may recheck the findings by additional samplings
and analysis. Requests for rate adjustments by the owner may be submitted no
more often than once every twelve (12) months.
   The determination of suspended solids, five-day biochemical oxygen demand
and NH3-N contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the latest
editions of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage and
Industrial Wastes," or similar publications as published by the American Public
Health Association, the American Water Works Association or the Water Pollution
Control Federation. (Ord. No. 90-51, § 1, 10-15-90)
Sec. 9-123 Billings.
   For accounts opened on or prior to July 31, 2016, rates and charges may
continue to be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying the properties served
by the Sanitary Sewer Utility unless otherwise requested in writing by the
owners, but such billings shall in no way relieve the owner from liability in
the event payment is not made as herein required. For all accounts opened on or
after August 1, 2016, rates and charges must be billed to the property owner;
no new accounts will be opened in the names of tenants. (Ord. No. 90-24, § 6,

   In lieu of the above tap-on fees there shall be an optional tap-on fee
available for selection by owners of real estate desiring a sewer connection
for buildings consisting of multi-family dwelling units located on a single
parcel of real estate under one (1) ownership but in which each dwelling unit
will have an individual five-eighths (5/8) inch or three-fourths (3/4) inch or
less water meter as follows:
   The Board of Public Works and Safety, or its designee, shall determine the
diameter size(s) of the water line or lines feeding the owner's multi-family
dwelling unit buildings and the user shall pay the tap-on fee set forth above
based upon the size of the master water meter that would have been required to
provide a single source water supply to the single parcel of real estate under
one ownership but for the individual metering of each dwelling unit. If the
owner elects to pay the tap-on fee under this provision, the owner shall enter
into an agreement with the Board of Public Works and Safety to promptly pay the
sewer bill of any tenant within a dwelling unit that is more than one month
delinquent. The Board of Public Works and Safety is hereby authorized to make
rules and regulations for the implementation, processing, and collection of
this optional tap-on fee, which includes but is not limited to, establishing
procedures and approving forms and agreements for the election of this optional
tap-on fee. (Ord. No. 96-46, § 1, 12-16-96; Ord. No. 10-26, §1E, 10-4-10)
   A commercial or industrial customer shall also be required to pay such
reasonable extra costs as shall be determined by the Greenwood Board of Public
Works and Safety to be needed to effect the connection at the time of tap-on
   Every four (4) years, beginning with 1994, the Board of Public Works and
Safety shall cause a study of the connection fees to be made for the purpose of
reviewing the fairness and equity of those fees and to determine if any changes
may be appropriate. Any such study shall be conducted by officers or employees
of the City of Greenwood, by a firm of certified public accountants, or a firm
of consulting engineers, which firms shall have experience in such studies. A
report of such study shall be forwarded to the Greenwood Common Council. (Ord.

and equity of the rates and charges for sewage services on a continuing basis
and an analysis made of treatment costs charged by Indianapolis to the City of
Greenwood to determine any material changes which should be passed to the
City's users in a fair and equitable manner. Any such study shall be conducted
by officers or employees of the City of Greenwood, by a firm of certified
public accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers, which firms shall have
experience in such studies. A report of such studies shall be forwarded to the
Greenwood Common Council by December 31st of each year. (Ord. No. 90-24, § 10,

Division I.
General Provisions.
Sec. 9-150 Purpose, Objective and Applicability.
   a.   The functions of the Department of Stormwater Management are to
facilitate the safe and efficient capture and Conveyance of Stormwater run-off;
mitigate the damaging effects of Stormwater run-off, correct Stormwater
collection and Conveyance problems; and fund the activities of Stormwater
management including design, planning, regulation, education, coordination,
construction, operation, maintenance, inspection and enforcement activities,
all for the protection of the public health, welfare, and safety. It is the
further function of the Department of Stormwater Management to insure the
City’s compliance with its NPDES Stormwater Discharge permit(s); to encourage
Environmentally responsible Stormwater management in both the private and
public sectors.
   b.   The City has determined it is necessary, for the protection of public
health, safety, and welfare and to comply with federal, state, and local laws
and regulations, that a system of charges for Stormwater service in the City be
established that allocates the cost of providing Stormwater service to each
user in a manner proportionate to the cost of providing Stormwater service to
that user, insofar as those costs can be reasonably determined.
   c.   The City has further determined it is necessary, for the protection of
public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City to regulate
Stormwater and non-Stormwater Discharges to the storm Drainage system and to
protect, conserve and promote the orderly Development of land and Water
Resources within the City and its extra-territorial planning jurisdiction. The
objectives of this Article are:
      1.   To reduce the hazard to public health and safety caused by excessive
Stormwater Runoff.
      2.   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm Drain system
from construction Site Runoff.
      3.   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm Drain system
from Runoff from land disturbing activities including new Development and
Redevelopment.
      4.   To prohibit Illicit Discharges into the storm Drain system.
      5.   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection,
monitoring, and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this
Article.
   d.   In addition to the requirements of this Article, compliance with all
applicable ordinances and resolutions of the City as well as with applicable
federal, State of Indiana, and other local statutes and regulations shall also
be required. Unless otherwise stated, all other specifications referred to in
this Article shall be the most recent edition available. If the Project Site is
located within a Johnson County Regulated Drain Watershed, the applicant must
comply with all requirements of the Johnson County Surveyor’s Office prior to
issuance of any permit required under this Article.
   e.   Any construction project which has had its final Drainage plan filed
with the Plan Commission within a two (2) year period prior to August 15, 2015
shall be exempt from all requirements of this Article that are in excess of the
requirements of the Municipal Code provisions and ordinances in effect at the
time of filing. As such, the Drainage plan may be implemented as approved. If,
however, the project is expanded or otherwise altered, this Article shall
apply.
   f.   The degree of protection required by this Article is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on historical records,
engineering, and scientific methods of study. Larger storms may occur or
Stormwater Runoff amounts may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
Article does not imply that land uses permitted will be free from Stormwater
damage. This Article shall not create liability on the part of the City, its
applicable boards and commissions, or any officer, representative, or employee
thereof, for any damage that may result from reliance on this Article or on any
administrative decision lawfully made there under.
   g.   The construction cost of the Stormwater Control Systems and facilities
as required by this Article shall be accepted as part of the cost of land
Development and the Developer shall be responsible for all costs.
   h.   Maintenance of Stormwater Facilities during construction and thereafter
shall be the responsibility of the Developer and/or Property Owner. Assignment
of responsibility for maintenance of Drainage facilities serving more than one
lot shall be part of appropriate covenants to property deeds or otherwise
properly assigned and recorded in the chain of title for the property(ies) on
which the facilities are located. The City shall not be responsible for
maintenance of Drainage facilities unless the City formally agrees in writing
to accept responsibility for maintenance. Approval of plats shall not
constitute acceptance of responsibility for maintenance by the City under this
Section.
   i.   This Ordinance is adopted in accordance with statutory authority
granted under code authorizing jurisdiction over storm systems, and further is
required by Phase II of the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
program (FR Doc. 99-29181) authorized by the 1972 amendments to the Clean Water
Act (33 U.S.C. §§1251-1387) and the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management’s Construction Stormwater General Permit (CSGP) and Municipal
Separate Storm Sewer System General Permit (MS4GP).
   j.   Nothing contained in this Article shall prevent the City of Greenwood
from taking such other lawful action as may be necessary to prevent or remedy
any violation of this Article. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to
the person or persons responsible. (Ord. No. 15-33, § 1, 7-20-15; Ord. No. 24-

purposes of monitoring, inspection, and general maintenance activities,
adequate easement width, as detailed in the Stormwater Technical Manual, beyond
the actual footprint of the stormwater quality management facility as well as a
20-foot wide access easement from a public right-of-way to each BMP shall be
provided. Such easements must be recorded in the chain of title for the
property on which the project is located within thirty (30) days of acceptance
by the Board of Public Works and Safety. Approved post-construction stormwater
quality measures may be inspected by the Department of Stormwater Management
staff regardless of the presence of an easement. Acceptance of the easement by
the City under this Section does not confer liability or responsibility upon
the City for maintenance or upkeep of the drainage facilities.
   b.   Prohibited Items in Drainage Easements.

      1.   Basins shall be constructed to temporarily detain the stormwater
runoff that exceeds the maximum peak release rate authorized by the stormwater
technical manual.
      2.   The required volume of storage provided in detention basins,
together with such storage as may be authorized in other on-site facilities,
shall be sufficient to control excess runoff from the 10-year or 100-year storm
as set forth in the Stormwater Technical Manual. The post-development run-off
discharge from the project site must not exceed the pre-development discharge
based on the 2-year, 10-year, and 100-year peak storm events.
      3.   No residential lots or any part thereof, including swales, shall be
used for any part of a detention basin assumed full to the 100-year water
surface elevation or the emergency overflow weir elevation, whichever is
higher.
      4.   Detention facilities shall not be allowed within the 100-year
floodplain.
      5.   The increased stormwater runoff resulting from a proposed
development shall be detained on-site by the provisions of appropriate above-
or below-ground wet bottom or dry bottom detention facilities, parking lots, or
other acceptable techniques as set forth in the Stormwater Technical Manual
and/or as approved by the Board of Public Works and Safety. Measures that
retard the rate of overland flow and the velocity in runoff channels shall also
be used to partially control runoff rates.
   d.   Calculations; Design Standards and Specifications.
      1.   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement
of all stormwater facilities shall meet the design criteria, standards, and
specifications outlined in the most current version of the Stormwater Technical
Manual.
      2.   Design Storm Frequencies.
         A.   All storm sewers, inlets, catch basins, street gutters, and
swales shall accommodate, as a minimum, peak runoff from a 24-hour, 10-year
return frequency storm, subject to the “allowable spread” provisions of the
Stormwater Technical Manual, within the banks. Ditches shall accommodate the
100-year runoff within the banks or a designated easement.
         B.   Culvert Capacities.
            i.   Culverts under roadways designated as thoroughfares,
arterials, or that provide the only means of ingress and egress to developments
shall accommodate the 100-year flow to the culvert without overtopping the
roadway.
            ii.   Culverts under collector roadways (those roadways connected
to designated thoroughfares and arterials) shall accommodate the 50-year flow
to the culvert without overtopping the roadway.
            iii.   All other roadway culverts shall accommodate the 25-year
flow to the culvert without overtopping the roadway.
            iv.   Driveway culvert capacities shall be required to equal the
capacities required for the street classification to which the driveway
connects.
         C.   For portions of the system considered minor drainage systems, the
allowable spread of water on collector streets is limited to maintaining two
clear 10-foot moving lanes of traffic. One lane is to be maintained on local
roads, while other access lanes (such as a subdivision cul-de-sac) can have
water spread equal to one-half of their total width.
         D.   To ensure access to buildings and allow the use of the roadway by
emergency vehicles during storms larger than the design storm, an overflow
channel/swale between sag inlets and overflow paths or basin shall be provided
at sag Inlets so that the maximum depth of water that might be ponded in the
street sag shall not exceed seven (7) inches measured from elevation of the
gutter. All water shall be contained in the right-of-way for a 100-year storm.
         E.   Design storm frequencies for individual developments shall
conform to all requirements set forth in the Stormwater Technical Manual. The
Stormwater Department and/or the Department of Community Development Services
may, in their discretion, require more restrictive design storm frequencies for
individual developments.
      3.   Minimum Size for Storm Sewers. The minimum diameter of all storm
sewers shall be twelve (12) inches. When the minimum will not limit the rate of
release to the required amount, the rate of release for Detention storage shall
be controlled by an orifice plate or other device, subject to acceptance by the
City.
      4.   Pipe Cover, Grade, and Separation from Sanitary Sewers.
         i.   Pipe grade shall be such that, in general, a minimum of two (2)
feet of cover is maintained over the top of the pipe. Uniform slopes shall be
maintained between inlets, manholes, and inlets to manholes. Final grade shall
be set forth with full consideration of the capacity required, sedimentation
problems, and other design parameters, and shall conform to all applicable
requirements set forth in the Stormwater Technical Manual.
         ii.   A minimum of two (2) feet of Vertical separation between storm
sewers and sanitary sewers is required. When this is not possible, the sanitary
sewer must be encased in concrete or ductile steel within five (5) feet, each
side, of the crossing centerline.
      5.   Overflow Design.
         i.   All buildings shall have a minimum flood protection grade shown
on the secondary plat.
         ii.   Overflow path/ponding areas throughout the development resulting
from a 100-year storm event, calculated based on all contributing drainage
area, on-site and off-site, in its proposed or reasonably anticipated land use
and with storm pipe system assumed completely plugged, shall be determined in
accordance with the standards set forth in the Stormwater Technical Manual.
   e.   Compensatory Storage.  In an attempt to strike a balance between the
legitimate need for economic development within the stormwater district and the
need to preserve the natural functions of floodplains to the extent possible,
compensatory excavation equivalent to the floodplain storage lost shall be
required for all activities within the floodplain of streams located in the
stormwater district where drainage area of the stream is equal to or larger
than one (1) square mile. Compensatory storage is required when a portion of
the floodplain is filled, occupied by a structure, or when as a result of a
development/redevelopment a change in the channel hydraulics occurs that
reduces the existing available floodplain storage. Compensatory storage is
required for all activities in the regulatory floodplain. There is no threshold
to compensatory storage. Any volume of fill requires compensatory storage be
provided. Compensatory storage must be located on-site and adjacent to or
opposite area filled or occupied by a structure. Compensatory storage must be
designed and constructed as outlined in the Stormwater Technical Manual.
   f.   Storm Sewers. For new development and redevelopment projects, all
stormwater conveyances within or parallel to and adjacent to the public right-
of-way that are not designed as an approved stormwater BMP or component of a
low impact development plan shall be fully contained in storm sewers with an
adequate and approved outlet. Residential subdivisions containing lots of less
than 15,000 square feet and non-residential subdivisions shall be constructed
with storm sewers to convey all on-site drainage. However, on-site drainage
swales with required conveyance capacity of less than five (5) cubic feet per
second under the ten (10) year post-development design storm may be allowed in
the discretion of the Board of Public Works and Safety.
   g.   Inspection, Maintenance, Record Keeping and Reporting. After the
approval of the stormwater management permit and/or erosion and sediment
control permit and the commencement of construction activities, the Stormwater
Department and/or Department of Community Development Services have the
authority to conduct inspections of the work being done to insure full
compliance with the provisions of this Article, the Stormwater Technical
Manual, and the terms and conditions of the approved stormwater management
permit and/or erosion and sediment control permit. The City shall have the
right to charge a reasonable fee for inspections.
   h.   Post-Construction Inspection. The Stormwater Department and/or
Department of Community Development Services also have the authority to perform
long-term, post-construction inspection of all stormwater quantity facilities.
Stormwater quantity facilities shall be maintained in good condition, in
accordance with the designed and approved performance specifications for the
facilities, in addition to any prescribed operation & maintenance procedures,
and shall not be subsequently altered, revised or replaced except as approved
by the Board of Public Works and Safety. If deficiencies are found during the
inspection, the owner of the facility will be notified by the Stormwater
Department or Department of Community Development Services and will be required
to take all necessary measures to correct such deficiencies. If the owner fails
to correct the deficiencies within the allowed time period, as specified in the
notification letter, the Board of Public Works and Safety may undertake the
work and shall take steps to collect the costs of the work from the owner using
lien rights if necessary. The City shall have the right to charge a reasonable
fee for inspections.
   i.   Assignments. Assignment of responsibility for maintaining facilities
serving more than one lot or holding shall be documented by written instrument
properly recorded in the chain of title via covenants to property deeds or
other accepted appropriate legal instrument before the final stormwater
management permit is approved. (Ord. No. 15-33, § 1, 7-20-15; Ord. No. 24- 44,
§ 1, 12-16-24)

and specifications. Projects located within the district that include clearing,
grading, excavation or other land disturbing activities resulting in the
disturbance of land are subject to this Section as outlined in subsections (c)-
(e) below. This includes both new development and redevelopment. This Section
also applies to disturbances of land that are part of a larger common plan of
development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb 10,000
square feet or more of total land area. The Stormwater Technical Manual
addresses calculation of land disturbance.
   b.   Exemptions. The requirements under this Section do not apply to the
following activities:
      1.   Agricultural land disturbing activities including tillage, planting,

approved for the larger project site. The stormwater management permit
application for the larger project site must include detailed erosion and
sediment control measures for individual lots in accordance with the Stormwater
Technical Manual. In addition, these individual lots are required to submit an
application for erosion and sediment control permit prior to receiving a
building permit under Greenwood Building Code, found at Greenwood Municipal
Code Section
7-1 et seq.
   f.    The City of Greenwood has determined that projects on individual lots,
not within a larger permitted project, disturbing less than 10,000 square feet
of total land area have the potential to generate polluted stormwater runoff.
The land disturbing activities included in Section
9-161 (d)(3) require a formal review and issuance of an erosion and sediment
control permit by the Stormwater Department. A formal review will be required
before a building permit can be issued under Greenwood Building Code Section
7-1 et seq.
   g.   Responsibility for Adherence. It will be the responsibility of the
project site owner to complete a stormwater management permit and/or erosion
and sediment control permit application and ensure that a sufficient
construction plan is completed and submitted to the Board of Stormwater
Management in accordance with Section
9-161 of this Article. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner
to ensure compliance with this Article during the construction activity and
implementation of the construction plan, and to notify the Stormwater
Department with a sufficient notice of termination letter and request for a
notice of termination inspection upon completion of the project and
stabilization of the site. However, all persons engaging in construction
activities and land disturbing activities on a permitted project site meeting
the applicability requirements must comply with the requirements of this
Section and this Article.
   h.   Calculations and Design Standards and Specifications. Calculation of
land disturbance must comply with the requirements set forth in the Stormwater
Technical Manual. The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and
placement of all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction
sites shall  meet the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined
in the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual and the Stormwater Technical Manual.
   i.   Inspections. Following approval of the stormwater management permit or

activities, the Stormwater Department and/or Department of Community
Development Services have the authority to conduct inspections of the site to
ensure full compliance with the provisions of this section, the approved SWPPP,
the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual, the Stormwater Technical Manual, and the
terms and conditions of the approved permit. The Stormwater Department and/or
Department of Community Development Services shall have the authority to charge
a reasonable fee for inspections as set forth in Sections
9-161(l) and (m).
   j.   Self-Monitoring, Record Keeping, and Reporting. A self-monitoring
program must be implemented by the project site owner to ensure the SWPPP is
working effectively. A trained individual, acceptable to the Stormwater
Department and/or the Department of Community Development Services, shall
perform a written evaluation of the project site by the end of the next
business day following each measurable storm event. If there are no measurable
storm events within a given week, the site should be monitored at least once in
a week. Weekly inspections by the trained individual shall continue until the
entire site has been stabilized and a notice of termination has been issued.
The SWPPP shall serve as a baseline for stormwater quality, but should not be
interpreted to be the only basis for implementation of stormwater quality
measures for a project site. The project site owner is responsible for
implementing, in accordance with this section, all measures necessary to
adequately prevent polluted stormwater runoff. Recommendations by the trained
individual for modified stormwater quality measures must be implemented.
Although self-monitoring reports do not need to be submitted to the Stormwater
Department or Department of Community Development Services, the Stormwater
Department and/or Department of Community Development Services have the right
to request complete records of maintenance and monitoring activities involving
stormwater pollution prevention measures. All evaluation reports for the
project site must be made available to the Department of Stormwater Management
or Department of Community Development Services, in an organized fashion,
within forty-eight (48) hours upon request. (Ord. No. 15-33, § 1, 7-20-15; Ord.

   a.   Applicability. In addition to the requirements of Section
9-157, the SWPPP, which is required to be submitted to the Stormwater
Department as part of the stormwater management permit application, must also
include post-construction stormwater quality measures. These measures shall be
incorporated as a permanent feature of the site plan and left in place
following completion of construction activities to continuously treat
stormwater runoff from the stabilized site. Any project located within the
boundaries of the stormwater district that includes clearing, grading,
excavation, and/or other land disturbing activities, resulting in the
disturbance of 10,000 square feet or more of total land area is subject to the
requirements of this Section. This includes both new development and
redevelopment. Disturbances of land less than 10,000 square feet of total land
area that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger
common plan will ultimately disturb 10,000 square feet or more of total land
area are also subject to the requirements of this Section. In addition,
regardless of the amount of disturbance, the Stormwater Department reserves the
right to require pre-treatment BMPs for proposed hot spot developments in
accordance with the provisions contained in the Stormwater Technical Manual.
Calculation of land disturbance shall follow the guidelines referenced in
Sections
9-156(d) and
9-157(g) and the Stormwater Technical Manual.

      4.   Nuisance. Any activity, construction, and/or property condition
which constitutes an illicit connection, illicit dumping, and/or an illicit
discharge under this Section shall be unlawful and declared a public nuisance
subject to the provisions of Greenwood Municipal Code Chapter 6, Article 6.
      5.   Illicit Connection, Dumping, and Discharge Violations. Any person
found to be in violation of this Section shall be subject to the fine set for
in Section
9-163(e) of this Article for each violation, and further shall be responsible
for the cost of cleanup or correction of the prohibited action. If the
responsible person has not taken corrective action within ten (10) calendar
days after notification of a violation, then the City or its designee may take
whatever action is necessary to cleanup or correct the prohibited act, with the
cost to be taken as a lien against the property from which the violation
originated to the extent allowed under applicable law.
   e.   Private Property Maintenance Duties. Every person owning property
through which a watercourse passes, and/or such person’s lessee, shall keep and
maintain that part of the watercourse located within the property boundaries
free of garbage, solid waste, trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other
obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of
water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner and/or lessee shall
maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a
watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use,
function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
   f.   Spill Reporting. Any discharger who accidentally discharges into a
waterbody any substance other than stormwater or an exempted discharge shall
immediately inform the Stormwater Department concerning the discharge. A
written report concerning the discharge shall be filed with the Stormwater
Department and IDEM by the dischargers within five (5) days. The written report
shall specify:
      1.   The composition of the discharge and the cause thereof;
      2.   The date, time, and estimated volume of the discharge;
      3.   All measures taken to clean up the accidental discharge, and all
measures proposed to be taken to prevent any recurrence; and
      4.   The name and telephone number of the person making the report, and
the name and telephone number of a person who may be contacted for additional
information on the matter.
   A properly reported accidental discharge shall be an affirmative defense to
a civil infraction proceeding brought under this Article against a discharger
for such discharge. It shall not, however, be a defense to a legal action
brought to obtain an injunction, to obtain recovery of costs or to obtain other
relief because of or arising out of the discharge. A discharge shall be
considered properly reported only if the discharger complies with all the
requirements of this Section. This requirement does not relieve discharger from
notifying other entities as required by state or federal regulations.
   g.   Inspections and Monitoring.
      1.   The Stormwater Department and Department of Community Development
Services have the authority to periodically inspect the storm drainage system
within the stormwater district, in an effort to detect and eliminate illicit
connections and discharges into the system. If, as a result of the storm
drainage system inspection, a discharger is suspected of an illicit discharge,
the Stormwater Department or Department of Community Development Services may
inspect and/or obtain water and/or soil samples from stormwater runoff
facilities of the subject discharger, to determine compliance with the
requirements of this Article. Upon request, the discharger shall allow the
Stormwater Department’s or Department of Community Development Services’
properly identified representative to enter upon the premises of the discharger
at all hours necessary for the purposes of such inspection or sampling. The
Stormwater Department or Department of Community Development Services or their
properly identified representative may place on the discharger’s property the
equipment or devices used for such sampling or inspection. Identified illicit
connections or discharges shall be subject to enforcement action as described
in Section
9-163 of this Article.
      2.   New Development Inspections. Following the final completion of
construction and the receipt of as-built drawings by the Department of

activities that disturb topsoil and vegetation that have the potential to
generate polluted stormwater runoff. Activities of this nature must receive
prior approval from the City, including any permits required under Section
9-161 of this Article, and must be performed in accordance with erosion and
sediment control practices approved by the City, as set forth in the Stormwater
Technical Manual, and the State of Indiana.
      2.   It shall be the property owners’ responsibility to maintain the
natural features on their lots and to take preventive measures against any and
all erosion and/or deterioration of natural or manmade features on their lots.
      3.   All persons who cause, in whole or in part, alteration of the land
shall provide erosion and sediment control so as to adequately prevent soils
from being eroded and discharged or deposited onto adjacent properties or into
the stormwater drainage system, a public street or right-of-way, wetland,
creek, stream, water body, or floodplain. Said erosion and sediment control
shall comply with the requirements and provisions set forth in the Stormwater
Technical Manual.
   c.   Dams and Levees. Proposed new dams and levees, or improvements to any
existing dam or levee, shall conform to all applicable requirements set forth
in the Stormwater Technical Manual. (Ord. No. 15-33, § 1, 7-20-15)
Sec. 9-161 Permit Requirements and Procedures.
   a.   Sensitive Areas; Impact Drainage Areas.
      1.   Determination of Sensitive Areas. Sensitive areas include highly
erodible soils, wetlands, threatened or endangered species habitat, outstanding
waters, impaired waters, recreational waters, and surface drinking water
sources. A listing of highly erodible soils, outstanding water, impaired water,
recreation water and surface drinking water sources shall be included in any
stormwater permit, as applicable. Any discharge from a stormwater practice that
is a Class V injection well as defined by 40 CFR § 144.3 shall meet the Indiana
groundwater quality standards. If wetlands are suspected on a site, a wetland
delineation must be completed in accordance with the methodology established by
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE). Special terms and conditions for
development determined to impact or discharge to any sensitive area shall be
included in the stormwater management permit.
      2.   Impact Drainage Areas.
         A.   Mandatory Impact Drainage Areas. The following areas shall be
designated as impact drainage areas, unless good reason for not including them
is presented to the Board of Stormwater Management:
            i.   A Floodway or Floodplain as designated by the most updated
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Code dealing with floodplain
regulation.
            ii.   Land within 25 feet of each bank of any ditch within the
stormwater district.
            iii.   Land within 15 feet of the centerline of any stormwater
infrastructure or enclosed conduit within the stormwater district.
         B.   Discretionary Impact Drainage Areas. The Board of Stormwater
Management is authorized, but is not required, to classify certain geographical
areas as impact drainage areas. In determining impact drainage areas, the Board
of Stormwater Management may consider such factors as: topography; soil type;
capacity of existing drains; and distance from adequate drainage facility. Land
that does not have an adequate outlet, taking into consideration the capacity
and depth of the outlet, may be designated as an impact drainage area by the
Board of Stormwater Management. Special terms and conditions for development
within any impact drainage area shall be included in the stormwater management
permit.
      3.   Treatment of Sensitive and Impact Drainage Areas. In the event that
a project site is determined to impact or discharge to a sensitive area or is
located in an impact drainage area, the Board of Stormwater Management and/or
Board of Public Works and Safety may, in its discretion, require more stringent
stormwater quality and quantity measures than detailed in this Article, the
Stormwater Technical Manual, or in the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual.
   b.   Exempted Properties. Specific projects or activities may be exempt from
all or part of the informational requirements of this Article and/or Stormwater
Technical Manual. Exemptions are detailed in Sections
9-150(e),
9-156(a),
9-157(b),
9-158(b), and
9-159(b). If a project or activity is exempt from any or all requirements of
this Article, a claim should be submitted to the Stormwater Department listing
the exemption criteria met, in lieu of the information requirements listed in
the Stormwater Technical Manual. An individual exemption claim is not required
for individual lots, disturbing less than one (1) acre of land, developed
within a larger permitted project site. Review and acceptance of such lots is
covered in subsection d. below.
   c.   Stormwater Management Permit Procedures. This Section applies to all
development or redevelopment of land that results in land disturbance of one
(1) acre or more. Individual lots with land disturbance less than one (1) acre
shall refer to subsection d. below. All projects located within the district
lie within the City’s MS4 area boundary. The project site owner shall submit an
application for a stormwater management permit to the Department of Stormwater
Management. The application and all supporting documentation and information
shall be in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Stormwater
Technical Manual. All plans, reports, calculations, and narratives shall be
signed and sealed by a professional engineer or a licensed surveyor, registered
in the State of Indiana.
   d.   Erosion and Sediment Control Permits for Individual Lots.
      1.   For all individual lots disturbing 10,000 square feet or more of
total land area, a formal review and issuance of an erosion and sediment
control permit by the Stormwater Department will be required before a building
permit can be issued under Greenwood Building Code, found at Greenwood
Municipal Code Section
7-1 et seq.
      2.   For individual lots disturbing less than 10,000 square feet of total
land area, developed within a larger permitted project, a formal review and
issuance of an erosion and sediment control permit will be required before a
building permit can be issued under Greenwood Building Code, found at Greenwood
Municipal Code Section
7-1 et seq. All stormwater management measures necessary to comply with this
Article must be implemented in accordance with permitted plan for the larger
project. Information to be included in the application must comply with the
provisions of the Stormwater Technical Manual. Issuance of a stormwater
management permit does not preclude the need for an application for an erosion
and sediment control permit if required under this Section.
      3.   The City of Greenwood has determined that projects on individual
lots, not within a larger permitted project, disturbing less than 10,000 square
feet of total land area have the potential to generate polluted stormwater
runoff. The following land disturbing activities require a formal review and
issuance of an erosion and sediment control permit by the Stormwater Department
will be required before a building permit can be issued under Greenwood
Building Code Section
7-1 et seq.:
      a.   A project on a residential lot that will exceed the allowable lot
coverage based on the Zoning Ordinance.
      b.   Individual lots disturbing 500 square feet of total land area.
      c.   Projects resulting in an increase of 500 square feet or more of
impervious.
   e.   Easement Use Permit.
      1.   Drainage Easements. Prior to the planting of trees, shrubs,
structures, or fences or the introduction/planting of a rain garden or bioswale
in any drainage easement, a project site developer and/or property owner shall

said application to be reviewed and a decision made by the Director of the
Stormwater Department and/or his designee. Information to be included in the
application must comply with the provisions of the Stormwater Technical Manual.
      2.   Utility Easement. Prior to the erection of any structures or fences
in any utility easement, a project site developer and/or property owner shall
file an application for an easement use permit with the Department of Community
Development Services, said application to be reviewed and a decision made by
the Engineering Division. Information to be included in the application must
comply with the requirements approved by the Department of Community
Development Services and/or the Board of Public Works and Safety.
   f.   Terms and Conditions of Permits. In granting any permit under this
Article, including a stormwater management permit, erosion and sediment control
permit, and/or an easement use permit, the Board of Stormwater Management and/
or the Board of Public Works and Safety may impose such terms and conditions as
are reasonably necessary to meet the purposes of this Article. The project site
owner shall insure compliance with such terms and conditions. Non-compliance
with the terms and conditions of permits will be subject to enforcement actions
as described in Section 9-163. The project site owner shall inform all general
contractors, construction management firms, grading or excavating contractors,
utility contractors, and the contractors that have primary oversight on
individual building lots of the terms and conditions of any permits granted
under this Article and the schedule for proposed implementation.
   g.   Required Assurances - Performance Guarantees.
      1.   Applicability. This Section shall apply to all projects subject to a
stormwater management permit. As a condition of approval and issuance of the
stormwater management permit, the Board of Public Works and Safety shall
require the applicant to provide assurance in the form of an irrevocable letter
of credit, bond, or other acceptable means of assurances when the stormwater
management plan has been accepted and before construction begins. Said
assurance will guarantee a good faith execution of the stormwater drainage
plan, the stormwater pollution prevention plan, the stormwater quality
management plan, and any permit conditions. The intent of this assurance is not
only to complete the installation of storm drain infrastructure for the
project, but also to assure that adequate stormwater pollution prevention
measures are properly installed and maintained. If adequate assurances are set
aside by the project site owner for the overall project, proof of total
assurance can be submitted in place of an individual stormwater assurance.
      2.   Amount of Performance Guarantee. The assurance shall be for an
amount equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the total costs of all
stormwater management measures for the entire project, based upon the bond
estimate form and unit prices, as approved by the Board of Public Works and
Safety. The above-mentioned costs shall be based on an estimate as prepared by
a registered engineer or land surveyor. Said costs shall be for the
installation and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of erosion control measures
and the construction and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of storm drainage
infrastructure, detention/retention facilities, and stormwater quality BMPs, as
regulated under this Article, until the construction is completed, the site is
stabilized, and as-built plans are accepted by the Board of Public Works and
Safety. Assurances shall be for a minimum of $5,000.
      3.   Form of Performance Guarantee. Performance guarantees shall be in a
form approved by the Legal Department.
      4.   All other performance guarantees, maintenance guarantees or other

20-15; Ord. No. 24-44, § 1, 12-16-24)
Sec. 9-162 Waivers from Stormwater Requirements.
   a.   Waivers. The Board of Public Works and Safety may grant waivers from
the requirements of this Article and/or the Stormwater Technical Manual, based
upon evidence submitted by the developer that the natural surface drainage is
adequate, and a constructed stormwater system is not necessary, in which case
easements for such natural surface drainage would be provided instead of
construction of a storm drainage system. The Board of Stormwater Management may
grant waivers from the requirements of this Article and/or the Stormwater
Technical Manual, based upon evidence that the existing stormwater pollution
and/or erosion and sediment control facilities are adequate.
   b.   Application for Waivers. Any person or entity requesting a waiver of
the requirements of this Article and/or the Stormwater Technical Manual shall
submit a request, in writing, in a form approved by the Stormwater Department.
If the request at issue involves a waiver of water quantity requirements, said
request shall be placed on the agenda of following public meeting of the Board
of Public Works and Safety, at which time the person and/or entity requesting
the waiver, an agent of the person and/or entity requesting the waiver, and any
person affected by the request shall be permitted to appear and give evidence.
If the request at issue involves a waiver of water quality requirements, said
request shall be placed on the agenda of following public meeting of the Board
of Stormwater Management, at which time the person and/or entity requesting the
waiver, an agent of the person and/or entity requesting the waiver, and any
person affected by the request shall be permitted to appear and give evidence.
If a given waiver request involves both issues of water quantity and water
quality, the request shall be required to be presented to only to the Board of
Public Works and Safety.
   c.   Basis for Waivers. In considering a request for a waiver from
stormwater requirements, the Board of Public Works and Safety and/or Board of
Stormwater Management may consider the recommendations of the Engineering
Division, Stormwater Department, Legal Department and the  comments of other
persons having knowledge of the matter, as well as studies such as hydraulic
studies of peak flows and “show no impact” studies. In order to grant a waiver,
the Board of Stormwater Management or Board of Public Works and Safety must
make the following findings:
      1.   The granting of the waiver will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare, or injurious to other property;
      2.   The conditions upon which the request for a waiver is based are
unique to the property for which a waiver is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property;
      3.   The application of this Article will present or cause undue hardship
for a development or development site; provided, however, that undue hardship
shall not include the need for the developer to incur reasonable expenses in
order to comply with this Article; and
      4.   The granting of the appellant’s requested relief will not
substantially prevent the goals and purposes of this Article, nor result in
less effective management of stormwater runoff or stormwater quality.
   d.   Decisions Regarding Waivers. All decisions of the Board of Public Works
and Safety and/or the Board of Stormwater Management regarding a request for a
waiver from the requirements of this Article and/or the Stormwater Technical
Manual shall be made in writing and provided to the person and/or entity who
requested the waiver. Both boards may, in their discretion and within the
requirements set forth above, limit its granting of a waiver to or place
conditions on its grant. If the Board of Public Works and Safety and/or the
Board of Stormwater Management denies the request for a waiver, in whole or in
part, the person and/or entity that made the request for a waiver shall be
obligated to comply with all portions of this Article and/or Stormwater
Technical Manual for which a waiver is denied.
   e.   Any waiver issued under this Article shall not operate as a waiver from
any other requirements in other Articles of the Greenwood Municipal Code,
including, but not limited to, the Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision Ordinance,
Comprehensive Plan, and/or Thoroughfare Plan of the City of Greenwood, and
shall not operate as a waiver of any requirements or regulations issued by any
other governmental entity. (Ord. No. 15-33, § 1, 7-20-15; Ord. No. 24-44, § 1,
12- 16-24)

that he or she has committed a violation of this Article.
   e.   Civil Penalties for Violations.
      1.   Any person found in violation of any provision of this Article and/
or the Stormwater Technical Manual shall be responsible for a civil infraction
and subject to the fines set forth in subsection e.4. for each offense, plus
costs, damages, and expenses. Each day such a violation occurs or continues
shall be deemed a separate offense and shall make the violator liable for the
imposition of a fine for each day.
      2.   Costs and Expenses; Burden of Proof. Fines under this Section may be
collected in a civil action, along with all costs and expenses involved in the
case, including, but not limited to, mediation costs, short-term and long-term

For purposes of this Section, subsequent offense means a violation of the
provisions of this Article committed by the same person within three (3) years
of a previous violation of the same provision of this Article for which said
person admitted responsibility or was adjudicated to be responsible.
   f.   Alternative Remedies. In lieu of and/or in addition to the penalties
and remedies authorized by this Article, the Board of Stormwater Management
and/or Board of Public Works and Safety may require a violator to engage in
alternative remedial actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at
compliance workshops, creek cleanup, public education, or other similar
measures.
   g.   Stop Work Order and Protective Measures.
       1.   Issuance of a Stop Work Order. In addition to the penalties listed
above, if land disturbance activities are conducted contrary to the provisions
of this Article or accepted final stormwater management plans, an enforcement
agency may order the work stopped by notice in writing served on any person
engaged in the doing or causing of such work to be done, and any such persons
shall forthwith stop such work until authorized by the Department of Stormwater
Management and/or Department of Community Development Services to proceed with
the work.
      2.   Form and Service of Stop Work Order. A stop work order shall be in
writing and shall state to which land alteration it is applicable and the
reason for its issuance. One (1) copy of the order will be posted in a
conspicuous place on the site by the enforcement agency, and one (1) copy shall
be delivered to the developer and/or property owner and, if applicable, to the
person doing the land alteration by personal service and/or certified mail. It
is unlawful for any person to remove the order from the site or continue any
work on the site without permission from the enforcement agency.
      3.   Protective Measures. The enforcement agency may also undertake or
cause to be undertaken, any necessary or advisable protective measures to
prevent violations of this Article or to avoid or reduce the effects of
noncompliance herewith. The cost of any such protective measures shall be the
responsibility of the owner of the property upon which the work is being done
and the responsibility of any person carrying out or participating in the work.
Any person who neglects or fails to comply with a stop work order shall, upon
conviction, be subject to a fine of not less than $1,000, and such person shall
also pay such costs as may be imposed by the court, as well as reasonable
attorneys’ fees. A permit reinstatement fee may also be assessed by the Board
of Stormwater Management as set forth in Sections
9-161(l) and (m).
   h.   Suspension, Revocation or Modification of Permits. The Department of
Stormwater Management and/or Department of Community Development Services may
suspend, revoke, or modify any existing permit that the violator may also have
been previously granted. A suspended, revoked, or modified permit may be
reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the
remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured
the violations described therein, upon such conditions as the Board of
Stormwater Management and/or Board of Public Works and Safety deems necessary
to enable the applicant or other responsible person to take the necessary
remedial measures to cure such violations. A permit reinstatement fee may also
be assessed by the Board of Stormwater Management and/or Board of Public Works
and Safety as set forth in Sections
9-161(l) and (m).
   i.   Emergency Cease and Desist Orders. When an enforcement agency finds
that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
Article, or any order, permit, or regulation issued hereunder, and that the
person’s violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or
threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably
appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons or to the environment, the enforcement agency may issue an
order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the violator to immediately comply with all
requirements of this Article and take such appropriate preventive action as may
be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
immediately halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Any person
notified of an emergency order directed to him/her under this subsection shall
immediately comply and stop or eliminate the endangering discharge. In the
event of a discharger’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the
emergency order, the enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed
necessary, in its discretion, to prevent or minimize harm to the stormwater
drainage system or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to persons
or to the environment. The enforcement agency may allow the person to
recommence its discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
enforcement agency that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further
termination proceedings are initiated against the discharger under this
Article. A person who is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Board of Stormwater Management within
five (5) days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency cease
and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the violator.
   j.   Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges.
      1.   Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. An
enforcement agency may, without prior notice, suspend stormwater drainage
system discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop
an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons,
or to the stormwater drainage system or waters of the state. If the violator
fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the enforcement
agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to
the stormwater drainage system or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to
persons.
      2.   Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person
discharging to the stormwater drainage system in violation of this Article may
have his/her stormwater drainage system access terminated if in the
determination of the enforcement agency such termination would abate or reduce
an illicit discharge. The enforcement agency will notify a violator of the
proposed termination of its stormwater drainage system access by written
notice. The violator may petition the Board of Stormwater Management for
reconsideration. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates
stormwater drainage system access to premises terminated pursuant to this
Section, without the prior approval of the Board of Stormwater Management.
   k.   Cost of Abatement of the Violation. In addition to any other remedies,
should any owner fail to comply with the provisions of this Article, the
enforcement agency may, after giving notice and opportunity for compliance,
have the necessary work done, and the owner shall be required to promptly
reimburse the City for all costs of such work. If the amount due for abatement
of the violation is not paid within thirty (30) days or by the expiration of
the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special
assessment against the property and the Legal Department shall file all
necessary documentation to allow the Johnson County Treasurer to place the
amount on the property tax bill for the property.
   l.   Remedies Cumulative. Nothing herein contained shall prevent an
enforcement agency from taking such other lawful action as may be necessary to
prevent or remedy any violation. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to
the person or persons responsible. Costs include, but are not limited to,
repairs to the stormwater drainage system made necessary by the violation, as
well as those penalties levied by the EPA or IDEM for violation of the City’s
NPDES permit, administrative costs, court costs, attorneys’ fees, and other
costs and expenses associated with the enforcement of this Article, including
sampling and monitoring expenses.
   m.   Appeal of Notice of Violation/Citation.
      1.   If a person believes that the warning ticket or citation received
results from an incorrect interpretation of the Greenwood Municipal Code by a
municipal official, the aggrieved person may file an administrative appeal of
the decision for a hearing by the Board of Public Works and Safety, if the
warning ticket or citation involves an issue of water quantity, and/or the
Board of Stormwater Management, if the warning ticket or citation involves an
issue of water quality.
      2.   Form of Appeal. Said appeal shall be in writing on the form
prescribed by applicable Board and approved the Legal Department. A person who
elects to file such an appeal shall indicate this intent in writing to the
issuing agency. A person shall have ten (10) working days after issuance of the
notice of violation/citation to file the appeal, and additional monetary fines
as prescribed in this section shall be stayed upon the filing of such appeal,
as long as the violation does not continue at the real estate. A person who
files the appeal within said time period shall pursue the appeal in an
expeditious fashion.
      3.   Hearing. Upon filing, the appeal shall be placed on the agenda of
following public meeting of the Board of Public Works and Safety, if the
warning ticket or citation involves an issue of water quantity, and/or the
Board of Stormwater Management, if the warning ticket or citation involves an
issue of water quality. At said public meeting, the person and/or entity filing
the appeal, an agent of the person and/or entity filing the appeal, the
enforcement agency, and any person affected by the request shall be permitted
to appear and give evidence.
      4.   Decision of Board. All decisions of the Board of Public Works and
Safety and/or the Board of Stormwater Management regarding an appeal shall be
made in writing, stating the reasons for the decision, and provided to the
person and/or entity who filed the appeal. The action taken by the Board of
Public Works and Safety and/or the Board of Stormwater Management after a
hearing shall be final.
      5.   If the applicable board denies the appeal of the notice of
violation/citation, and the applicable violation of this Article and/or the
Stormwater Technical Manual persists, then a lawsuit may be commenced by the
designated enforcement entity in a court of competent jurisdiction in Johnson
County, Indiana.
   n.   Enforcement Measures after Appeal. If the violation has not been
corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation,
or, in the event of an appeal, within five (5) days of the decision of the
applicable board upholding the decision of an enforcement agency, then
representatives of the Department of Stormwater Management and/or Department of
Community Development Services may enter upon the subject private property and
are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation
and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent
or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the Department of
Stormwater Management and/or Department of Community Development Services or
its designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth
above. The property owner shall be required to promptly reimburse the city for
all costs of such work as stated in this Section. (Ord. No. 15-33, § 1, 7-20-
15; Ord. No. 24-44, § 1, 12-16-24)
Sec. 9-164 through 9-186 reserved for future use.
Division III.
Rates, Charges and Billing.
Sec. 9-187 Stormwater Service Charge.
   A stormwater service charge shall be imposed on each and every lot and
parcel of land within the district which directly or indirectly contributes to
the stormwater system of the district, which charge shall be assessed against
the owner, who shall be considered the user for the purposes of this Article.
This charge is deemed reasonable and is the minimum necessary to pay for the
repair, replacement, planning, improvement, operation, regulation and
maintenance of the existing and future City stormwater system and for
compliance with the City’s NPDES stormwater discharge permit(s) and MS4
responsibilities. (Ord. No. 15-33, § 1, 7-20-15)
Sec. 9-188 Stormwater Rate and Fee Establishment Procedures.
   a.   Each parcel of property assigned a separate tax identification number
shall be individually subject to a stormwater service charge, unless a parcel
is determined to be exempt from such a charge pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this Article.
   b.   For each parcel that directly or indirectly contributes to the
stormwater system of the district, the stormwater service charge shall be based
on the presence of and/or measure of impervious surface area on the parcel or
property.
   c.   Each parcel of property shall be classified as residential or non-
residential. The Director is authorized to establish the classification of an
individual parcel or property based upon its primary use. If, in the opinion of
any user, the classification of an individual parcel or property is incorrect,
the individual may appeal using the provisions of Sec.
9-191.
   d.   The stormwater rate is designed to recover the cost of rendering
stormwater service to the users of the stormwater system and shall be the basis
for assessment of the district’s stormwater service charge. The rate is further
designed to maintain adequate reserves to provide for reasonably expected
variations in the cost of providing services, as well as variations in the
demand for services.
   e.   The rate shall be evaluated annually by qualified professionals as to
its sufficiency to satisfy the needs of the Department of Stormwater Management
and an evaluation report shall be provided to the Board of Stormwater
Management no later than December 31 of each year. (Ord. No. 15-33, § 1, 7-20-
15)
Sec. 9-189 Rate Structure and Calculations.
   a.   For the purposes stated in Sections
9-150 and
9-188, there is hereby assessed a stormwater service charge to each user in the
district who contributes directly or indirectly to the stormwater system of the
district, in an amount defined below.
   b.   The Department of Stormwater Management hereby establishes that an
equivalent residential unit (“ERU”) shall be based upon 2,800 square feet of
impervious surface area.
   c.   All properties having impervious surface area within the district shall
be assigned an ERU, or multiple thereof, with all properties having impervious
area assigned at least one (1) ERU excepting contiguous residential properties
as defined in Sec.
9-152.
   d.   The stormwater service charge for one (1) ERU is hereby established at
$5.00 per month. The total service charge for a particular property shall be
determined by taking the number of ERUs assigned to a particular property and
multiplying it by $5.00.
   e.   Residential Properties. A monthly flat rate charge for stormwater
service rendered to residential properties shall be charged to each account
within the district. All residential properties are assigned one (1) ERU. This
flat fee shall apply to all residential properties as defined herein.
      1.   Contiguous residential properties having common ownership and
sharing a single structure containing four (4) or less dwelling units may be
assigned one (1) ERU.
      2.   Contiguous residential properties having common ownership, one of
which contains a dwelling building, and the remainder of which contain
impervious surface area but serve an accessory or incidental use, may be
assigned one (1) ERU.
   f.   Non-Residential Properties. The impervious surface area of each non-
residential property shall be individually calculated. Non-residential
properties shall be assessed a monthly rate for stormwater service based upon
the total number of ERUs that encompasses the measured impervious surface area
on the individual property. The calculation to determine the total number of
ERUs for a non-residential property shall be completed by dividing the total
square footage of measured impervious surface area for a property by 2,800
square feet. The division shall be calculated to the first decimal place. Total
ERUs shall not be less than one (1) for any non-residential property containing
measurable surface area.
   g.   Only whole ERUs shall be used in determining the assignment of gross
ERUs to a property. All rounding necessary to reach the appropriate whole ERU
shall be done according to mathematical convention (0-0.4 rounded down to the
nearest whole ERU; 0.5-0.9 rounded up to the nearest whole ERU).
   h.   Where there exists a common area parcel controlled by a Homeowners’
Association, and said parcel abuts four (4) individually parceled single-family
residential properties and is necessary to allow for ingress or egress from
each individually parceled single-family residential property to a public or
private street (thus, essentially acting as a common driveway), said common
area parcel shall not incur any residential or non-residential stormwater fees
so long as the impervious surface area on the common area parcel does not
exceed one (1) ERU. (Ord. No. 15-33, § 1, 7-20-15; Ord. No. 15-78, § 1, 11-4-
15)
Sec. 9-190 Billings, Terms of Payment.
   a.   Billings. All stormwater service fees shall be calculated monthly. Any
bill for services for partial month service shall be assessed on a per diem
basis. The Board of Stormwater Management, in its discretion, may set the
billing period as either monthly or quarterly.
   b.   Terms of Payment.   
      i.   The stormwater service charges shall be due on the payment date set
out on the bill. It shall be a violation of this Article to fail to pay a
stormwater service bill when due. All bills for stormwater services not paid on
or before the due date, which due date shall be approximately fifteen (15) days
after the bill is rendered, shall be subject to a collection or deferred
payment charge of ten percent (10%) on the outstanding balance.
      ii.   Payments made by check or other negotiable instrument that returned
for non-sufficient funds may be subject to a NSF fee of Twenty and no/100
Dollars ($20.00) plus an amount equal to the actual charge by the depository
institution for negotiable instruments returned for insufficient funds. When an
NSF fee is imposed under this Subsection, the City shall notify the maker or
drawer, or the person for whose benefit the instrument was given, to inform
them that the instrument was dishonored or returned unpaid and that the person
has ten (10) days after the date the notice is mailed to pay the total amount
due, including the NSF fee, in cash, certified check, or other guaranteed
payment. If the person fails to make payment within the ten (10) day period,
the City may file a civil action for the amount due, including the NSF fee,
court courts, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and treble damages. If payment is not
received with respect to dishonored checks within ninety (90) days after the
check is initially received, the matter will be referred to the Johnson County
Prosecutor in accordance with Ind. Code § cx 36-1-8-13. (Ord. No. 16-36, § 5,
6-20-16)
      iii.   Payments made by credit or debit card that are denied by the card
issuer may be subject to chargeback fee of Twenty and no/100 Dollars ($20.00)
plus an amount equal to the actual costs incurred by the City as a result of
the chargeback. When a chargeback fee is imposed under this Subsection, the
City shall notify the cardholder that the payment was denied and that the
person has ten (10) days after the date the notice is mailed to pay the total
amount due, including the chargeback fee, in cash, certified check, or other
guaranteed payment. If the person fails to make payment within the ten (10) day
period, the City may file a civil action for the amount due, including the
chargeback fee, court costs, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and treble damages.
(Ord. No. 15-60, § 3, 10-19-15; Ord. No. 16-36, § 6, 6-20-16)
   c.   Payment Priority. Partial payments shall be applied in this order: 1)
any NSF fee on the account; 2) any late fees on the account; 3) past due
balances; 4) current balances. In the event the City should elect to combine
stormwater service bills with any other City utility bills, partial payments
shall be applied in this order as between utilities: 1) waste management fees;
2) stormwater service fees; and 3) sanitary sewer fees. This provision only
applies to utility bills appearing on the same bill.
   d.   Collection. Delinquent stormwater service charges and applied
penalties, recording fees, and service charges may be made a lien upon property
and may be collected in accordance with the provisions of Ind. Code § 8-1.5-5-
29, Ind. Code § 8-1.5-5-30, and Ind. Code § 8-1.5-531. Delinquent stormwater
service charges may also be collected in a civil action along with reasonable
attorneys’ fees and court costs. (Ord. No. 15-33, § 1, 7-20-15)
Sec. 9-191 Appeals of Rate Determination.
   If, in the opinion of any user, the ERU multiple assigned to his or her
property is inaccurate in light of the amount of impervious surface area found
on the property or the property classification assigned to his or her property
is inaccurate, the user shall have the right to contest the ERU determination
and thus the rate assessed in the following manner:
   a.   User shall obtain and complete a petition to appeal stormwater rate and
return it to the Stormwater Department with verifiable documentation supporting
the user’s claim.
   b.   The Stormwater Department shall investigate the user’s claim and, upon
review thereof, shall render a written determination within thirty (30) days
that either the original ERU determination and assessed rate shall be affirmed
or the user’s rate should be adjusted.
   c.   If the user’s petition is denied, said opinion shall be forwarded to
the user by certified mail, return receipt requested. A determination of amount
of adjustment shall be forwarded to the user by certified mail, return receipt
requested, in cases where an adjustment is given. User shall then have fourteen
(14) days from the receipt of the opinion or determination to request
reconsideration by the Board of Stormwater Management.
   d.   If a request for reconsideration by the Board of Stormwater Management
is received, it shall be placed on the Board’s agenda for formal consideration
within thirty (30) days. The user and the Stormwater Department shall have the
opportunity to submit additional written documentation in support of each
position prior to the meeting. The Board of Stormwater Management shall conduct
a hearing on the disputed issue and issue a determination which shall be
binding on the Stormwater Department. The hearing shall be electronically
recorded and a transcript of the hearing provided upon request at a cost per
page as determined by the Controller and amended from time to time.
   e.   A party or person aggrieved by the final Board of Stormwater Management
determination shall have the right to judicial review of the determination in
accordance with state law.
   f.   If the Stormwater Department recommends that the user’s rate be
reduced, or reduction is ordered by the Board of Stormwater Management or a
court of law, user shall be credited accordingly for any overpayment made from
the date of the petition.
   g.   Dispute or appeal of an ERU determination for stormwater service rate
or credit application shall not be a valid reason for non-payment of the
originally assessed stormwater service charge by the user. (Ord. No. 15-33, §
1, 7-20-15)
Sec. 9-192 Discount and Credits Policies and Procedure.
   a.   Stormwater service charge credits may be available to eligible non-
residential property owners.
   b.   Non-residential property owners may qualify for one or more of the
following types of credits:
      1.   Stormwater Quality Credits
      2.   Stormwater Quantity Credits
      3.   Retrofit Credits
      4.   Education Credits
   c.   Credit requests shall be reviewed by the Department of Stormwater
Management and recommended for approval or denial to the Board of Stormwater
Management. The Board shall render the final approval or denial of all credit
requests. Specific policies and procedures for submission of a credit request
by a non-residential property owner shall be consistent with the most recent
version of the "City of Greenwood Stormwater Credit Manual" approved by the
Board. An approved credit or combination of credits shall not exceed forty
percent (40%) of the total service charge assessment for a parcel of property.
   d.   Approved credits shall be applied to the monthly stormwater service
charge as approved by the Board for a period of five (5) years (60 months)
following the date of Board approval at which time the credit shall expire
unless otherwise terminated. A credit shall be terminated as described below:
      1.   Property transfer or new ownership
      2.   Failure to maintain facilities as required/indicated in Stormwater
Technical Manual
      3.   Failure to report on education credit
      4.   Property alteration
   e.   Expired or terminated credits require the submission of a new credit
request.
   f.   Application for a credit or appeal determination thereon shall not
constitute a valid reason for non-payment of assessed stormwater service
charges by the property owner.
   g.   All residential and non-residential customers who enroll in both the
City’s ACH and E-Billing program (or who are enrolled as of January 1, 2016)
and who pay their stormwater service charges through this program for a period
of two (2) consecutive billing cycles shall be entitled to a one-time billing
credit in the amount of Ten and no/100 Dollars ($10.00). Participation in the
E-Billing Program shall be defined as an account’s receipt of exclusively
electronic bills and notification with no paper mailings. The credit shall be
applied on the first bill following the customer’s enrollment in the program
(or for existing enrollees, on the first bill following January 1, 2016), and
shall be revoked if the customer cancels ACH or E-Billing within two (2)
billing cycles of the credit having been applied. No customer shall be eligible
for more than one (1) electronic bill credit, except that receipt of an
electronic billing credit under this Section shall not prohibit a customer from
obtaining an electronic billing credit under either GMC Sec.
6-309(d) or GMC Sec.
9-111(b). The Controller shall be responsible for determining if a customer is
eligible for a credit under this Section, and no action of the Board shall be
required in order for this credit to be given to an individual customer. (Ord.
No. 15-33, § 1, 7-20-15; Ord. No. 15-74, § 3, 12-7-15)
Sec. 9-193 Stormwater Management Fund.
   All rates and fees collected for stormwater service, including but not
limited to, drainage service charges, direct charges and interest earnings on
any unused funds shall be deposited in an account entitled “Stormwater
Management Account.” Disbursements from this account shall be authorized by the
Board of Stormwater Management. Such disbursements shall be used for the
operation, maintenance and improvement of the district’s stormwater management
system, for reimbursement to the City for past and future stormwater management
system maintenance and administration, and to achieve the goals and purposes of
this Article. (Ord. No. 15-33, § 1, 7-20-15)

the Greenwood Common Council as provided by law.
(Ord. 20-29, § 2, 9-21-20)
Sec. 10-01-02. Statutory Authority.
This Ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authority contained in Indiana Code §
36-7-4 et seq. Whenever any provision of this Ordinance refers to or cites a
section of the Indiana Code and that section is later amended or superseded,
this Ordinance shall be deemed amended to refer to the amended section or the
section that most nearly corresponds to the superseded section.
(Ord. 20-29, § 2, 9-21-20)
Sec. 10-01-03. Purpose and Intent.
In adopting this Ordinance, the Council has given reasonable consideration to,
among other things: the Comprehensive Plan; current conditions and the
character of current structures and uses in each district and zone; the most
desirable use for which the land in each district and zone is adapted; the
conservation of property values throughout the City; and, responsible
development and growth of the City, and hereby adopts this Ordinance for the
purpose of:
   A.   Securing adequate light, air, convenience of access, and safety from
fire, flood, and other danger;
   B.   Lessening or avoiding congestion in public ways;
   C.   Promoting the public health, safety, comfort, morals, convenience, and
general welfare;
   D.   Guiding the future development of the City;
   E.   Ensuring that growth be commensurate with and promotive of the
efficient and economical use of public funds; and
   F.   Otherwise accomplishing the purposes of Indiana Code § 36-7-4 et seq.
(Ord. 20-29, § 2, 9-21-20)
Sec. 10-01-04. Findings for Adoption of this Ordinance.
The Council, in adopting this Ordinance, finds that the Ordinance has paid

   C.   In those instances where buildings and structures exist on a lot or
parcel that is subsequently rezoned to another district or zone (zone map
amendment), those buildings and structures shall be exempt from seeking

otherwise rezoned. These PUDs may continue to function under the established
PUD Ordinance previously adopted and specific to that development. Any project
within the same geographic boundaries of the existing PUD may be redeveloped

existing uses and building form.
(Ord. 20-29, § 2, 9-21-20)
Sec. 10-01-08. Official Zoning Map.

Plan Commission President and attested by the Planning Director under the
following words: “This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map of
the City of Greenwood, adopted on October 5, 2020, and hereby supersedes and
replaces any and all previous zoning maps. Plan Commission President, Planning
Director.”

water areas, buildings, and other structures in the City.
   D.   No changes of any nature shall be made in the official zoning map or
matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this
Ordinance and in Indiana State Code. Any unauthorized change of whatever kind
by any person or persons shall be considered a violation of this Ordinance and
punishable as provided under this Chapter.

variance with those shown on the official zoning map, or in other circumstances
not covered herein, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall interpret the district or
zone boundaries.
(Ord. 20-29, § 2, 9-21-20)
Sec. 10-01-09. Replacement of Official Zoning Map.
In the event that the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or
difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and
additions, the Plan Commission may by resolution adopt a new official zoning
map which shall supersede the prior official zoning map. Unless the prior
official zoning map has been lost or has been totally destroyed, the prior map
or any significant parts thereof remaining, shall be preserved, together with
all available records pertaining to its adoption or amendment. The new official
zoning map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior
official zoning map and shall be identified by the signature of the President

   A.   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts and zones as
shown on the Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
      1.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of
streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
      2.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed as following such lot lines.
      3.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following City limits shall be
construed as following such City limits.
      4.   Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed
to be midway between the main tracks.
      5.   Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed as
moving with the actual shoreline; boundaries indicated as approximately
following the centerlines of streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or other bodies of
water shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
      6.   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features listed
above shall be so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the
official zoning map shall be determined by the scale of the map.
   B.   Where confirmation of zoning is required for due diligence, financing,
or permitting purposes, a zoning verification letter may be requested from the
city. A “Zoning Verification Letter” (ZVL) is an official document issued by
the Planning Division.
      1.   Zoning Verification Letter serves as an official document that
provides essential zoning information to assist in property transactions,
development proposals, and compliance with local zoning regulations.
      2.   Includes current zoning district, existing and proposed uses, and
whether the use is permitted by right or is legal non-conforming.
      3.   Outlines zoning classifications and uses of adjacent properties,
confirms if property is part of a Planned Unit Development (PUD) or Overlay
District, and indicates status of site plan approvals, variances, and
commitments.
      4.   Addresses any open zoning, building, or fire code violations, and
confirms the existence of open building permits and Certificates of Occupancy.
      5.   The City shall charge a fee for the issuance of a Zoning
Verification Letter to cover administrative costs.

may permit, as a special exception, the extension of the regulations for either
portion of the lot not to exceed fifty feet (50') beyond the district or zone
line into the remaining portion of the lot.
(Ord. 20-29, § 2, 9-21-20)
Sec. 10-01-12. Rules of Measurement and Calculation.
   A.   Height Measurement.
      1.   In measuring heights, a habitable basement or attic shall be counted
as a story. A story in a sloping roof, the area of which story at a height of
four feet (4') above the floor does not exceed two-thirds (2/3) of the story
immediately below it and which does not contain an independent apartment, shall
be counted as a half story. Height shall be measured from ground level to the
highest point of the building or the mid-point of a sloped or hipped roof.
Chimneys, elevators, poles, spires, tanks, towers, and other projections not
used for human occupancy are not included in calculating height and may extend
above the height limit.

maximum requirements established by this Ordinance.
(Ord. 20-29, § 2, 9-21-20)
Sec. 10-01-13. Rules of Interpretation.

Sec. 10-02-05. Development Regulations.
Development regulations are listed for each respective district or zone. The
dimensional standards for the district or zone establish intensity, lot
dimensions, and height standards for all development applications. These
standards allow for variety in building types while maintaining the overall
character of neighborhoods and commercial areas of the City. This approach to
regulating development standards promotes development intensities that match
existing and proposed infrastructure investments.
The following page contains a graphic representation of the various development
standards found within the development tables for each section.

Sec. 10-02-09. Classification of Permitted Uses.
Permitted uses are listed in the use table below. The following symbols are
used and have a meaning as assigned below:
   A.   “PP” indicates that a use is Principally Permitted in the respective
district or zone as a principal use. The use is also subject to all other
applicable requirements of this Division.
   B.   “SE” indicates a use may be permitted in the respective district or
zone only where approved in accordance with the Special Exception standards
listed herein, and a Special Exception approval granted by the Plan Commission
as outlined in Division VI. Special Exceptions are subject to all other
applicable requirements of this Ordinance, including any applicable use
standards. In the instance that a use already exists on a property within a
district or zone where the use becomes a Special Exception upon adoption of
this Ordinance, then said use may continue exempt from the Special Exception
approval requirement.
   C.   “PA” indicates a use may be permitted as an accessory use to a
Principally Permitted use. Permitted Accessory uses are subject to all other
applicable requirements of this Division, including any applicable use
standards.
   D.   A blank cell indicates that a use is not permitted in the respective
district or zone. Uses not listed as Principally Permitted uses, Permitted
Accessory uses or Special Exceptions are prohibited from the applicable
district or zone.
(Ord. 20-29, § 2, 9-21-20)
Sec. 10-02-10. Similar Use Determinations.
   A.   It is not possible for a list of permitted uses to capture every
possible use that could be established. The City will occasionally receive an
application for approval of a use that is not expressly listed in the use
table. If a particular use is not listed in the use table, the Planning
Director will determine if a proposed use is similar to a listed use.
   B.   If the Planning Director determines that a proposed use is similar to a
listed use, the regulations governing that use apply to the particular use not
listed. The Planning Director may consider the following in deciding whether a
use is similar:
      1.   Whether the proposed use is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan,
Master Plan, or Area Plan and the purposes of the district or zone.
      2.   Whether the use has similar impacts on the neighborhood, such as
traffic, noise, lighting, or similar considerations.
      3.   Whether the unlisted use has the same characteristics as a listed
use in terms of building and site arrangement, site area or floor space,
equipment devoted to the activity, customer type, number of employees in each
activity, hours of operation, vehicles used and parking requirements, number of
vehicle trips generated, signs, and how the use is advertised.
   C.   The Planning Director may record a decision about whether a use is
similar to an unlisted use in writing.
   D.   If the Planning Director determines that a similar use does not exist,
the applicant has the following options:
      1.   Request a text amendment to establish a specific listing for the use
in question under
Division IV. If the Common Council declines to approve a text amendment, the
use is not permitted.
      2.   Request a variance under
Division VI. If the variance is approved, the use is treated as a permitted
use. If it is denied, the use is prohibited.
      3.   Appeal the determination to the Board of Zoning Appeals under
Division VI.

               Aeronautics, or the Greenwood Board of Aviation Commissioners to indicate to air
               crews the presence of structures or trees constituting airspace hazards, as
               defined in this Ordinance, shall be permitted.
 
(Ord. 20-29, § 2, 9-21-20)
Sec. 10-02-30. Flood Hazard Overlay District.
   A.   Background. The flood hazard areas of the City of Greenwood are subject
to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed,
or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
   B.   Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses
due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      1.   Protect human life and health;
      2.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      3.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      4.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      5.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located
in floodplains;
      6.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
area;
      7.   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      8.   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
      9.   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      10.   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      11.   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      12.   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   C.   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      1.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      2.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      3.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      4.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      5.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   D.   Definitions. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used
in these regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them meaning they have
in common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A structure with a floor area of four hundred (400) square
feet or less that is on the same parcel of property as a principal structure
and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure; an
accessory structure specifically excludes structures used for human habitation.
      1.   ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are considered walled and roofed where the
structure includes at least two (2) outside rigid walls and a fully secured
roof.
      2.   Examples of accessory structures include but are not necessarily
limited to two (2)-car detached garages (or smaller), carports, storage and
tool sheds, and small boathouses.
      3.   The following may have uses that are incidental or accessory to the
principal structure on a parcel but are generally not considered to be
accessory structures by the NFIP:
         a.   Structures in which any portion is used for human habitation,
whether as a permanent residence or as temporary or seasonal living quarters,
such as a detached garage or carriage house that includes an apartment or guest

limited to, a gazebo, pavilion, picnic shelter, or carport that is open on all
sides (roofed but not walled).
ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
ALTERATION OF A WATERCOURSE. A dam, impoundment, channel relocation, change in
channel alignment, channelization, or change in cross-sectional area of the

inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      1.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
      2.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
      3.   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding
and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally
dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited
along the path of the current.
   FLOOD or FLOODING also includes the collapse or subsidence of land along the
shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion or undermining
caused by waves or current of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels that
result in a flood as defined above.
FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Areas subject to the one percent (1%) annual chance flood.
(See SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA)
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which FEMA
has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available
digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM and
the water surface elevation of the base flood.
FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOODPLAIN)
FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The BFE plus two (2) feet at any given location
in the SFHA. (See FREEBOARD)
FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated by
water from any source. (See FLOOD)
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. Zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations,
building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a
floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance), and
other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone
areas. The term describes such state or local regulations in any combination
thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG.
FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulative increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height.
FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which
is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than those calculated for the base flood.
FRINGE or FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the floodplain lying outside the
floodway.
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
HARDSHIP. As related to variances of this section, the exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City of
Greenwood Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional,
unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial
hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations,
physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors
likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these
problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even
if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      1.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
      2.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      3.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      4.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by (a)
an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of Interior, or (b)
directly by the Secretary of Interior in states without approved programs.
HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. Analyses performed by a
professional engineer licensed by the State of Indiana, in accordance with
standard engineering practices that are accepted by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and FEMA, used to determine the base flood, other frequency
floods, flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries, and flood
profiles.
INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL-EVALUATION SERVICE (ICC-ES) REPORT. A document that
presents the findings, conclusions, and recommendations from a particular
evaluation. ICC-ES reports provide information about what code requirements or
acceptance criteria were used to evaluate a product, and how the product should
be identified, installed.
LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the mapping
update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new flood
map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six (6)-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six (6)-month period unless the community has
previously incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several types
of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by letter.
They are broken down into the following categories:
      1.   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). FEMA’s comment on a
proposed project that would, upon construction, result in modification of the
SFHA through the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
      2.   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (CLOMR-F). A letter
from FEMA stating that a proposed structure that will be elevated by fill would
not be inundated by the base flood.
      3.   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a building or land is not
located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A
LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
      4.   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT OUT AS SHOWN (LOMA-OAS). An official
determination by FEMA that states the property or building is correctly shown
outside the SFHA as shown on an effective NFIP map. Therefore, the mandatory
flood insurance requirement does not apply. An out-as-shown determination does
not require elevations.
      5.   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the currently
effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations,
and elevations.
      6.   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). FEMA’s modification
of the SFHA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill outside the
existing regulatory floodway.
LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of construction,
of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately
next to the structure.
LOWEST FLOOR. For floodplain management purposes, the lowest elevation
described among the following:
      1.   The lowest floor of a building.
      2.   The basement floor.
      3.   The garage floor if the garage is connected to the building.
      4.   The first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or pillars.
      5.   The floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement, below an
elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any resistance to
the flow of floodwaters. Designs for meeting the flood opening requirement must
either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet
or exceed the following criteria:
         a.   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
         b.   At least two (2) openings are designed and maintained for the
entry and exit of floodwater; and these openings provide a total net area of at
least one (1) square inch for every one (1) square foot of enclosed area. The
bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above the
exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath each opening,
whichever is higher. Doorways and windows do not qualify as openings.
      6.   The first floor of a building elevated on pilings or columns in a
coastal high hazard area (as that term is defined in 44 CFR 59.1), as long as
it meets the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3.
MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a "recreational vehicle."
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.
NATURAL GRADE. For floodplain management purposes, the elevation of the
undisturbed natural surface of the ground. Fill placed prior to the date of the
initial identification of the flood hazard on a FEMA map is also considered
NATURAL GRADE.
NEW CONSTRUCTION. For floodplain management purposes, any structure for which
the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulations adopted by a community and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88). As adopted in 1993, a vertical
control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within
the floodplain.
OBSTRUCTION. Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment,
levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization, bridge,
conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure,
vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into any
watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
ONE PERCENT (1%) ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a one percent (1%)
chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. See REGULATORY FLOOD.
PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community’s FEMA
map to effect changes to base (one percent (1%) annual chance) flood
elevations, floodplain boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and
planimetric features. These changes typically occur as a result of structural
works or improvements, annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas,
or correction to base flood elevations or SFHAs.
PREFABRICATED BUILDING. A building that is manufactured and constructed using
prefabrication. It consists of factory-made components or units that are
transported and assembled on-site to form the complete building.
PRINCIPALLY ABOVE GROUND. At least fifty-one percent (51%) of the actual cash
value of the structure, less land value, is above ground.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:

acceptable to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and
the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any
location is as defined in subsection E., General Provisions, 2., of this
section. The REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the term "Base Flood”, “One
Percent Annual Chance Flood”, and “100-Year Flood”.
REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two (2)
separate occasions during a ten (10)-year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded
twenty-five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
RIVERINE. Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, and the like.
SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITY. Any facility involved in the storage or disposal
of nonliquid, non-soluble materials ranging from municipal garbage to
industrial wastes that contain complex and sometimes hazardous substances.
Solid waste also includes sewage sludge, agricultural refuse, demolition
wastes, mining wastes, and liquids and gases stored in containers.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Synonymous with “areas of special flood
hazard” and floodplain, means those lands within the jurisdiction of the City
of Greenwood subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any
given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and Flood Insurance Studies as
Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. The SFHA includes areas that are flood
prone and designated from other federal, state or local sources of data
including but not limited to best available flood layer maps provided by or
approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the
permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank, which is principally above ground. The term includes a manufactured home,
as well as a prefabricated building. It also includes recreational vehicles
installed on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days.

cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred
“repetitive loss” or “substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not include improvements of structures to correct
existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
requirements.
VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this section consistent
with the variance conditions herein.
VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this section.
WALLED AND ROOFED. A building that has two (2) or more exterior rigid walls and
a fully secured roof and is affixed to a permanent site.
WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel, or other topographic
feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. WATERCOURSE
includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may
occur.

      1.   Lands to Which This Section Applies. This section shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard (SFHAs) within the jurisdiction of the City of
Greenwood, Indiana as identified in subsection E., General Provisions, 2., of
this section, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the City of Greenwood, Indiana.
      2.   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.
         a.   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for
the studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the City of Greenwood delineated
as “AE Zones” on the Johnson County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood
Insurance Rate Map dated August 2, 2007 shall be determined from the one
percent (1%) annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of
Johnson County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas and the corresponding Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) dated August 2, 2007, as well as any subsequent
updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency with the most recent date. Should the floodway limits not be delineated
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map for a studied SFHA designated as an “AE Zone”,
the limits of the floodway will be according to the best available flood layer
as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
         b.   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for
each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the City of Greenwood, delineated
as "A Zones" on the Johnson County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood
Insurance Rate Map, dated August 2, 2007, as well as any subsequent updates,
amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
with the most recent date, shall be according to the best available flood layer
provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream
drainage area from the subject site is greater than one (1) square mile.
Whenever a party disagrees with the best available flood layer data, the party
needs to replace existing data with better data that meets current engineering
standards. To be considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources for review and subsequently approved.
         c.   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community’s known flood prone areas
shall be according to the best available flood layer as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one (1) square mile.
         d.   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.
   F.   Establishment of Floodplain Development Permit. A Floodplain
Development Permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
section prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of
special flood hazard.
   G.   Compliance.
      1.   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or
structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of
this section and other applicable regulations.
      2.   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this section
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the most conservative
(highest) base flood elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed
structure; or for other developments, affecting any part of the area of the
development.
      3.   No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without
full compliance with the terms of this section and other applicable
regulations.
   H.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This section is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this section and another conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   I.   Discrepancy between Mapped Floodplain and Actual Ground Elevations.
      1.   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) with base flood elevations provided (riverine or lacustrine Zone AE) on
the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the
profiles or table of still water elevations shall govern.
      2.   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
      3.   If the natural grade elevation of the site in question is at or
above the base flood elevation and a LOMA or LOMR-FW is obtained, the
floodplain regulations will not be applied provided the LOMA or LOMR-FW is not
subsequently superseded or invalidated.
   J.   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this section
all provisions shall be:
      1.   Considered as minimum requirements;
      2.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      3.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   K.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Therefore, this section does not create any liability on the part of the City
of Greenwood, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of
Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this section, or
any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
   L.   Penalties for Violation. Failure to obtain a Floodplain Development
Permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a Floodplain
Development Permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this section. All violations shall be considered a common nuisance
and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code for
the City of Greenwood. All violations shall be punishable by a fine as
prescribed in Sec.
10-04-09 (F).
      1.   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the
violation continues to exist.
      2.   The City of Greenwood Planning Director shall inform the owner that
any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and
therefore may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be
suspended.
      3.   Nothing herein shall prevent the City of Greenwood from taking such
other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.
   M.   Administration.
      1.   Designation of Administrator. The Common Council of the City of
Greenwood hereby appoints the Planning Director to administer and implement the

provisions of these regulations have been met or refuse to issue the same in
the event of noncompliance.
         e.   Advise permittee that additional federal, state and/or local
permits may be required. If specific federal, state and/or local permits are
known, require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file
with the floodplain development permit.
         f.   Conduct substantial damage determinations to determine whether
existing structures, damaged from any source and in special flood hazard areas,
must meet the development standards of these regulations.
         g.   For applications to improve structures, including alterations,
movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, change of occupancy, additions,
rehabilitations, renovations, substantial improvements, repairs of substantial
damage, and any other improvement of or work on such buildings and structures,
the Floodplain Administrator shall:
            i.   Verify and document the market value of the pre-damaged or
pre-improved structure;
            ii.   Compare the cost to perform the improvement; or the cost to
repair a damaged building to its pre-damaged condition; or, the combined costs
of improvements and repair, if applicable, to the market value of the pre-
damaged or pre-improved structure. The cost of all work must be included in the
project costs, including work that might otherwise be considered routine
maintenance. Items/activities that must be included in the cost shall be in
keeping with guidance published by FEMA to ensure compliance with the NFIP and
to avoid any conflict with future flood insurance claims of policyholders
within the community;
            iii.   Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage. The determination
requires evaluation of previous permits issued for improvements and repairs as
specified in the definition of “substantial improvement’ for proposed work to
repair damage caused by flood. The determination also requires evaluation of
previous permits issued to repair flood-related damage as specified in the
definition of substantial damage; and
            iv.   Notify the applicant if it is determined that the work
constitutes substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage and that
compliance with the applicable general and specific standards in subsection N.,

prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit copies of
such notifications to FEMA.
         i.   Ensure that construction authorization has been granted by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources for all development projects subject to
this section. Maintain a record of such authorization (either copy of actual
permit/authorization or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment).
         j.   Verify the upstream drainage area of any proposed development
site near any watercourse not identified on a FEMA map to determine if
subsection M. Administration, 3. i is applicable.
         k.   Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is
not diminished.
         l.   Verify and record the actual elevation of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, in
accordance with subsection M, Administration, 2.
         m.   Verify and record the actual elevation to which any new or
substantially improved structures have been floodproofed in accordance with
subsection M., Administration, 2..
         n.   Make on-site inspections of projects in accordance with
subsection M., Administration, 4.
         o.   Coordinate with insurance adjusters prior to permitting any
proposed work to bring any flood-damaged structure covered by a standard flood
insurance policy into compliance (either a substantially damaged structure or a
repetitive loss structure) to ensure eligibility for ICC funds.
         p.   Ensure that an approved connection to a public sewer system or an
approved on-site septic system is planned for any structures (residential or
non-residential) to be equipped with a restroom, kitchen or other facilities
requiring disposal of wastewater.
         q.   Provide information, testimony, or other evidence as needed
during variance hearings.
         r.   Serve notices of violations, issue stop-work orders, revoke
permits and take corrective actions in accordance with subsection M,
Administration, 4.
         s.   Maintain for public inspection and furnish upon request local
permit documents, damaged structure inventories, substantial damage
determinations, regulatory flood data, SFHA maps, Letters of Map Change (LOMC),
copies of DNR permits, letters of authorization, and floodplain analysis and
regulatory assessments (letters of recommendation), federal permit documents,
and “as-built” elevation and floodproofing data for all buildings constructed
subject to this ordinance in accordance with subsection M., Administration, 4.
         t.   Coordinate map maintenance activities and associated FEMA follow-
up in accordance with subsection M., Administration, 5.
         u.   Utilize and enforce all Letters of Map Change (LOMC) or Physical
Map Revisions (PMR) issued by FEMA for the currently effective SFHA maps of the
community.
         v.   Request any additional information which may be necessary to
determine the disposition of a proposed development or structure with respect
to the requirements of this section.
      4.   Administrative Procedures.
         a.   Inspections of Work in Progress. As the work pursuant to a permit
progresses, the Floodplain Administrator shall make as many inspections of the
work as may be necessary to ensure that the work is being done according to the
provisions of the local ordinance and terms of the permit. In exercising this
power, the Administrator has a right, upon presentation of proper credential,
to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction at any reasonable
hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action.
         b.   Stop Work Orders.
            i.   Upon notice from the Floodplain Administrator, work on any
building, structure or premises that is being done contrary to the provisions
of this section shall immediately cease.
            ii.   Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the
owner of the property, or to his/her agent, or to the person doing the work,
and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed.
         c.   Revocation of Permits.
            i.   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit or approval,
issued under the provisions of this section, in cases where there has been any
false statement or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application
or plans on which the permit or approval was based.
            ii.   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit upon
determination by the Floodplain Administrator that the construction, erection,
alteration, repair, moving, demolition, installation, or replacement of the
structure for which the permit was issued is in violation of, or not in
conformity with, the provisions of this section.
         d.   Floodplain Management Records.
            i.   Regardless of any limitation on the period required for
retention of public records, records of actions associated with the
administration of this section shall be kept on file and maintained under the
direction of the Floodplain Administrator in perpetuity. These records include
permit applications; plans; certifications; Flood Insurance Rate Maps; Letter
of Map Change; records of issuance of permits and denial of permits;
determinations of whether proposed work constitutes substantial improvement or
repair of substantial damage; required design certifications and documentation
of elevations required by this section; notifications to adjacent communities,
FEMA, and the state related to alterations of watercourses; assurances that the
flood carrying capacity of altered watercourses will be maintained;
documentation related to appeals and variances, including justification for
issuance or denial; and records of enforcement actions taken pursuant to this
section.
            ii.   These records shall be available for public inspection at the
City of Greenwood’s City Hall located at 300 South Madison Avenue, Greenwood,
IN 46142.
         e.   Periodic Inspection. Once a project is completed, periodic
inspections may be conducted by the Floodplain Administrator to ensure
compliance. The Floodplain Administrator shall have a right, upon presentation
of proper credential, to enter on any premises within the territorial
jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the purposes of
inspection or other enforcement action.
      5.   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet NFIP minimum requirements to
have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to ensure that the City of
Greenwood flood maps, studies and other data identified in subsection E.,
General Provisions, 2. accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate
floodplain management criteria are based on current data, the following map
maintenance activities are identified:
         a.   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
            i.   For all development proposals that impact floodway
delineations or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that
technical data reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six (6)
months of the date such information becomes available. These development
proposals include:
               1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
               2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed
structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special
flood hazard area;
               3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and subdivision or large-scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations.
            ii.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have required
technical data for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map
Revision and submitted to FEMA. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources
will review the submittals as part of a partnership with FEMA. The submittal
should be mailed to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources at the address
provided on the FEMA form (MT-2) or submitted through the online Letter of Map
Change website. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall be
the responsibility of the applicant.
            iii.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional
Letter of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit
for proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood elevation.
            iv.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to this section.
         b.   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Greenwood and may be submitted to FEMA at any time.
         c.   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Greenwood have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Johnson County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map
accurately represent the City of Greenwood boundaries, include within such
notification a copy of a map of the City of Greenwood suitable for
reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for
which the City of Greenwood has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.
      6.   Variance Procedures.
         a.   The Board of Zoning Appeals (the Board) as established by the
Common Council of the City of Greenwood shall hear and decide appeals and
requests for variances from requirements of this section.
         b.   The Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an
error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Floodplain
Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this section. Any person
aggrieved by the decision of the Board may appeal such decision to the Johnson
County Court.
         c.   In considering such applications, the Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this section, and:
            i.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            ii.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others;
            iii.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
            iv.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
            v.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
            vi.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
            vii.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
            viii.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            ix.   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters at the site; and
            x.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         d.   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance.
         e.   Variances from the provisions of this section shall only be
granted when the Board can make positive findings of fact based on evidence
submitted at the hearing for the following:
            i.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            ii.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship as defined in subsection D, Definitions.
            iii.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of
the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
         f..   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to
subsection N., Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction, 1. a., 1. c. i., or 1. d.
may be granted.
         g.   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to subsection N.,
Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction, 1. a., 1. c. i., or 1. d. will require a
permit from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Variances shall not be
issued within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood
levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         h.   Variances to the Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction of
subsection N, Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction, may be granted only when a
new structure is to be located on a lot of one-half acre or less in size,
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the flood protection grade.
         i.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
“historic structures” upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an
“historic structure” and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
         j.   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use.
         k.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         l.   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes
of this section, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this section.
         m.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and
the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the
cost of the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
         n.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request.
   N.   Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction.
      1.   Floodplain Status Standards.
         a.   Floodways (Riverine). Located within SFHAs, established in
subsection E., General Provisions, 2., are areas designated as floodways. The
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters,
which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. Under the
provisions of the Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1) a permit for construction in
a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior
to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit,
construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes
land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing, and paving
undertaken before the actual start of construction of the structure. General
licenses and exemptions to the requirements of the Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-
28-1 and 312 I.A.C. 10) may apply to qualified additions/improvements to
existing lawful residential structures, rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland
restoration, utility line crossings, outfall projects, creek rock removal, and
prospecting.
            i.   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in
subsection E., General Provisions, 2., the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent
plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and
apply for approval for construction in a floodway, provided the activity does
not qualify for a general license or exemption (I.C. 14-28-1 or 312 I.A.C. 10).
            ii.   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator
until approval has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
for construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. The Floodplain
Development Permit shall meet the provisions contained in this article.
            iii.   The Floodplain Development Permit cannot be less restrictive
than an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to qualify for
a general license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site/
project. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
            iv.   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development shall
cause no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge without first obtaining a Conditional Letter of Map Revision and
meeting requirements of subsection M. Administration, 5. a. A Conditional
Letter of Map Revision cannot be issued for development that would cause an
increase in flood levels affecting a structure and such development should not
be permitted.
            v.   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet
identified on the effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect
of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or
unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as
an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least fifteen-
hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood
elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway
condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
            vi.   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill
(including levees) the City of Greenwood shall submit the data and request that
the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per
mapping standard regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
         b.   Fringe (Riverine). If the site is in the fringe (either
identified on the FIRM or identified by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources through detailed or approximate studies and not identified on a
FIRM), the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development
Permit provided the provisions contained in this section have been met.
         c.   SFHAs without Established Base Flood Elevation and/or Floodways/
Fringes (Riverine).
            i.   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one (1)
square mile:
            If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one (1) square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
            No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the one percent (1%) annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood
protection grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
            Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper written
approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain analysis/
regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, a Floodplain Development Permit may be issued,
provided the conditions of the Floodplain Development Permit are not less
restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
            ii.   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one (1)
square mile:
            If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one (1) square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and one percent (1%) annual chance flood elevation for
the site.
            Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in this
article have been met.
         d.   SFHAs not Identified on a Map.
            i.   If a proposed development site is near a waterway with no SFHA
identified on a map, the Floodplain Administrator shall verify the drainage
area upstream of the site. If the drainage area upstream of the site is
verified as being greater than one (1) square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
            ii.   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator
until written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
(approval for construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence
of general license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory
assessment citing the one percent (1%) annual chance flood elevation and the
recommended flood protection grade has been received from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.
            iii.   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, a Floodplain Development Permit may be
issued, provided the conditions of the Floodplain Development Permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this article have been met.
      2.   General Standards. In all areas of special flood hazard, the
following provisions are required:
         a.   All new construction, reconstruction or repairs made to a
repetitive loss structure and substantial improvements shall be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure;
         b.   New construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage
below the FPG;
         c.   New construction and substantial improvements must incorporate
methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
         d.   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning
equipment, and other service facilities shall be located at/above the FPG for
residential structures. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air
conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be located at/above
the FPG or designed so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within
the components below the FPG for non-residential structures. Water and sewer
pipes, electrical and telephone lines, submersible pumps, and other
waterproofed service facilities may be located below the FPG;
         e.   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
         f.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;

GENERALLY APPLICABLE REGULATIONS.
Sec. 10-03-01. Applicability.
   A.   The following regulations are applicable generally to all property
within the City as set forth herein.
   B.   Waivers.
      1.   The Commission may, in its discretion, authorize and approve waivers
from the requirements and standards of the generally applicable regulations in
this Ordinance upon a finding that:
         a.   The approval of the waiver request will not be detrimental to the
public safety, health, and welfare, or injurious to property within a
reasonable proximity to the subject property involved in the waiver request.
         b.   The strict application of the applicable Ordinance standard will
result in practical difficulties in the development due to the particular
physical surroundings, unique constraints, or topographical conditions of the
subject property. These conditions will not substantially alter the character
of the subject district or zone.
         c.   The practical difficulties were not self-imposed and cannot be
overcome by reasonable design alternatives. Financial hardship does not
constitute a practical difficulty.
         d.   The waiver request is necessary and represents a minimal
deviation from explicit Ordinance standards.
      2.   In approving waivers, the Commission may impose such conditions as
will, in its judgment, substantially secure the objectives of these
regulations.
      3.   Applications for waivers shall be submitted to the Commission with
application forms as prescribed by the Plan Commission. On the application, the
applicant shall describe the requested waivers and shall submit proposed
findings of fact in support of each requested modification. The applicant shall
bear the burden of establishing a sufficient factual basis for each requested
modification.
(Ord. 20-29, § 2, 9-21-20)
Sec. 10-03-02. Parking and Access.
   A.   Intent. Every use of land must include on-premises parking sufficient
for the needs normally generated by the use. Parking shall be provided in a
manner than is safe, accessible, well-designed, and mitigates environmental
impacts.
   B.   Applicability. The standards of this section shall apply to new
development and expansions greater than twenty percent (20%), as described
below:
      1.   Expansion of a structure (GFA), use, number of dwelling units, or
seating capacity beyond twenty percent (20%) requires that the entire site must
be compliant with the standards herein.
      2.   If the expansion is less than twenty percent (20%), then only the
expanded part of the use, building or site must be compliant with these
standards.
      3.   If only the site, and not the use or building, is expanded by more
than twenty percent (20%), then only the site must be compliant with these
standards.
      4.   Where the development standards tables in Division II of this code
identify parking as located in side or rear yards, one double-row of parking is
permitted in front of the primary structure.
   C.   Calculation of Required Parking Spaces. In determining the required
number of parking spaces, fractional spaces are rounded to the nearest whole
number, with one-half (½) or more counted as an additional space. Where
multiple uses exist on the same lot, the required parking minimum will be the
sum of the required parking for each use. Parking reductions may be granted for
shared parking as listed herein.

   A.   Purpose and Intent.
      1.   The purpose of this section is to regulate the size, color,
illumination, movement, materials, location, height and condition of all signs
placed on private property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the
protection of the health, safety and morals; the protection of property values;
the character of the various neighborhoods; the creation of a convenient,
attractive and harmonious community; protection against destruction of or
encroachment on historic convenience to citizens; encouraging economic
development; and enhancing the quality of life.
      2.   This section is intended to promote signs that are compatible with
the use of the property to which they are appurtenant, the landscape and
architecture of surrounding buildings, are legible and appropriate to the
activity to which they pertain, are not distracting to motorists, and are
constructed and maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition.
      3.   This section does not regulate every form and instance of visual
communication that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits
of the City. Rather, it is intended to regulate those forms and instances that
are most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set forth
above.

Sec. 10-03-17. Planned Unit Development (PUD).
   A.   Purpose. The purpose of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) is to
encourage flexibility in the development of land in order to promote its most
appropriate use; to improve the design, character, and quality of new
developments; to encourage a harmonious and appropriate mixture of uses; to
facilitate the adequate and economic provision of streets, utilities, and City
services; to preserve the natural environmental and scenic features of the
site; to encourage and provide a mechanism for arranging improvements on sites
so as to preserve desirable features; and to mitigate the problems which may be
presented by specific site conditions. It is anticipated that Planned Unit
Developments will offer one or more of the following advantages:
      1.   Reflect the policies of the Comprehensive Plan specific to the
neighborhood in which the PUD is to be located;
      2.   Provide substantial buffers and transitions between areas of
different land use and development densities;
      3.   Enhance the appearance of neighborhoods by conserving areas of
natural beauty, and natural green spaces;
      4.   Counteract urban monotony and congestion on streets;
      5.   Promote architecture that is compatible with the surroundings;
      6.   Buffer differing types of land use and intensities of development
from each other so as to minimize any adverse impact which new development may
have on existing or zoned development;
      7.   Promote and protect the environmental integrity of the site and its
surroundings and provide suitable design responses to the specific
environmental constraints of the site and surrounding area; and
      8.   Effectuate implementation of the Comprehensive Plan.
   B.   Conformance. Planned Unit Development is an area under single ownership
or control to be developed in conformance with an approved PUD master plan,
consisting of a map showing the development area and all improvements to the
development area, a text which sets forth the uses and the development
standards to be met, and exhibits setting forth any aspects of the PUD master
plan not fully described in the map and text. The map, exhibits, and text
constitute a PUD master plan. The uses and standards expressed in the PUD
master plan constitute the use and development regulations for the Planned Unit
Development site in lieu of the regulations for the underlying district or
zone.
   C.   Requirements.
      1.   The area designated in the Planned Unit Development map must be a
tract of land under single ownership or demonstrated control. Single control of
property under multiple ownership may be accomplished through the use of
enforceable covenants and commitments, which run to the benefit of the Plan
Commission.
      2.   The Concept Plan shall indicate the land use, development standards,
and other applicable specifications of the Municipal Code, which shall govern
the Planned Unit Development. If the Concept Plan is silent on a particular
land use, development standard, or other specification of the Municipal Code,
the standard of the underlying district or zone, the applicable regulations
shall apply.
      3.   The Planned Unit Development map shall show the location of all
improvements. The location of Planned Unit Developments shall be designated on
the Official Zoning Map and adopted pursuant to this Division.
      4.   The Planned Unit Development must comply with all required
improvements, construction standards, design standards, and all other
engineering standards contained within the Municipal Code and other pertinent
regulations, except where specifically varied through the provisions of this
Section.
      5.   Designation and Conveyance of Permanent Open Space.
         a.   Definition. Permanent open space shall be defined as parks,
playgrounds, waterways (as defined in paragraph b. of this subsection,
landscaped green space, and natural areas, not residential yard space
surrounding dwelling units, and not including schools, community centers or
other similar areas in public ownership.
         b.   Designation. No plan for a Planned Unit Development shall be
approved unless such plan provides for permanent landscaped or natural open
space. A minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of the proposed Planned Unit
Development area shall be designated as Permanent Open Space. No more than
thirty-five percent (35%) of the required permanent open space can be covered
by water defined as the high- water elevation, including detention and
retention ponds. The remaining permanent open space must be usable space, and
the developer must provide the necessary facilities to make them usable.
         c.   In the case of mixed uses, permanent open space shall be
allocated to the property in proportion to the uses assigned to the Planned
Unit Development and shall be located in a reasonable proximity to those uses.
Provided, however, the permanent open space need not be located in proximity to
the use in the case of preservation of existing features.
         d.   If the Concept Plan provides for the Planned Unit Development to
be constructed in stages, open space must be provided for each stage of the
Planned Unit Development in proportion to that stage.
         e.   Conveyance. Permanent open space shall be conveyed in one of the
following forms:
            i.   To a municipal or public corporation; or
            ii.   To a not-for-profit corporation or entity established for the
purpose of benefiting the owners and tenants of the Planned Unit Development,
or where appropriate and where approved by the Plan Commission and the Common
Council, adjoining property owners, or both. All conveyances shall be
structures to ensure that the grantee has the obligation and the right to
effect maintenance and improvement of the common open space; and that such duty
of maintenance and improvement is enforced by the owners and tenants of the
Planned Unit development and, where applicable, by adjoining property owners;
or
            iii.   To owners other than those specified in subsections i. and
ii. above, and subject to restrictive covenants describing and guaranteeing the
open space and its maintenance and improvement, running with the land for the
benefit of residents of the Planned Unit Development or adjoining property
owners; or both; or
            iv.   Uses permitted in a Planned Unit Development may be any use
which is found in the Master List of Uses by Zone and District, Division II,
Sec. 10-02-11, subject to the approval of the Plan Commission and Common
Council.
   D.   Procedure for Approval.
      1.   Introduction. Application shall be accompanied by all plans and
documents required by Sec.

Concept Plan, subject to approval of a PUD master plan.
            iii.   No permit of any kind shall be issued until the PUD master
plan has been approved.
         d.   PUD Master Plan.
            i.   Purpose of PUD Master Plan Approval. The purpose of the PUD
master plan is to designate the controls for development of the Planned Unit
Development. The PUD master plan shall show the exact location of each building
and improvement to be constructed and a designation of the specific internal
use or range of uses to which each building shall be put.
            ii.   Time Limit for PUD Master Plan Approval. The PUD master plan
shall be submitted to the Planning Department not more than eighteen (18)
months following Common Council approval of the Concept Plan. The Concept and
PUD master plans may be submitted as a single plan if all requirements herein
are met. The PUD master plan may be submitted and approved in stages, with each
stage representing a portion of the Concept Plan, at the discretion of the Plan
Commission. The time limit for submitting each stage for approval may be set
forth in the Concept Plan, in which case that schedule shall control the timing
of development, rather than the time period contained in this paragraph. The
Plan Commission may extend the time for application for approval of the PUD
master plan for good cause, consistent with the purposes of this Ordinance.
         e.   Expiration of Time Limit.
            i.   Periodically, the planning staff shall report to the Plan
Commission on Planned Unit Developments whose time limits have expired. The
applicants shall be notified. The Plan Commission shall determine whether to
consider extending the time or to initiate action to amend the Official Zoning
Map so as to rescind the Planned Unit Development designation.
            ii.   Relationship of Development and Concept Plan. The PUD master
plan shall conform to the Concept Plan as approved.
            iii.   Procedure for approval of a PUD master plan shall be:
               1)   The PUD master plan and supporting data shall be filed with
the planning staff.
               2)   The planning staff shall review the PUD master plan to
include site plan review, in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance
(Development Plans).
               3)   If the Plan Commission has retained PUD master plan
approval authority, as provided herein, or where a new PUD master plan is
required, the Plan Commission shall hold a public hearing in accordance with
its Rules of Procedure. The Plan Commission may approve, deny, or approve with
modifications.
               4)   Staff Approval. If the Plan Commission has authorized staff
to approve any PUD master plans during the PUD concept plan approval process,
staff shall have approval authority for said PUD master plans. Staff decisions
may be appealed by the property owner to the Plan Commission.
            iv.   Expiration of PUD master plan. The PUD master plan shall
expire two (2) years after approval, unless grading and/or building permits
have been obtained and site work is still current and valid on that date. This
rule shall also apply to each stage of a PUD master plan approved in stages.
The applicant may request an extension of time in writing, and the approving
authority may extend the time limit where appropriate. Such extension may be
considered at the time of PUD master plan approval.
            v.   Effect of Approval of PUD Master Plan. No permit of any kind
shall be issued for any purpose within a Planned Unit Development except in
accordance with the approved PUD master plan, and after acceptance by the City
of all required guarantees for improvements herein.

      3.   Factors for Granting a Special Exception. Before granting a special
exception, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider the following factors:
         a.   Appropriate screening and buffering of the site, including refuse
and other service areas, is provided to ensure that the use will be compatible
with neighboring properties and will present acceptable views from public ways;
         b.   Ingress and egress to the site and to structures is safe and
adequate, and on-site circulation is also safe and adequate. The Board of
Zoning Appeals may receive recommendations regarding ingress and egress and
site circulation from the City Engineer and the Fire Chief. The Board of Zoning
Appeals may also request that the applicant provide a traffic impact analysis;
         c.   Satisfactory parking and loading facilities are provided;
         d.   Adequate utility services and related facilities are available.
The Board of Zoning Appeals may require written evidence of this availability
from utility authorities;
         e.   Adequate yards and open space are provided;
         f.   The proposed use does not generate environmental impacts which
may threaten public health and safety, including, but not limited to, negative
impacts to air quality (such as odor, smoke or air pollution), increased
flooding due to filling of the floodplain, or a loss of wetlands;
         g.   Compatibility with surrounding uses. The proposed special
exception shall not cause a loss of use or enjoyment of adjacent properties;
         h.   The design of the structures is in harmony with the surrounding
area, in both style and scale; and
         i.   The petition is not in conflict with the Comprehensive Plan.
      4.   Supplemental Conditions or Commitments. In granting any special
exception, the Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions or
commitments, per Ind. Code § 36-74-918.2 and Ind. Code § 36-7-4-1015. Violation
of such conditions or commitments, when made a part of the terms under which
the special exception is granted shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance
and grounds for revoking said special exception. Written commitments shall be
subject to the requirements established herein and to written rules of
procedure adopted by the Board in relation thereto.
      5.   Revocation of Special Exception. All special exception approvals
shall be considered conditional approvals. A special exception shall be deemed
subject to revocation following notice to interested parties and an opportunity
to be heard, under one or all of the following conditions:
         a.   If the use for which the special exceptions was granted ceases
for any continuous period greater than six (6) months in length;
         b.   If there is a change in use of the property or structures for
which the special exception was granted; and/or
         c.   If the applicant fails to comply with specific conditions or
commitments made a part of the approval by the Board or fails to comply with a
reasonable request of the Board for furnishing specific information related to
the proposed use.
      6.   Revocation for Failure to Obtain a Permit or Commence Use. The
granting of a special exception becomes official (final) only upon actual
commencement of the approved use for the subject property. Commencement of the
approved use must occur within three (3) years of the date that the application
was filed, or the special exception shall become null and void. The Board of
Zoning Appeals may grant a one-time extension not to exceed three (3)
additional years. If a land alteration permit is needed in order to affect the
requested use, the issuance of said permit must occur within the same three
(3)-year period from the date that the application was filed, or the approval
becomes null and void. Any actual construction required to affect the requested
use must also begin within that same three (3) years from the date that the
application was filed or said permit shall become null and void.

      3.   If the petition is denied, withdrawn, or dismissed for want of
prosecution, and the civil zoning violation continues at the real estate, then
a lawsuit may be commenced by the designated enforcement entity in a court of
competent jurisdiction in Johnson County, Indiana.
   D.   Appealing a Violation.
      1.   If a person believes that the warning ticket or citation received
results from an incorrect interpretation of the Ordinance by a municipal
official, the aggrieved person may file an administrative appeal of the
decision for a hearing by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Said appeal shall be
conducted in accordance with this Ordinance.
      2.   A person who elects to file such an appeal shall indicate this
intent in writing to the issuing agency. A person shall have ten (10) working
days after issuance of the warning ticket to file the appeal, and additional
monetary fines as prescribed above shall be stayed upon the filing of such
appeal, as long as the violation does not continue at the real estate.
      3.   A person who files the appeal within said time period shall pursue
the appeal in an expedited fashion. If the Board of Zoning Appeals affirms the
interpretation of this Ordinance which led to issuance of the warning ticket or
citation, and the civil zoning violation continues at the real estate, then a
lawsuit may be commenced by the designated enforcement entity in a court of
competent jurisdiction in Johnson County, Indiana.
   E.   Failure to Cure Violations.
      1.   A person who received a citation may elect to stand trial for the
offence by indicating on the citation his/her intent to stand trial and
returning a copy of the citation to the Planning Director. The returned copy of
the citation shall serve as notice of the person’s intent to stand trial, and
the additional monetary fines prescribed herein shall be stayed upon receipt of
the notice. On receipt of the notice of intention to stand trial, a lawsuit
will be commenced by the City’s legal department in a court of competent
jurisdiction in Johnson County, Indiana.
      2.   If a person who received a citation fails to pay the assessed fine
within seventy-two (72) hours and fails to give notice of his/her intention to
either file a petition as prescribed herein, file an appeal as prescribed
herein, or stand trial as prescribed herein, the City’s legal department may
file a civil lawsuit as prescribed by applicable laws and ordinances, and seek
penalties as prescribed in this section.
      3.   A person adjudged to have committed a civil zoning violation is
liable for the court costs and fees. No costs shall be assessed against the
enforcement agency in any such action.
      4.   In proceeding before the court for a civil zoning violation, the
Indiana Rules of Trial Procedure shall govern. The designated enforcement
entity has the burden of proving the civil zoning violation by a preponderance
of the evidence.
      5.   Seeking a civil penalty as authorized by this section does not
preclude the City from seeking alternative relief from the court in the same
action, or from seeking injunctive relief or other remedy in a separate action
for the enforcement of this Ordinance.
      6.   A change of venue from Johnson County shall not be granted in such a
case, as provided in Ind. Code § 36-7-4-1014.
   F.   Remedies and Penalties.
      1.   Each day a violation remains uncorrected is a distinct and separate
civil zoning violation subject to an additional citation and fine in the amount
approved by Common Council from time to time, provided a warning ticket has
first been issued.
      2.   The monetary fine for each civil zoning violation shall be $50.00,
except that for repeated civil zoning violation, the following fines shall
apply:
         Second citation:            $ 75.00
         Each Citation in Excess of Two:      $100.00
      3.   All fines prescribed by this section for civil zoning violations
shall be paid within seventy-two (72) hours to the Violations Clerk or his/her
designee of the Ordinance Violations Bureau, who shall render to the person
making payment a receipt stating the amount and purpose for which the fine has
been paid and duplicate of which shall be made a part of the records of the
Plan Commission. All fines thus received shall be deposited in accordance with
law.

DIVISION V.
NONCONFORMITIES.
Sec. 10-05-01. Applicability.
   A.   This Division governs lots, structures, and uses that were either:
      1.   lawful and conforming before the adoption of this Ordinance and any
amendments thereto, and that are no longer lawful under this Ordinance; or
      2.   lawfully nonconforming under the previous Zoning Ordinance and
remain lawfully non-conforming under this Ordinance and any amendments thereto.
   B.   It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit lawfully existing
nonconformities to continue until they are discontinued or removed, but not to
encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this Ordinance that
nonconformities shall not be enlarged, expanded or extended, nor used as
grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district or zone.
   C.   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any structure
on which actual construction lawfully began prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Ordinance and upon which actual building
construction has been carried on diligently since. Actual construction is
hereby defined to include the placement of construction materials in permanent
position and their fastening in a permanent manner, and shall include any
excavation, demolition or removal that has substantially begun in preparation
for building.
(Ord. 20-29, § 2, 9-21-20)
Sec. 10-05-02. Continuation.
   A.   Except as hereinafter specified, the lawful use of a building or lot,
or the lawful existence of a structure at the time of the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, which would render the use or the
structure non-conforming, may be continued as a lawfully existing
nonconformity.
   B.   A use or structure can at any time be brought into conformance with the
regulations in this Ordinance. Upon bringing the use or structure into
conformance with this Ordinance, the use or structure shall be considered
conforming and shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district or
zone, the nonconforming use not thereafter be resumed, and the terms and
provisions of this Division shall no longer apply unless the use or structure
becomes non-conforming as a result of an amendment to this Ordinance.
   C.   In any district or zone in which single-family dwellings are permitted,
a single-family dwelling and permitted accessory structures may be erected on
any lot of record lawfully existing as of the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Ordinance so long as the lot is not adjacent to lots with the
same ownership.
   D.   If two or more adjacent lots under the same ownership are lawfully
existing at the time of passage or amendment of this Ordinance, they shall be
considered to be an undivided parcel for purposes of this Ordinance. No portion
of said lots shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with
the applicable requirements of this Ordinance.
(Ord. 20-29, § 2, 9-21-20)
Sec. 10-05-03. Enlargement or Substitution.
   A.   No nonconformity shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed,
substituted, or altered to increase its nonconformity beyond an amount equal to
twenty percent (20%) of the GFA of the building or twenty percent (20%) of the
property. Should a property be modified beyond 20%, the building may retain a
legal, non-conforming status but the entire property must then meet current
standards. Should a building be modified beyond twenty percent (20%) of the
GFA, the property can retain legal, non-conforming status.
   B.   A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a building
which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption
or amendment of this Ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any
area outside of such building.
   C.   No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion
of the lot other than that occupied by such use as of the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Ordinance.
   D.   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
Division shall be erected in connection with any nonconforming uses of
property.
   E.   A nonconforming use can only be substituted with a permitted use or an
approved use by special exception.
(Ord. 20-29, § 2, 9-21-20)
Sec. 10-05-04. Repairs, Maintenance and Alterations.
   A.   On any nonconforming structure or structure containing a nonconforming
use, ordinary repairs, or the repair or replacement of nonbearing walls,
fixtures, wiring, or plumbing may be performed to the extent that the total
cost of such repair or replacement during any twelve (12)-month period does not
exceed fifty-one percent (51%) of the current replacement cost of the
nonconforming structure or the nonconforming portion of the structure, as the
case may be. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to permit the enlargement
or expansion of the area of any such structure.
   B.   If a nonconforming structure or a structure containing a nonconforming
use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and
maintenance, is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or
unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, or is declared by any duly
authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition,
it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity
with this Ordinance.
   C.   Regular maintenance of the nonconforming use or structure is permitted.
This includes painting, roofing, repaving, and replacement of windows and
siding with like materials.
(Ord. 20-29, § 2, 9-21-20)
Sec. 10-05-05. Replacement of Non-Residential Structure.
   A.   Any nonconforming structure used for non-residential purposes that is
damaged to an extent of more than seventy-five percent (75%) of its fair market
value at the time of the event causing the damage, exclusive of foundations,
shall not be restored, reconstructed, repaired, renovated, reused, or
reoccupied. If such damage amounts to seventy-five percent (75%) or less of the
then fair market value, the non-conforming structure may be restored,
reconstructed, repaired, renovated, reused or reoccupied, provided a building
permit is obtained and the restoration shall begin within twelve (12) months
from the time of the event that cause the damage.
(Ord. 20-29, § 2, 9-21-20)
Sec. 10-05-06. Replacement of Residential Structure.
   A.   If a legal nonconforming structure used for residential purposes, other
than such a structure that is subject to the jurisdiction of a preservation
commission organized under Ind. Code § 36-7-11-11.3, et seq. or a structure
location within a flood plain as defined in Ind. Code § 14-8-2-99, is damaged
or destroyed, the owner shall be permitted to reconstruct, repair, or renovate
the structure if the reconstruction, repair, or renovation satisfies all of the
following:
      1.   The structure will continue to be used for residential purposes; and
      2.   The new foundation of the reconstructed, repaired, or renovated
structure may not exceed the square footage of the foundation of the damaged or
destroyed structure.
(Ord. 20-29, § 2, 9-21-20)
Sec. 10-05-07. Discontinuance.
   A.   Where a non-conforming use has been discontinued or abandoned for six
(6) consecutive months, or for eighteen (18) months during any three (3)-year
period (except when government action impedes access to the property), the use
shall be considered discontinued and the property shall not thereafter be used
except in conformity with the applicable regulations of this Ordinance.

DIVISION VI.
SUBDIVISIONS.
Sec. 10-06-01. General Provisions and Design Principles.
In determining whether an application for approval shall be granted, the Plan
Commission shall review plats to determine whether the plat is in accordance
with the Comprehensive Development Plan and conforms to the standards and
requirements in this Division. Whenever the applicable requirements of this
Ordinance or the requirements of any other applicable governmental unit or
agency are higher or more restrictive, the higher or more restrictive
requirements shall control.
Nothing in this Ordinance shall be construed as a rule or regulation that would
prevent or restrain the complete use of any material resources by the owner.
Due consideration shall be given to the preservation of natural features,
including large trees, forests, waterways, scenic and historic points of
interest and other community assets.
Land subject to flooding or otherwise uninhabitable shall not be platted for
any use or in any manner that has the tendency to increase likelihood of danger
or harm to the public health, safety or welfare.
   A.   General Guidelines and Design Principles. The quality of design of the
built environment of the City is dependent on the quality of design of the
individual subdivisions that compose it. Good community design requires the
coordination of the efforts of each subdivider and developer of land within the
City. Therefore, the design of each subdivision shall be prepared in accordance
with the principles established by the Comprehensive Development Plan for land
use, circulation, community facilities and public utility services and in
accordance with the following general principles:
      1.   It is intended that the City shall be designed as a group of
integrated residential neighborhoods and appropriate commercial and industrial
and public facilities. The neighborhood, as a planning unit, is intended as an
area principally for residential use. Space for religious, recreational and
educational facilities to serve the residents of the neighborhood should be
provided and designed as an integral part of each neighborhood.
      2.   The size of lots and blocks and other areas for residential,
commercial, industrial and public uses should be designed to provide adequate
light, air, open space, landscaping and off-street parking and loading
facilities.
      3.   The arrangement of lots and blocks and the street system should be
designed to make the most advantageous use of topography and natural physical
features. Tree masses and large individual trees should be preserved. The
system of sidewalks and roadways and the lot layout should be designed to take
advantage of visual qualities of the area.
      4.   Circulation within and connections to the City’s existing street
network shall be provided in accordance with the following design criteria:
         a.   Each subdivision should provide for the continuation of all
arterial streets and highways as shown on the Comprehensive Thoroughfare Plan
Map.
         b.   Arterial streets should be located on the perimeter of a
residential neighborhood.
         c.   Minor streets should be designed to provide access to each parcel
of land within a subdivision or development, to adjoining undeveloped tracts,
and in a manner that will encourage connectivity with the existing street
network but discourage heavy use by through traffic. They should be planned so
that future expansion will not require the conversion of minor streets to
arterial routes.
         d.   Collector streets should be designed to provide a direct route
from other minor streets to the major street system. Each subdivision shall
provide for the continuation of collector streets as shown on the Comprehensive
Thoroughfare Plan Map.
         e.   Ingress and egress to residential properties should be provided
only to minor and collector streets.
         f.   Pedestrian ways should be separated from roadways used by
vehicular traffic and to provide anticipated pedestrian traffic within all
residential building sites with access to neighborhood facilities, such as
schools, parks and playgrounds, churches and shopping centers. An internal
trail system shall be provided to connect common areas to the public sidewalks
within the subdivision as well as to connect to perimeter sidewalk and trail
systems.
      5.   Minimum standards for development are contained herein, elsewhere in
this Ordinance, and in the applicable building code; provided, however, the
Comprehensive Development Plan expresses policies designed to achieve an
optimum quality of development in the City. If only the minimum standards are
followed, a standardization of development will occur, which will produce a
monotonous built environment. Subdivision design should be of a quality to
carry out the purpose and spirit of the policies expressed in the Comprehensive
Development Plan and in this Ordinance rather than be limited to the minimum
standards required herein.
(Ord. 20-29, § 2, 9-21-20)
Sec. 10-06-02. Blocks.
   A.   The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due
regard for the following:
      1.   To ensure a well-connected street network that considers future
development;
      2.   To avoid super blocks with limited connectivity and that discourage
pedestrian activity, contribute to street congestion, and increase driving
distance that can negatively impact emergency services;
      3.   To provide safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian access
within developments and between adjacent developments and to lessen traffic
congestion; and
      4.   To promote safe, direct and convenient pedestrian, bike and
vehicular access.
   B.   Blocks used for residential use shall not be longer than six hundred
feet (600') as measured along the centerline of the block. The Plan Commission
may require a dedicated common area easement in length of not less than across
any portion of the block.
   C.   Blocks used for residential purposes should be of sufficient width to
allow for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth.
   D.   Blocks intended for business and industrial use should be of a width
suitable for the intended use, with due allowance for off-street parking and
loading facilities.
(Ord. 20-29, § 2, 9-21-20)
Sec. 10-06-03. Lots.
Subdivision lots shall be adequate for the type of development and land use
proposed and shall be in conformity with applicable provisions of this
Ordinance.
   A.   A developer may request, at the time of submittal of a preliminary
plat, use of the “20/20” option. This option allows twenty percent (20%)
reduction of the lot area and lot width requirements for a maximum of twenty
percent (20%) of the total number of lots. Such reduced lots must be so noted
on the primary plat plans. The “20/20” option shall be available only to
subdivisions located in the RM Medium Lot residential zone.
   B.   The lot size, width, depth and shape, grade, location and orientation,
shall be in proper relation to street and block design and to existing and
proper topographical conditions.
   C.   Where a primary structure spans multiple lot lines, for the purposes of
development standard application, the outermost lot lines shall be considered
for the assessment of front, side, and rear yard measurement.
   D.   Every lot or parcel shall have sufficient frontage and access to a
public street designated, designed and improved in accordance with the terms of
this Ordinance; provided, however, the Plan Commission may modify this
requirement to include a private street. Frontage for lots facing a cul-de-sac
turnaround shall be as approved by the Plan Commission.
   E.   Flag lots are expressly prohibited.
   F.   As a general principle:
      1.   Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles or radial to
street lines.
      2.   Corner lots shall be of sufficient size to permit required building
setback and orientation to both streets.
      3.   Excessive lot depth in relation to width, or more than a proportion
of 3.5 to 1, shall be avoided.
      4.   Lot driveways shall be so located, designed, and constructed as to
provide a reasonable sight distance at intersections of a car behind the right-
of-way line.
      5.   Where difficult problems of driveway curvature and excessive grades
are likely to be present, the developer shall submit for Plan Commission
approval the details of driveway location and grade before lot lines and
building sites are finally determined.
(Ord. 20-29, § 2, 9-21-20)
Sec. 10-06-04. Easements and Dedications.
   A.   Where alleys are not provided, easements not less than fifteen feet
(15') in total width (minimum 7 ½ feet each side) shall be provided along each
rear lot line, and alongside lot lines where necessary, for use by public and
private utilities where it is deemed necessary. Larger easements may be
required for storm or sanitary sewer lines.
   B.   A minimum ten (10)-foot common area strip along the right-of-way at the
entrance of each subdivision shall be provided to accommodate appropriate
buffers and easements.
(Ord. 20-29, § 2, 9-21-20)
Sec. 10-06-05. Streets.
The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets
shall conform to all of the elements of the Comprehensive Thoroughfare Plan Map
and the following:
   A.   Major streets and collector streets shall be planned to conform with
the Comprehensive Thoroughfare Plan Map.
   B.   Whenever a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major
street, the Plan Commission may require service streets, reverse frontage with
screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property
line deep lots, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate
protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and
local traffic. The Plan Commission may require trails along abutting streets or
within the subdivision in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan.
   C.   Residential and cul-de-sac streets shall be laid out so that their use
by through traffic will be discouraged.
   D.   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or
limited access highway right-of-way, the Plan Commission may require a street
approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land. Such distances also
shall be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and
future grades separation structures.
   E.   Easements providing access to streets shall be prohibited except where
their control and maintenance is defined in a manner approved by the Plan
Commission.
   F.   Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of the tract owned or
intended for development by the party that is subdividing, a preliminary plan
of a proposed future collector street system for the unsubdivided portion shall
be prepared and submitted.
   G.   When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or
parcels, such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical
location and opening of future streets and appropriate subdivision, with
provision for adequate utility easements and connections for such
resubdivision.
   H.   Street intersections shall not be closer than one hundred fifty feet
(150') centerline to centerline. This provision does not apply to frontage
roads.
   I.   Street right-of-way widths shall be in accordance with the
Comprehensive Development Plan Map with the following standards intended as
minimum guidelines (actual street right-of-way widths may be greater). Where
not designated in the Comprehensive Development Plan Map, street right-of-way
widths, shall be not less than the following:
      1.    Major Streets:
         a.    Highways - minimum determined by State.
         b.   Primary Arterial - one hundred twenty feet (120') minimum.
         c.   Secondary Arterial - one hundred feet (100') minimum.
      2.   Minor Streets:
         a.   Collector - seventy feet (70') minimum.
         b.   Residential Service - sixty feet (60') minimum.
         c.   Cul-de-sac - sixty feet (60') minimum.
   J.   The grades of all streets shall not exceed the following, except in the
opinion of the Plan Commission where unusual topographic conditions justify a
modification of these standards. The minimum street grade shall not be less
than 0.5%.
 
Major Street Maximum Grades (longitudinal)
Highways           5%
Primary Arterial   5%
Secondary Arterial 7%

      1.   Land zoned for multi-family, industrial, or commercial use may
initially be platted into blocks, with the understanding that these blocks may
eventually be re-subdivided into lots, and recorded, without completing a new
primary plat. If, in the opinion of the Plan Commission, there are indications
that such future re-subdivision will occur, including the presence of parcels
containing more than one (1) acre of land, the Plan Commission may require that
the initial plat allow for the future opening of streets and the ultimate
extension of adjacent streets. Easements or right-of-ways providing for the
future opening and extension of such streets may be made a requirement of the
plat.

points feet from the intersection of said street lines (twenty-five feet (25')
for minor streets and fifty feet (50')) for arterial streets, or in the case of
a rounded property corner, from the intersection of the street right-of-way
lines extended.
      11.   The same sight line limitations shall apply to any lot within ten
feet (10') from the intersection of a street right-of-way line with the edge of
a driveway pavement. No driveway shall be located within seventy feet (70') of
the intersection of two street centerlines. If the available distance is less
than seventy feet (70'), the driveway shall be located at the greatest distance
from the intersection of the street centerlines.
      12.   This subdivision has been designed to include a stormwater quality
best management practice (BMP(S)) that must be maintained by the BMP(S) upon
the activation of the homeowners association, the operations and maintenance
manual for such BMP(S) owner, said BMP(S) is currently maintained by the
developer; however, upon the activation of the homeowners association, the
operations and maintenance manual for such BMP(S) shall become the
responsibility of said association subject to all fees and other City
requirements. A “BMP Operations and Maintenance Manual” is recorded as
instrument number 2019-026601 on the 20th day of November, 2019 in the office
of the Recorder of Johnson County, Indiana.
      13.   Sump pump lateral and underdrain pipes for sump pump laterals,
located within drainage easements, are to be privately owned and maintained by
the homeowner’s association, individual sump pump laterals are to be maintained
by individual lots owners.
      14.   Storm sewers and tile drains 12-inch (12") or larger within
designated drain easements are extensions of the City’s Stormwater Drainage
System and are the responsibility of the City. Drainage swales, detention and
retention ponds, and post construction stormwater quality measures shall be the
responsibility of the owner or homeowner’s association. If no homeowner’s
association exists or a homeowner’s association dissolves, owners of each lot
shall be equally responsible for maintenance. In the event the property owner
(s) or the association fails to exercise its obligation, the City may perform
the required maintenance and shall have the right to assess each lot in the
subdivision a proportionate amount of the associated costs. If necessary, a
Notice of Lien shall be filed against the affected lots. The lien shall be
enforced in the same manner as a mortgage lien under Indiana Law and,
therefore, shall include reimbursement of attorney’s fees, title expenses,
interest, and costs of collection.

Sec. 10-06-30. Provisions for Completion and Maintenance of Improvements.
   A.   Financial Guarantees.
      1.   The developer shall submit separate financial guarantees for each
public or private improvement and may not include any land that is not under
development at the time the financial guarantees is required, such as sections
of adjacent or contiguous land that remained undeveloped, except to the extent
that the land not then under development is used to access the site or provide
utilities or other necessary services to the land that is under development.
      2.   Financial guarantees shall be in the amount of an engineer’s
estimate or an actual contract amount, if available, to complete the portion of
the area or improvement of the project, or the designated section in the
project being bonded; provided, the amount may be in excess of the full value
of the engineer’s estimate or actual contract amount, as appropriate, and such
an excess amount shall be based upon a reasonable adjustment for the estimated
cost of inflation of materials and labor encompassed within the subject matter
of the financial guarantees.
      3.   Once the form and amounts of a financial guarantee have been
officially approved by the Board of Public Works and Safety, the developer may
enter into a performance agreement with the Board of Public Works and Safety to
provide for partial release(s) of the performance guarantee as the developer’s
project improvements are completed. The authority for administration and
enforcement of said financial guarantee and performance agreement shall then
lie with the Board of Public Works and Safety.
      4.   The following types of performance guarantees may be approved by and
filed with the Board of Public Works and Safety:
         a.   An insurance bond securable to the City in the amount equivalent
to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the estimated cost of completion of the
required public or private improvements.
         b.   An irrevocable letter of credit on behalf of the applicant and
securable to the City in an amount equivalent to one hundred ten percent (110%)
of the estimated cost of completion of the required public or private
improvements, written for a maximum length of one (1) year but automatically
renewed for additional one (1)-year periods not to exceed four (4) years.
      5.   The Board of Public Works and Safety shall, after a period of ten
(10) months, determine if the public improvements have been accepted for
maintenance by the governmental unit having jurisdiction over the public
improvements. If they have not been accepted, the Board of Public Works and
Safety shall so notify the developer of its intent to secure the funds and then
commence procedures to secure the funds pledged by letter of credit. At its
discretion the Board of Public Works and Safety may grant an extension for such
period fixed by the BPWS, not to exceed one (1) year. In which case the
developer shall file with the BPWS a new letter of credit for the period so
fixed in accordance with the requirements for letters of credit herein. The
Board of Public Works and Safety may require the filing of a financial
statement in determining whether or not to accept a letter of credit.
      6.   A performance guarantee by insurance bond shall be deemed by the
City to be in full force and effect until such time said guarantee is released
by official action and written notice by the Board of Public Works and Safety.
Any public improvements must be completed and accepted within two (2) years of
secondary approval (the date the Notice of Determination of Secondary Approval
is issued), unless an extension of time is granted by official action of the
Board of Public Works and Safety. Failure to complete improvements within said
time limits may result in forfeiture of financial guarantee without additional
notice to financially responsible party to secure completion of said
improvements.
      7.   Performance Guarantee Released/Maintenance Guarantee Received.
         a.   Upon completion of the public improvements within a subdivision
or development (or sections thereof) and submittal of as-built drawings (in
CAD) and video of any storm sewer, the developer shall request inspection of
construction improvements and release of performance guarantee by the Board of
Public Works and Safety. Upon receipt of such request the Board of Public Works
and Safety shall instruct the City Engineer and other appropriate City
representatives to inspect said improvements and submit recommendations to the
Board of Public Works and Safety. Any deficiencies found in the design and
workmanship of public improvements shall be corrected by the developer prior to
release of the performance guarantee. At such time as the public improvements
are acceptable to the Board of Public Works and Safety, it shall release the
performance guarantee in lieu of the three (3)-year maintenance guarantee. The
amount of the maintenance guarantee shall be equal to or greater than twenty
percent (20%) of the corresponding performance guarantee.
         b.   Performance guarantee for erosion control shall remain in full
force and effect until such time that eighty-five percent (85% of the lots to
which that performance guarantee pertains have been built upon.
         c.   The performance bond or other surety may be partially released on
an annual or on a more frequent basis before or during development in
accordance with a partial release schedule agreed to in a written performance
agreement by:
            i.   The Board of Public Works and Safety; and
            ii.   The developer or his/her/its designated agent.
      8.   As a condition for release of a performance guarantee, the developer
shall submit to the City Engineer two complete sets of record drawings of all
public improvements covered by said guarantee along with a video of any storm
sewers. Final record drawings shall not be accepted until the Board of Public
Works and Safety accepts the improvements. Record drawings shall be initially
submitted as paper copies, while the final record drawings shall be submitted
as original mylar copies, and in an electronic format compatible with the
City’s database.
      9.   Maintenance guarantees shall be of one of the forms as deemed
acceptable for financial guarantees above.
      10.   At least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration date of a
maintenance guarantee it shall be the responsibility of the developer to make a
written request to the Board of Public Works and Safety for final inspection
and full acceptance of responsibility of the public
      11.   Construction and maintenance of a public improvement shall be
deemed as the full responsibility of the developer until said public
improvement is accepted by official action and written notice by the Board of
Public Works and Safety. Expiration of a maintenance guarantee does not relieve
a developer from the responsibility of having the public improvements meet City
standards and specifications prior to official acceptance by the City.
   B.   General Inspection Procedures.
      1.   Execution of Contractual Agreement. As a condition for secondary
approval the developer shall enter into a contractual agreement with and as
prescribed by the Board of Public Works and Safety to provide for the
inspection and testing services in accordance with the standards and procedures
of this Ordinance, and subject to terms, conditions, and amendments as may be
imposed by the Board of Public Works and Safety.
      2.   Duties and Powers of Inspectors. The City Engineer or his/her
designated representative shall be responsible for adequate inspection and
review of all public improvements constructed within the jurisdiction of the
City. Private improvements (including, but not limited to, drainage, streets,
grading, erosion) are also subject to inspection when they have the potential
to impact adjacent property. The inspector shall perform, but not necessarily
be limited to, the following duties:

elevation and compacted in compliance with City specification, the developer
shall request inspection by a City representative. The developer shall not
proceed with any stoning or paving until having received approval to proceed
from the inspector.
         b.   Street Sub-Base: When the stone sub-base has been graded and
compacted in compliance with City specifications the developer shall request
inspection by a City representative. The developer shall not proceed with any
paving until having received approval to proceed from the inspector.
         c.   Street Paving: When ready to begin paving the developer shall
give the City Engineer at least forty-eight (48) hours’ notice so that the
inspector may be present during the time of paving.
         d.   Drainage Roughed-In: When the land has been cut to grade and
properly sloped in compliance with the approved plans, then the developer shall
request an inspection by a City representative.

sewer structures that are to be at or below grade level are in place in the
open trench, the developer shall call for an inspection by a City
representative.
         f.   Open Trench Sanitary Sewer Rough-In: When all conduits or
sanitary sewer structures that are to be at or below grade level are in place
in the open trench, the developer shall call for an inspection. In addition,
the developer shall be responsible for providing the City Engineer with
documentation for the appropriate tests and certification as required in this
Ordinance for sanitary sewers.
         g.   Block or Street Sections of Sidewalks: If the developer installs
sidewalks in relatively large sections such as sections of blocks or streets
involving several lots, the developer shall notify the City Engineer for
inspection at such time as a given section of sidewalk has been poured and all
forms removed. The developer shall not proceed with backfilling or grading
until having received approval to proceed from the inspector.
         h.   Sidewalks on a Lot-By-Lot Basis: If the developer installs
sidewalks on a lot-by-lot basis he may perform all work necessary for complete
installation of the sidewalk, including backfilling. The City Engineer may make
periodic inspections of such sidewalks to assure compliance with standards and
specifications. The developer may request a one-time reduction in the amount of
the performance guarantee posted, in relation to the amount of sidewalk that
has been completed, so long as at least fifty percent (50%) of the total
sidewalks have been installed at the time of the request. The Board of Public
Works and Safety shall rely on the recommendation of the City Engineer when
considering this request.
         i.   Final: When all work for said improvement in a given subdivision
or development (or section thereof) has been completed, and record drawings and
video of any storm sewer(s) have been submitted, the developer shall then
request a final inspection, before a reduction of the performance guarantee is
requested improvement. Failure to comply will result in immediate forfeiture of
guarantee. Upon receipt of such request the Board of Public Works and Safety
shall instruct the City Engineer and other appropriate representatives to
inspect said improvements and submit recommendations to the Board of Public
Works and Safety. Any deficiencies found in the workmanship or materials shall
be corrected by the developer prior to release of the maintenance guarantee. At
such time as the improvements are acceptable to the Board of Public Works and
Safety, the Board shall release the maintenance guarantee and the City thereby
assumes full and permanent responsibility for maintenance of the public
improvement.
