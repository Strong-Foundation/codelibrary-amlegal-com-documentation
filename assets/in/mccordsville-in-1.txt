   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the town, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered and consolidated into component codes, titles,
chapters and sections, shall be known and designated as the “McCordsville Town
Code”, for which designation “code of ordinances”, “codified ordinances” or
“code” may be substituted. Code title, chapter and section headings do not
constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.
§ 10.02  INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.

   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code, unless

reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or division.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning, application
or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)
§ 10.05  RULES OF INTERPRETATION; DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Rules of interpretation. This code shall be construed by the following
rules, unless the construction is plainly repugnant to the legislative intent

sense. Technical words and phrases having a peculiar and appropriate meaning in

construed as imputing authority to a majority of the persons, unless otherwise
declared in the section giving the authority.
      (3)   Where a section requires an act to be done which, by law, an agent
or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.
      (4)   Words denoting the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the
feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,
and words in the plural shall include the singular; the use of a verb in the
present tense shall include the future, if applicable.

(I.C. 1-1-4-5)
§ 10.06  SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   If any section of this code now enacted or subsequently amended or its

or application.

containing a non-severability provision, each division or part of every section
is severable.
      (2)   If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the
invalidity does not affect the remainder of the section unless:
         (a)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with
and so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
         (b)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of
whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a statute stating that the provisions of an act are

§ 10.07  REFERENCE TO OTHER SECTIONS.
   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof, the
reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified or renumbered, unless the subject matter is
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.08  REFERENCE TO OFFICES; NAME DESIGNATIONS.

the functionary.
   (B)   Name designations. Whenever any ordinance or resolution of the Council
refers to any board, bureau, commission, division, department, officer, agency,
authority or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated, on the effective date of that ordinance or following the
effective date, the rights, powers, duties or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity, then the named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date
or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which the duties,
liabilities, powers and rights were transferred.
(I.C. 1-1-6-1)
§ 10.09  ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
the error.
§ 10.10  REASONABLE TIME.
   (A)   In all cases where an ordinance requires an act to be done in a
reasonable time or requires reasonable notice to be given, REASONABLE TIME OR
NOTICE shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of the act or the giving of the notice.
   (B)   The time within which an act is to be done, as herein provided, shall
be computed by excluding the first day and including the last. If the last day
be a Saturday, Sunday or a state holiday, it shall be excluded.
§ 10.11  REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provided. The
repeal of any section shall not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture
or liability incurred under the section, unless the repealing section so
expressly provides. The section shall be treated as still remaining in force
for the purposes of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the
enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture or liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12  LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected

section of this code, the chapter or section shall be specifically repealed and

place.

§ 33.15  GENERAL INFORMATION.
   (A)   The fixed asset policy is being issued effective January 1, 2005. The
new policy will be referred to as the “capital asset policy”. This policy is
being issued to document the minimum value of capital assets to be reported on
our financial reports, and to include infrastructure assets. This issuance of a
policy document is related to the implementation of a new reporting model,
Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement 34. Statement 34 will require
the town to depreciate capital assets. The capital asset threshold will be
$5,000. An asset with a value under $5,000 will be expensed in the year of
purchase. The infrastructure portion of this policy is also effective January
1, 2005.
   (B)   Town utilities will follow this same definition of capital assets,
except any item with a unit cost of $5,000 or more shall be capitalized. Assets
that are not capitalized (items less than $5,000) are expensed in the year of
acquisition. Town utilities will follow the capitalization guidelines of the
State Board of Accounts.
   (C)   The town is, by this subchapter, establishing a capital asset policy
in order to provide a higher degree of control over its considerable investment
in capital assets, and to be able to demonstrate accountability to its various
constituencies: citizens, rate-payers, oversight bodies and regulators. All
public information pertaining to capital assets will be made available in the
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR).
   (D)   The purpose of establishing a capital policy is fivefold:
      (1)   To safeguard the investments of the citizens of the town;
      (2)   To fix responsibility for the custody of equipment;
      (3)   To provide a basis for formulating capital asset acquisition,
maintenance and retirement polices;
      (4)   To provide data for financial reporting; and
      (5)   To demonstrate appropriate stewardship responsibility for public
assets.
   (E)   This policy will only serve to classify capital assets, including
fixed and infrastructure, for accuracy in financial reporting through the State
Board of Accounts. It does not include data processing, programming
requirements or computer operations procedures.
(Ord. 020905, passed 2-9-2005)
§ 33.16  DEFINITION OF CAPITAL ASSETS.
   (A)   Capital assets include: land, land improvements, including monuments,
buildings, building improvements, construction in progress, machinery and
equipment, vehicles and infrastructure. All land will be capitalized, but not
depreciated. All items with a useful life of more than one year, and having a
unit cost of $5,000 or more, shall be capitalized (including acquisitions by
lease-purchase agreements and donated items). A capital asset meeting the
criteria will be reported and depreciated in the government-wide financial
statements.
   (B)   Assets that are not capitalized (items less than $5,000) are expensed
in the year of acquisition. An inventory will be kept on all computers and
other equipment with a capitalized cost of less than $5,000. (See § 33.22.)
   (C)   Exceptions are:
      (1)   Items costing less than the above limits which are permanently
installed as a part of the cost of original construction or installation of a
larger building or equipment unit will be included in the cost of the larger
unit;
      (2)   Modular equipment added subsequent to original equipment
construction of a larger building or equipment unit which may be put together
to form larger units costing more than the prescribed limits will be charged to
capital assets, even though the cost of individual items is less than those
units; and
      (3)   Cabinets, shelving, bookcases and similar items, added subsequent
to original construction, which are custom made for a specific place and
adaptable elsewhere, will be capitalized.
   (D)   Purchases made using grant funds must comply with grant requirements
or the above procedures, whichever are the most restrictive.
(Ord. 020905, passed 2-9-2005)
§ 33.17  THRESHOLD LEVELS FOR CAPITAL ASSETS.
   The following schedule will be followed for the different types of capital
assets other than infrastructure assets:
Type Capitalize/Depreciate
Type                     Capitalize/Depreciate
Building                 $5,000
Building improvements    $5,000
Construction in progress All/capitalize only
Land                     All/capitalize only
Land improvements        $5,000
Machinery and equipment  $5,000
Town utility assets      $5,000
Vehicle                  $5,000
 
(Ord. 020905, passed 2-9-2005)
§ 33.18  VALUATION OF CAPITAL ASSETS.
   (A)   Capital assets must be recorded at actual cost.
   (B)   Normally the cost recorded is the purchase price or construction costs
of the asset, but also included is any other reasonable and necessary costs
incurred to place the asset in its intended location and intended use.
   (C)   The costs could include the following:
      (1)   Legal and title fees, closing costs;
      (2)   Appraisal and negotiation fees, surveying fees;
      (3)   Damage payments;
      (4)   Land preparation costs, demolition costs;
      (5)   Architect, engineering and accounting fees;
      (6)   Insurance premiums during construction;
      (7)   Transportation charges; and
      (8)   Interest costs during construction.
   (D)   Donated or contributed assets should be recorded at their fair market
value on the date donated.
(Ord. 020905, passed 2-9-2005)
§ 33.19  ASSET DEFINITIONS BY MAJOR CATEGORY.
   (A)   It is important to the maintenance of accurate records that each asset
category be precisely defined, and that all persons responsible for records
maintenance be fully aware of the categorization system.
   (B)   This section further clarifies the asset definitions by major
category.
      (1)   Land. Land is defined as specified land, lots, parcels or acreage,
including rights-of-way owned by the town, its various departments, boards or
authorities, regardless of the method or date of acquisition. Easements will
not be included as the town does not own them, but as an interest in land owned
by another (i.e., property owner) that entitles its holder to a specified
limited use.
      (2)   Improvements other than buildings. Examples of town assets in this
category are walks, parking areas and drives, fencing, retaining walls, pools,
fountains, planters, underground sprinkler systems and other similar items.
Examples of town utilities assets in this category are water supply mains,
collection sewers, wells, dams, fences, intake pipes, manholes and fire
hydrants.
      (3)   Buildings.
         (a)   All structures designed and erected to house equipment services
or functions are included. This includes systems, services and fixtures within
the buildings, and attachments, such as porches, stairs, fire escapes,
canopies, areaways, lighting fixtures, flagpoles and all other units that serve
the building.
         (b)   Plumbing systems, lighting systems, heating, cooling,
ventilating and air handling systems, alarm systems, sound systems,
surveillance systems, passenger and freight elevators, escalators, built-in
casework, walk-in coolers and freezers, fixed shelving and other fixed
equipment are included with the building, if owned.
         (b)   Communication antennas and/or towers are not included as
buildings. These are parts of the equipment units that they serve.
      (4)   Equipment. Equipment includes all other types of physical property
within the scope of the fixed asset management system not previously
classified. Included within this category are office mechanical equipment,
office furniture, appliances, furnishings, machinery items, maintenance
equipment, communication equipment, police, fire, sanitation and park
department, laboratory equipment, vehicles, road equipment, aircraft, emergency
equipment, earth moving equipment, text equipment, civil defense equipment and
data processing equipment. All supplies are excluded.
      (5)   Infrastructure.
         (a)   Infrastructure assets are long-lived capital assets that
normally can be preserved for a significantly greater number of years than most
capital and that are normally stationary in nature. Examples include roads,
streetlights, traffic signals, drainage systems and water systems.
Infrastructure assets do not include buildings, drives, parking lots or any
other examples given above that are incidental to property or access to the
property above.
         (b)   Additions and improvements to infrastructure, which increase the
capacity or efficiency of the asset, will be capitalized. Maintenance/repairs
will be considered as necessary to maintain the existing asset, and therefore
not capitalized. For example, patching, resurfacing, snow removal and the like,
are considered maintenance activities, and will be expensed. Also, normal
department operating activities, such as feasibility studies and preliminary
engineering and design, will be expensed and not capitalized as an element of
the infrastructure asset.
         (c)   Alleys will not be included as part of infrastructure for the
following reason: existing improved alleys will be maintained as gravel alleys,
and the town is responsible only for the maintenance, such as patching and
repairing. Any investments to upgrade the alleys will be done by homeowner
participation. Therefore, the town will not track and value alleys, and the
patching/repairs will be expensed as they occur.
         (d)   The retroactive reporting requirements for infrastructure of
GASB 34 requires the town to report items put into service from 1980 forward,
and gives the town the option to report items put into service prior to 1980.
The town will report only on items put into service after 1980. Retroactive
reporting is not mandated until fiscal years beginning after January 1, 2006
which the town will comply with.
         (e)   At the network level, the asset will be classified as major if
the cost of the network item is at least 10% of the cost of all capital assets
in fiscal year 1999. A network will be defined as a group of similar assets
that serve a particular function or purpose for the town.
         (f)   At the subsystem level, the asset will be classified as major if
the cost of the subsystem item is at least 5% of the cost of all capital assets
in fiscal year 1999. A subsystem will be defined as a segment of a network of
assets that serve a similar function for the town.
(Ord. 020905, passed 2-9-2005)
§ 33.20  DEPRECIATION METHODS.
   (A)   The town will be depreciating capital assets by using either
composite/group method depreciation or the straight-line method.
      (1)   Salvage value will be determined on an asset-by-asset basis.
      (2)   Depreciation will be calculated at year-end.
      (3)   Land is not depreciated according to general accepted accounting
principles.
   (B)   A network of assets is composed of all assets that provide a
particular type of service for government.
      (1)   A subsystem of a network of assets is composed of all assets that
make a similar portion or segment of a network of assets.
      (2)   The following will be the breakdown of our networks and subsystems:
         (a)   Roads/streets network: subsystems: types of streets, curbs; and
         (b)   Traffic components network: subsystems: traffic signals street
lights.
      (3)   Composite/group network: composite depreciation refers to
calculating depreciation for a collection of similar assets. A single composite
rate is applied annually to the acquisition cost of the collection as a whole.
At year-end an adjustment will be made to the total cost to account for any
additions/disposals throughout the year. The accumulated depreciation
associated with it will also be adjusted. A gain or loss will never be reported
on the asset when using the composite method. A full year’s depreciation will
be taken when the asset is placed in service and no depreciation recorded in
the year it is sold or disposed of. It will group our dissimilar assets by
useful lives and our similar assets by networks. To determine the appropriate
depreciation rate for the composite group, divide one by the number of years
the assets are depreciated. For instance, a group of assets with a 25-year life
will be depreciated at 4% each year (1/65).
      (4)   Following is the list of groups it will use for depreciation:
Composite/Group Depreciation
Composite/Group Depreciation
Flood walls/gates    50 years
Street lights        35 years
Traffic signals      25 years
Roads
  Asphaltic concrete20 years
  Brick or stone    50 years
  Cement            10 years
  Concrete          30 years
  Gravel            15 years
 
      (5)   Straight-line depreciation: all assets accounted for under the
capital asset policy will be depreciated using the straight-line method of
depreciation.
         (a)   A gain or loss on disposal will be recorded.
         (b)   Following is a list of the most common useful lives:
Building components (HVAC systems, roofing)                            20 years

   (C)   Leased equipment should be capitalized if the lease agreement meets
any one of the following criteria:
      (1)   The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the
end of the lease term;
      (2)   The lease contains a bargain purchase option;
      (3)   The lease term is equal to 75% of the estimated economic life of
the leased property; or
      (4)   The present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of
the lease, excluding executory costs, equals at least 90% of the fair market
value of the leased property.
   (D)   Leases that do not meet any of the above criteria should be recorded
as an operating lease and reported in the notes of the financial statements.
(Ord. 020905, passed 2-9-2005)
§ 33.22  ASSET TRANSFERS AND DISPOSITIONS.
   (A)   Property should not be transferred, turned in for auction or disposed
of without prior approval of the department head. A vehicle/equipment out-
processing checklist should be sent to the Town Controller’s office in all
cases. This form is a dual-purpose form for transfer (defined as any movement
of an asset by virtue of change in location, either by account, department,
building, floor or room) or retirement (disposal) of property.
   (B)   The main points to be remembered when using this form are:
      (1)   Always provide sufficient detail to properly identify the asset,
most importantly the asset’s tag number or town ID;
      (2)   Be accurate and do not overlook any of the needed entries;
      (3)   Write legibly;
      (4)   Complete each column for every asset listed on the form;
      (5)   Enter information in correct row, depending on whether one is
transferring or deleting an asset;

as well as the Town Controller’s office.
(Ord. 020905, passed 2-9-2005)
§ 33.23  PERIODIC INVENTORIES.
   A physical inventory of all capital assets (any item over $5,000) will be
conducted in each department on or about December 31 of every year. The Town
Controller’s office will conduct spot checks on a random basis. Department
heads will be accountable for the capital asset inventory charged to their
departments by verifying a list of their capital assets at year-end.
(Ord. 020905, passed 2-9-2005)
§ 33.24  RESPONSIBILITIES OF CONTROLLER’S OFFICE.
   The Fiscal Officer will ensure that accounting for capital assets is being
exercised by establishing a capital asset inventory, both initially and
periodically in subsequent years. The Fiscal Officer will further ensure that
the capital asset report will be updated annually to reflect additions,
retirements and transfers and to reflect the new, annual capital asset balance
for financial reporting purposes and the annual and accumulated depreciation
calculation.
(Ord. 020905, passed 2-9-2005)
§ 33.25  RESPONSIBILITIES OF DEPARTMENT HEADS.
   (A)   It is the responsibility of the department head to act as or designate
a steward for each piece of property. The steward will become the focal point
for questions regarding the availability, condition and usage of the asset, as
well as the contact during the physical inventory process.
   (B)   The steward shall be designated as the person to record the receipt of
the asset, to examine the asset to make sure that no damage was incurred during
shipment and to make sure that the asset was received in working order.
   (C)   The steward is also responsible for arranging for the necessary
preventative maintenance and any needed repairs to keep the asset in working
condition. It is necessary to have a responsible person available for questions
that arise during a physical inventory or when someone wants to borrow the
asset. The steward ensures that the asset is used for the purpose for which it
was acquired and that there is no personal or unauthorized use. In addition,
the steward should report any property damage or theft.

§ 34.06  TAX ABATEMENT GUIDELINES.
   (A)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) below are hereby adopted by the Town
Council as the guidelines and principles for consideration of a statutorily
compliant request for tax abatement and an application score sheet.
   (B)   Contemporaneous with the submission of a statutorily compliant request
for tax abatement, a petitioner shall submit to the Clerk-Treasurer of the town
a non-refundable application fee of $500 before any further consideration or
processing of the application will take place.
      (1)   (a)   Guidelines and principles for consideration of property tax
abatement in the town. These principles are factors and considerations for
evaluating application for economic revitalization areas and tax abatement, and
will be used in determining the length of abatement within each category.
            1.   Firms receiving tax abatement are expected to give local
construction firms and local suppliers of goods and services the opportunity to
do business whenever possible.
            2.   Firms that create a technology based product or service or use
advanced technology in manufacturing will be given a higher priority.
            3.   The number of jobs retained and/or created per dollar of
investment will be an important consideration.
            4.   The level of wages and benefits will be an important
consideration for all applications.
            5.   Projects that will require variances or special exceptions
will require additional review.
            6.   Adverse environmental impacts will negatively affect the
consideration of abatement.
            7.   Any need for additional public infrastructure or other
additional public support for the project will be considered in determining the
length of the abatement. Support of additional infrastructure will be
considered as a local incentive to the company applying.
            8.   The time period of depreciation of equipment will be
considered in the length of abatement for equipment.
            9.   Economic revitalization areas (ERAs) designated by the Town
Council for personal property will include a memorandum of understanding that
may provide for the repayment to the town of all or a portion of the tax
savings realized through the designation in the event that the ERA is
terminated because the property is removed from the town.
            10.   A limited tax abatement may be considered in a Tax Increment
Finance (TIF) District.
         (b)   Guidelines for consideration of property tax abatement in the
town.
            1.   Projects will be considered for abatement only if the proposed
new investment is at least $1,000,000 and development has not begun and/or
equipment has not been ordered.
            2.   In addition, if the applicant is not the owner, authorization
of the application must be obtained from the owner.
            3.   The length of the abatement period for real estate will be
considered by the guidelines in the categories below:
6 to 10 years Manufacturing/real estate improvement
6 to 10 years Technology based/real estate improvement
              Manufacturing equipment (tangible personal property used in the
3 to 7 years  direct production, manufacture, fabrication, assembly,
              extraction, mining, processing, refining or finishing of other
              tangible personal property)
              Research and development equipment (tangible personal property,
3 to 7 years  such as laboratory equipment, research and development equipment,
              computers and computer software, telecommunications equipment or
              testing equipment)
              Logistical distribution equipment (tangible personal property,
              such as racking equipment, scanning or coding equipment,
3 to 7 years  separators, conveyors, fork lifts or lifting equipment,
              transitional moving equipment, packaging equipment, sorting and
              picking equipment or software for technology used in logistical
              distribution)
              Information technology equipment (tangible personal property that
              consists of equipment, including software, used in the fields of
3 to 7 years  information processing, office automation, telecommunication
              facilities and networks, informatics, network administration,

      (1)   Pursuant to I.C. 36-9-25, the town, by and through its Town
Council, may order the termination of water service to a sewer service address

days delinquent. When so ordered, the water utility shall terminate the service
in accordance with the terms of its agreement with the town.
      (2)   The fee for terminating services shall be a minimum of $45, and

the town’s contract with Citizens Energy Group, which shall include charges
assessed against the town by the water utility for effecting the termination.
The fee for terminating commercial and industrial services shall be determined
in an agreement between the town and the water company. These disconnect fees
shall be assessed against the customer and added to the sewer delinquent bill.
      (3)   The town may not terminate water service under this section, if the
County Health Department has found and certified to the town that the
termination of water service will endanger the health of the user and others in
the municipality.
      (4)   (a)   Prior to the termination of water service because of sewer
user fee delinquency, the town, or its designated representative, must first
give notice of the delinquency and impending termination at least 10 calendar
days prior to the proposed termination, by first class mail, addressed to the
user to whom the service is billed, which notice shall contain the following:
            1.   The delinquent amount due, together with any penalty and fees;
            2.   The date of the notice of termination;
            3.   The date on or after which termination shall be made;
            4.   Notice that water service may be disconnected if, prior to the
earliest possible date of termination given in the notice, the user does not
pay the delinquency, together with any penalty and fees, or disputes the
amount, or makes other provisions for payment pursuant to this section; and
            5.   A procedure, as provided in division (A)(4)(b) below for
resolving a disputed bill.
         (b)   The town Clerk-Treasurer shall serve as the account review
officer (ARO) to review and resolve disputes. Before the earliest possible date
of termination of water service as specified in the notice, a user may request
a hearing before the ARO to dispute the correctness of all or part of the
amount(s) shown in accordance with the provisions of this division (A). A user
shall not be entitled to dispute the correctness of all or part of an amount(s)
if all or part of the amount(s) was the subject of a previous dispute under
this division (A).
      (5)   The procedure for a hearing on a user dispute shall be as follows.
         (a)   Before the earliest possible date of termination as specified on
the notice of termination, the user shall notify the ARO in writing that he or
she requests a hearing to dispute the correctness of all or part of the amounts
shown on the notice of termination, stating as completely as possible the basis
for the dispute.
         (b)   An informal hearing before the ARO shall be held within 15 days
of the ARO’s receipt of the user’s written request for a hearing on a disputed
bill.
         (c)   At the hearing, the user shall be entitled to present all
evidence that is, in the ARO’s view, relevant and material to the dispute.
         (d)   Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, the ARO, within
ten days of the completion of the hearing, shall issue a written decision
formally resolving the dispute.
      (6)   The ARO shall be authorized to resolve any disputed sewage bill and
shall be authorized to order the termination of water service under appropriate
circumstances.
         (a)   Upon approval by the ARO, the user may enter into an agreement
to amortize the unpaid balance of his or her account over a reasonable period
of time, not to exceed six months.
         (b)   No termination shall be effected for any user complying with any
amortization agreement, provided the user also keeps current his or her account
for sewer service as charges accrue in each subsequent billing period.
         (c)   If a user fails to comply with an amortization agreement, the
ARO may terminate water service, provided written notice is given to the user
at least 48 hours prior to the termination, and the notice includes conditions
the user is required to meet to avoid termination.
      (7)   Utilization of this hearing procedure shall not relieve a user of
the obligation to timely and completely pay all other undisputed water and
sewer bills or charges. Failure to timely and completely pay all the undisputed
amounts shall subject the user to termination of service in accordance with the
provisions of this division (A).
      (8)   Until the date of the ARO’s decision, the town shall not terminate
water service of the user. If the ARO determines that the customer must pay

decision, shall notify the user of the following:
         (a)   The amount to be paid;
         (b)   The date on or after which services will be terminated; and

         (a)   A person who requests, either orally or in writing, water and/or
sewage service from the town or water utilities; and/or
         (b)   A person in whose name water and/or sewage service is billed for
the rendering of the service.
   (B)   Termination of services not exclusive remedy. The remedy provided
herein for the collection of delinquent sewer user charges or benefits shall
not be construed to abridge or in any manner interfere with the right and power
of the town to enforce a collection thereof by any other action or as otherwise
provided by statute.
   (C)   Procedure.

accounts.
      (3)   The annual schedule shall be submitted to the Town Council, which
by resolution may declare accounts listed in the schedule as uncollectible and
may authorize the town to cease further collection procedures and expense the
amounts outstanding on the accounts as bad debts.
      (4)   The annual schedule shall be prepared by the town and approved by
the resolution of the Sewer Board prior to being forwarded to the Town Council
for final approval. A sewer user account may be deemed uncollectible only if

following receipt (the “due date”) are hereby declared to be delinquent and a
penalty of 10% of the delinquent balance shall be added to the trash collection
fees due.
      (5)   Payments received from the sewer customer and/or storm water
customer shall be applied first to the trash collection services, second to
storm water utility fees and third to sewer utility fees.

This Stormwater Utility user fee rate is designed to recover and be able to pay
the cost of rendering stormwater service to the users of the stormwater system,
and shall be the basis for assessment of the town’s Stormwater Utility user
fee. This rate is established so as to maintain adequate fund reserves to
provide for reasonably expected variations in the cost of providing services,
as well as variation in the demand for services. This rate shall be evaluated
annually as to its sufficiency to satisfy the needs of the Stormwater Utility.
The following methods may be used to determine the non-residential user
factors:
      (1)   Computation of the impervious area using on-site measurements of
the apparent outside boundaries in or on such developed property made by the
town or on its behalf;
      (2)   Computation of the impervious area using the dimensions which are
set forth and contained in the records of the office of the County Assessor or
Vernon Township Assessor;
      (3)   Estimation, calculation and computation of the impervious area
using aerial photography or photogrammetry, or as contained in the records of
the town or county; or
      (4)   Computation of impervious area using data provided by the owner,
tenant or developer. The authorized official may require additional information
as necessary to make the determination.
   (D)   Residential erosion control plot plan review fees. It is hereby
acknowledged that Ord. 030805, the town’s Stormwater Management Ordinance, has
heretofore been duly passed, Ch. 6, § IV, of which provides for and requires
the review of individual lots within a permitted project. The charge for review
and inspection associated with the performance of said required review and
inspection shall be $35 per lot which shall be paid at the time of the
application for a building permit pertaining to said lot.
   (E)   Non-residential stormwater management ordinance compliance/inspection
fee. It is hereby acknowledged that Ord. 030805, the town’s Stormwater
Management Ordinance, has heretofore been duly passed, Ch. 6, § II, Permit
Procedures, are set forth the requirements deemed necessary to constitute
compliance with the town’s Stormwater Management Ordinance and inspection of
approved and installed infrastructure. Pursuant to Ch. 6, § VI, of the
aforementioned ordinance, the fee for
compliance review and inspection of the subject premises shall be $100, plus
$40 for each acre or part thereof constituting the proposed site. The total
amount of said fees shall be calculated as set forth in Ch. 6, § VI(B), and
shall be payable in accordance with said provision.
   (F)   All new or transferred accounts shall be charged a one-time
administrative set-up fee of $20. The one-time administrative set up fee of $20
shall not be charged to a developer of any subdivision, but shall instead be
charged to the person or entity purchasing a lot or parcel from the developer
at the time of the sale.  Furthermore an account may be reactivated by the
property owner without the payment of the one-time administrative set up fee of
$20.  As an incentive to encourage use of automated services offered by the
Sewer Utility, the following credits may be applied to the set-up fee. A credit
of $10 for set-up of automatic clearing house (ACH) monthly draft and a $5

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
§ 52.20  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Authority and title.
      (1)   This subchapter is adopted in accordance with statutory authority
granted under state statutes, and further is required by Phase II of the
national pollution discharge elimination system program (FR Doc. 99-29181)
authorized by the 1972 amendments to the Clean Water Act, the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management’s Rule 13 (327 I.A.C. 15-13), and the

   (B)   Applicability and exemptions.
      (1)   This subchapter shall regulate all development and redevelopment
occurring within the town. No building permit shall be issued and no land
disturbance started for any construction in a development, as defined in §§
52.21 and
52.22, until the plans required by this subchapter for the construction have
been accepted in writing by the Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer.
With the exception of the requirements of §§
52.24 and
52.28(D), single-family dwelling houses in accepted subdivisions, new buildings
(or cumulative building additions) with less than 500 square feet
of area, and land-disturbing activities affecting less than 10,000 square feet
of area shall be exempt from the requirements of this subchapter. Also exempt
from this subchapter shall be the agricultural land-disturbing activities.
      (2)   Town projects shall be exempt from obtaining permit, but are
expected to meet all applicable technical requirements of this subchapter and
the McCordsville Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
      (3)   Any construction project which has had its final drainage plan
accepted by the County Drainage Board within a two-year period prior to the
effective date of this subchapter shall be exempt from all requirements of this
subchapter that are in excess of the requirements of ordinances in effect at
the time of acceptance. Such an exemption is not applicable to the requirements
detailed in §
52.24.
      (4)   The Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer and/or the Town
Public Works Commissioner have the authority to modify, grant exemptions and/or
waive any and all the requirements of this subchapter and its associated
technical standards document. A pre-submittal meeting with the Town Drainage
Board and/or the Town Engineer and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner may be
requested by the applicant to discuss the applicability of various provisions
of this subchapter and the associated McCordsville Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual with regards to unique or unusual circumstances relating to a
project; however, any initial determination of the applicability shall not be
binding on future determinations of the Town Drainage Board and/or the Town
Engineer and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner that may be based on the
review of more detailed information and plans.
   (C)   Background.
      (1)   On December 8, 1999, Phase II of the national pollutant discharge
elimination system (NPDES) permit program, was published in the federal
register. The NPDES program, as authorized by the 1972 amendments to the Clean
Water Act, controls water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge
pollutants into waters of the United States. Phase II of NPDES requires permit
coverage for stormwater discharges from regulated small municipal separate
storm sewer systems (MS4s) and for small construction activity that results in
the disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre. This federal regulation
went into effect March 10, 2003. In response to Phase II of NPDES, the State
Department of Environmental Management enacted Rule 13 (327 I.A.C. 15-13) and
revised Rule 5 (327 I.A.C. 15-5).
      (2)   Under these new state and federal regulations, the town is required
to establish a regulatory mechanism for regulating stormwater quality
management. Therefore, the “Hancock County Sediment Control and Drainage
Ordinance” was replaced with this document to include stormwater quality in
addition to quantity.
   (D)   Findings. The Town Council finds that:
      (1)   Water bodies, roadways, structures and other property within, and
downstream of the town are at times subjected to flooding;
      (2)   Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is
also a danger to the natural resources of the region;
      (3)   Land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds,
resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, increased flooding,
increased stream channel erosion and increased sediment transport and
deposition;
      (4)   Soil erosion resulting from land-disturbing activities causes a
significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to be transported off-site
and deposited in ditches, streams, wetlands, lakes and reservoirs;
      (5)   Increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments
and pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development
projects within the town will, absent reasonable regulation and control,
adversely affect the town’s water bodies and water resources;
      (6)   Pollutant contributions from illicit discharges within the town
will, absent reasonable regulation, monitoring and enforcement adversely affect
the town’s water bodies and water resources;
      (7)   Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, non-point source pollution and
illicit sources of pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation
of stormwater management;
      (8)   Adopting the standards, criteria and procedures contained and
referenced in this subchapter and implementing the same will address many of
the deleterious effects of stormwater runoff and illicit discharges; and
      (9)   Adopting this subchapter is necessary for the preservation of the
public health, safety and welfare, for the conservation of our natural
resources and for compliance with state and federal regulations.
   (E)   Purpose. The purpose of this subchapter is to provide for the health,
safety and general welfare of the citizens of the town, through the regulation
of stormwater and non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system, and
to protect conserve and promote the orderly development of land and water
resources within the town.
      (1)   This subchapter establishes methods for managing the quantity and
quality of stormwater entering into the storm drain system in order to comply
with state and federal requirements.
      (2)   The objectives of this subchapter are:
         (a)   To reduce the hazard to public health and safety caused by
excessive stormwater runoff;
         (b)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain
system from construction site runoff;
         (c)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain
system from runoff from new development and re-development;
         (d)   To prohibit illicit discharges into the storm drain system; and
         (e)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection,
monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this
subchapter.
   (F)   Conflicting ordinances. The provisions of this subchapter shall be
deemed as additional requirements to minimum standards required by other town
ordinances, and as supplemental requirements to Indiana’s Rule 5 regarding
Stormwater Discharge Associated with Construction Activity, (327 I.A.C. 15-5),
and Indiana’s Rule 13 regarding Stormwater Runoff Associated with Municipal
Separate Storm Sewer System Conveyances (327 I.A.C. 15-13). In case of
conflicting requirements, the most restrictive shall apply.
   (G)   Interpretation. Words and phrases in this subchapter shall be
construed according to their common and accepted meanings, except that words
and phrases defined in §§
52.21 and
52.22, shall be construed according to the respective definitions given in that
section. Technical words and technical phrases that are not defined in this
subchapter but which have acquired particular meanings in law or in technical
usage shall be construed according to those meanings.
   (H)   Disclaimer of liability. The degree of protection required by this
subchapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
historical records, engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger storms
may occur or stormwater runoff amounts may be increased by human-made or
natural causes. This subchapter does not imply that land uses permitted will be
free from stormwater damage. This subchapter shall not create liability on the
part of Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer or any officer,
representative or employee thereof, for any damage which may result from
reliance on this subchapter or on any administrative decision lawfully made
there under.

shall be considered properly reported only if the discharger complies with all
the requirements of this section. This requirement does not relieve discharger
from notifying other entities as required by state or federal regulations.
   (G)   Inspections and monitoring.
      (1)   Storm drainage system. The Town Drainage Board and/or the Town
Engineer and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner has the authority to
periodically inspect the portion of the storm drainage system under the town’s
control, in an effort to detect and eliminate illicit connections and
discharges into the system. This inspection will include a screening of
discharges from outfalls connected to the system in order to determine if
prohibited flows are being conveyed into the storm drainage system. It could
also include spot testing of waters contained in the storm drainage system
itself to detect the introduction of pollutants into the system by means other
than a defined outfall, such as dumping or contaminated sheet runoff.
      (2)   Potential polluters. If, as a result of the storm drainage system
inspection, a discharger is suspected of an illicit discharge, the Town
Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer and/or the Town Public Works
Commissioner may inspect and/or obtain stormwater samples from stormwater
runoff facilities of the subject discharger, to determine compliance with the
requirements of this subchapter. Upon request, the discharger shall allow the
Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer and/or the Town Public Works
Commissioner’s properly identified representative to enter upon the premises of
the discharger at all hours necessary for the purposes of the inspection or
sampling. The Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer and/or the Town
Public Works Commissioner or its properly identified representative may place
on the discharger’s property the equipment or devices used for sampling or
inspection. Identified illicit connections or discharges shall be subject to
enforcement action as described in §
52.29.
      (3)   New development and re-development. Following the final completion
of construction and the receipt of as-built drawings in compliance with §

(Ord. 030805, passed - -2005)
§ 52.25  STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Applicability and exemptions. The storage and controlled release rate
of excess stormwater runoff shall be required for all new business, commercial
and industrial developments, residential subdivisions, planned development,
rural estate subdivisions and any redevelopment or other new construction
located within the town. The Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer,
after thorough investigation and evaluation, may waive the requirement of
controlled runoff for minor subdivisions and parcelization. Additional
exemptions regarding the detention requirements are provided under division (B)
(1)(e) below.
   (B)   Policy on stormwater quantity management.
      (1)   Detention policy. It is recognized that most streams and drainage
channels serving the town do not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey
stormwater runoff resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, except
for situations provided in divisions (B)(1)(c) and (d) below, the storage and
controlled release of excess stormwater runoff shall be required for all
developments and redevelopments (as defined in §
52.21) located within the town.
         (a)   General release rates. In general, the post-development release
rates for developments up to and including the ten-year return period storm may
not exceed 0.1 cfs per acre of development. The post-development release rate
for developments for the 11 to 100-year return period storms shall not exceed
0.3 cfs per acre of development. For sites where the pre-developed area has
more than one outlet, the release rate should be computed based on pre-
developed discharge to each outlet point. The computed release rate for each
outlet point shall not be exceeded at the respective outlet point even if the
post developed conditions would involve a different arrangement of outlet
points.
         (b)   Site-specific release rates for sites with depressional storage.
            1.   For sites where depressional storage exists, the general
release rates provided above may have to be further reduced. If depressional
storage exists at the site, site-specific release rates must be calculated
according to methodology described in the McCordsville Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual, accounting for the depressional storage by modeling it as a
pond whose outlet is a weir at an elevation that stormwater can currently
overflow the depressional storage area. Post developed release rate for sites
with depressional storage shall be the two-year pre-developed peak runoff rate
for the post-developed ten-year storm and ten-year pre-developed peak runoff
rate for the post-developed 100-year storm. In no case shall the calculated
site-specific release rates be larger than general release rates provided
above.
            2.   Also note that for determining the post-developed peak runoff
rate, the depressional storage must be assumed to be filled, unless the Town
Drainage Board and/or Town Engineer can be assured, through dedicated easement,
that the noted storage will be preserved in perpetuity.
         (c)   Management of off-site runoff.
            1.   Runoff from all upstream tributary areas (off-site land areas)
may be bypassed around the detention/retention facility without attenuation.
The runoff may also be bypassed through the detention/retention facility
without attenuation, provided that a separate outlet system or channel is
incorporated for the safe passage of the flows, i.e., not through the primary
outlet of a detention facility. Unless the pond is being designed as a regional
detention facility, the primary outlet structure shall be sized and the invert
elevation of the emergency overflow weir determined according to the on-site
runoff only. Once the size and location of primary outlet structure and the
invert elevation of the emergency overflow weir are determined by considering
on-site runoff, the 100-year pond elevation is determined by routing the entire
inflow, on-site and off-site, through the pond.
            2.   Note that the efficiency of the detention/retention facility
in controlling the on-site runoff may be severely affected if the off-site area
is considerably larger than the on-site area. As a general guidance, on-line
detention may not be effective in controlling on-site runoff where the ratio of
off-site area to on-site area is larger than 5.1. Additional detention (above
and beyond that required for on-site area) may be required by the Town Drainage
Board and/or Town Engineer when the ratio of off-site area to on-site area is
larger than 5:1.
         (d)   Downstream restrictions.
            1.   In the event the downstream receiving channel or storm sewer
system is inadequate to accommodate the post-developed release rate provided
above, then the allowable release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted
by the capacity of the receiving downstream channel or storm sewer system.
Additional detention, as determined by the Town Drainage Board and/or Town
Engineer, shall be required to store that portion of the runoff exceeding the
capacity of the receiving sewers or watercourses. When the downstream
restrictions are suspected, the Town Drainage Board and/or Town Engineer may
require additional analysis to determine the receiving system’s limiting
downstream capacity.
            2.   If the proposed development makes up only a portion of the
undeveloped watershed upstream of the limiting restriction, the allowable
release rate for the development shall be in direct proportion to the ratio of
its drainage area to the drainage area of the entire watershed upstream of the
restriction.
         (e)   Exemptions for detention requirements. Detention will not be
required for the following:
            1.   Notwithstanding the requirements for an individual lot plot
plan permit in this subchapter, land alterations where the primary basis on
which a stormwater drainage permit is required is the construction, enlargement
or location (on a permanent foundation) of a one-family dwelling, two-family
dwelling or accessory structure appurtenant to either a one- or two-family
dwelling;
            2.   Accepted fill areas or one-time addition to existing
commercial buildings that do not increase the amount of impervious area on-site
by more than a total of 0.5 acres, provided the existing runoff patterns and
flow capacity within the property will not be altered by the filling
operations;
            3.   Not withstanding the provisions of division (B)(1)(d) above,
those site developments where the stormwater management system has been
designed so that:
               a.   After combining flows from both the off-site and on-site
drainage areas, there will be no increase in the total peak discharge from the
developing site during the two-, ten- and 100-year storm events;
               b.   The volume of runoff for each project site outlet has not
been increased for the two-, ten- and 100-year storm events; and
               c.   The flow width and velocity at the property boundary line
for each sub-basin is less than or equal to that flow width and velocity which
existed prior to the development for the two-, ten- and 100-year storm events.
            4.   Where the direct release of runoff from the proposed
development meets the conditions set forth in division (B)(1)(f) below.
         (f)   Direct release provisions. It is the policy of the Town Drainage
Board and/or the Town Engineer to not allow the direct release (no detention)
of runoff from a proposed development to an adjacent stream since there is no
large watershed area (more than 100 square miles) of contributing drainage area
in any of the watersheds within the town.
      (2)   Grading and building pad elevations.
         (a)   Maximum yard slopes are 3:1 where soil has been disturbed during
construction processes. Finished floor elevation must be no less than six
inches above finished grade and a minimum of 15 inches above an adjacent road
elevation unless a written variance is granted by the Town Drainage Board.
         (b)   For all structures located in the special flood hazards area
(SFHA) as shown on the FEMA maps, the lowest floor elevations of all
residential, commercial or industrial buildings, shall be such that lowest
floor elevation, including basement, shall be at the flood protection grade and
therefore have two feet of freeboard above the 100-year flood elevation.
         (c)   The lowest adjacent grade for residential, commercial or
industrial buildings outside a FEMA or IDNR designated floodplain shall have
two feet of freeboard above the flooding source’s 100-year flood elevation
under proposed conditions, unless the flooding source is a rear-yard swale.
When the flooding source is a rear-yard swale, the lowest adjacent grade for
residential, commercial or industrial buildings shall have two feet of
freeboard above the 100-year flood elevation under proposed conditions or be
separated by a minimum distance of 50 feet from the proposed-condition 100-year
flood boundary.
         (d)   For areas outside a FEMA or IDNR designated floodplain, the
lowest adjacent grade (including walkout basement floor elevation) for all
residential, commercial or industrial buildings adjacent to ponds shall be set
a minimum of two feet above the 100-year pond elevation or two feet above the
emergency overflow weir elevation, whichever is higher. In addition to the
lowest adjacent grade requirements, any basement floor must be at least a foot
above the permanent water level (normal pool elevation).
         (e)   The 100-year flow paths throughout the development, whether
shown on FEMA maps or not, must be shown as hatched area on the plans and 30
feet along the centerline of the flow path contained within permanent drainage
easements.
            1.   A statement shall be added to the plat that would refer the
viewer to the construction plans to see the entire extent of overflow path as
hatched areas.
            2.   No fences or landscaping can be constructed within the
easement areas that may impede the free flow of stormwater. These areas are to
be maintained by the property owners or be designated as common areas that are
to be maintained by the homeowners association.
            3.   The lowest adjacent grade for all residential, commercial or
industrial buildings shall be set a minimum of one foot above the noted
overflow path/ponding elevation.
         (f)   It shall be the property owners’ responsibility to maintain the
natural features on their lots and to take preventive measures against any and
all erosion and/or deterioration of natural or human- made features on their
lots.
      (3)   Acceptable outlet and adjoining property impacts policies.
         (a)   Design and construction of the stormwater facility shall provide
for the discharge of the stormwater runoff from off-site land areas as well as
the stormwater from the area being developed (on-site land areas) to an
acceptable outlet(s) (as determined by the Town Drainage Board and/or Town
Engineer and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner) having capacity to receive
upstream (off-site) and on-site drainage. The flow path from the development
outfall(s) to a regulated drain or natural watercourse (as determined by the
Town Drainage Board and/or Town Engineer and/or the Town Public Works
Commissioner) shall be provided on an exhibit that includes topographic
information. Any existing field tile encountered during the construction shall
also be incorporated into the proposed stormwater drainage system or tied to an
acceptable outlet.
         (b)   Where the outfall from the stormwater drainage system of any
development flows through real estate owned by others prior to reaching a
regulated drain or watercourse, no acceptance shall be granted for the drainage
system until all owners of real estate and/or tenants crossed by the outfall
consent in writing to the use of their real estate through a recorded easement.
In addition, no activities conducted as part of the development shall be
allowed to obstruct the free flow of flood waters from an upstream property.
         (c)   If an adequate outlet is not located on site, then off-site
drainage improvements may be required. Those improvements may include, but are
not limited to, extending storm sewers, clearing, dredging and/or removal of
obstructions to open drains or natural watercourses, and the removal or
replacement of undersized culvert pipes as required by the Town Drainage Board
and/or Town Engineer and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner.
      (4)   No net loss floodplain storage policy.
         (a)   Floodplains exist adjacent to all natural and human-made
streams, regardless of contributing drainage area or whether they have been
previously identified or mapped. Due to potential impacts of floodplain loss on
peak flows in streams and on the environment, disturbance to floodplains should
be avoided. When the avoidance of floodplain disturbance is not practical, the
natural functions of floodplain should be preserved to the extent possible.
         (b)   In an attempt to strike a balance between the legitimate need
for economic development within the town and the need to preserve the natural
functions of floodplains to the extent possible, compensatory excavation
equivalent to the floodplain storage lost shall be required for all activities
within floodplain of streams located in the town where drainage area of the
stream is equal or larger than one square mile. This requirement shall be
considered to be above and beyond the minimum requirements provided in the
applicable flood hazard areas ordinance currently in effect in the town. The
Town Drainage Board and/or Town Engineer may alter the compensation ratio,
based on extenuating circumstances, for a specific project.
         (c)   Note that by definition, COMPENSATORY STORAGE is the replacement
of the existing floodplain and, in rare exceptions, the floodway storage lost
due to fill. Compensatory storage is required when a portion of the floodplain
is filled, occupied by a structure or when as a result of a project a change in
the channel hydraulics occurs that reduces the existing available floodplain
storage. The compensatory storage should be located adjacent or opposite the
placement of the fill and maintain an unimpeded connection to an adjoining
floodplain area.
         (d)   Computations must show no net loss of floodplain storage for
two-year, ten-year, 50-year and 100-year storm events. That is, the post-
development two-year floodplain storage along a stream shall be the same as
two-year pre-development floodplain storage along the stream within the
property limits, the post-development ten-year floodplain storage along a
stream shall be the same as ten-year pre-development floodplain storage along
the stream within the property limits, and so on.
         (e)   Calculations for floodplain volume shall be submitted in tabular
form showing calculations by cross-section. The volume of floodplain storage
under the without-project conditions and the with-project conditions should be
determined using the average-end-area method with plotted cross-sections at a
horizontal to vertical ratio of between 5:1 and 10:1, with two- through 100-
year flood elevations noted on each cross-section. The scale chosen should be
large enough to show the intent of proposed grading. Cross-sections should
reflect both the existing and proposed conditions on the same plot. The
location and extent of the compensatory storage area as well as the location
and orientation of cross-sections should be shown on the grading plan.
   (C)   Calculations and design standards and specifications. The calculation
methods as well as the type, sizing and placement of all stormwater facilities
shall meet the design criteria, standards and specifications outlined in the
McCordsville Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. The methods and procedures
in the Stormwater Technical Standards Manual are consistent with the policy
stated above.
   (D)   Drainage easement requirements. There shall be no trees or shrubs
planted, nor any structures or fences erected in any drainage easement, unless
otherwise accepted by the Town Drainage Board and/or Town Engineer and/or the
Town Public Works Commissioner. All stormwater systems, including detention or
retention basins, conveyance systems, structures and appurtenances, located
outside of the right-of-way may be incorporated into the town’s system at the
discretion of the Town Drainage Board and/or Town Engineer and/or the Town
Public Works Commissioner. The developer shall petition to incorporate the
storm system into the town’s system. The stormwater management permit shall not
be approved until the petition is submitted in a form accepted by the Town
Drainage Board and/or Town Engineer and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner.
The following specific areas shall be included in a petition.
      (1)   Subdivisions.
         (a)   All new channels, drain tiles equal to or greater than eight
inches in diameter, inlet and outlet structures of detention and retention
ponds, and appurtenances thereto as required by this chapter, that are
installed in subdivisions requiring a stormwater management permit from the
town shall be petitioned by the project site owner to become incorporated into
the town’s system upon completion, proper inspection, and acceptance by the
Town Drainage Board and/or Town Engineer and/or the Town Public Works
Commissioner. New drain tiles refer to all sub-surface stormwater piping,
tubing, tiles, manholes, inlets, catch basins, risers and the like.
         (b)   New drain tile, eight inches to 24 inches in diameter, shall be
placed in a minimum 20-foot easement (ten feet from centerline on each side)
and shall be designated on the record plat as 20-foot regulated drain easement
(RDE). Pipes that are 24 inches or larger in diameter shall be placed in a 30-
foot easement (15 feet from centerline on each side) and shall be designated on
the record plat as 30-foot regulated drain easement. Wider easements may be
required by Town Drainage Board and/or Town Engineer when the depth of pipe is
greater than six to ten feet, depending on the pipe size.
         (c)   A minimum of 25 feet from top of the bank on each side of a new
channel shall be designated on the record plat as a drainage easement.
         (d)   Rear-yard swales and emergency overflow paths associated with
detention ponds shall not be included in petition for incorporation; however, a
minimum of 30 feet width (15 feet from centerline on each side) needs to be
designated as drainage easement.
         (e)   A minimum of 30 feet beyond the actual footprint (top of the
bank) of stormwater detention facilities shall be designated as drainage
easement. A minimum 30-foot width easement shall also be required as access
easement unless the pond is immediately next to a public right-of-way.
         (f)   The statutory 75-foot (each side) drainage easement for
regulated drains already within the town’s system may be reduced if the drain
is re-classified by the Town Drainage Board as an urban drain.
         (g)   If the Town Drainage Board and/or Town Engineer accepts the
petition for incorporation into their system, the following statement shall
become part of the restrictive covenants of every platted subdivision and shown
on the recorded plat: “Channels, tile drains eight inches or larger, inlets and
outlets of detention and retention ponds, and appurtenances thereto within
designated drain easements are extensions of the town’s stormwater drainage
system, and are the responsibility of the Town Drainage Board and/or the Town
Public Works Commissioner. Drainage swales and tile drains less than eight
inches in inside diameter shall be the responsibility of the property owner or
homeowner association”.
         (h)   The following statement shall be put on each subdivision plat:
“A petition addressed to the Town Drainage Board has been filed in duplicate
with the Town Engineer, requesting that the subdivision’s storm drainage system
and its easements be accepted into the regulated drainage system. The storm
drainage system and its easements that are accepted into the regulated drainage
system are delineated on the plat as regulated drainage easements (RDEs).
Regulated drainage easements are stormwater easements and drainage rights-of-
way that are hereby dedicated to the public and to McCordsville, Indiana, for
the sole and exclusive purpose of controlling surface water and/or for the
installation, operation and maintenance of storm sewers and tile drains as
defined in the McCordsville Stormwater Management Ordinance (code §
52.21). These drainage easements are established under authority of the Indiana
Drainage Code and the Board may exercise powers and duties as provided in the
code. All other storm drainage easements have not been accepted into the town’s
system. All drainage improvements performed relative to the conveyance of
stormwater runoff and the perpetual maintenance thereof, within the latter
easements, shall be the responsibility of the owner or homeowner association.
The Town Drainage Board assumes no responsibility relative to the improvements
or the maintenance thereof. This subdivision contains linear feet of open
ditches and linear feet of subsurface drains that will be included in the
town’s regulated drainage system.” The noted regulated drain lengths, broken
down by the length of open and tile drains, shall also be shown in tabular form
in a prominent position on the plat. Any crossing and/or encroachment of a
drainage easement requires application and acceptance from the Town Engineer
and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner.
      (2)   Non-subdivisions. Where the Town Drainage Board and/or the Town
Public Works Commissioner is responsible for maintenance of the drainage
system, drainage easements of 75 feet from the top of bank on each side of the
channel or each side of the tile centerline must be dedicated to the town. In
addition, a minimum of 25-foot width of vegetative fitter strip must be
provided and maintained along top-of-bank, on each side, by the applicant
within these easements.
      (3)   Establishment of new regulated drain. When the Town Drainage Board
and/or Town Engineer and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner determines it is
necessary to establish a new regulated drain, each developer shall provide the
necessary information and meet the requirements of the 1965 State Drainage
Code, being I.C. 36-9-27-1 et seq., as amended, for the establishment of a new
regulated drain. Necessary easements for adequate maintenance of any new
regulated drain shall be determined by the Town Engineer and/or the Town Public
Works Commissioner if not already established in this subchapter.
      (4)   Municipalities and schools. All new channels, swales, drain tiles,
inlet and outlet structures of detention and retention ponds, and appurtenances
thereto as required by this chapter, that are installed on the municipal or
school property will be maintained, repaired and constructed by the entity and
will not become regulated drains. The design must meet the standards of this
subchapter for sizing and installation. Any off-site portion of the drainage
system must be within easements and have clearly defined maintenance agreements
between the property owner and the municipality and/or school.
   (E)   Placement of utilities. No utility company may disturb existing storm
drainage facilities without the consent of the Town Drainage Board and/or Town
Engineer and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner, whose decision may be
appealed to the Town Council. All existing drainage facilities shall have
senior rights and damage to the facilities shall result in penalties as
prescribed in §
52.29.
   (F)   Structures near regulated drains. For regulated drains not located in
platted subdivisions, unless otherwise accepted by the Town Drainage Board and/
or the Town Public Works Commissioner, no permanent structure (including
fences) shall be erected within 75 feet measured at right angles from: the
existing top edge of each bank of a regulated open drain, as determined by the
Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner; or the
centerline of a tiled regulated drain. The State Drainage Code may be consulted
for further details.
   (G)   Inspection, maintenance, record-keeping and reporting.
      (1)   After the approval of the stormwater management permit by the Town
Drainage Board and the commencement of construction activities, the Town
Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer and/or the Town Public Works
Commissioner has the authority to conduct inspections of the work being done to
ensure full compliance with the provisions of this section, the Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual and the terms and conditions of the approved permit.
      (2)   The Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer and/or the Town
Public Works Commissioner also have the authority to perform long-term, post-
construction inspection of all public or privately owned stormwater quantity
facilities.
         (a)   The inspection will cover physical conditions, available storage
capacity and the operational condition of key facility elements.
         (b)   Stormwater quantity facilities shall be maintained in good
condition, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the approved
stormwater management permit and shall not be subsequently altered, revised or
replaced except in accordance with the approved stormwater permit or in
accordance with approved amendments or revisions to the permit.
         (c)   If deficiencies are found during the inspection, the owner of
the facility will be notified by Town Drainage Board and/or Town Engineer and/
or the Town Public Works Commissioner and will be required to take all
necessary measures to correct the deficiencies.
         (d)   If the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the
allowed time period, as specified in the notification letter, the Town Drainage
Board and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner will undertake the work and
collect all cost to collect the deficiencies and attorney’s fees from the
owner, using lien rights if necessary.
         (e)   Assignment of responsibility for maintaining facilities serving
more than one lot or holding shall be documented by appropriate covenants to
property deeds, unless responsibility is formally accepted by a public body,
and determined before the final stormwater permit is approved.
         (f)   Stormwater detention/retention basins may be donated to the town
or other unit of government designated by the Town Drainage Board and/or the
Town Public Works Commissioner, for ownership and permanent maintenance
providing the Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner or
other governmental unit is willing to accept responsibility.
(Ord. 030805, passed - -2005)
§ 52.26  STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION FOR CONSTRUCTION SITES.
   (A)   Applicability and exemptions.
      (1)   The Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer and/or the Town
Public Works Commissioner will require a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWPPP), which includes erosion and sediment control measures and materials
handling procedures, to be submitted as part of the construction plans and
specifications. Any project located within the town that includes clearing,
grading, excavation and other land-disturbing activities, resulting in the
disturbance of one acre or more of total land area, is subject to the
requirements of this chapter. This includes both new development and
redevelopment. This section also applies to disturbances of less than one acre,
of land that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the
larger common plan will ultimately disturb one or more acres of land, within
the MS4 area. Division (C) below provides guidelines for calculating land
disturbance. Projects meeting the coverage requirements of 327 I.A.C. 15-5
(Rule 5) shall also be in compliance with 327 I.A.C. 15-5.
      (2)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the following
activities:
         (a)   Agricultural land-disturbing activities; or
         (b)   Forest harvesting activities.
      (3)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures:
         (a)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 I.A.C. 10;
         (b)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34; and
         (c)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste
pursuant to a permit issued by the State Department of Environmental Management
under 329 I.A.C. 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including
the expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either
within or outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
      (4)   For an individual lot where land disturbance is expected to be one
acre or more, the individual lot owner must complete his or her own notice of
intent letter, apply for a stormwater permit from the Town Drainage Board, and
ensure that a sufficient construction and stormwater pollution prevention plan
is completed and submitted in accordance with §
52.28, regardless of whether the individual lot is part of a larger permitted
project site.
      (5)   An individual lot with land disturbance less than one acre, located
within a larger permitted project site, is considered part of the larger
permitted project site, and the individual lot operator must comply with the
terms and conditions of the stormwater permit approved for the larger project
site. The stormwater permit application for the larger project site must
include detailed erosion and sediment control measures for individual lots. In
addition, these individual lots are required to submit individual lot plot plan
permit applications prior to receiving a building permit. Details of the
permitting process are contained in §
52.28.
      (6)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete
a stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan
is completed and submitted to Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer and/
or the Town Public Works Commissioner in accordance with §
52.28. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure
compliance with this subchapter during the construction activity and
implementation of the construction plan, and to notify the Town Drainage Board
and/or the Town Engineer and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner with a
sufficient notice of termination letter upon completion of the project and
stabilization of the site; however, all persons engaging in construction and
land-disturbing activities on a permitted project site meeting the
applicability requirements must comply with the requirements of this section
and this subchapter.
   (B)   Policy on stormwater pollution prevention. Effective stormwater
pollution prevention on construction sites is dependent on a combination of
preventing movement of soil from its original position (erosion control),
intercepting displaced soil prior to entering a waterbody (sediment control)
and proper on-site materials handling. The developer must submit to the Town
Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer and/or the Town Public Works
Commissioner, a SWPPP with detailed erosion and sediment control plans, as well
as a narrative describing materials handling and storage, and construction
sequencing. The following principles apply to all land-disturbing activities
and should be considered in the preparation of a Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan within the town.
      (1)   Minimize the potential for soil erosion by designing a development
that fits the topography and soils of the site. Deep cuts and fills in areas
with steep slopes should be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours
should be followed as closely as possible.
      (2)   Existing natural vegetation should be retained and protected
wherever possible. Areas immediately adjacent (within 35 feet of top of bank)
to watercourses and lakes also should be left undisturbed wherever possible.
Un-vegetated or vegetated areas with less than 70% cover that are scheduled or
likely to be left inactive for 15 days or more must be temporarily or
permanently stabilized with measures appropriate for the season to reduce
erosion potential. Alternative measures to site stabilization may be acceptable
if the project site owner or his or her representative can demonstrate they
have implemented and maintained erosion and sediment control measures adequate
to prevent sediment discharge from the inactive area.
      (3)   All activities on a site should be conducted in a logical sequence
so that the smallest practical area of land will be exposed for the shortest
practical period of time during development.
      (4)   The length and steepness of designed slopes should be minimized to
reduce erosion potential. Drainage channels and swales must be designed and
adequately protected so that their final gradients and resultant velocities
will not cause erosion in the receiving channel or at the outlet methods for
determining acceptable velocities are included Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual.
      (5)   Sediment-laden water which otherwise would flow from the project
site shall be treated by erosion and sediment control measures appropriate to
minimize sedimentation. A stable construction site access shall be provided at
all points of construction traffic ingress and egress to the project site.
      (6)   Appropriate measures shall be implemented to prevent wastes or
unused building materials, including, garbage, debris, packaging material,
fuels and petroleum products, hazardous materials or wastes, cleaning wastes,
wastewater, concrete truck washout and other substances from being carried from
a project site by runoff or wind. Identification of areas where concrete truck
washout is permissible must be clearly posted at appropriate areas of the site.
Wastes and unused building materials shall be managed and disposed of in
accordance with all applicable state statutes and regulations. Proper storage
and handling of materials, such as fuels or hazardous wastes, and spill
prevention and cleanup measures shall be implemented to minimize the potential
for pollutants to contaminate surface or ground water or degrade soil quality.
      (7)   Public or private roadways shall be kept cleared of accumulated
sediment that is a result of runoff or tracking. Bulk clearing of accumulated
sediment shall not include flushing the area with water. Cleared sediment shall
be redistributed or disposed of in a manner that is in accordance with all
applicable statutes and regulations.
      (8)   Collected runoff leaving a project site must be either discharged
directly into a well-defined, stable receiving channel or diffused and released
to adjacent property without causing an erosion or pollutant problem to the
adjacent property owner.
      (9)   Natural features, including wetlands, shall be protected from
pollutants associated with stormwater runoff.
   (C)   Calculations and design standards and specifications. In calculating
the total area of land disturbance, for the purposes of determining
applicability of this section to the project the following guidelines should be
used.
      (1)   Off-site construction activities that provide services (for
example, road extensions, sewer, water and other utilities) to a land-
disturbing project site, must be considered as a part of the total land
disturbance calculation for the project site, when the activity is under the
control of the project site owner.
      (2)   Strip developments will be considered as one project site and must
comply with this section, unless the total combined disturbance on all
individual lots is less than one acre and is not part of a larger common plan
of development or sale.
      (3)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by this rule,
the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the total area of
land disturbance for improvements, such as, roads, utilities or common areas,
and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as determined by the
following.
         (a)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
one-half acre or more, one-half acre of land disturbance must be used as the
expected lot disturbance.
         (b)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
less than one half acre in size, the total lot must be calculated as being
disturbed.
         (c)   To calculate lot disturbance on all other types of projects
sites, such as industrial and commercial projects project sites, a minimum of
one acre of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance,
unless the lots are less than one acre in size, in which case the total lot
must be calculated as being disturbed.
      (4)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing and placement
of all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction sites shall
meet the design criteria, standards and specifications outlined in the Indiana
Stormwater Quality Manual or the McCordsville Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual. The methods and procedures included in these two references are in
keeping with the above stated policy and meet the requirements of IDEM’s Rule
5.
   (D)   Inspection, maintenance, record keeping and reporting. Following
approval of the stormwater management permit by the Town Drainage Board and
commencement of construction activities, the Town Drainage Board and/or the
Town Engineer and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner has the authority to
conduct inspections of the site to ensure full compliance with the provisions
of this section, the McCordsville Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, the
Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual and the terms and conditions of the approved
permit.
      (1)   A self-monitoring program must be implemented by the project site
owner to ensure the stormwater pollution prevention plan is working
effectively. A trained individual, acceptable to Town Drainage Board and/or the
Town Engineer and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner, shall perform a
written evaluation of the project site by the end of the next business day
following each measurable storm event. If there are no measurable storm events
within a given week, the site should be monitored at least once in that week.
Weekly inspections by the trained individual shall continue until the entire
site has been stabilized and a notice of termination has been issued. The
trained individual should look at the maintenance of existing stormwater
pollution prevention measures, including erosion and sediment control measures,
drainage structures and construction materials storage/containment facilities,
to ensure they are functioning properly. The trained individual should also
identify additional measures, beyond those originally identified in the
stormwater pollution prevention plan, necessary to remain in compliance with
all applicable statutes and regulations.
      (2)   The resulting evaluation reports must include the name of the
individual performing the evaluation, the date of the evaluation, problems
identified at the project site, and details of maintenance, additional measures
and corrective actions recommended and completed.
      (3)   The stormwater pollution prevention plan shall serve as a guideline
for stormwater quality, but should not be interpreted to be the only basis for
implementation of stormwater quality measures for a project site. The project
site owner is responsible for implementing, in accordance with this section,
all measures necessary to adequately prevent polluted stormwater runoff.
Recommendations by the trained individual for modified stormwater quality
measures should be implemented.
      (4)   Although self-monitoring reports do not need to be submitted to the
Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer and/or the Town Public Works
Commissioner has the right to request complete records of maintenance and
monitoring activities involving stormwater pollution prevention measures. All
evaluation reports for the project site must be made available to Town Drainage
Board and/or the Town Engineer and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner, in an
organized fashion, within 48 hours upon request.
(Ord. 030805, passed - -2005)
§ 52.27  QUALITY MANAGEMENT FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   Applicability and exemptions.
      (1)   In addition to the requirements of §
52.26, the stormwater pollution prevention plan, which is to be submitted to
the Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer and/or the Town Public Works
Commissioner as part of the stormwater management permit application, must also
include post-construction stormwater quality measures. These measures are
incorporated as a permanent feature into the site plan and are left in place
following completion of construction activities to continuously treat
stormwater runoff from the stabilized site. Any project located within the town
that includes clearing, grading, excavation and other land-disturbing
activities, resulting in the disturbance of one acre or more of total land
area, is subject to the requirements of this chapter. This includes both new
development and re-development and disturbances of less than one acre of land
that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger
common plan will ultimately disturb one or more acres of land, within the MS4
area.
      (2)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the following
activities:
         (a)   Agricultural land-disturbing activities;
         (b)   Forest harvesting activities;
         (c)   Construction activities associated with a single-family
residential dwelling disturbing less than five acres, when the dwelling is not
part of a larger common plan of development or sale;
         (d)   Single-family residential developments consisting of four or
less lots;

      (3)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures:
         (a)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 I.A.C. § 10;
         (b)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34; or
         (c)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste
pursuant to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management under 329 I.A.C. § 10 that contains equivalent stormwater
requirements, including the expansion of landfill boundaries and construction
of new cells either within or outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
      (4)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete
a stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan
is completed and submitted to the Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer
and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner in accordance with §
52.28. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure proper
construction and installation of all stormwater BMP in compliance with this
subchapter and with the approved stormwater management permit, and to notify
the Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer and/or the Town Public Works
Commissioner with a sufficient notice of termination letter upon completion of
the project and stabilization of the site; however, all eventual property
owners of stormwater quality facilities meeting the applicability requirements
must comply with the requirements of this chapter and this subchapter.
   (B)   Policy on stormwater quality management.
      (1)   It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to undeveloped
areas, generally have increased imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates,
increased runoff rates and increased concentrations of pollutants such as
fertilizers, herbicides, greases, oil, salts and other pollutants. As new
development and re-development continues in the town, measures must be taken to
intercept and filter pollutants from stormwater runoff prior to reaching
regional creeks, streams and rivers. Through the use of Best Management
Practices (BMP), stormwater runoff will be filtered and harmful amounts of
sediment nutrients, and contaminants will be removed. The town has adopted a
policy that the control of stormwater quality will be based on the management
of total suspended solids (TSS).
      (2)   The project site owner must submit to the Town Drainage Board and/
or the Town Engineer and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner, a Stormwater
Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) that would show placement of appropriate BMP
from a pre-approved list of BMP specified in the McCordsville Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual.
         (a)   The noted BMP must be designed, constructed and maintained
according to guidelines provided or referenced in the McCordsville Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual.
         (b)   Practices other than those specified in the pre-approved list
may be utilized; however, the burden of proof, as to whether the performance
(minimum 80% TSS removal) and ease of maintenance of those practices will be
according to guidelines provided in the McCordsville Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual, would be placed with the applicant.
         (c)   Details regarding the procedures and criteria for consideration
of acceptance of the BMP are provided in the McCordsville Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual.
      (3)   Gasoline outlets and refueling areas must install appropriate
practices to reduce lead, copper, zinc and hydrocarbons in stormwater runoff.
These requirements will apply to all new facilities and existing facilities
that replace their tanks.
   (C)   Calculations and design standards and specifications.
      (1)   Calculation of land disturbance should follow the guidelines
discussed in §
52.26(C).
      (2)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing and placement
of all stormwater quality management measures, or BMP shall meet the design
criteria, standards and specifications outlined in the Indiana Stormwater
Quality Manual or the McCordsville Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. The
methods and procedures included in these two references are in keeping with the
above stated policy and meet the requirements of IDEM’s Rule 13.
   (D)   Easement requirements.
      (1)   All stormwater quality management systems, including detention or
retention basins, filler strips, pocket wetlands, in-line filters, infiltration
systems, conveyance systems, structures and appurtenances located outside of
the right-of-way shall be incorporated into permanent easements. For
developments occurring outside the town’s limits and/or at the discretion of
the Town Engineer and/or the Town Drainage Board, the developer shall petition
to establish the noted system as a portion of regulated drain pursuant to the
provisions of I.C. 36-9-27-54, and the drainage plan shall not be accepted
until the petition is submitted in a form accepted by the Town Engineer and the
Town Drainage Board.
      (2)   For the purposes of monitoring, inspection and general maintenance
activities, the petition should include a 30-foot wide perimeter beyond the
actual footprint of the stormwater quality management facility.
   (E)   Inspection, maintenance, record keeping and reporting.
      (1)   After the approval of the stormwater management permit by the Town
Drainage Board and the commencement of construction activities, the Town
Drainage Board and/or Town Engineer and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner
has the authority to conduct inspections of the work being done to ensure full
compliance with the provisions of this chapter, the McCordsville Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual, the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual and the terms
and conditions of the approved permit.
      (2)   Stormwater quality facilities shall be maintained in good
condition, in accordance with the operation and maintenance procedures and
schedules listed in the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual or the McCordsville
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and the terms and conditions of the
approved stormwater permit and shall not be subsequently altered, revised or
replaced except in accordance with the approved stormwater permit or in
accordance with approved amendments or revisions in the permit. Following
construction completion, inspection and maintenance of stormwater quality
facilities shall be the long-term responsibility of the Town Drainage Board
and/or the Town Engineer and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner. Stormwater
detention/retention basins may be donated to the town or other unit of
government designated by the Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Public Works
Commissioner, for ownership and permanent maintenance providing the Town
Drainage Board and/or the Town Public Works Commissioner or other governmental
unit is willing to accept responsibility.
      (3)   The Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer and/or the Town
Public Works Commissioner also has the authority to perform long-term, post-
construction inspection of all public or privately owned stormwater quality
facilities. The inspections will follow the operation and maintenance
procedures included in the McCordsville Stormwater Technical Standards Manual
and/or permit application for each specific BMP. The inspection will cover
physical conditions, available water quality storage capacity and the
operational condition of key facility elements. Noted deficiencies and
recommended corrective action will be included in an inspection report.

   (B)   Permit procedures.
      (1)   This section applies to all development, or re-development of land,
that results in land disturbance of one acre or more. Individual lots with land
disturbance less than one acre that are developed within a larger permitted
project site, should refer to division (D) below for plan review requirements
and procedures.
      (2)   Figure 1 in division (J) below is a flowchart summarizing the plan
review/permit approval process and can be found at the end of this chapter. For
projects located within the MS4 area boundary, as shown in division (K) below,
the project site owner shall submit an application for a stormwater management
permit to the Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer. The application
will include an initial notice of intent letter (NOI) that would also act as
the permit application form, proof of public notice, construction plan sheets,
stormwater drainage technical report, a stormwater pollution prevention plan,
and any other necessary support information. Specific information to be
included in the application can be found in division (C) below. Four copies of
each application must be submitted to the Town Drainage Board and/or the Town
Engineer. Additionally, a digital copy of the construction plans is required in
a format accepted by the Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer.
      (3)   After the Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer receive the
application, the applicant will be notified as to whether his or her
application was complete or insufficient. The applicant will be asked for
additional information if the application is insufficient. If the application
is complete, the Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer will forward one
copy of the application to the Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) for
its review and comment within a ten-day period. The remaining three copies will
be reviewed in detail by the Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer and/
or its plan review consultants). Once all comments have been received and
review completed, the Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer will either
accept the project request modifications, or place the project on the agenda of
the next scheduled meeting of the Town Drainage Board. If the project must go
through a scheduled meeting, the Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer
will furnish the applicant a complete list of comments and objections to the
plans and accompanying data prior to the scheduled meeting. After the scheduled
meeting, the Town Drainage Board will either issue a permit, or request
modifications to the construction plans.
      (4)   Any person to which this subchapter applies may request a variance
from the provisions of this subchapter in writing and mailed certified mail
return receipt requested to the Town Drainage Board c/o the Town Hall. The
request shall identify the provision(s) of the subchapter from which the
applicant requests the variance and a detailed statement as to the basis for
the request. Written notice of the date, time and location at which the
variance request will be considered by the Town Drainage Board shall be mailed
to the applicant by the Board. At that date, time and location or any other
date, time or location as established by the Town Drainage Board, the variance
may be considered whereupon a decision to deny, grant or grant in part the
variance being requested, will be made. The Town Drainage Board may consider
the recommendations and comments of the Town Engineer and/or the Town Public
Works Commissioner, as well as the comments of the applicant or any other
person(s) having knowledge of information pertinent to the variance request.
      (5)   The Town Drainage Board may grant, in whole or in part, a variance
from the terms of this subchapter, but only upon finding that the following
requirements have been satisfied:
         (a)   The application of the subchapter provisions will present or
cause practical difficulties for a development or development site; provided,
however, that practical difficulties shall not include the need for the site
owner to incur additional reasonable expenses in order to comply with the
ordinance; and
         (b)   The granting of the relief requested will not substantially
prevent the goals and purposes of this subchapter, nor result in less effective
management of stormwater runoff.
      (6)   The project site owner must notify the Town Drainage Board and/or
the Town Engineer and IDEM 48 hours before beginning construction. Notification
shall be in the form of an updated IDEM NOI form. Once a permit has been issued
and the updated NOI submitted to the Town Drainage Board and/or the Town
Engineer and IDEM 48 hours before beginning construction, construction may
commence. Once construction starts, the project owner shall monitor
construction activities and inspect all stormwater pollution prevention
measures in compliance with this subchapter and the terms and conditions of the
approved permit. Upon completion of construction activities, as-built plans
must be submitted to the Town Drainage Board and/or the Town Engineer. A notice
of termination (NOT) shall be sent to the Town Drainage Board and/or the Town
Engineer once the construction site has been stabilized and all temporary
erosion and sediment control measures have been removed. The Town Drainage
Board and/or the Town Engineer, or representative, shall inspect the
construction site to verify the requirements for an NOT have been met. Once the
applicant receives a “verified” copy of the NOT, they must forward a copy to
IDEM. Permits issued under this scenario will expire five years from the date
of issuance. If construction is not completed within five years, the NOI must
be resubmitted at least 90 days prior to expiration. No Rule 5 (327 I.A.C. 15-
5) permit is required from IDEM for projects within the MS4 area boundary,
since the Town Drainage Board is the permitting authority.

the sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rate.  The town may
make proper allowances in determining the sewage bill for quantities of water
shown on the records to be consumed, but which were also shown to the
satisfaction of the town that such quantities did not enter the sanitary
sewerage system.  In order to ascertain the rate or charge provided in this
section, the owner or other interested party, shall at his or her expense,
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devised or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the town for
determining the sewage discharge.

the manner provided by law and ordinance.
   (A)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed
monthly.
   (B)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying
the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but
the billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in the event
payment is not made as herein required. The owners of properties served, which
are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to examine the
collection records of the town for the purpose of determining whether bills
have been paid by the tenant or tenants, provided that the examination shall be
made at the office at which the records are kept and during the hours that the
office is open for business.
   (C)   As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when due are
hereby declared to be delinquent and a penalty of 10% of the amount of the
rates or charges shall thereupon attach thereto. The time at which rates or
charges shall be paid is now fixed at the 15th day of the month following the
month represented by said changes.
   (D)   In accordance with I.C. 26-1-3.1-502.5 and all acts amendatory or
supplemental thereto, for each returned or dishonored check, electronic or ACH
payment, including, but not limited to, debit/credit card transactions issued
to the sewer utility, there may be a fee of $30 added to the customer’s bill in
addition to the actual charge levied by the depository institution processing
the returned check, electronic or ACH payment.
   (E)   Customers of the sewer utility may deposit payments for the sewer
utility in an after-hours drop box located at the Town Hall.
   (F)   The town Clerk-Treasurer shall serve as the account review officer
(ARO) to review and resolve disputes. Before the earliest possible date of
termination of sewage service as specified in the notice, a user may request a
hearing before the ARO to dispute the correctness of all or part of the amount
(s) shown in accordance with the provisions of division (A) above. A user shall
not be entitled to dispute the correctness of all or part of the amount(s) if
all of part of the amount(s) was the subject of a previous dispute under the
following: the invalidity of any section, clause, sentence or provision of this
subchapter shall not affect the validity of any other part of this subchapter
which can be given effect without the invalid part or parts.
   (G)   The procedure for a hearing on a user dispute shall be as follows.
      (1)   Before the earliest possible date of termination as specified on
the notice of termination, the user shall notify the ARO in writing that he or
she requests a hearing to dispute the correctness of all or part of the amounts
shown on the notice of termination, stating as completely as possible the basis
for the dispute.
      (2)   An informal hearing before the ARO shall be held within 15 days of
the ARO’s receipt of the user’s written request for a hearing on the disputed
bill.
      (3)   At the hearing, the user shall be entitled to present all evidence
that is, in the ARO’s view, relevant and material to the dispute.
      (4)   Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, the ARO, within ten
days of the completion of the hearing, shall issue a written decision formally
resolving the dispute.
   (H)   The ARO shall be authorized to resolve any disputed sewage bill and
shall be authorized to order the termination of sewage service under
appropriate circumstances. Upon approval by the ARO, the user may enter into an
agreement to amortize the unpaid balance of his or her account over a
reasonable period of time, not to exceed six months. No termination shall be
effected for any user complying with any account for sewer service as charges
accrue in each subsequent billing period. If a user fails to comply with an
amortization agreement, the ARO may terminate sewer service provided written
notice is given to the user at least 48 hours prior to the termination and the
notice includes conditions the use is required to meet to avoid termination.
   (I)   Utilization of this hearing procedure shall not relieve a user of the
obligation to timely and completely pay all other undisputed sewage bills or
charges. Failure to timely and completely pay all the undisputed amounts shall
subject the user to termination of service in accordance with the provisions of
this division.
   (J)   Until the date of the ARO’s decision, the town shall not terminate
sewage service of the user. If the ARO determines that the customer must pay
some or all of the disputed amount(s), the Department or ARO in his or her
written decision, shall notify the user of the following:
      (1)   The amount to be paid:
      (2)   The date on or after which services will be terminated; and
      (3)   Notice that unless the town receives complete payment of the amount
shown prior to the earliest possible date of termination given in the notice,
sewage service shall be terminated.
   (K)   A USER for the purpose of this section is defined as:
      (1)   A person who requests, either orally or in writing, sewage service
from the town sewer utility; and/or
      (2)   A person in whose name sewage service is billed for the rendering
of the service.
   (L)   Notwithstanding the above and foregoing, the ARO may, upon a
customer’s written request, with or without a hearing at the sole discretion of
the ARO, consider a request for an amortization or payment plan which differs
from the regular billing cycle. The decision of the ARO shall be in writing and
delivered to the customer and the Department.
   (M)   Any residential customer deposit remaining after the passage of this
subchapter shall be applied to the customer’s outstanding balance until
utilized in full.
   (N)   One or more final and active accounts in the name of or guaranteed by
a party may be consolidated at the sole discretion of the utility, when one or
more of the accounts has been final and the amount owing on the account is
delinquent.
   (O)   All new or transferred accounts will be charged a one-time
administrative set-up fee of $20. The one-time administrative set up fee of $20
shall not be charged to a developer of any subdivision, but shall instead be
charged to the person or entity purchasing a lot or parcel from the developer
at the time of the sale.  Furthermore an account may be reactivated by the
property owner without the payment of the one- time administrative set up fee
of $20.  As an incentive to encourage the use of automated services offered by
the Sewer Utility, the following discounts will be applied to the set-up fee. A
discount of $10 credit for set-up of automatic clearing house (ACH) monthly
draft and a $5 credit for set-up of electronic billing (e-billing) will be
given to all customers who complete the new customer form. The new customer
form will be available at Town Hall, on the town’s website, faxed or by mail.
The total set-up fee will be added to the first bill.
   (P)   All owners of property shall remain ultimately and legally liable for
the payments of any and all utility charges to the premises regardless of
whether such property is used for single-family, multiple-dwelling or
commercial purposes or the fact that the billings are made in the name of a
tenant. Such billings are for the personal convenience of the property owner,
and shall not in any way affect the lien right of the town against the premises
to which the services are furnished.
   (Q)   A billing adjustment may be made by way of credit or debit to the
customer's account once a billing mistake is discovered by an authorized
utility representative.
   (R)   The customer must notify the utility at least 15 days in advance of
the service termination date. This will allow the Sewer Utility staff to
finalize the account and mail final bill due on or before closing the account.
The customer shall remain responsible for all utility charges until proper
notice is received by the Utility and service is terminated.
   (S)   In all instances the Utility, upon providing the customer with a
proper delinquent notice may terminate sewer service. The Utility may terminate
services to a customer for any one or more of the following reasons:
      (1)   In accordance with an order by any court or other duly authorized
public authority;
      (2)   Detection of fraudulent or unauthorized use of sewer services for
which the Utility has reasonable grounds to believe the affected customer is
responsible;
      (3)   Non-payment of bill;
      (4)   Failure to pay for other material, fees, services or any other
outstanding balances to the town; or
      (5)   Failure to make installment payments as arranged with the Utility.
   (T)   If, prior to the termination of service date specified in the
delinquent notice, the customer notifies the Utility of not having the ability
to pay the full amount due, the Utility may make payment agreements for the
outstanding bill within the time period determined by the authorized utility
representative not to exceed six months.
   (U)   The customer may not breach any payment agreement with the Utility. If
any payment agreement is breached, the Utility may order the termination of
service immediately.
   (V)   The Utility may accept payment of the past due account balance before
the work order has been submitted to avoid disconnection of service.
   (W)   Discontinuance of service for any reason shall not release the owner
of the property from his or her obligation to pay in full the Utility bills.

subchapter and will be repaid only from funds deposited in the Sewer
Improvement and Betterment Fund and the Developer Reimbursement Fund.
      (5)   No provision of this subchapter shall be construed as a guarantee
by the town that the owners and/or developers of real estate advancing funds
will be reimbursed therefor.
      (6)   The amount of credits and reimbursements, if any, due to the
developer, will be based on construction costs for labor and materials only and
will be determined by the Town Engineer, whose decision shall be final.
   (K)   All plans for any sewer infrastructure to be installed outside the
area being developed by the applicant (i.e., off-site sewers) shall be designed
by engineers retained by the developer and shall be reviewed by the Town
Engineer, the cost of which shall be paid by the developer to the Town Engineer
pursuant to separate contractual agreement between the developer and the Town
Engineer. All easements shall be granted to the town, which shall obtain the

become and remain thereafter the sole property of the town without further
dedication thereof. The owners and/or developers making the dedication shall
post at the time of dedication, five years maintenance equal to 25% of the
project cost in a form acceptable to the town. Owners and/or developers shall
furnish an affidavit that they have paid in full all contractors, materialmen
and laborers the full cost of the extension or extensions.
   (M)   The owners and/or developers obtaining a permit for sewerage
extensions shall submit plans for on-site sewers, including trunk sewers to be
constructed within the development, to the Town Engineer for review and
approval prior to the start of construction. During construction of any on-site
or off-site sewer installations, the owners and/or developers shall pay to the
Town Engineer the expense of his or her inspection services to assure that the
construction of the facilities are in compliance with current standards and
specifications established by the Town Engineer and the town. Upon completion
of construction, the owners and/or, developers shall provide certified record
construction drawings in a digital format compatible with Auto-Cad 2000 or
similar in hard copy format to the Town Engineer within 30 days of completion
of the project. If certified record construction drawings are not provided, as
above required, the Town Engineer may prepare these at the expense of the
owners and/or developers. No potential reimbursable expenses of oversizing and/
or off-site interceptor construction will be allowed until certified record
drawings are provided to and approved by the Town Engineer. The owners and/or
developers shall pay the inspection costs and the costs for televising all
infrastructures, prior to approval and acceptance of the infrastructure by the
town, and the costs for televising required six months prior to expiration of
five-year maintenance period. The payment shall be made directly to the Town
Engineer.
   (N)   Individual connections in developed areas: if individual applicants
for sewage service in already developed acreage and/or platted subdivisions
wish to be served requiring construction of a new trunk sewer or local sewers,
they shall obtain a permit and deposit adequate funds, with the town to pay all
construction costs, engineering costs and all appurtenant costs prior to
authorization of the design by the town and receipt of bids for construction.
If the project does not proceed to completion after project costs are
established, the money so deposited by individual applicants shall be non-
refundable and will be used to pay incurred expenses. If the monies are in
excess of the town’s expenses, the excess will be returned on a pro rata basis
to the individual(s) making the deposit. If the project is completed, the
deposits of individual applicants shall be credited to the individuals’ costs.
If a connection is made to any trunk or local sewer without obtaining a permit
and paying the required availability, connection and local sewer costs, the act
shall constitute a violation of this subchapter, and individual owners and/or
developers of real estate making the connection will be subject to a fine of
$500 per day for each day the connection was unlawfully installed, and will be
required to remove the connection until the requirements of the ordinance are
complied with. Each day the unlawful connection exists may be considered a
separate offense.
   (O)   This subchapter and the costs and charges set out herein may be
amended from time to time by the Town Council when conditions exist that
indicate to the Town Council that charges herein are not equitable for the
customers of the municipal sewage system or for the subdividers, developers or
owners of property connected to the town’s sewage system.
   (P)   If a connection is made to any trunk or local sewer without obtaining
a permit and paying the required availability fee, connection fee and/or local
sewer costs, the act shall constitute a violation of this subchapter, and the
owner and/or developer of real estate so connected will be subject to a fine of
$100 per day for each day the connection was unlawfully installed, and will be
required to remove the connection until the requirements of this subchapter are
complied with. Each day the unlawful connection exists shall be considered a
separate offense.

Environmental Enforcement, has abated the unwholesome environmental condition,
the Town Manager or his or her designee shall mail, via certified mail, return
receipt requested, an invoice to the property owner reflecting the total cost
incurred by the town in abating the unwholesome environmental condition. The
invoice will also include a fine in the amount of $250 for violating the
ordinance. Within ten days of the date the invoice is mailed, the property
owner shall:
         (a)   Pay to the town all amounts owed as reflected in the invoice; or
         (b)   File a written appeal to the Town Manager setting forth the
address of the property; the name of the property owner; the basis for the
appeal and any documentation supporting the appeal. Upon appeal, the Town
Manager shall determine whether the property owner is liable for the violation
or the invoice amount. The Town Manager can approve or deny the appeal
administratively or refer the matter to the Town Council. If found liable, the
property owner shall have ten days from the date that the determination is
rendered to pay to the Town of McCordsville the invoice amount.

reasonable attorney’s fees and other costs associated with the enforcement of
the provisions of this subchapter.

schedule found in Ord. 011111.
   (B)   Such liens shall be perfected in the manner following:
      (1)   By the adoption by the Town Council at any regular or special
meeting thereof of an assessment resolution which shall give the name of the
owner or owners, a description of the offending private property and the amount
of the charges being assessed;
      (2)   The certification of such assessment resolution to the Auditor of
the county who by special assessment shall cause the amount thereof to be

violation of any provisions of this subchapter or other ordinances of the town,
or of any state law, any motorized and/or non-traditional vehicle known to have

$20.
   (C)   Removal and impounding of a motorized and/or non-traditional vehicle
shall be accomplished with reasonable care, but otherwise shall be at the risk

jurisdiction.
   (D)   Removal, impounding and storage of a motorized and/or non-traditional

from the penalty prescribed for his or her violation of this subchapter or any
other town ordinance or state law, for the violation of which the motorized
and/or non-traditional vehicle has been removed, impounded and stored, but
remedies and penalties are declared to be distinct and separate as means of
enforcing compliance to this subchapter.
   (E)   Whenever an owner, his or her agent or representative fails or refuses
to pay expenses of removal and storage of a motorized/non-traditional vehicle
impounded, in addition to and separate from the penalty incurred by him or her,
the police officer discovering the motorized and/or non-traditional vehicle
parked or left standing, illegally, shall file or cause to be filed, in any
court having jurisdiction an affidavit charging the owner, his or her agent or
representative with the committed offense. The person so charged shall be cited
to appear on a certain day and hour to answer and stand trial upon the charge.
The police officer, who executed the affidavit, shall be present and assist in
the prosecution of the charge.
   (F)   Pending a hearing upon the charge, the owner, his or her agent or
representative may obtain possession of the impounded motorized and/or non-

accrued towing and storage charges, or in another reasonable sum fixed by the
judge of the court, conditioned upon the appearance of the owner, his or her
agent or representative before the court at the day and hour set for trial, to
answer the charge in the affidavit.
   (G)   In the event the judge finds the motorized and/or non-traditional
vehicle to have been properly towed and/or impounded, the judge shall, in all
instances, not only assess the penalty prescribed herein, or by law for the
violation, but in addition thereto, shall determine and assess against the
defendant whatever amount, within the limits prescribed by this subchapter, the
judge finds from the evidence is a fair and equitable reimbursement to the town
or other persons, for the removal expense for impounding and storage of the
motorized and/or non-traditional vehicle, plus attorney’s fees incurred by the
town; however, in no event shall the sum assessed for impounding be more that
the maximum amount in this subchapter, but the charge shall be additional to
the assessment of the reasonable charges for the towing and storage of the
motorized and/or non-traditional vehicle, not exceeding the towing and storage
charges herein provided for.
   (H)   In the event that the judge finds from the evidence that the motorized
and/or non-traditional vehicle was not parked or left standing in violation of
any provisions of this subchapter, or other ordinance or statute, as charged in
the affidavit, the judge shall order the motorized and/or non-traditional
vehicle restored to the owner, agent or representative without any penalty of
the assessment of any charges made against him or her.
   (I)   Independent of and in addition to the remedy, action and assessment of
any penalty provided for the violations, a police officer may order and effect
the removal of the motorized and/or non-traditional vehicle from the street or
other public place and may cause it to be impounded and stored, as provided for
in this subchapter, and any action against or charges assessed against or paid
by or for the person as a result of impounding and storage shall be wholly
distinct from and independent of any offense and penalty which may be assessed
against and paid by or for the person.
   (J)   Any and all sums of money collected in excess of the expenses incurred
for towing and/or storage of an impounded motorized and/or non-traditional
vehicle shall be deposited into the local law enforcement continuing education
fund for expenditure in compliance with the ordinance creating the fund.

an Area designated strictly for underground or buried utilities, may submit an
application to the Town Council requesting a waiver to install new utility
poles or new wireless support structures within the Area pursuant to the
provisions in division (I) as stated in this section. The waiver process is
described as follows:
         (b)   A waiver from the provisions of this section may be granted upon
application to the McCordsville Town Council who, after conducting a public
hearing on such a request, shall determine whether to grant the waiver based
upon the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of McCordsville.
   (D)   From and after the effective date of this chapter, no person,
corporation, or utility shall erect or construct within the town's ROW any
pole, overhead line, or associated overhead structure used or useful in
supplying electric, communication or similar associated services.
   (E)   Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Town Council, all
utilities located within the town's ROW shall be placed underground and/or
buried.

grade level.
      (5)   The minimum tower separation shall be 1,000 feet between any other
support structures primarily used for telecommunications, as measured in any
direction between support structures, not necessarily a dimension measured
parallel to a road right-of-way. Additionally, no tower shall be closer than
100 feet to a single-family residential structure.
      (6)   Support structures must be metal or fiberglass monopoles matching
the design and color of the town's non-residential street lights, as amended.
The town street light color is Federal Green or color equivalent. The town
reserves the right to require luminaires on support structures that match the
town's street light luminaire specifications.  Such luminaires shall be
maintained in good working order, be illuminated consistent with the timing of
other street lights along the corridor, at the cost of the applicant, including
the cost of electricity.
      (7)   Any antenna equipment mounted to the support structure shall also
be matching in color to the support structure.
      (8)   All facility equipment at a single facility (with the exception of
the antenna itself) shall be ground mounted in a cabinet having an area not to
exceed 40 cubic feet and no greater than 48 inches in overall height. Under
special circumstances, contingent upon a mutual agreement, the town may allow a
pole mounted cabinet with dimensions not exceeding 20 inches by 20 inches by
six inches (20" x 20" x 6"), ground mounted cabinet not to exceed two feet by
two feet by one foot (2' x 2' x 1') and other considerations, such as, but not
limited to, the addition of shrouding and landscaping to mitigate the visual
impact of the equipment. If a mutual agreement cannot be reached, then the Town
of McCordsville Public Works Committee shall intervene and make a
determination.
      (9)   All support structures shall have a plaque identifying the

exceed 0.25 square feet.
      (10)   All support structures shall avoid conflicts with sidewalks,
multi-use trails, and other roadway and utility infrastructure.
      (11)   All conduit, wiring and fiber shall be concealed within the
support structure and/or shall be buried underground. All new electrical
service lines to the support structure and/or equipment shall also be
underground. Existing aerial electrical service lines may remain. Under no
circumstance shall any service drop crossing a street or roadway be run in any
manner other than underground via a bore.
      (12)   Wireless support structures and facilities shall be designed to
blend into the surrounding environment through the use of color, camouflaging
and architectural treatment. The entire facility shall be aesthetically and
architecturally compatible with its environment. The use of materials
compatible with the surrounding environment is required for associated support
structures, which shall be designed to architecturally match the exterior of
residential or commercial structures within the neighborhood or area. Specific
requirements for aesthetics of the wireless support structures and facilities
shall be in accordance with the standards established by the McCordsville Town
Council, from time to time.
      (13)   Operation. A petitioner receiving a permit for a: (1) new
construction of a wireless support structure; (2) substantial modification of
wireless support structure; or (3) collocation of wireless facilities on an
existing structure, inherently agrees that if the wireless support structure or
wireless facilities are not used for a period of six months, they will be
removed by the facilities owner at its expense. Should such owner fail to
remove the wireless support structure or wireless facilities after 30 days from
the date of notice of violation is issued by the town, the town may remove such
structure or facilities and bill the owner for the costs of removal and clean-
up and restoration of the site. The owner of any facility shall annually file a
copy of any inspections completed on such wireless support structure or
wireless facilities with the town for continued operation and use of the
structure or facility, and provide documentation of compliance with the

stresses allowed for new buildings of similar structure, purpose or location;
      (3)   Any portion thereof has been damaged by fire, earthquake, wind,
flood or by any other cause to an extent that the structural strength or
stability thereof is materially less than it was before such catastrophe, and
is less than the minimum requirements for new buildings of similar structure,

      (4)   Any portion, member or appurtenance thereof is likely to fail, to
become detached or dislodged, or to collapse and thereby injure persons or
damage property;
      (5)   Any portion of a building, or any member, appurtenance or
ornamentation, on the exterior thereof is not of sufficient strength or
stability or is not so anchored, attached or fastened in place so as to be
capable of resisting a wind pressure of one-half of that specified for new
buildings of similar structure, purpose or location without exceeding the
working stresses permitted for such buildings;
      (6)   Any portion thereof has cracked, warped, buckled or settled to such
an extent that walls or other structural portions have materially less
resistance to winds or earthquakes than is required in the case of similar new
construction;
      (7)   The building or structure, or any portion thereof, because of
dilapidation, deterioration, or decay; faulty construction; the removal,
movement, or instability of any portion of the ground necessary for the purpose
of supporting the building, the deterioration, decay or inadequacy of its
foundation; or any other cause, is likely to partially or completely collapse;
      (8)   For any reason, the building or structure, or any portion thereof,
is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is being used;
      (9)   The exterior walls or other vertical structural members list, lean
or buckle to such an extent that a plumb line passing through the center of
gravity does not fall inside the middle one-third of the base;

or more damage or deterioration of its supporting member or members or 50%
damage or deterioration of its non-supporting members, enclosing or outside
walls or coverings;

earthquake or flood or has become so dilapidated or deteriorated so as to
become an attractive nuisance to children or freely accessible to persons for
the purpose of committing unlawful acts, including but not limited to trespass;

maintained in violation of any specific requirement or prohibition applicable
to such building or structure provided by the building regulations of this town
or of any law or ordinance of this state or town relating to the condition,
location or structure of buildings;
      (13)   Any building or structure which, whether or not erected in
accordance with all applicable laws and ordinances, has in any non-supporting
part, member, or portion less than 50%, or in any support part, member or
portion less than 66% of the strength, fire-resisting qualities or
characteristics, or weather-resisting qualities or characteristics, required by
law in the case of a newly constructed building of like area, height and
occupancy in the same location;
      (14)   A building or structure, used or intended to be used for dwelling
purposes, because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, decay, damage,

facilities or otherwise, is determined by the health officials to be
unsanitary, unfit for human habitation or in such a condition that is likely to
cause sickness or disease;

condition, deterioration, damage, inadequate exits, lack of sufficient fire-
resistive construction; faulty electric wiring, gas connection, or heating
apparatus; or other cause, is determined by the fire official to be a fire
hazard; and
      (16)   Any portion of a building or structure remains on a site after the

defects thereof. This notice shall require the owner, within 30 days, to
commence either the required repairs or improvements or demolition and removal
of the building or structure or portions thereof. If necessary, the notice
shall also require the building, structure or portion thereof to be vacated
forthwith and not reoccupied until the required repairs and improvements are
completed, inspected and approved by the Building Inspector.
      (2)   Proper service of the notice shall be by personal service upon the
owner of record, if he or she shall be found within the town limits. If he or

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT; PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-
4 granted the power to local government units to control land use within their
jurisdictions. Therefore, the Town Council of the Town of McCordsville does
hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities,
and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-
proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters.
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage.
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
      (6)   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures
and their contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the National
Flood Insurance Program.
   (D)   Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To protect human life and health.

§ 152.02  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE.  Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
      (1)   ZONE A.  Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   ZONE AE AND A1-A30.  Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones
A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO.  Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      (4)   ZONE AH.  Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
      (5)   ZONE AR.  Areas that result from the decertification of a
previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the
process of being restored to provide base flood protection.
      (6)   ZONE A99.  Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance
flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an
under-construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special
flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a
protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for
insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection
system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base
flood elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE).  A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE).  Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL.  A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING.  A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD.  The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE).  The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT.  That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER.  The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
the Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY.  The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING.  See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY.  A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS).  A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular
program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY.  A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.

of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.  The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD.  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration
(FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM).  An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS).  The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA.  Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOOD.)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG).  The elevation of the regulatory flood plus
two feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See FREEBOARD.)
   FLOODPLAIN.  The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake,
or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The floodplain includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT.  The operation of an overall program of corrective
and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS.  This chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which
control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state,
or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for
preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. Floodplain management
regulations are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain
ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain management
requirements.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING).  A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE.  A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY.  The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD.  A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE.  Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP (as related to variances of this chapter).  The exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
McCordsville Drainage Board requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual,
and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial  hardship
alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical
handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise
cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems
can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE.  The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a
structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURES.  Any structures individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).  The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD).  A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC).  A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA).  An amendment by letter to the currently
effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA
through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is only
issued by FEMA.
   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR).  An official revision to the currently
effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations,
and elevations.
   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F).  An official revision by
letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.

below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and
         (c)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.

velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD.  The flood that has a 1% chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the
letter A is subject to the 1% annual chance flood. See REGULATORY FLOOD.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR).  An official republication of a community's
FEMA map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations,
floodplain boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric

determined in a FIS.
   REGULATORY FLOOD.  The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable
to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is
as defined in §
152.04 of this chapter. The REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the term BASE
FLOOD, ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD, and 100-YEAR FLOOD.
   REPETITIVE LOSS.  Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the

amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided
for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly
constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to
be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that
intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood-prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA).  Those lands within the jurisdiction of
the town subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the Town
of McCordsville are generally identified as such on the Hancock County, Indiana
and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated December 4, 2007 as well
as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown
on a FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1-A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).
   START OF CONSTRUCTION.  Substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction  of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE.  A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes
recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would
equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred substantial loss
or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration
of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structures continued designation as a historic structure.
   SUSPENSION.  The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE.  A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION.  The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATERCOURSE.  A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   X ZONE.  The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B Zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X Zones (C Zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE.  A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or
type of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A.  See definition for A ZONE.
   ZONE B, C, AND X.  Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)

jurisdiction of the town.
(Ord. 021114A, passed 2-11-2014)
§ 152.04  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING REGULATORY FLOOD DATA.
   This chapter's protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best
available regulatory flood data is listed below.
   (A)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the Town of McCordsville shall be as
delineated on the 1% annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study
of Hancock County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas and the corresponding Flood
Insurance Rate Map dated December 4, 2007 as well as any future updates,
amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
with the most recent date.
   (B)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each
of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the Town of McCordsville, delineated as
an A Zone on the Hancock County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance
Rate Map dated December 4, 2007 as well as any future updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area
from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace existing
data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review, subsequently approved.
   (C)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification
on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of
any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas shall be according
to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater
than one square mile.
   (D)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.
(Ord. 021114A, passed 2-11-2014)
§ 152.05  ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   A floodplain development permit shall be required in conformance with the
provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development
activities in areas of special flood hazard.
(Ord. 021114A, passed 2-11-2014)
§ 152.06  COMPLIANCE.
   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally
altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. No land or stream within the SFHA shall
hereafter be altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and
other applicable regulations.
(Ord. 021114A, passed 2-11-2014)
§ 152.07  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions
shall prevail.
(Ord. 021114A, passed 2-11-2014)
§ 152.08  DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND ELEVATIONS.
   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles shall govern.
   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
   (C)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the
base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site shall be
considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied.
The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA.
(Ord. 021114A, passed 2-11-2014)
§ 152.09  INTERPRETATION; WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   (A)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements.
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body.
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (B)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Therefore, this chapter does not create any liability on the part of the Town
of McCordsville, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of
Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.

(Ord. 021114A, passed 2-11-2014)
§ 152.39  STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
152.04, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving and the like undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/ improvement to a residence
in a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in §§
152.35 through
152.42 of this chapter have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot
be less restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community's more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
0.15 of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under
the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as
proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the Floodplain Administrator shall submit the data and request that the
Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per
mapping standard regulations found at 44 C.F.R. 65.12.
(Ord. 021114A, passed 2-11-2014)
§ 152.40  STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
152.35 through
152.42 of this chapter have been met. The key provision is that the top of the
lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or
above the FPG.

§ 152.41  STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway permit (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway permit (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in §§
152.35 through
152.42 of this chapter have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
152.35 through
152.42 of this chapter have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and will not increase flood damages
or potential flood damages.

designee, to discuss the request.
   (B)   Staff procedure.  Upon receipt of an application for primary plat
approval, the Administrative Officer shall review the application for technical
conformity with the standards fixed in this chapter. Within 30 days after
receipt of the application, the Administrative Officer shall announce the date
for a hearing before the Plan Commission, and shall provide for notice in
accordance with I.C. 36-7-4-706.  After the staff has announced a date for a
hearing before the Plan Commission, it shall:
      (1)   Notify the applicant in writing;
      (2)   Give notice of the hearing by publication in accordance with I.C.
5-3-1; and
      (3)   Provide for due notice to interested parties, consistent with
Indiana State Statute, at least ten days before the date set for the hearing.
   (C)   Technical Review Committee procedure.  The Technical Review Committee
shall review the primary plat and make a report to the Plan Commission within
15 days after the date the application was filed. If the Technical Review
Committee finds that the primary plat has been prepared in accordance with the
terms of this chapter, they shall forward a report so stating to the Plan
Commission for consideration. If the Technical Review Committee finds that the
primary plat has not been prepared in accordance with the terms of this
chapter, they shall return the plat to the subdivider with a written
specification of the items of nonconformance and shall submit a copy of the
same to the Plan Commission.
   (D)   Plan Commission procedure.
      (1)   Approval.  If, after the hearing, the Plan Commission determines
that the application and plat comply with the standards of this and all other
applicable ordinances, it shall make written findings and a decision granting
primary approval to the plat.  Upon approval of the primary plat, the Plan
Commission will indicate upon each copy  that it has been approved.  One copy
shall be returned to the subdivider along with a written statement indicating
the action taken by the Plan Commission. If approved with conditions, a written
copy of the conditions shall accompany each copy of the approved plat.  As a
condition of primary approval, the Plan Commission may specify:
         (a)   The manner in which public ways shall be laid out, graded and
improved;
         (b)   A provision for water, sewage, and other utility services;
         (c)   A provision for lot size, number and location;
         (d)   A provision for drainage design; and
         (e)   A provision for other services, as specified in this chapter.
      (2)   Disapproval.  If, after the hearing, the Plan Commission
disapproves the plat, it shall make written findings that set forth its reasons
and a decision denying primary approval. If disapproved, the Plan Commission
shall return to the subdivider three copies of the primary plat marked
"Disapproved by the McCordsville Plan Commission," along with a written
statement indicating the reason or reasons for its disapproval.
      (3)   Continuation.  The Plan Commission may also refer a plat back to
the Technical Review Committee for review or study on a specific technical
matter.
   (E)   Drainage Board procedure.  No subdivision shall be approved nor shall
an improvement location permit be issued for land zoned for residential or non-
residential use unless the working drain for each lot in the subdivision and
each proposed structure outlets into a regulated drain.  All subdivision plats
shall dedicate to the town, for drainage purposes, all regulated drains, drain
tile, storm sewers, retention ponds and drainage ditches which have side slopes
steeper than five to one.  Upon receipt of a subdivision application, the
Administrative Officer shall refer the application to the McCordsville Drainage
Board or its agents to review the preliminary plat and determine that the
property will be adequately drained and that adjoining properties and/or
downstream areas will not be adversely affected by the planned development of
the property.  If the Drainage Board finds that adjacent or intervening
landowners decline to cooperate in providing these connections, and that the
connections required by this section cannot therefore be made, the Board may
waive the requirement if it determines that other adequate provisions have been
made to discharge the working drains.
   (F)   Subsequent approvals (if necessary).  Subsequent approval will be
required of the engineering proposals pertaining to water supply, storm
drainage, sewerage and sewage disposal, grading and gradients, roadway widths,
and the surfacing of streets by the Town Council, where concerned, prior to the
approval of the secondary plat by the Plan Commission.
   (G)   Approval of primary plat does not constitute approval of a secondary
plat.  Approval of a primary plat shall not constitute approval of a secondary
plat. Rather, it shall be deemed an expression of approval to the layout
submitted on the primary plat as a guide to the preparation of the secondary
plat.  Approval of the primary plat shall terminate two years after the date of
approval unless further extended by the Plan Commission upon written request of
the subdivider, and by filing 60 days prior to the expiration of the approval
and by payment of a filing fee established by the McCordsville Plan Commission.
(Ord. 121410A, passed 1-11-2011)

   (A)   Conformance with primary plat required.  The secondary plat shall not
be considered for approval until the action taken by the  Plan Commission on
the required primary plat has been completed, nor shall secondary approval be
granted prior to the expiration of the appeal period provided for in I.C. 36-7-
4-707(c). When the secondary plat submitted does not substantially conform to
the approved primary plat, the subdivider shall not file an application for
secondary plat approval until the primary plat has been amended in accordance
with the same procedure required for primary plat approval.
   (B)   Construction plan(s) required.  Construction drawings are to be

§ 153.034  TECHNICAL REVIEW COMMITTEE PROCEDURE.
   Upon receipt of an application for secondary plat approval, the Technical
Review Committee shall review the secondary plat and make a report to the Plan
Commission within 15 days after the final filing date. If the Technical Review
Committee finds that the secondary plat has been prepared in accordance with
the terms of this chapter, they shall forward a report so stating to the Plan
Commission for consideration. If the Technical Review Committee finds that the
secondary plat has not been prepared in accordance with the terms of this
chapter, they shall return the plat to the subdivider with a written
specification of the items of nonconformance and shall submit a copy of the
same to the Plan Commission.
(Ord. 121410A, passed 1-11-2011)
§ 153.035  PLAN COMMISSION PROCEDURE.
   The Plan Commission shall, upon the filing of an application for secondary
plat approval, review the secondary plat along with the accompanying data, hear
the report of the Technical Review Committee, and determine whether or not the
secondary plat meets all minimum requirements and standards of this chapter and
of all other applicable ordinances of the town.  The Plan Commission shall then
take one of the following actions on the secondary plat within 30 days after
its submission or a mutually agreed upon extension.
   (A)   Approval.  The Plan Commission shall authorize the Plan Commission
officers to sign the secondary plat only after the Administrative Officer has
determined that the secondary plat meets the minimum requirements of this
chapter and all applicable ordinances in the town.  Upon final approval of the
secondary plat, indicated by signature of the officers, the officers shall
direct the Administrative Officer to post the secondary plat to a Town Council
agenda following receipt of all items indicated in §
153.036.
   (B)   Conditional approval.  If the Plan Commission determines that upon the
satisfactory completion of one or more specified conditions consistent with the
requirements, standards, and specifications of this chapter, the secondary plat
would comply with the terms of this chapter, the Plan Commission may give
conditional approval to the plat. Conditional approval of a secondary plat may
include a construction agreement which is acceptable to the Plan Commission and
would permit the subdivider to proceed with the installation of improvements
prior to recording. Written notice of the conditional approval shall constitute
formal authorization to the subdivider to construct and install all or a part
of the required improvements, subject to inspection and acceptance procedures
required by this chapter. The subdivider shall furnish sufficient evidence to
the Plan Commission of the satisfactory completion of the conditions before the
plat will be deemed “final approval for record.”  Upon final approval of the
secondary plat, the Plan Commission shall indicate upon each copy that it has
been approved.  One copy shall be returned to the subdivider, along with the
written statement indicating the action taken by the Plan Commission.  A
written copy of the conditions shall accompany each copy of the approved
secondary plat.
   (C)   Disapproval.  Should the Plan Commission decide to disapprove the
plat, written notice of the action, together with reasons therefor, shall be
transmitted to the subdivider. The action shall also be entered on the official
records of the Plan Commission, provided that nothing contained therein shall
prejudice the subdivider’s ability to make reapplication for secondary plat
approval according to the terms of this chapter.
   (D)   Continue.  Should the Plan Commission have a question regarding a
specific technical aspect of the plat which had not previously been studied by
the Technical Review Committee, the Plan Commission may refer to the plat along
with a detailed statement of the question to the Technical Review Committee for
a finding.
   (E)   Final approval of a secondary plat not acceptance of dedications. 
Final approval of a plat by the Plan Commission shall not be construed as an
acceptance by the public of the offer of dedication of any street improvement,
way, place, structure, utility improvements, or open space improvement, within
the areas shown upon the plat unless the acceptance is endorsed by the Town
Council upon the original tracing of the secondary plat.

§ 153.036  RECORDING A FINAL PLAT.
   After the Plan Commission officers have affixed their signatures to the
original tracing and the subdivider has completed the required improvements and
installation, provided financial guarantees as required by town ordinances, and
met all other requirements of this chapter, the Administrative Officer shall
place the secondary plat on the next Town Council agenda for acceptance of
dedication. Following acceptance of dedication the subdivider shall record the
plat with the County Recorder within one year.  If not recorded within this
time, the approval shall be null and void, unless further extended by the Plan
Commission upon written request of the subdivider, filed with the Plan
Commission 60 days prior to the expiration of the approval and by payment of a
filing fee established by the Plan Commission. The subdivider shall pay the
recording fee, and file with the Plan Commission four prints of the approved
secondary plat, including  restrictive covenants, as recorded.  One
reproducible print of the secondary plat, as recorded, shall be filed and
retained in the office of the Planning and Building Department. For multi-
family or non-residential, until the prints have been so filed, no occupancy
permit shall be issued for any lot shown upon the plat. For single-family
residential, until the prints have been so filed, no improvement location
permit, occupancy permit, or other permits shall be issued for any lot shown
upon the plat.

DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS
§ 153.050  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   In determining whether an application for approval shall be granted, the
Plan Commission shall determine if the plat conforms to the principles and
standards required in this chapter, which shall be deemed as the minimum; and
whenever the applicable requirements of other town ordinances are higher or
more restrictive, those requirements shall control any application for plat
approval.
   (A)   Natural features.  In the subdividing of any land, due regard shall be
shown for all natural features, such as tree growth, watercourses, historic
spots, or similar conditions which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and
value to the proposed development.
   (B)   Pollution prevention.  Due consideration shall be given to the
prevention of air and stream pollution, proper treatment and disposal of refuse

   (C)   Design.  The subdivision layout shall be of a character that protects
the health, safety, and general welfare of the county and its residents. In
designing a street system, the subdivider shall be guided by the following
principles:

through-traffic movement, but street connections into and from adjacent areas
may be required;
      (3)   Local street patterns shall provide reasonable direct access to the
primary circulation system;
      (4)   Local circulation systems and land development patterns shall not

      (5)   Elements in the local circulation system should be designed with
the least amount of interruptions possible in order to function effectively and
safely;
      (6)   Traffic generators within residential areas shall be considered in
the design of the circulation pattern;

   (C)   Intersection standards.
      (1)   Number of streets at an intersection.  No more than two streets
shall intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by the Plan
Commission.
      (2)   Spacing.  Intersections of major streets shall be at least 800 feet
apart and any street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet shall
not be permitted.  Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing
street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersection on
the opposite side of the street.
      (3)   Angle.  All streets shall intersect at 90° whenever possible.  In
no instance shall two streets intersect at less than 80° onto arterial or
collector or local streets.
      (4)   Horizontal curves.  To insure adequate site distance, when the
street centerline deflects more than 10°, connections shall be made by
horizontal curves. The minimum centerline radius for local residential streets
shall be 150 feet and for all other streets shall be 400 feet.
      (5)   Tangent.  A tangent of at least 100 feet shall be introduced
between reversed curves on local and collector streets.
      (6)   Visibility.  Clear visibility, measured along the center line of
the street, shall be provided for at least 600 feet on all arterial streets,
400 feet on collector streets, and at least 200 feet on all local streets.
      (7)   Maximum vertical grade.  The maximum vertical grade for all streets
shall not exceed 5%. The minimum vertical grade of all streets shall be 0.4%.
      (8)   Maximum cul-de-sac length.  The maximum length cul-de-sac street
shall be 1,300 feet measured along the center line from the intersection at
origin through the center of the circle to the end of the right-of-way.  The
origin of a cul-de-sac shall be defined as the centerline of the first street
intersected by the cul-de-sac.  Each cul-de-sac shall have a terminus of nearly
circular shape with dimensions consistent with Table 2, Cul-de-sac Terminus
Diameter Requirements, unless the Plan Commission approves an equally safe and
convenient form of space instead of the required turning circle.
      (9)   Acceleration and deceleration lanes.  At an intersection of a
subdivision local or collector street with an arterial or major collector
street or road, the Town Engineer on behalf of the Plan Commission may require
the subdivider to install improvements such as, but not limited to,
acceleration and deceleration and/or passing lanes along the arterial or
collector street.
      (10)   Turn lanes and traffic signals.  At a nearby intersection of an
arterial or collector roadway, the Town Engineer on behalf of the Plan
Commission may require turn lanes and/or traffic signals.
      (11)   Arterial and collector improvements.  On arterial and collector
roadways adjacent to a proposed development or redevelopment, the Town Engineer
on behalf of the Plan Commission, may require the roadway to be improved to the
standard set by the typical cross section.
   (D)   Pedestrian route standards.  Sidewalks at least five feet wide are
required on both sides of the street in all subdivisions, except where a
subdivision is adjacent to a collector (major or minor) or arterial (minor or
major) street, in which case a multi-use pathway is required on the north and
east sides of the road as specified and a sidewalk is required on the west and
south sides of the road as specified. On US 36, the multi-use pathway shall be
excluded and the road shall have sidewalks on both sides of the road.  Sidewalk
and multi-use pathway connectivity shall be considered and exceptions granted
as consistent with connectivity and any plan established by the Parks Board.
All other standards for sidewalks shall conform to the Hancock County
Subdivision Control Ordinance. Additionally, any multi- use paths identified in
the Parks and Recreation Master Plan are hereby incorporated into this chapter
by reference. Furthermore, the town may increase/decrease the width of any
sidewalk or multi-use pathway at its discretion, and/or replace a sidewalk with
a multi-use path, or vice versa, without being considered non-compliant with
this chapter.
(Ord. 121410A, passed 1-11-2011)
§ 153.054  STREET STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS, GENERAL.
   All streets shall be constructed in conformance with the McCordsville,
Indiana Town Standards. Improvements for streets shall conform to the rules,
regulations, and design specifications as set forth and established by the
McCordsville Public Works Committee as adopted.
   (A)   Number of access points.
      (1)   Subdivisions with fewer than five lots.  In subdivisions with fewer
than five lots, shared driveways are encouraged to minimize access points along
existing roadways.
      (2)   Subdivisions with five or more lots.  Subdivisions with more than
five lots shall construct a new road for access to the proposed lots rather
than creating driveway cuts for each proposed lot directly onto existing roads.
      (3)   Subdivisions with more than ten lots.  Subdivisions with more than
ten lots shall provide more than one entrance into the subdivision for public
safety and improved circulation. Where it is not feasible to provide more than
one access point due to physical constraints or the size of the lot, at least
one easement shall be platted to an adjoining parcel that is likely to
develop.  The easement shall provide future right-of-way for road extensions
and utility connections into the adjoining parcel.
   (B)   Connectivity of adjacent subdivisions.  Adjacent subdivisions shall
connect to one another.
   (C)   Half streets, stub streets, and dead-end streets.  Half streets
encouraged, especially where essential to the reasonable development of the
subdivision in conformity with other requirements of these regulations, and
where the Town Council finds it will be proper to require the dedication of the
other half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is
adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be
planned within the tract.  A temporarily dead-ended street shall be permitted
in any case in which a street is proposed to be and should logically be
extended but is not yet constructed.  An adequate easement for a turnaround
shall be provided for any temporary dead-end street which extends 200 feet or
more in length. The easement shall be automatically vacated to abutting
property owners when the dead-ended street is legally extended.
   (D)   Street names.  No street names may be used which will duplicate or be
confused with the names of existing streets.  All street names shall include a
directional element to position the street appropriately within the north-south
and east-west grid covering the county. The streets which are logical
extensions or continuations of, or obviously in alignment with any existing
streets, either constructed or appearing on any validly recorded plat, shall
bear the names of the existing streets.
   (E)   Proposed rights-of-way.  Rights-of-way for proposed streets shall be
extended to the boundary lines of the proposed subdivision so that a connection
can be made to all adjacent properties unless the extension is not feasible
because of topography or other physical conditions, or unless, in the opinion
the Plan Commission, the extension is not necessary or desirable for the
coordination with existing streets or the most advantageous development of
adjacent tracts. In any event, no subdivision shall be designed so as to create
or perpetuate the land-locking of adjacent undeveloped land.
   (F)   Nonconforming streets abutting or within a proposed subdivision.  In
subdivisions that adjoin or include existing streets that do not conform to the
minimum right-of-way dimensions as established by this chapter, the subdivider
shall dedicate additional width along either one or both sides of the streets
of inadequate width so as to bring them up to standards, provided the area to
be used for widening is owned by the subdivider or under his or her control.
   (G)   Restrictive covenants.  The following provisions shall be required as
a provision of the restrictive covenants of all secondary plats to which they
apply:
      (1)   No fence, wall, hedge, tree or shrub planting which obstructs sight
lines and elevations between two and one-half and eight feet above the street
shall be  placed or permitted to remain on any corner lot within the triangular
area formed by the street right-of-way lines and a line connecting points 40
feet from the intersection of the local or collector street lines, and 75 feet
from the intersection of arterial streets, or in the case of a rounded property
corner, from the intersection of the street right-of-way lines extended.
      (2)   The same sight line limitations shall apply to any lot within ten
feet of the intersection of a street right-of-way line with the edge of the
driveway pavement or alley line.  No driveway shall be located within 70 feet
of the intersection of two street lines.  No drainage structures shall be
located within driveway limits.
      (3)   No sump pump drains or other drains shall outlet onto the street.
      (4)   No trees shall be planted in the right-of-way.
      (5)   No vehicle shall be parked on a public street for more than 24
hours, unless otherwise permitted to do so.
      (6)   Snow removal for the subdivision internal streets shall be the
responsibility of the developer or homeowner's association.
      (7)   The maintenance of all irrigation or sprinkler systems installed in
the right-of-way shall be the responsibility of the individual homeowner or
developer.  The town assumes no responsibility for maintenance or damage of any
kind.
      (8)   Each homeowner (lot owner) shall be responsible for constructing a
five-foot wide concrete sidewalk of 4,000 psi concrete, four inches thick,
sloped toward the street with expansion joints each 48 feet along the entire
street frontage of their respective lot. The sidewalk shall be constructed
prior to completing finish lot grading. The sidewalk shall be located one foot
inside the street right-of-way line, (not on the lot) and parallel to the
street right-of-way line.
      (9)   All public sidewalks shall comply with all Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended, requirements and in the situation of a
conflict between ADA rules, covenants or other regulations, the ADA shall
govern.
      (10)   Unless provided by the local municipality, the homeowner's
association shall negotiate with and procure trash pick-up and curbside
recycling services from one provider for all of the owners in the subdivision.
      (11)   The homeowner's association may employ a managing agent or a real
estate management company to assist with the management, administration,
operation, and maintenance of the subdivision.
   (H)   Pipe underdrains.  Pipe underdrains will be used on both sides of the
street. The minimum slope of the pipe shall be 0.4%.
   (I)   Concrete.  All concrete used for construction of streets, curbs and
gutters, sidewalks and other related items shall have a minimum compressive
strength of 4,000 psi with the appropriate air entrainment, which shall be
consistent with industry standards, and a slump not to exceed four inches. 
Stone shall be used for coarse aggregate.
(Ord. 121410A, passed 1-11-2011)
§ 153.055  BLOCK STANDARDS.
   (A)   Length and width.  Block length and width or acreage within bounding
streets shall be designed to accommodate the size of the lot required in the
area by this chapter and to provide for convenient access, circulation control,
and safety of street traffic.  Blocks that are unreasonably large or small will
not be approved. The maximum block length shall be 1,200 feet.  In the design
of blocks longer than 800 feet, the Commission may specify  the provision of
pedestrian crosswalks near the center, or wherever most useful to facilitate
pedestrians' circulation to a school, park, recreation area, shopping center,
or other significant neighborhood destination.
   (B)   Residential blocks.  Residential blocks shall be of sufficient depth
to accommodate two tiers of lots of minimum depth, except where reverse
frontage lots bordering a freeway, arterial street or flood plain are used.
   (C)   Block shape.  No specific rule concerning the shape of blocks is made,
but blocks must fit easily into the overall plan of the subdivision and their
design must evidence consideration of lot planning, traffic flow, and public
areas.
(Ord. 121410A, passed 1-11-2011)
§ 153.056  LOT STANDARDS.
   Subdivision lots shall be adequate for the type of development and land use
proposed, and shall conform to the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (A)   Lot lines.  Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles
or radial to the street line.
   (B)   Lot dimensions.  The lot size, width, depth, shape, grade, location
and orientation, shall be in proper relation to street and block design to
existing and proposed topographical conditions.
   (C)   Depth to width ratio.  The depth to width ratio of any single-family
residential lot shall not be greater than three to one respectively.  The width
is to be measured where the lot contiguously abuts the right-of-way of a
street. This standard shall apply to platted lots only.
   (D)   Setbacks.  The minimum yard size, or setback lines, required for each
lot shall be in conformance with the requirements of the requirements of the
Zoning Ordinance.
   (E)   Road frontage.  Every lot or parcel shall have sufficient frontage and
access to a public street designated, designed and improved in accordance with
the terms of this chapter.
   (F)   Corner lots.  Corner lots shall be sufficiently larger than interior
lots to allow maintenance of setback lines on both streets.
   (G)   Double-frontage lots.  Double frontage lots are prohibited with the
exception of the need to buffer residential development from adverse influences
or to minimize the number of intersections with arterial streets and highways. 
A no-access screen planting buffer strip of ten feet shall be provided along
the lot lines adjoining the adverse influence or arterial street.
   (H)   Lots abutting a watercourse, drainage way, channel, or stream.  Lots
abutting a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream shall have additional
minimum width or depth as required to provide an adequate building site and
afford the minimum usable area required for front, rear, and side yards.
(Ord. 121410A, passed 1-11-2011)
§ 153.057  EASEMENTS.
   Adequate areas of suitable size and location shall be allocated for utility
easements.  As a general principle, the easements shall be at least 15 feet in
width, shall provide reasonable continuity from block to block and shall be
located at rear lot lines and alongside and front lot lines when deemed
necessary. The Plan Commission may require the reservation of a utility
easement at least ten feet in width, along the front yard line and parallel to
the adjoining street right-of-way.
   (A)   Subdivisions traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel, or
stream. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse drainage way, channel
or stream, adequate areas for storm water or drainage easements shall be
allocated for the purpose of widening, deepening, sloping, improving or
protecting the watercourses in accordance with the requirements of the
McCordsville Drainage Board or its agents, or the Hancock County Drainage Board
if the ditch is maintained by the Hancock County Surveyor.
   (B)   Placement.  Whenever practicable, the subdivider shall be encouraged
to design for the placement of utility lines underground, following the
required standards and specifications established by each utility company. The
location of each underground utility system shall be shown by appropriate
easement lines on the proposed plat.
(Ord. 121410A, passed 1-11-2011)
§ 153.058  ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   It is recognized that the subdivider, in creating non-residential
subdivisions, faces unique problems of lot design not normally encountered in
residential subdivisions.  For this reason, the initial emphasis of the Plan
Commission shall be upon street layout and block arrangement. Generally, the
procedural requirements shall be for the owner to follow the regular procedure
outlined in these regulations.  However, the subdivider need show only two lots
along with the street and block layout. Then from time to time, as prospective
buyers or users express interest in lots sized to their required
specifications, the owner shall submit an amendment to the approved recorded
subdivision plat for consideration.  Regular procedural requirements of the
Plan Commission following the receipt of a final subdivision plat shall then
apply, except those streets that have been built by following an approved set
of plans on the previously approved secondary plat shall not have to be rebuilt
because of the adoption of new criteria by the county. This shall also apply to
storm drainage facilities within the subdivision unless runoff characteristics
have been changed by the newly proposed improvements or unauthorized existing
improvements.
(Ord. 121410A, passed 1-11-2011)
§ 153.059  SOIL LIMITATIONS AND NATURAL FEATURES.
   Land with soils which are designated unsuitable for urban development, such
as flood plains and very poorly drained organic (muck) soils, characterized by
seasonal high water table at or near the surface, ponding, or frequent to
occasional flooding, shall not be platted for urban development or used for
nonagricultural structures. The condition of soils, such as being unsuitable
for urban development, shall be determined by soil survey data furnished by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture and Soil Conservation assisting the County Soil
and Water Conservation District.
(Ord. 121410A, passed 1-11-2011)
IMPROVEMENTS AND INSTALLATIONS
§ 153.070  IMPROVEMENTS AND INSTALLATIONS.
   Subdivision improvements shall be designed, furnished and installed by the
subdivider in accordance with requirements of this chapter, state and county
road standards, and other requirements of the state and county, and whenever
the applicable requirements of any other governmental unit are higher or more
restrictive, those requirements shall control any  application or plat
approval.  No final subdivision plat shall be approved by the Plan Commission
unless the following improvements have been completed as herein specified and
required, or the subdivider provides a financial guarantee as specified by this
chapter.
(Ord. 121410A, passed 1-11-2011)
§ 153.071  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Submission of construction drawings prior to construction.  After Plan
Commission approval of the primary plat and prior to any construction in the
subdivision, the subdivider shall submit copies of the construction drawings
for streets and drainage facilities to the town at least 45 days before
construction is to begin.
   (B)   supervision and construction.  Supervision and inspection of
construction of all required improvements shall be under the direction of the
Town Council.  All phases of construction are to be inspected on a regular
basis.  Notice is to be given to the offices of the McCordsville Drainage Board
or its agents and the Town Engineer 24 hours in advance.
   (C)   As-built plans required.  A set of mylar "as-built" or "record"
drawings shall be submitted to the McCordsville Drainage Board and Town
Engineer after the subdivision street and drainage construction is complete. In
addition, as each portion or section of a subdivision or project is platted,
the developer and/or builder shall provide to the Town Manager, a digital
representation of all aspects of said portion or section a digital format using
the Auto-Cad software or such other format as may be agreed to by the Town
Manager after consultation with the town's consulting engineers.
(Ord. 121410A, passed 1-11-2011)
§ 153.072  STREETS.
   Streets shall be installed in compliance with the following minimum
standards and requirements:
   (A)   Sub-base, base and pavement standards.  The minimum standards for
street construction shall be in accordance with the Town Standards and the
Standard Specifications of the State Department of Highways, current edition,
and all applicable up-to-date revisions to each edition, or subsequent
superseding edition thereafter referred to as the "Standard Specifications,"
unless otherwise required by this chapter.  Copies of the Standard
Specifications are on file  in the office of the Town Engineer. The minimum
thickness of sub-base, base, and pavement shall be as follows:
      (1)   The preparation of sub-grade for street pavements shall be
according to the following provisions:
         (a)   Unless otherwise provided, the sub-grade shall be prepared per
the Town Standards.  During sub-grade preparation and after its completion,
adequate drainage shall be provided at all times to prevent water from standing
on the sub-grade.  Sub-grades shall be so constructed to have as nearly as
possible uniform density throughout.  After compaction and final grading, the
sub-grade shall be finished with a roller weighing not less than ten tons.  At
areas not accessible to the roller, the required compaction shall be obtained
with mechanical tamps or vibrators.  All soft yielding or otherwise unsuitable
material which will not compact properly shall be removed.  Any holes or
depressions resulting from the removal of the unsuitable material shall be
filled with satisfactory material and compacted so as to be in conformance with
the surrounding sub-grade surface.  No placement of pavement shall be permitted
on un-inspected or unapproved sub-grade and at no time when the sub-grade is
frozen or muddy.  No hauling shall be done nor equipment moved over the sub-
grade when it is in a condition that would cause undue distortion to result. If
these conditions are present the sub-grade shall be protected with adequate
plank runways, mats or other satisfactory means if hauling is done thereon;
         (b)   All utility excavations under the pavement shall be backfilled
with Grade B borrow and construction shall conform to Section 211 of the
Standard Specifications or compacted thoroughly by other means. The gradation
for "B" borrow will be limited to nominal sizes greater than ½ inch;
         (c)   All sub-grade for streets shall be proof-rolled per the Town
Engineer and tested by an independent testing laboratory, if so directed by the
Town Engineer, and the cost of this testing shall be paid for by the
subdivider.
      (2)   Rigid pavement specifications.  The provisions for construction of
rigid pavement shall be as follows:
         (a)   For local and cul-de-sac streets, a six-inch plain concrete
pavement, as set out in division (3)(a) below shall be used, or four inches of
compacted #53 stone on four inches of #2 stone on lime stabilized sub-grade per
the Town Standards;
         (b)   For collector streets, an eight-inch reinforced concrete
pavement, or six inches of compacted #53 stone on four inches of #2 stone on
lime stabilized sub-grade per the Town Standards.
      (3)   Rigid pavement construction.  The provisions for construction of
rigid (plain concrete) pavement construction shall be as follows:
         (a)   At the time of placement of the concrete, the sub-grade shall be
properly dampened just prior to the placement where it has become dry, where
the surface has been removed by final grading, or for any other reason it has
not been properly dampened.  Concrete pavement shall be in accordance with
Section 500 of the Standard Specifications or any subsequent amendments
thereto.  Concrete shall be finished by machine or vibratory screed except on
widened portions, intersections or other places where hand-finishing will be
permitted. Weakened plane or dummy, transverse, or contraction joints shall be
placed not to exceed 20-foot spacing.  Closer spacing to average 15 feet will
be encouraged. Transverse contraction joints may be of formed or sawed dummy
groove, ribbon or pre-molded strip type, and shall be 1/4 the pavement depth.
When transverse joints are to be formed by sawing, care must be taken to
prevent the formation of cracks due to contraction of the slab. All transverse
joints shall be sawed within eight hours after the placing of the concrete. 
Expansion joints, with 1/2-inch preformed joint filler, shall be placed at

§ 154.024  TECHNICAL REVIEW COMMITTEE.
   The Plan Commission may establish a Technical Review Committee for the
purpose of providing detailed reviews and recommendations to the Plan
Commission concerning any proposed development plans or subdivision plats that
may from time to time be submitted.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.  The purpose of the Technical Review Committee is
to provide written recommendations pertaining to technical aspects of design
and construction plans; however, approval or disapproval of a development or
subdivision is clearly the responsibility of the Plan Commission.
   (B)   Establishment.  The Technical Review Committee is hereby established
under both the Zoning Ordinance and the Subdivision Control Ordinance to serve
the differing needs of these two documents.  The Committee shall be made up of
the same members under both ordinances in order to facilitate coordination of
the decision making by the Plan Commission with respect to the design and
construction aspects of these two documents.
   (C)   Composition.  Committee membership shall be at the request of the
Administrative Officer.  The Administrative Officer may request the assistance
of members of public and semi-public local and state departments, agencies and
organizations, including but not limited to the following (or their designees):
      (1)   Town Planner, Chair;
      (2)   Town Engineer;
      (3)   Town Street Commissioner;
      (4)   County Highway Superintendent;
      (5)   Wastewater Superintendent;
      (6)   Water Superintendent;
      (7)   Fire Chief;
      (8)   Police Chief;
      (9)   Building Department;
      (10)   County Health Department;
      (11)   A representative and/or designee of the County Soil and Water
Conservation District; and
      (12)   Any other persons deemed appropriate by the Plan Commission.
   (D)   Roles and responsibilities.  The Technical Review Committee shall
limit its attention and recommendations to the design and construction aspects
of the proposed development or subdivision with emphasis placed on public
improvements, utilities, drainage, landscaping, parking, signage, and other
development standards. Projects shall be reviewed for compliance with the
Zoning Ordinance and compatibility with the Comprehensive Plan, as amended from
time to time.
   (E)   Committee meetings.  The Technical Review Committee is strictly a
committee and does not have the authority to take any official action; however,
the Committee shall advertise for and hold public meetings. The Committee shall
meet as prescribed by the Calendar of Meetings and Filing Deadlines, and all
Technical Review Committee meetings shall be open to the public. The Committee
shall then submit its review comments and recommendations to the Advisory Plan
Commission.
   (F)   Authority.  The Technical Review Committee shall have the authority to
request that a docket be continued by the Advisory Plan Commission until the
Committee has reviewed revised plans submitted by a petitioner(s).
(Ord. 121410, passed 1-11-2011)
§ 154.025  ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW COMMITTEE.
   The Plan Commission may establish an Architectural Review Committee for the
purpose of providing detailed reviews and recommendations to the Plan
Commission concerning any proposed building elevation that may from time to
time be submitted.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.  The purpose of the Architectural Review Committee
is to provide written recommendations pertaining to technical aspects of
building elevations for the purpose of providing for the orderly and harmonious
appearance of structures throughout the town.  For the purposes of
administering and enforcing this chapter, the Architectural Review Committee is
not to be confused with an Architectural Review Board which is typically
concerned with protecting and preserving historic areas, sites and buildings in
a community.
   (B)   Establishment.  The Architectural Review Committee is hereby
established under both the Zoning Ordinance and the Subdivision Control
Ordinance to serve the differing needs of these two documents.  The Committee
shall be made up of the same members under both ordinances in order to
facilitate coordination of the decision making by the Plan Commission with
respect to the design and construction aspects of these two documents.
   (C)   Composition.  Committee membership shall be at the request of the
Administrative Officer.  The Administrative Officer may request the assistance
of members of public and semi-public local and state departments, agencies and
organizations. The Architectural Review Committee shall be chaired by the
Administrative Officer, or his or her designee, and shall consist of at least
one licensed architect residing or working in the town.  Remaining members
shall be residents of the town interested in civic matters.
   (D)   Roles and responsibilities.  The Architectural Review Committee shall
limit its attention and recommendations to the architectural design standards
of this chapter. Projects shall be reviewed for compliance with the Zoning
Ordinance and compatibility with the McCordsville Comprehensive Plan, as
amended from time to time. Members of the Architectural Review Committee shall:
      (1)   Review the Town of McCordsville Architectural Design Standards
contained herein and adopted planned unit development ordinances, and any
additional architectural design requirements imposed as part of an overlay
district, such as the Highway Corridor Overlay district.
      (2)   Review applications for their compatibility with all applicable
standards, regulations, and commitments.
      (3)   Offer opinions as to what physical alterations or enhancements
could be made to projects presented in order to improve the aesthetic quality
of the project and the town's overall physical environment.
      (4)   Make recommendations regarding architectural issues raised on
appeal to the appropriate governing body (e.g. Board of Zoning Appeals) in
connection with the issuance or denial of entitlements or other project
approvals or denials.
      (5)   Zoning commitments, if applicable.
   (E)   Committee meetings.  The Architectural Review Committee is strictly a
committee and does not have the authority to take any official action; however,
the Committee shall advertise for and hold public meetings. The Committee shall
meet as prescribed by the Calendar of Meetings and Filing Deadlines, and all
meetings of the committee shall be open to the public. The Committee shall then
submit its review comments and recommendations to the Advisory Plan Commission
and/or Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (F)   Authority.  The Architectural Review Committee shall have the
authority to request that a docket be continued by the Advisory Plan Commission
or Board of Zoning Appeals until the Committee has reviewed revised plans
submitted by a petitioner(s).
(Ord. 121410, passed 1-11-2011)
ZONING DISTRICTS
§ 154.040  OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   The Town of McCordsville is divided into zoning district classifications as
described and defined in this chapter and as shown on the Zoning Map.  The
Zoning Map, together with all explanatory matter thereon, is hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.
   (A)   Identification.  The Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the
signature of the President of the Plan Commission and attested by the
Administrative Officer under the following words: "This is to certify that this
is the Official Zoning Map of McCordsville, Indiana, adopted, and hereby
supersedes and replaces any and all previous zoning maps." The Official Zoning
Map shall also include the ordinance number by which it was adopted, the date
of adoption, and the dates of any subsequent amendments.
   (B)   Location.  The Official Zoning Map shall hereafter be kept in the
custody of the Administrative Officer, or his or her designee. Regardless of
the existence of purported copies of the Zoning Map which may from time to time
be made or published, the Official Zoning Map located in the office of the
Administrative Officer, or his or her designee, shall be the final authority as
to the current zoning statutes of land and water areas, buildings, and other
structures within the jurisdiction of the Plan Commission.
   (C)   Copies.  Copies of the Official Zoning Map may be made and distributed
to interested persons. All copies of the Zoning Map shall be labeled as copies
and include the date on which it was obtained. A fee may be established for the
purchase of Zoning Map copies.
   (D)   Amendment or replacement.  No changes of any nature shall be made on
the Official Zoning Map except in compliance with the procedures set forth in
§§
154.020 through
154.025, Administration. Any unauthorized change by any property owner(s) or
person(s) shall be considered a violation of this chapter.
      (1)   Amendment (rezoning).  Upon the passage of a map amendment
(rezoning), the Town Council shall certify a copy of the amendment to the
Administrative Officer. The Administrative Officer, or his or her designee,
shall cause the change to be made to the Official Zoning Map in accordance with
the amendment. The Administrative Officer, or his or her designee, shall cause
the Official Zoning Map to show a notation, either electronically or through a
permanent-pen hand written note, identifying the ordinance number, ordinance
title, and date of adoption by the Town Council.
      (2)   Errors and omissions.  Other revisions may be made to correct
drafting or other errors or omissions in the Zoning Map, but shall not have the
effect of amending the map.
      (3)   Replacement.  In the event that the Official Zoning Map becomes
damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature or
number of changes and additions, the Plan Commission may, by resolution,
recommend to the Town Council adoption of a new Official Zoning Map which shall
supersede the prior map. The new Official Zoning Map may correct drafting or
other errors or omissions in the prior Official Zoning Map. The replacement map
shall be identified by the signature of the President of the Plan Commission
and attested by the Administrative Officer under the following words: "This is
to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map of McCordsville, Indiana, and
hereby supersedes and replaces all previous zoning maps."
      (4)   Preservation of the prior Official Zoning Map.  Unless the prior
map has been lost or completely destroyed, it or any significant parts shall be
preserved, together with any available records of its adoption and amendment.
   (E)   Interpretation of district boundaries.
      (1)   Interpretation procedures.
         (a)   Administrative Officer interpretation.  The Administrative
Officer, or his or her designee, shall determine the applicable zoning for each
property in the Plan Commission's jurisdiction.  Any decision of the
Administrative Officer may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
         (b)   Plan Commission interpretation provision..  In the event that
the Administrative Officer cannot definitively determine the location of a
district boundary, immediate action on any affected application shall be
delayed until such time when the Plan Commission determines the zoning district
boundary. The Plan Commission shall interpret the location of the district
boundary with reference to the scale of the Official Zoning Map and the
purposes set forth in all relevant provisions of this chapter. This
interpretation may occur as part of a regular or special Plan Commission
meeting and shall not require a public hearing. Decisions of the Plan
Commission may not be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals, but may be
appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction.
      (2)   Interpretation standards.  Zoning district boundaries illustrated
on the Official Zoning Map shall be interpreted as follows:
         (a)   Streets and easements.  Boundaries shown within the lines of
roads, easements, and transportation rights-of-way shall be deemed to follow
the centerlines.
         (b)   Property lines.  Boundaries indicated as following section or
fractional sectional lines, platted lot lines, or municipal corporation limits
shall be construed to follow such lines.
         (c)   Bodies of water.  Boundaries indicated as approximately
following the center line of streams, rivers, or other bodies of water shall be
construed to follow such center lines. Boundaries indicated as following a
shore line shall be construed as moving with any change in the actual shore
line.
         (d)   Divided lots.  In the event that a boundary line divides a lot
or parcel, the Administrative Officer, or his or her designee, shall determine
the applicable zoning district. If a portion of a lot or parcel is in an
overlay district, the entire lot or parcel shall be deemed as being within the
overlay district.  The Administrative Officer may require a rezone or replat of
the site if any portion of a construction or development proposal overlaps two
or more zoning districts. The petitioner shall be responsible for filing the
appropriate forms and for applying the appropriate filing fees to rezone or
replat the lot or parcel.
         (e)   Extensions of lines.  Boundaries indicated as parallel to or
extensions of the features listed above in divisions (a) through (d) above
shall be construed as such.
         (f)   The Conservation and Flood Plain Overlay District boundaries. 
Boundaries of the Conservation and Flood Plain Overlay District shall coincide
with the boundaries as documented on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps for Hancock
County, Indiana.
      (3)   Effect of vacation on zoning district boundaries.  Whenever any
street, alley, public way, railroad right-of-way, or other similar area is
vacated by the proper authority, the adjoining zoning districts shall be
extended automatically to the center of the vacated area. All areas included in
the vacation shall then be subject to all applicable regulations of the
extended zoning district. In the event of a partial vacation, the adjoining
zoning district, or the zoning district nearest the portion vacated, shall be
extended automatically to include all of the vacated area.
(Ord. 121410, passed 1-11-2011)
§ 154.041  ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICT CLASSIFICATIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the town is divided into zoning district
classifications.  Each of the following districts is intended to stand alone
and is not part of a hierarchy system of land use regulation.  For example,
uses permitted in a Neighborhood Commercial (CN) district are not automatically
permitted in a Regional Commercial (CR) district.  Only those uses expressly
permitted as prescribed by the Official Use Schedule shall be permitted in said
district.
   (A)   Residential districts.  Residential zoning districts are intended to
accommodate areas for residences and public and semi-public uses (e.g. parks
and open space) which are normally associated with residential neighborhoods. 
In some instances, retail goods and services may be appropriate.  However, when
permitted, such uses shall not detract from the overall residential character
of the neighborhood.  Development and redevelopment in these districts should
be served by sewer and water utilities and have convenient access via local
roads and streets.  The underlying purpose for the town's seven residential
districts described below is the creation of a stable and orderly residential
environment. Each of the following residential districts is intended to
differentiate between density and housing needs.  All residential districts
should be served by sewer and water utilities.
      (1)   R1, Low Density Residential.  All R1 districts are intended to
accommodate areas of low density (less than one dwelling unit per acre),
single-family residences.
      (2)   R2, Low-Medium Density Residential.  All R2 districts are intended
to accommodate areas of low to medium density (1 - 1.99 dwelling units per
acre), single-family residences.
      (3)   R3, Medium Density Residential.  All R3 districts are intended to
accommodate areas of moderate density (2 - 2.49 dwelling units per acre),
single- or two-family residences.
      (4)   R4, High Density Residential.  All R4 districts are intended to
accommodate area of high density (2.5 - 2.99 dwelling units per acre), single-
or two-family residences.
      (5)   R5, High Density Residential.  All R5 districts are intended to
accommodate areas of the highest density (three or more dwelling units per
acre), single- or two-family residences.
      (6)   MF1, Low-Medium Density Multi-family Residential.  All MF1
districts are intended to accommodate areas of low to moderate density (less
than eight units per acre) multi-family attached housing such as duplexes and
townhomes.  MF1 districts may also be used to provide a transition between some
single-family or two-family residential districts and non-residential
districts.
      (7)   MF2, Medium-High Density Multi-family Residential.  All MF2
districts are intended to accommodate areas of higher density (eight or more
units per acre) multi-family housing such as apartments and condominiums.  MF2
districts may also be used to provide transition between some single-family or
two-family residential districts and non-residential districts.
   (B)   Commercial districts.  Commercial zoning districts are intended to
accommodate different types of businesses and commercial uses.  The intent is
to establish compact districts for like uses and better provide for efficient
traffic movement, parking facilities, and police and fire protection. 
Development and redevelopment in these districts should be served by sewer and
water utilities and have convenient access via local collector and arterials
streets.  In general, industrial uses are excluded due to the hazards and
nuisances they often present.  All commercial business districts shall be
served by sewer and water utilities.
      (1)   CN, Neighborhood Commercial.  All CN districts are intended to
accommodate smaller areas of land suitable for convenience stores, services,
and amenities within close proximity to residential areas.  They should enable
the development of small scale, mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented neighborhood
centers located at the intersection of major thoroughfares.  These districts
should be free of larger retailers, such as "big box" stores or other regional
retail uses with 7,500 or more square feet in gross floor area, that do not
serve the immediate needs of the neighborhood.
      (2)   CO, Professional Business Office.  All CO districts are intended to
accommodate moderate to large areas of land suitable for professional office
centers with complimentary retail uses and support facilities.  These districts
may also be used to transition between non-residential districts and
residential districts, provided they are limited to a maximum of three stories
in height.
      (3)   CR, Regional Commercial.  All CR districts are intended to
accommodate larger areas of land suitable for a variety of businesses that
serve a regional market, or require convenient access to arterial roadways and
major collector streets that are designed to carry relatively large volumes of
vehicular traffic.  These districts can be used alone as well as in combination
with other zoning districts to create community shopping, entertainment,
services and public gathering spaces.  These districts should be focused and
centralized at intersections rather than sprawled out along the highway so as
not to define the highway itself.
   (C)   Industrial districts.  Industrial zoning districts are intended to
accommodate low and medium intensity industrial business within the town by
providing for suitable space for existing industries and their expansion as
well as for future industrial development.  Development and redevelopment in
these districts should be served by sewer and water utilities and have
convenient access via major collector and arterials streets.  Performance
standards, parking specifications, and yard regulations prescribed by this
chapter ensure safe industrial development that is compatible with adjacent
land uses.  In general, all industrial districts should be sited near
railroads, or collectors or arterial roadways in order to meet the anticipated
transportation needs of anticipated land use activities.  All industrial
districts shall be served by sewer and water utilities.
      (1)   I1, Low Intensity Industrial.  All I1 districts are intended to
accommodate moderate to large land areas suitable for warehousing, research and
development, or similar type uses where all activities take place within
enclosed buildings.  In this instance, low intensity industries are those
industrial activities that are less likely to cause conditions that would be
objectionable to neighboring properties.
      (2)   I2, Medium Intensity Industrial.  All I2 districts are intended to
accommodate production or assembly of modern industrial parts.  In general,
greater separation is needed between industries located in an I2 district and
residential or commercial areas compared to those separation distances required
in an I1 district.
   (D)   Overlay Districts.
      (1)   AO, Airport Overlay.  The AO district is intended to regulate uses
within close proximity to the Mount Comfort Airport further ensuring
compatibility through additional regulations regarding height and further
limiting the types of uses allowed within certain zones.
      (2)   HCO, Highway Corridor Overlay.  The HCO district is intended to
address the unique characteristics of the properties adjacent to the two
primary transportation corridors that run through the town.  Citing unique
traffic management needs, development pressures, and aesthetic quality, the
purpose of the HCO district is to require additional development standards and
regulations without modifying the development objectives of the underlying base
zoning districts.
      (3)   R/WCO, Right-of-Way Corridor Overlay. The R/WCO district is
intended to address land uses and facilities located within all public rights-
of-way within the incorporated limits of the town. The purpose of this overlay
district is to provide for functional and appropriate land use and development
standards that will allow for suitable, reliable public and private
telecommunications services. The town recognizes the need for the use of small-
cell facilities for telecommunications in order to serve the needs of the area,
and in doing so, there is a need to minimize the adverse, undesirable impacts
of such facilities.
   (E)   Other districts.
      (1)   P, Public/Semi-public.  All P districts are intended to accommodate
large-scale public facilities and other public/semi-public institutions where a
large number of people gather or congregate.
      (2)   Old Town.  In general, the Old Town district is intended to
accommodate residential uses and residential conversions with an emphasis on
protecting the residential character of the original town plat.  In this
district, commercial establishments are intended to serve the residents of and
visitors to the town rather than the motoring public.
      (3)   TC, Town Center.  In general, all TC districts are intended to
accommodate a mix of land uses and serve as a primary commercial activity
center, wherein residents and visitors can find a vast range of goods and
services, and entertainment.  It is further intended that all TC districts
ensure a pedestrian-friendly environment with multiple destinations for
working, shopping, and entertainment.  In most instances, residential dwellings
are encouraged, provided they are not single-family detached homes.
         (a)   In undeveloped area of town, the TC district is intended to
become the most intensely developed areas within the community.
         (b)   In established areas of town, TC districts are intended to
ensure the continued viability of neighborhoods and businesses.  In these
instances, the standards and regulations are intended to maintain contextually
appropriate setbacks, uses and other standards consistent with the McCordsville
Comprehensive Plan.  Small parcels may need to be consolidated to provide
development sites large enough for today's building and parking needs, but
should be designed with an emphasis on pedestrian traffic rather than vehicular
traffic, keeping parking lots to the sides and rears of the building where
possible, emphasizing the front entrances, incorporating numerous buildings
openings (e.g. windows and doors), and providing screening for parked cars.
      (4)   PUD, Planned Unit Developments.  All PUD districts are intended to
accommodate development of land in areas where there are site limitations or
unique site characteristics.  It is the intent of the town to encourage
innovation in land development practices through the use of the planned unit
development process.

SPECIFIC USE STANDARDS
§ 154.060  ACCESSORY USE AND STRUCTURE STANDARDS, GENERAL.
   (A)   Board of Zoning Appeals approval.  To vary from the following specific
use standards shall require review and approval from the Board of Zoning
Appeals pursuant to the development standards variance process prescribed by
this chapter.
   (B)   Purpose and intent.  The intent of these accessory use and structure
standards is to address the unique features of these types of structures and
uses; allow the reasonable utilization of property; and to ensure the provision
of adequate light, air, and circulation on each property.
   (C)   Order of establishment.  No accessory use or structure, or incidental
use or structure, shall be permitted to be located, placed, or established on
any lot prior to the issuance of an improvement location permit for a primary
structure, or an occupancy permit for a primary land use. All accessory uses
and structures shall be permitted only in association with, and on the same lot
as, the primary use or structure.
   (D)   Incidental uses and structures.  The following shall be considered
incidental uses and structures and shall meet the requirements specified
herein.

§ 154.061  TEMPORARY USE AND STRUCTURE STANDARDS, GENERAL.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.  The purpose of these temporary use and structure
standards is to establish minimum standards for the temporary use of property
and the placement of temporary structures in order to:
      (1)   Accommodate the temporary needs or properties and land uses;
      (2)   Ensure that temporary uses do not become permanent without proper
scrutiny; and
      (3)   Protect the public welfare from the unique hazards that can be
created by temporary uses and structures.
   (B)   General.  The following standards shall apply to all properties within
the town.
      (1)   Temporary structure standards.  All temporary structures shall
comply with the following requirements:
         (a)   Applicable development standards.  Temporary structures must
meet all development standards for a permanent accessory structure unless
otherwise specified in this subchapter.
         (b)   Temporary structure time limits.  Any temporary structure used
for a permitted primary use may be permitted for up to 120 days in a calendar
year, unless otherwise specified by this chapter. Temporary structures used for
a permitted primary religious-place of worship or school use may be permitted
for up to two years.
      (2)   Temporary use and structure standards.  Temporary uses and
structures are permitted in any zoning district provided that the use is a
permitted use in that zoning district. All temporary uses and structures shall
comply with the following requirements:
         (a)   Permit requirements.  All temporary uses and structures shall
require a temporary use permit unless otherwise specified in this chapter. No
temporary use or structure, or the related signs, lighting, parking, and the

being obtained.
         (b)   Time limits.  Temporary uses and/or structures that seek
extensions of the initial time limits established in this chapter shall be
subject to administrative approval.
            1.   An extension of up to 120 days may be granted by the
Administrative Officer in any given calendar year. The Board of Zoning Appeals
may grant subsequent extensions after a public hearing is held. For religious-
place of worship or school uses the Administrative Officer may approve a one-
time extension for up to two additional years. The Board of Zoning Appeals may
grant subsequent extensions after a public hearing is held. The Board or
Administrative Officer may impose reasonable conditions as part of its
approval.
            2.   No extensions of the time limits described in this subchapter
shall be granted for any temporary use or structure known to violate any
requirements of this chapter as it exists at the time the extension is
requested.  An extension shall be considered invalid if the temporary use or
structure was in violation of this chapter at the time the extension was
sought.
         (c)   Removal.  All temporary uses and/or structures shall be removed
and the site reverted to its original condition within the duration of the
permit or any extension thereof.
      (3)   Construction trailers.  Construction trailers are permitted as
temporary structures only during times of construction activity. Construction
trailers shall not be located in any required setback or buffer yard.
Construction trailers may be permitted for up to two years, and may be extended
by the Board of Zoning Appeals or the Administrative Officer via an unlimited
number of one-year extensions. The Board or Administrative Officer may impose
reasonable conditions as part of its approval.
      (4)   Construction dumpsters.  Dumpsters for construction-related debris
shall be permitted as temporary structures only during times of construction
activity. Dumpsters shall not be located in any required setback or buffer
yard. Construction dumpsters in residential districts shall be held to the time

similar activities conducted outside of an enclosed building, excluding
residential garage/yard sales, may be permitted on a temporary basis in any
zoning district in the town upon obtaining a temporary use permit from the
Administrative Officer.  The permit may be issued without a public hearing,

application.
         (b)   Criteria.  Before approving an application for a temporary
outdoor land use permit, the Administrative Officer, or his or her designee,
shall first find that the application is complete and then that the proposed
temporary outdoor land use meets all of the following criteria:

as the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance and the Comprehensive Plan, the
Administrative Officer may approve the permit or approve it with conditions.
            2.   If the Administrative Officer finds that the proposed
temporary outdoor land use is not consistent with the requirements of this
section or the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance and the Comprehensive Plan, he
or she shall deny the application.
            3.   In making his or her determination on the application, the
Administrative Officer may, in his or her discretion, first consult with the
Plan Commission.
            4.   An appeal of a decision by the Administrative Officer relative
to the denial of a temporary outdoor land use permit for a temporary use may be
taken to the Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant to the provisions for appeal set
forth in this chapter.
         (d)   Permit.  A written temporary outdoor land use permit shall be

discretion of the Administrative Officer, insure compliance with the terms and
conditions of the temporary outdoor land use permit and fully reimburse the
town for all expenses incurred, including legal and administrative costs, in
correcting any failure on the part of the permit holder and repairing any
damage caused thereby; and
            5.   The signature of the Administrative Officer.
         (e)   Revocation.  The Administrative Officer may revoke a permit at

“The developer or property owner (lot owner) shall be responsible for
constructing a five-foot wide concrete sidewalk of 4,000 PSI strength plain
cement four inches thick, sloped one-quarter inch per foot toward the street
with expansion joints each 48 inches along the entire street frontage of their
respective lot.” The sidewalk shall be constructed prior to completing finish
lot grading. The sidewalk shall be located one foot inside the planned public
right-of-way line, (not on the lot) and parallel to the street right-of-way
line, or it may be located inside a private street easement or access easement,
when the street is not a public right-of-way. The lot owner and/or developer is
responsible for the repair and maintenance of the sidewalk for the initial one
year from completion of residence. Thereafter, the homeowners’ association
shall be responsible for maintenance and upkeep of the sidewalk. However,
except any damage done by the adjoining lot landowner and/or developer during
construction shall be corrected by the landowner and/or developer. All public
sidewalks shall comply with all Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as
amended, requirements and in the situation of a conflict between ADA rules,
covenants or other regulations, the ADA shall govern.”

public building shall have a ground floor area of no less than 2,000 square
feet and comply with the same architectural guidelines and covenants which are
applicable to the residences proposed for the development.
   (C)   Public safety.  In multi-family developments the petitioner/developer
shall submit the development plan to the governing fire agency for review to
determine if the plan shall include provisions to preserve land for future fire
structures. If the fire agency so determines that a need exists for land, the
Plan Commission may require, the petitioner to include in the plans of the
development, such reserved land areas up to two acres. At such time as that
land is platted, the developer shall include the land in the plat and deed the
land to the governing fire agency within 60 days thereafter, or upon taking
title of the land.
   (D)   Community amenity.  Multi-family developments greater than 120 and
less than 239 acres shall include provisions for public recreation such as
baseball fields, soccer fields, basketball court, tennis courts, fitness trails
and the like. The land set aside for such uses shall be a minimum of five acres
and shall increase five acres for each additional 120 acres that the gross
number of acres exceeds 239 acres. The park land shall be transferred to the
McCordsville Park Board upon recording the plat for the area upon the consent
of the Board. If at the time of recordation of the plat, the Park Board does
not accept the transfer of the park, the land shall be deeded to the homeowners
association for maintenance and control. After five years from the date of
recordation, if the Park Board does not formally request title to the land, the
homeowners association shall use the land for the benefit of the development as
set forth above. The use may include park amenities, sports fields, trails,
community buildings and other uses which meet the intent of this section of the

facilities shall not be approved unless the petitioner submits an affidavit
that the telecommunications equipment planned for the proposed structure cannot
be accommodated on an existing or approved utility pole, electrical
transmission tower, other wireless support structure, or other structure due to
one or more of the following reasons:
            1.   The planned telecommunications equipment would exceed the
structural capacity of the existing or approved utility pole, electrical
transmission tower, other wireless support structure, or other structure as
documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer and the existing
or approved utility pole, electrical transmission tower, other wireless support
structure, or other structure cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to
accommodate the planned telecommunication equipment at a reasonable cost;
            2.   The planned telecommunications equipment would cause
interference impacting the usability of other existing telecommunication
equipment at the site if placed on existing structures. Supportive
documentation by a qualified and licensed professional engineer indicating the
interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost;
            3.   The existing or approved utility pole, electrical transmission
tower, other wireless support structure, or other structure within the search
radius cannot accommodate the planned telecommunication equipment at a height
necessary to function reasonably as documented by a qualified and licensed
professional engineer;
            4.   Other unforeseen reasons make it unfeasible or impossible to
locate the planned telecommunication equipment upon an existing or approved
utility pole, electrical transmission tower, other wireless support structure,
or other structure; or
            5.   The petitioner has been unable to enter a commonly reasonable
lease term with the owners of existing or approved utility pole, electrical
transmission tower, other wireless support structure, or other structure.
         (c)   The overall maximum antenna and tower height shall be 50 feet
from grade level.
         (d)   The minimum tower separation shall be 1,000 feet between any
other support structures primarily used for telecommunications, as measured in
any direction between support structures, not necessarily a dimension measured
parallel to a road right-of-way.
         (e)   Support structures must be metal or fiberglass monopoles
matching the design and color of the town's non-residential street lights, as
amended. The town reserves the right to require luminaires on support
structures that match the town's street light luminaire specifications. Such
luminaires shall be maintained in good working order, be illuminated consistent
with the timing of other street lights along the corridor, at the cost of the
applicant, including the cost of electricity.
         (f)   Any antenna equipment mounted to the support structure shall
also be matching in color to the support structure.
         (g)   All facility equipment at a single facility (with the exception
of the antenna itself) shall be ground mounted in a cabinet having an area not
to exceed 40 cubic feet and no greater than 48 inches in overall height. Under
special circumstances, contingent upon a mutual agreement, the town may allow a
pole mounted cabinet with dimensions not exceeding 20 inches by 20 inches by
six inches (20" x 20" x 6"), ground mounted cabinet not to exceed two feet by
two feet by one foot (2' x 2' x 1') and other considerations, such as, but not
limited to, the addition of shrouding and landscaping to mitigate the visual
impact of the equipment. If a mutual agreement cannot be reached, then the town
Public Works Committee shall intervene and make a determination.
         (h)   All support structures shall have a plaque identifying the
structure, the owner, and the owner's contact information; said plaque shall
not exceed 0.25 square feet.
         (i)   All support structures shall avoid conflicts with sidewalks,
multi-use trails, and other roadway and utility infrastructure.
         (j)   All conduit, wiring and fiber shall be concealed within the
support structure and/or shall be buried underground. All new electrical
service lines to the support structure and/or equipment shall also be
underground. Existing aerial electrical service lines may remain. Under no
circumstance shall any service drop crossing a street or roadway be run in any
manner other than underground via a bore.
         (k)   Wireless support structures and facilities shall be designed to
blend into the surrounding environment through the use of color, camouflaging
and architectural treatment. The entire facility shall be aesthetically and
architecturally compatible with its environment. The use of materials
compatible with the surrounding environment is required for associated support
structures, which shall be designed to architecturally match the exterior of
residential or commercial structures within the neighborhood or area. Specific
requirements for aesthetics of the wireless support structures and facilities
shall be in accordance with the standards established by the Public Works
Committee, from time to time.
      (4)   Operation. A petitioner receiving a permit for a: (1) new
construction of a wireless support structure; (2) substantial modification of
wireless support structure; or (3) collocation of wireless facilities on an
existing structure inherently agrees that if the wireless support structure or
wireless facilities are not used for a period of six months, they will be
removed by the facilities owner at its expense. Should such owner fail to
remove the wireless support structure or wireless facilities after 30 days from
the date of notice of violation is issued by the town, the town may remove such
structure or facilities and bill the owner for the costs of removal and clean-
up and restoration of the site. The owner of any facility shall annually file a
copy of any inspections completed on such wireless support structure or
wireless facilities with the town for continued operation and use of the
structure or facility, and provide documentation of compliance with the
financial assurance provisions of division (C) of this section.
      (5)   Confidential. All confidential information submitted by the
petitioner shall be maintained to the extent authorized by I.C. 5-14-3 et seq.

the choice of location demonstrating that collocation of wireless facilities on
an existing wireless support structure was not a viable option based upon
documentation by a qualified and licensed professional engineer.
            2.   Single application. An applicant may submit one application
for multiple wireless service facilities that are located within R/WCO. The
permit authority may issue a single permit for all wireless support structures
and service facilities included in the application rather than individual
permits for each wireless support structure and service facility.
            3.   Procedure.
               a.   Determination of completion/defects. Within ten business
days of receipt of an application, the permit authority shall review the
application to determine if the application is complete. If the permit
authority determines that an application is not complete, the permit authority
shall notify the applicant in writing, which shall be an email within the
specified time period, and followed-up by a mailed letter which may not be
within the specified time period, of all defects in the application. An
applicant that receives a written notice of incompletion may cure the defects
and resubmit the application within 30 business days of receiving the notice.
If an applicant is unable to cure the defects within the 30 day period, the
applicant shall notify the permit authority of the additional time the
applicant requires to cure the defects.
               b.   Decision by permit authority. Not more than 14 business
days after the permit authority makes an initial determination of completeness,
the permit authority shall: (1) review the application to determine if it
complies with applicable requirements of this division (E); (2) review the
application to determine if it complies with standards required as established
by the permit authority; and (3) notify the applicant in writing, which shall
be an email within the specified time period, and followed-up by a mailed
letter which may not be within the specified time period, whether the
application is approved or denied. However, if the applicant requested
additional time to cure defects in the application, the 14 business days shall
be extended for a corresponding, reasonable amount of time.
            4.   Written determinations. A written determination, which shall
be delivered via an email within the specified time period and followed-up by a
mailed letter which may not be within the specified time period, shall state
clearly the basis for the decision to approve or deny an application. If the
permit authority denies an application, the written notice must include
substantial evidence in support of the denial. A notice is considered written
if it is included in the minutes of a public meeting of the permit authority.
         (b)   Substantial modification.
            1.   Contents of application. An application for substantial
modification of a wireless support structure shall include: (a) the name,
business address, email address, telephone number, and point of contact for the
applicant; (b) the location of the proposed or affected wireless support
structure or wireless facility; and (c) a small cell facility construction
plan, as defined herein, that describes the proposed modifications to the
wireless support structure and all equipment and network components, including
antennas, transmitters, receivers, base stations, power supplies, cabling, and
related equipment.
            2.   Single application. An applicant may submit one application
for multiple modifications of wireless support structures and service
facilities that are located within R/WCO. The permit authority may issue a
single permit for all wireless support structures and service facilities
included in the application rather than individual permits for each wireless
support structure and service facility.

industrial operations. Where applicable the determination of compliance of
industrial operations with the requirements of this section shall be determined
by the Advisory Plan Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals, or Administrative
Officer when consistent with the petition review processes established by this
chapter.
   (E)   General standards.  All uses placed into operation after the effective
date of this chapter shall comply with all federal and state standards, as well
as the following general standards in the interests of protecting public
health, safety, and general welfare and lessening potential damage to property.
No use in existence on the effective date of this chapter shall be altered or
modified in a manner that conflicts with these standards.
      (1)   Fire and explosive hazards.  Firefighting equipment and prevention
measures shall be subject to the approval of the governing fire agency and
shall be readily available and apparent when any activity involving the

(Ord. 121410, passed 1-11-2011)
§ 154.076  LAND USE REQUIREMENTS.
   Each land use is either permitted by right or by special exception.  For the
purposes of administering and enforcing this chapter, the location of a given
land use shall be as prescribed by the Official Schedule of Uses.  Any use not
designated by a "P" or "S" in the subject district shall be considered to be a
prohibited use in the subject district.  The Administrative Officer may
determine into which category a use is placed if it is not specifically listed
but is similar to another use that is listed in the Official Schedule of Uses. 
This determination may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant to
§§
154.200 through
154.210, Procedures and Permits, of this chapter.
   (A)   Compatibility with surrounding land uses.  All proposed developments
within the town will be reviewed for their compatibility with the surrounding
neighborhoods, the natural environment, and their ability to create pleasing
transitions between land uses.  To decrease the level of incompatibility
between residential and non-residential uses, landscape buffers may be
required.  Refer to § 165.120, Buffering and Screening Standards, of this
chapter.
   (B)   Residential uses.
      (1)   Determining density and open space.
         (a)   To allow greater flexibility and variety in the creation of
residential subdivisions while preserving significant community and natural
resources, residential subdivisions are required to arrange the residential
units on areas of the project site best suited for development and protect at
least 25% of the land for open space uses.  A minimum of 6% of the land shall
be for active or passive recreation purposes.  Open spaces must be accessible
to residents of the subdivision without crossing a private lot.
         (b)   Residential development within a project may not exceed the
gross density of the identified on
Chapter 154, Appendix B, Bulk Use Standards Matrix, of this chapter.  No
minimum lot size is required, but the applicant must meet all of the other
development standards of the residential zoning classification and the
requirements of this chapter.
         (c)   The development potential of the property is determined by
multiplying the area of the tract times the density permitted by the zoning
district.
         (d)   The minimum open space requirement is calculated by multiplying
the area of the tract by 0.25.  The recreation open space requirement is
calculated by multiplying the area of the tract by 0.06.
         (e)   Land designated for open space uses shall be restricted from
further subdivision through the use of conservation easements in a form
acceptable to the County Recorder and duly recorded in the County Recorder's
Office.
         (f)   Storm water management ponds or basins, land within the rights-
of-way of underground pipelines, and floodplain areas may be included as part
of the minimum required open space.  Road rights-of-way may not be included as
a part of the minimum required open space.
      (2)   Evaluation criteria.  In evaluating the layout of lots and open
space, the following criteria will be considered by the Plan Commission as
indicating design appropriate to the site's natural, historic, and cultural
features and meeting the purposes of this chapter.  Diversity and originality
in lot layout shall be encouraged to achieve the best possible relationship
between development and conservation areas.  The Plan Commission shall evaluate
proposals to determine whether the proposed subdivision:
         (a)   Protects and preserves all floodplains, wetlands, and slopes
greater than 20% from clearing, grading, filling, or construction to the
greatest extent possible.
         (b)   Preserves and maintains mature woodlands and existing
agricultural fields and creates sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts
between residential and agricultural areas.
         (c)   Maintains and creates a buffer of natural species vegetation at
least 100 feet wide adjacent to wetlands and surface waters, including creeks,
streams, springs, lakes, and ponds.
         (d)   Designs around existing hedgerows and tree lines between fields
and minimizes impacts on woodlands greater than five acres in size.  Woodlands
on highly erodible slopes should also be avoided.
         (e)   Protects wildlife habitat areas of species listed as endangered,
threatened, or of special concern by the US Environmental Protection Agency
and/or the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
         (f)   Improves public safety and vehicular carrying capacity by
avoiding development fronting directly onto existing public roads.
         (g)   Organizes the subdivision where the largest practicable number
of lots abuts open space areas in order to provide direct views and access to
open space.
         (h)   Provides recreational areas in suitable locations that offer
convenient access by residents and adequate screening from nearby lots.
         (i)   Includes a pedestrian circulation system designed to ensure that
pedestrians can walk safely and easily on the site, between properties and
activities or special features within the neighborhood open space system.
         (j)   Provides open space that is reasonably contiguous. 
Fragmentation of open space should be minimized so that resource areas are not
divided into numerous small parcels located in various parts of the
development.  To the greatest extent practicable, this land shall be designated
as a single
block with logical, straightforward boundaries with a length-to-width ratio not
to exceed 4:1.  Long, thin open space areas shall be avoided unless the
conservation feature is linear or such configuration is necessary to connect
with other streams and trails.  The open space shall generally abut existing or
potential open space uses on adjacent parcels.
      (3)   Garage location/orientation.  Two-car garages, a minimum of 22 feet
in width, or 20 feet in width with an additional four-foot-deep by eight-foot-
long storage area (within the garage), shall be required for all dwellings.
Garages may be front-loading, side-loading, courtyard-loading, rear-loading,
and/or detached. Any front-loading garage, attached or detached, which is
located less than 20 feet behind the front elevation of the home, shall feature
a decorative garage door. Any front-loading garage that protrudes eight feet or
more in front of the front elevation, shall feature at least one window on each
side elevation of the garage. These windows shall not count towards any other
window requirement. No front-loading garage shall protrude more than ten feet
in front of the front elevation. Garage protrusion shall be measured by
determining the distance between the farthest protruding front facade of the
garage and the widest portion of the front facade of the front elevation.
Front-loading garages shall not exceed 45% of the width of the front elevation.
Detached garages must be separated from the primary structure a minimum of ten
feet. For any three-car or larger garage that faces a street, at least one of
the bays must have a separate door and be off-set a minimum of two feet from
the other bays. At least 25% of all lots within a residential subdivision shall
feature a home that does not have a front-loading garage. All decorative garage
doors shall be approved by the Architectural Review Committee. These
regulations do not apply to multi-family residential developments.

   (C)   The keeping of farm animals such as chickens, ducks, goat, sheep,
pigs, cows, or other animals as determined by the Director, may be permitted on
a property of at least five acres in the R-l, R-2, and R-3 Zoning Districts.
Furthermore, farm animals shall be classified into two categories, small farm
animals and large farm animals. Farm animals who have not reached mature
adulthood shall not count against any animal quantity restrictions. For the
purpose of this section, small farm animals are chickens, ducks, pygmy goats,
and the like. Large farm animals are cows, pigs, sheep, goats, llamas, donkeys,
and the like. Farm animal quantities shall be limited as follows:
      (1)   The keeping of small farm animals shall be limited to three small
farm animals per acre.
      (2)   The keeping of large farm animals shall be limited to one large
farm animal per acre.
      (3)   Structures, kennels, stalls, coops, pens, and other elements to
house farm animals on the immediate surrounding property controlling the
movement of those farm animals shall be considered confinement areas and
limited in size. Confinement areas shall be limited to 10% coverage of the
total lot area of the property. Confinement areas shall not be in a front yard.
      (4)   Small farm animal confinement areas shall be a minimum of 50 feet
from any side or rear property line.

Administrator.
(Ord. 111020C, passed 12-8-2020)
§ 154.079  PROPERTY IDENTIFICATION.
   The purpose and intent of this section is to require property identification
for buildings within the town for public safety and emergency response purposes
and set enforcement provisions for failure to display identification. These
standards are not considered a sign as described in the town's Sign Ordinance.
   (A)   The assigned street address of a building shall be displayed in such a
manner so that the numerals can readily be seen from the street. The size of
the numerals shall comply with the applicable standards required by the
Building Code. However, the minimum numeral height for a non-residential
building shall be eight inches, or as otherwise required by the Fire Marshall
during the plan review process.
   (B)   Any dwelling or commercial building that abuts an alley or secondary
access that could be used by motor vehicles shall not only display the premises
identification on the front but shall also display its premises identification
visible from the alternate access to the property.
   (C)   Any structure with a main entrance that is not directly accessible or
visible from any roadway or parking lot shall also display the premises
identification at the main entrance.
   (D)   Any structure for which there exists a ground or monument sign shall

(Ord. 111020C, passed 12-8-2020)
§ 154.080  PUBLIC ART.
   The town encourages the incorporation of public art in all development and
projects. Public art should aim to have the highest aesthetic standards by
enabling artists to create original and sustainable artwork, with attention to
design, materials, construction, and location. The following criteria should
describe the public art sought by the town.
   (A)   Public art shall be in keeping with the best practices in maintenance
and conservation.
   (B)   Public art should generate visual interest by creating focal points,
meeting places and landmarks that will enhance the town's image.
   (C)   Public art should enliven and enhance the unique quality of sense of
place, within the development or community.
   (D)   Public art should foster common currency for social and economic
exchange between residents and attract visitors by ensuring that they have
access to visual 'clues' that will help them navigate and embrace a potentially
unfamiliar environment.
   (E)   Public art is expected to be integrated into the overall design of the
larger civic context in which it is placed.
   (F)   Public art should illuminate the character, community, geography,
history and environment found in the town.
   (G)   Public art in privately owned developments should be fully integrated
into the development's design, in the most accessible and visible locations.
   (H)   Artwork in retail streets and developments will need to be reviewed in
relation to signage and store frontage to make sure it will not impact the
visibility or access to the business.
   (I)   Attention should be paid to how the artwork will appear amidst mature
landscaping.
   (J)   Special care should be made to avoid locations where public art may be
damaged, such as in the portion of right-of-way dominated by vehicles.
   (K)   All public art to be erected shall be approved by the Town Council.
(Ord. 111020, passed 12-8-2020)
OVERLAY DISTRICTS
§ 154.090  ESTABLISHMENT AND GENERAL STANDARDS.
   The overlay districts listed below are hereby established to provide
additional development standards that respond to the unique characteristics of
the properties to which they apply. Overlay districts applicable to the town
include the Highway Corridor Overlay District, Airport Overlay District, and
Town Center Overlay.
   (A)   Applicability.  Property located within an overlay district shall be
subject to the standards and regulations of its base zoning district, which
shall include planned unit development districts, and the provisions prescribed
below.  In the event that a property is located within one or more overlay
districts, the property shall be subject to the requirements of each applicable

§ 154.091  HIGHWAY CORRIDOR OVERLAY.
   The visibility and accessibility of the land within the Broadway and CR 600
W highway corridors are unique and therefore command the highest standards of
development to stimulate substantial capital investments, encourage efficient
land use, promote coordinated development, permit innovative site designs,
establish development standards and preserve the integrity of the roadways
within the corridors.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.  The purpose of this district is to establish an
overlay district to address the unique characteristics of the properties
adjacent to the two primary transportation corridors that traverse the
McCordsville community.  These corridors have unique traffic management needs,
development pressures, and aesthetic characteristics that require the
establishment of additional development standards and regulations.  It is the
intent of this district to meet the goals of the Comprehensive Plan and fulfill
the purpose of this chapter.  More specifically, this overlay district is
intended to require development along the town's primary transportation
corridors that is aesthetically consistent, responsive to development
pressures, and proportional to the area's traffic management issues.
   (B)   Applicability.  The Highway Corridor Overlay District shall apply to
all development sites, buildings, structures, plantings, signs, street
hardware, and any other improvements that are visible to the public and which
affect the physical development of land.
   (C)   Boundary.  The rough boundary of the Highway Corridor Overlay District
is as illustrated on the Official Zoning Map.  For the purposes of
administering and enforcing this chapter, the physical boundary shall measure
600 feet in both directions, measured from the centerline of the road.
   (D)   Exemptions.  All single and two-family residential uses shall be
exempt from the requirements of the Highway Corridor Overlay District.
   (E)   Uses.  All uses permitted in an underlying base zoning district shall
be permitted in the Highway Corridor Overlay District.  All special exception
uses in an underlying base zoning district shall be special exception uses in
the Highway Corridor Overlay District.
   (F)   Development standards.  Unless specified otherwise, the following
development standards shall apply to developments along Broadway and CR 600 W.
      (1)   Vehicular access.  Any access gained from Broadway or CR 600 W
shall be approved by the town, Town Engineer and/or INDOT, depending on the
jurisdiction of each.  To provide safe and efficient traffic movement to and
from adjacent lands:
         (a)   Frontage roads, access roads, and distributor roads may have to
be constructed;
         (b)   Shared access shall be coordinated with contiguous lots and
designed to preserve the aesthetic benefits offered by the surrounding area;
         (c)   Access at the side or rear of building is encouraged; and
         (d)   New access points onto Broadway or CR 600 W shall be coordinated
with existing access points whenever possible.
      (2)   Curb cuts.  Curb cuts shall be no closer than one foot for every
400 feet of road frontage.  No curb cuts shall be within 200 feet of the
intersection of two public roads.  Opposing curb cuts shall align squarely or
be offset no less than 200 feet.
      (3)   Connectivity through stub streets.  Stub streets shall be built in
all cases where adjacent lots have reasonable potential for development.  For
the purposes of administering and enforcing this chapter, the term reasonable
potential shall include any adjacent parcel of adequate size for non-
residential or residential development, as determined by the Plan Commission,
or duly appointed or designated representative.
      (4)   Site layout.  All site development plans shall be prepared in
compliance with the requirements of §§
154.200 through
154.210, Procedures and Permits, of this chapter.  Site development plans for
parcels located within the Highway Corridor Overlay District shall also comply
with the following:
         (a)   Site layout shall consider the relationship between all
buildings on site;
         (b)   Pedestrian connectivity between uses shall be illustrated;
         (c)   The amount of off-street parking located between the street and
the front façade of the building shall not exceed 80% of the total number of
parking spaces required by this chapter;
         (d)   Internal drive aisles that connect multiple lots shall minimize
points of access for safe vehicular circulation; and
         (e)   The orientation and access for all outlots shall be considered
and illustrated on the plan.
      (5)   Architectural design standards.  The following architectural
standards shall apply to all non-residential development within a Highway
Corridor Overlay District.  The following architectural standards are in
addition to any architectural design standards imposed by an underlying base
zoning district.  In the event that one or more of the following architectural
design standards conflicts with an architectural design standard of an
underlying base zoning district, the standard that imposes the highest or
strictest regulation, shall govern. For the purpose of administering and
enforcing this chapter, the term FRONT FAÇADE shall refer to the façade that
faces the road with the highest thoroughfare classification; with the exception
of outlot buildings.  All façades of an outlot building shall be treated as a
front façade.
         (a)   Entry features.  Entryway features shall be required at the
primary entrance to the structure and shall include at least three of the
following design elements:
            1.   Raised corniced parapets over the door, peaked roof forms

§ 154.092  AIRPORT OVERLAY.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.  The Airport Overlay District permits operation of
the Mt. Comfort Airport and regulates uses adjacent to the airport to ensure
compatible growth and development.  District regulations control building
height and prohibit uses that create electrical interference.
   (B)   Height restriction zones.  There are hereby created and established
certain zones which include all of the land lying within and under the approach
surfaces, transition surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and conical surfaces. The
zones and surfaces are shown on the Mt. Comfort Airport Zoning Map. The various
zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
      (1)   Precision instrument approach surface.  The land area located at
each end of each instrument runway to be equipped for precision landings, its
surface area having a width of 1,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 200 feet
beyond each end of the runway and widening thereafter uniformly to a width of
16,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 50,200 feet beyond each end of the
runway, its centerline being the continuation of the runway centerline.
      (2)   Non-precision instrument or visual approach surface.  The land area
located at each end of each non-precision instrument or visual runway for
landings and take-offs, its surface area having an inner width identical to
width of the primary surface at a width of 4,000 feet at a distance of 10,200
feet beyond the end of the runway. The approach surface centerline is the
continuation of the runway centerline.
      (3)   Primary surface.  A surface longitudinally centered on a runway.
When the runway has a specially prepared hard surface, the primary surface
extends 200 feet beyond each end of that runway, but when the runway has no
specially prepared hard surface or planned hard surface, the primary surface
ends at each end of that runway. The elevation of the nearest point on the
primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway
centerline. The width of a primary surface is 500 feet for visual runways and
1,000 feet for all other runways. The width of the primary surface is the width
prescribed for the most precise approach to either end of the runway.
      (4)   Transitional surface.  These surfaces extend outward and upward at
right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended from
the sides of the primary surface and from the sides of the approach surfaces.
Transitional surfaces for those portions of a precision approach surface which
project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface extend a distance
of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach surface and
at right angles to the runway centerline.
      (5)   Horizontal surface.  A horizontal plane 150 feet above the
established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by
swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of the primary
surface of each runway of each airport and connecting the adjacent arcs by
lines tangent to those arcs. The radius of each arc is 5,000 for visual runways
and 10,000 for all other runways.
      (6)   Conical surface.  The land area beginning at the periphery of the
horizontal surface area and thence extending outwardly for a horizontal
distance of 4,000 feet.
   (C)   Height limitations.  Except as otherwise provided herein, no structure
or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in any zone
created by this section to a height in excess of the height limit herein
established for the zone. The height limitations are computed from the
applicable runway and elevation or the airport elevation as appropriate, and
are hereby established for each of the zones in question. When an area is
covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive limitation
shall prevail. Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the
growth, construction, or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height 50
feet or less above the surface of the land.
      (1)   Precision instrument approach surface.  Height limits shall be one
foot in height for each 100 feet in horizontal distance beginning at a point
200 feet from the end of the instrument runway and extending to a distance of
10,200 feet from the end of the runway, thence one foot in height for each 50
feet in horizontal distance to a point 50,200 feet from the end of the runway.
      (2)   Non-precision instrument or visual approach surface.  Height limits
shall be one foot in height for each 50 feet in horizontal distance beginning
at a point 200 feet from the end of the non-precision instrument runway and
extending to a point 10,200 feet from the end of the runway.
      (3)   Transitional surface.  Height limits shall be one foot in height
for each seven feet in horizontal distance beginning at the primary surface
edge, measured at right angles to the longitudinal centerline of the runway,
extending upward to a maximum height of 150 feet above the established airport
elevation. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits of
one foot in vertical height for each seven feet in horizontal distance measured
from the edges of all approach surfaces for the entire length of the approach
surface and extending upward and outward to the points where they intersect the
horizontal and conical surfaces. Further, where the instrument approach surface
projects through and beyond the conical surface, a height limit of one foot for
each seven feet of horizontal distance shall be maintained beginning at the
edge of the instrument approach surface and extending a distance of 5,000 feet
from the edge of the precision instrument approach surface measured at right
angles to the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
      (4)   Conical surface.  Height limits shall be one foot in height for
each 20 feet of horizontal distance beginning at the periphery of the
horizontal surface and measured perpendicularly to the periphery of the
horizontal surface.
   (D)   Permitted land uses.  Unless otherwise prohibited by this section, all
uses permitted in an underlying base zoning district shall be permitted in the
Airport Overlay District.
   (E)   Special exception uses.  The following types of uses shall be special
exceptions within the runway clear zone, provided that they are also listed as
permitted or special exception uses in the underlying standard zones:
      (1)   Mixed non-residential uses;
      (2)   Shopping centers not exceeding 15,000 square feet in gross floor
area;
      (3)   Cemeteries; and
      (4)   Hotels.
   (F)   Land use restrictions.  No land may be used in the Airport Overlay
District in a manner so as to create electrical or radar interference with
radio communication between the airport and aircraft, making it difficult for
flyers to distinguish between airport lights and others, resulting in glare in
the eyes of the flyers using the airport, impairing visibility in the vicinity
of the airport, or otherwise endangering the landing, taking off, or
maneuvering of aircraft.  The following land use restrictions shall apply:
      (1)   Bird strike hazards restrictions.  No waste disposal site, solid
waste transfer station, recycling facility, or other bird attracting use shall
be located within the Airport Overlay District without approval and proper
authorization by the Federal Aviation Administration.
      (2)   Height restriction exemptions.  The following uses and structures
are hereby exempt from the height restrictions of this section:
         (a)   A structure or object that is shielded by existing permanent
structures or by natural terrain or topographic features of equal or greater
height and is located in an area of established development where it is evident
that the shielded structure would not adversely affect aircraft navigation.
         (b)   Any air navigation facility, airport visual approach or landing
aid, aircraft arresting device, or meteorological device of a type approved by
the FAA and the height of which is fixed by its functional purpose.
         (c)   Any structures owned or maintained by the airport or any branch
of government for utility purposes.
      (3)   Prohibited uses.  The following types of uses shall be prohibited
within the runway clear zone:
         (a)   Auditoriums;

         (n)   Any uses involving the sales, storage, manufacture, and/or
distribution of gasoline, propane, or other flammable, toxic, explosive,
radioactive, bio-hazardous materials in a quantity and of a type that would
further jeopardize the health of aircraft occupants, bystanders, and emergency
personnel in the event of an aircraft accident; and
         (o)   Any uses not expressly identified above, in addition to all uses
legally existing before the effective date of this chapter, shall be permitted
in the runway clear zone.
      (4)   Noise protection.  All structures as defined in the Act permitted
in the Noise Sensitive Zone after effective date of this chapter shall obtain a
noise-sensitive permit from the Indiana Department of Transportation,
Aeronautics Section in accordance with the procedures specified in the Act at
I.C. 8-21-10-3.
   (G)   Nonconforming uses.  The height limits and use limitations established
by this section shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or
other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the
regulations as of the effective date of this subsection, or otherwise interfere
with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein shall require any
change in construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the
construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of
this chapter, and is diligently prosecuted.
   (H)   Safety lights.  The owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is
hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon
of markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Indianapolis Airport
Authority to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the
airport the presence of airport hazards. The markers and lights shall be
installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the Indianapolis Airport
Authority.
   (I)   Permits.  No permit for construction or alteration of a structure or
use within the Airport Overlay District shall be granted except in accordance
with the following provisions:
      (1)   Airport hazards.  No permit shall be granted for the establishment
or creation of an airport hazard or to permit a nonconforming use, structure,
or tree to be made or to become higher, or to become a greater hazard to air
navigation than it was on the effective date of this chapter or any amendments
thereto, or than it is when the application for a permit is made.
      (2)   Abandonment.  Whenever the Administrative Officer or designated
authority determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned
or more than 80% torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall
be granted that would allow the structure or tree to exceed the applicable
height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
   (J)   Definitions.  See §
154.005, Definitions.

stones); vertical spacing may be averaged over facade. On such buildings, the
first floor facade shall appear to be greater than the other floor heights.
Integrate at least one material change, color variation, or vertical reveal
every 50 horizontal feet of building facade (greater than 15,000 square feet);
horizontal spacing may be averaged over facade elevation. All buildings,
regardless of size or number of stories, shall use scale and design elements,
such as but not limited to special lighting, awnings, trees, and other
elements, to visually relate the building to the pedestrian scale and visually
anchor the building to the ground/street level. Exceptions may be granted by
the ARC for buildings featuring architectural styles which lend themselves to
less variation.
         (i)   For at least 60% of the building foundation perimeter, use any
combination of concrete, stone, or unique variation of color, texture, or
material, at least ten feet in height, around the base of the building.

exception or variance.  Any use which is non-conforming in the zoning district
in which it is located or is permitted by special exception or variance shall
provide parking which is consistent with the use and the standards for the
zoning district in which the use would ordinarily be permitted by this chapter.
In no instance shall the number of parking spaces required for non-conforming
uses or those permitted by special exception or variance be solely based on the
standards for the district in which they are located. The Board of Zoning
Appeals shall specify the number of parking spaces for all uses permitted by
special exception or variance consistent with the intent of this section.
However, the Board of Zoning Appeals may grant variances consistent with the
intent of this section.
   (G)   Requirements for uses not specifically listed.  The number of parking
spaces required for uses that are not listed specifically shall be determined
by the Administrative Officer by comparing the proposed use with those that are
specified and further determining the most relevant comparable use.
   (H)   Park use requirements.  Off-street parking space for park and
recreation uses and buildings located in any zoning district shall be provided
consistent with the requirements for business uses provided by this chapter.

§ 154.115  LOADING STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.  The purpose of these loading requirements is to
provide minimum standards for the loading and unloading of materials at
commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities, with the exception of
such facilities which are located in any Town Center District or other mixed-
use district. These requirements are intended to prevent loading and unloading
from occurring on a public street or in other locations that would present a
danger to persons or property.  Commercial, industrial, and institutional
facilities located within a Town Center District or other mixed-use district
shall be exempt from the standards and regulations of this section.
   (B)   Loading birth requirement.  Adequate off-street loading berths and
areas shall be provided for any building or structure which requires the

   (B)   General requirements.  Unless otherwise provided by this chapter, all
driveways and interior drives shall comply with the following design
requirements:
      (1)   Entrance widths.  No entrance shall exceed the following pavement
widths at the point which they intersect an existing or planned public right-
of-way. The distances for these standards shall be determined by measuring from
the outside edges of the curb or pavement (whichever is greater) of the
entrance or drive at an existing or planned public right-of-way which it
accesses, and shall not include any acceleration or deceleration lanes or
turning radii:
         (a)   Fourteen feet per lane (exclusive of any medians) if from a non-
residential or multi-family residential use onto any type of street, and
         (b)   Twenty-four feet total if from a single-family or two-family use

      (2)   Travel direction.  The direction of travel for vehicles using
entrances shall be as follows:
         (a)   All entrances providing access to an existing or planned public
right-of-way from all lots used for purposes other than single or two-family
residences shall be designed so that vehicles are traveling in a forward
direction when entering and leaving.
         (b)   In no case may any entrance for any use be designed to require a
vehicle to back onto any arterial or collector street.
      (3)   Shared entrances and drives.  Shared entrances and drives are
encouraged for all uses in all zoning districts, specifically for any multi-
family residential or non-residential use accessing a major collector or
arterial street.
         (a)   Access easements.  All shared entrances and drives shall be
constructed only in appropriate access easements which easements must be
recorded before usage commences.
         (b)   Required documentation.  A permanent documentation of any shared

Officer. A copy of the agreement shall be retained for the files of the Plan
Commission. The agreement shall be recorded prior to the issuance of the
occupancy permit.
      (4)   Interior drive widths.  The minimum pavement width shall be
exclusive of any parking spaces.  For single- and two-family residential uses
the minimum driveway width shall be 12 feet.  For all multi-family uses refer
to the §
154.113, Parking Standards, of this chapter.
   (C)   Curbs.  All entrances and interior drives for property used for
purposes other than agriculture, single-family residential or two-family
residential shall generally be completely curbed. Curbing shall not be required
if, in the written opinion of the Town Engineer/County Highway Engineer, the
drainage system for the property shall be best served if curbs were not
present.
   (D)   Commercial area internal linkages.  For all uses located in a
commercial zoning district there shall be interior drives that allow access
between existing and proposed commercial uses on adjacent properties.
      (1)   Cross-access required.  The drives must be designed as a single
two-way drive or a pair of one-way drives that provide access between the
parking lots and interior drives of all adjoining commercial uses.
      (2)   Separation.  Interior drives providing cross-access between
adjacent parcels shall be separated from an existing or planned right-of-way of
any such street by a minimum distance specified by the Town Engineer based on
the vehicle stacking requirements of the entrance(s) to the property from the
public street.
(Ord. 121410, passed 1-11-2011)
§ 154.117  SIGHT VISIBILITY STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.  The purpose of these sight visibility standards
is to contribute to a safe vehicular and pedestrian transportation system by
ensuring clear visibilities at street intersections and the vehicle entrances
to properties.
   (B)   Sight visibility triangle requirement.  All properties shall maintain
an area, otherwise referred to as the "sight visibility triangle," at every
intersection of an adjoining street with other streets and entrance drives. The
sight visibility triangle shall be free of structures, vegetation (including
crops), signs (other than street signs), and other opaque or partially opaque
objects between a height of 2-1/2 and 12 feet measured from the nearest top-of-
curb, or edge of pavement where curbs are not present.
   (C)   Sight visibility triangle dimensions.  The sight visibility triangle
shall be established by connecting points located along the intersecting
rights-of-way (or edge of pavement in the case of entrances). The dimensions of
the triangle vary depending on criteria such as design speed.  Refer to the
Geometric Design of Highways and Streets by the AASHTO (American Association of
State Highway and Transportation Officials) latest edition, for intersection
sight distance.

§ 154.119  LANDSCAPING STANDARDS.
   Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to impose any liability
upon the town, its officers or employees, nor to relieve the owner of any
private property from the duty to keep any tree, shrub or plant upon any street
tree area on his or her property or under his or her control in such condition
as to prevent it from constituting a hazard or an impediment to travel or
vision upon any public roadway or alley within the town.
   (A)   Landscape plan requirement.  A landscape plan shall be prepared by a
landscape architect registered with the State of Indiana and submitted to the
Plan Commission for approval at the same time other plans (i.e. architectural
design, lighting, parking, signage, and site plans) are submitted.  This plan
shall be drawn to scale with the scale clearly indicated and a graphic scale
for reference, and shall delineate all existing and proposed structures,
parking areas, walks, ramps for the handicapped, terraces, driveways, signs,
lighting standards, steps and other similar structures, and shall delineate the
location, size, and description of all landscape materials, including any
existing trees the owner wishes to apply towards the landscape requirements. 
Landscape treatments for plazas, roads, paths, service and parking areas shall
be designed as an integral and coordinated part of the landscape plan for the
entire lot.  The landscape plan shall ensure that sight distances are not
obstructed for drivers of motor vehicles.
   (B)   Landscaped areas.  The following areas shall be landscaped as
prescribed.  The following landscaping standards are in addition to any
buffering or screening requirements prescribed on the following pages.
      (1)   Public rights-of-way.  No person shall plant a tree or otherwise
allow a tree to grow within a dedicated public right-of-way with the exception
of a designated street tree corridor as established from time to time by the
town in accordance with the street design specifications of the McCordsville
Subdivision Control Ordinance, as amended from time to time.  In no instance
shall a tree be planted or allowed to grow above underground utilities.
      (2)   Planting adjacent to free-standing, non-residential buildings.  A
planting area five feet wide shall be installed along all sides of buildings. 
Sidewalks may be permitted in these areas, but shall not occupy the entire area
on any side of the building.  These adjacent planting areas need not be
rectangular in shape as long as the required amount of space is landscaped. 
Innovative and original designs are encouraged.  The adjacent planting area at
the rear of a structure may be excluded if that structure is located less than
40 feet from the rear property line and sufficient peripheral planting is
included to compensate for its removal. Front elevations of all industrial
buildings are required to plant a minimum of three shrubs, two ornamental
trees, or a mix thereof approved by staff per 12 lineal feet of building
perimeter, exclusive of loading docks.
      (3)   Plantings adjacent to free-standing, single-family residential
buildings.  Each single-family residential lot shall have the following minimum
specifications:
         (a)   A minimum of one shade tree.
         (b)   A minimum of two ornamental trees, two evergreen trees, or one
ornamental tree and one evergreen tree.
         (c)   A minimum of 12 shrubs, planted along the foundation of the
primary building.
         (d)   A minimum of one deciduous tree, planted in the front yard.
         (e)   Any front-loading garage that protrudes a minimum of eight feet
in front of the front elevation shall feature a minimum of eight shrubs along
the foundation of side elevation (nearest the side-yard property line) of the
garage.
      (4)   Interior parking lot plantings.  All parking lots with more than
ten spaces shall be landscaped as follows:
         (a)   Parking areas that are visible from any existing or planned
public right-of- way or any existing or planned private street easement and/or
abut any side or rear property line shall have a planted screen between the
parking perimeter and the street yard, side yard, and/or rear yard. Screening
must be at least three feet high with no gaps except for drive-aisles,
sidewalks, and the like. Brick or stone walls not to exceed four feet in height
may be used to substitute for shrubbery. Additionally, at least one tree for
each 50 lineal feet shall be planted along the peripheral of such parking area.
         (b)   Planting areas shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the
parking area. Not less than 5% of the parking lot shall be landscaped.
Landscape buffers and landscaping adjacent to buildings and on the periphery of
the parking lot shall not be included toward the interior parking lot planting
requirements. Landscaping shall be specifically provided at the ends of parking
rows and as a means of separating parking from major circulation aisles within
parking lots. One shade tree per 2,400 square feet of surface area is required.
One shrub per 500 square feet of surface area is required. No parking space
shall be further than 60 feet from the trunk of a shade tree. Existing shade
trees over 12 inches in caliper may be used to fulfill these requirements. Any
parking area that exceeds the town's parking quantity regulations shall
increase the interior landscaping areas by the same percentage, subject to the
approval of the Zoning Administrator. Interior landscape areas may be
consolidated, or intervals expanded in order to preserve existing trees.
         (c)   Median landscape island. A landscaped median island shall be
provided every six single parking rows. The median island shall be a minimum of
six feet wide (back of curb to back of curb). The median island may also serve
as the location for a sidewalk connecting the parking and use/building served
by the parking area. In such a case, the sidewalk must be a minimum of six feet
wide, and the median island expanded to a width of 11 feet. Landscaping shall
consist of a mixture of grass and mulched planting beds. A mixture of trees,
shrubs, ornamental grass, and perennial flowers shall be planted, subject to
the approval of the Zoning Administrator. Median islands may be consolidated,
or intervals expanded in order to preserve existing trees. Flexibility shall be
granted for accessibility/maneuvering of large commercial vehicles.
   (C)   Landscaping requirements.
      (1)   Placement.  The interior dimensions, specifications, and design of
any planting area shall be sufficient to protect the trees and shrubs planted
and provide for their proper growth.
      (2)   Plant materials.
         (a)   The primary plant materials used in and around parking areas
shall be shade trees that provide shade at maturity. Ornamental shrubs and
other plantings may be used to compliment tree landscaping, but shall not be
the sole contribution to the landscaping.
         (b)   Plant materials should be appropriate to local growing and
climatic conditions.  Whenever appropriate, existing trees greater than 12
inches in caliper should be conserved and integrated into the landscape plan. 
Plant materials shall be selected for their purpose, structure, texture,
hardiness, and appearance.
         (c)   Plant materials shall comply with the requirements described in
the latest edition of the American Standard Nursery Stock, which is published
by the American Association of Nurserymen.
      (3)   Plant specifications.
         (a)   Shade trees shall have a minimum caliper of two and one-half
inches. Shade tree selections can be made from Hard Maples, Oak, Skyline
Locust, and Linden trees.
         (b)   Ornamental trees shall have a minimum caliper of one and one-
half inches.
         (c)   Ornamental shrubs shall have a minimum height of at least 24
inches as measured from the base of the trunk, and a minimum spread of at least
18 inches as measured by the average width diameter of the shrub foliage.
      (4)   Ground cover.
         (a)   All plantings will be mulched in with a natural material.
         (b)   For lots 15,000 square feet or less, the front yards and side
yards to the building back corners of all single family residential homes shall
be entirely sodded.  The remainder of the yard may be sodded or seeded.  All
seeded areas shall be covered with straw or seeded by an equivalent or better
method.
         (c)   Front yards of all non-residential buildings shall be entirely
sodded. Any side yards to the building back corners will be sodded at least 20
feet from the building foundation, if these side areas are to be landscaped
with turf. The remainder of the yard shall be seeded and covered with straw or
seeded by an equivalent or better method.
      (5)   Prohibited plant materials.  As a matter of best practice and in
accordance with state and federal regulations plants that are classified as
being illegal in the State of Indiana or as a federal noxious weed are hereby
prohibited from being planted on public or private property in the jurisdiction
of the town.
   (D)   Supplemental tree plantings provisions.  All lots, including common
areas, within subdivisions shall be planted with supplementary shade trees if
less than the required number of trees exists on the lot after construction is
complete.  For design flexibility, one shade tree may be substituted for two
ornamental trees or two evergreen trees for up to 50% of the required
supplemental trees.  Existing deciduous trees at least eight inches in caliper
may be used to fulfill the supplemental tree planting requirements.  Existing
deciduous trees over 12 inches in caliper may reduce by one the required number
of supplemental trees. Existing evergreen trees over eight feet in height may
also be used to fulfill supplemental tree planting requirements.

> 1 acre                 3 per acre
 
   (E)   Preservation of topographic patterns and existing trees.  Where
natural or existing topographic patterns contribute to the beauty and/or
utility of a development, they shall be preserved and protected.  Modification
to topography shall be permitted where it contributes to the design. Existing
trees eight inches or greater in caliper that have good form and will be
protected in place may count toward the landscape requirements.
   (F)   Installation and maintenance.
      (1)   Installation.  All landscaping required by the approved landscaping
plan shall be installed prior to the issuance of a building occupancy permit if
said permit is issued during a planting season, or within six months of the
date an occupancy permit is issued if issued during a non-planting season.
      (2)   Maintenance.
         (a)   It shall be the responsibility of the owners and their agencies
to insure proper maintenance of the landscaping, in accordance with the
standards set by this chapter and as indicated on the landscaping plan which
has been approved by the Plan Commission.  This includes, but is not
necessarily limited to, replacing dead plantings with identical varieties or a
suitable substitute, and keeping the area free of refuse and debris.
         (b)   It shall be the duty and responsibility of every person owning
or occupying any real property within the town to keep all trees and plants on
their respective property trimmed in such a manner that there is a clearance of
at least 14 feet above any street or alley, and a clearance of at least seven
feet over any sidewalk.  It shall also be the duty and responsibility of every
person owning or occupying any real property within the town to keep all trees
on their respective property trimmed in such a manner that they do not obstruct
the view of any traffic sign or device for vehicular or non-vehicular traffic
in the direction controlled by that traffic sign or device.
         (c)   The practice of topping or other especially destructive
maintenance practices such as severely trimming trees is strictly forbidden. 
For the purposes of administering and enforcing this chapter, the phrase
severely trimmed shall include cutting of the branches or trunk of a tree in a
manner which will substantially reduce the overall size of the tree area so as
to destroy the existing symmetrical appearance or natural shape of the tree in
a manner which results in the removal of main lateral branches leaving the
trunk of the tree in a stub appearance.
         (d)   All trees shall be trimmed so as to comply with the ANSI A300
standards, as amended from time to time.
      (3)   Changes after approval.  No landscaping that has been approved by
the Plan Commission may later be altered, eliminated, or sacrificed, without
first obtaining further Plan Commission approval.
      (4)   Inspection.  The Administrative Officer, or his or her designee,
shall have the authority to visit any lot within the Commission's jurisdiction
to inspect the landscaping and check it against the approved plan on file.
   (G)   Diseased or hazardous trees and plans.  The town shall have the
exclusive authority to destroy any plants in or on public streets, alleyways,
places or parks if infected by disease or injurious insects, or if in the
judgment of the Public Works Commissioner, or his or her designee, represents a
dangerous condition or hazard to the public.  Such destruction may also be
effected when necessary for the protection of other flora or in any other case
when the public safety, health, or welfare is or may be adversely affected, as
determined by the Public Works Commissioner, or his or her designee.
   (H)   All landscape installations shall review the McCordsville Preferred
Planting Guide. This guide is not exhaustive and inclusive of all appropriate
selections; therefore, proposals for additions and/or substitutions to the
guide may be submitted to the Zoning Administrator for consideration. However,
any species which is listed as invasive or having poor characteristics shall be
avoided and will not be counted towards any landscape requirements.
   (I)   All industrial zoned lots shall incorporate a minimum 20 foot wide
perimeter landscape area along all perimeter road frontages. This perimeter
landscape area shall include mounding and landscape plantings. Mounding shall
be undulating, with at least 50% of the length of the mounding a minimum of
three feet higher than average adjacent grade of the property. The required
landscape material shall be no less than five trees and ten shrubs per 100
lineal feet. Plantings shall feature a mix of evergreen and deciduous
plantings.

§ 154.120  BUFFERING AND SCREENING STANDARDS.
   (A)   Buffering standards.
      (1)   Applicability.  Undeveloped properties, expansions of more than 40%
of existing floor area, and rezoned property are subject to the provisions of
this section. Developed lots or lots with unexpired permits at the effective
date of this chapter are hereby exempt from this requirement.
      (2)   Buffer yard requirement.  Where a commercial office, commercial
neighborhood, public/semi-public or multifamily use directly abuts a single-
family or two-family residential use, or an industrial use directly abuts a
commercial use, the subject property shall provide a landscape buffer 20 feet
wide planted with five trees and ten ornamental shrubs per 100 lineal feet of
buffer yard, and undulating mounding of at least three feet in height between
the conflicting uses. Where an industrial use or commercial regional use
directly abuts any residential use or public/semi-public use, the subject
property shall provide a landscape buffer 30 feet wide planted with eight trees
and ten ornamental shrubs per 100 lineal feet of buffer yard, and mounding of
at least five feet in height with a minimum six-foot fence constructed on top
of the mounding between the conflicting uses. The fence shall be constructed of
100% brick and/or stone, or brick or stone columns with wood or wood-like
composite material between the columns (spaced no more than 50 foot on center).
One hundred percent of the required shrubs and at least 50% of the required
trees must be located between the fence and the residential, institutional, or
public/semi-public use. It shall be the responsibility of the new land use
creating the incompatibility to construct and maintain the landscape buffer.
Where an industrial use is not immediately adjacent to a single-family or two-
family use, but is separated from the residential use by only public right-of-
way, the industrial land use shall provide a landscape buffer 30 feet wide
planted with eight trees and ten ornamental shrubs per 100 lineal feet of
buffer yard, and mounding of at least five feet in along the adjoining right-
of-way. This buffer yard can be waived by the Administrative Officer if the
property owner of the neighboring lower-intensity use requests, in writing to
the Administrative Officer, to not have the buffer yard constructed along their
property line.
      (3)   Buffer yard width reduction provision.  The width of the required
buffer and the number of shrubs may be reduced by half with the construction of
an opaque wall or fence.  The fence or wall shall be opaque (solid) and
constructed of material compatible with the principle building in composition
and color.  The wall shall have a minimum height of five feet and a maximum
height of seven feet.
   (B)   Screening of loading and storage areas.  Screening shall be by opaque
wall or fence six to eight feet in height.  One-third of the surface area of
the wall or fence must be screened from an existing or planned public right-of-
way with plants within six months of the date of the occupancy permit being
issued.  Screening shall be evergreen, and planted at a maximum spacing of four
feet on center.

      (8)   All equipment, including but not limited to the light column,
luminaire and additional fixtures shall remain the property of the developer,
property owner, or the homeowners association who shall be responsible for all
of the maintenance of the equipment as well as all operational cost of the
equipment.
      (9)   Record drawings shall be provided in digital format to the Town
Manager upon completion of installation of the lighting system, said format to
use the Auto-Cad software program or its approved equivalent.
      (10)   If the development is an apartment complex, condominium or other
form of multi-living arrangement, the same requirements as set forth above
shall apply in addition to which the lighting fixtures at the entrances shall
be 5.0 foot-candles, the lighting around parking and building areas shall be
1.0 foot-candles, and shall in all respects comply to the Illuminating
Engineering Society (IES) Lighting Handbook.
      (11)   For all projects, a photometric map indicating the distribution
and foot-candles of all proposed lighting shall be supplied to the
Administrative Officer prior to installation.
      (12)   At the time a subdivision or development is transferred from the
builder/developer to the HOA, the street lights and all their components shall
be owned fee simple. Street light leases may not be transferred to an HOA.
   (D)   Non-residential street lights.  All standards set forth in division
(C), Residential Street Lights, above shall apply where not in direct conflict
with those additional criteria set forth below.  In the event that one or more
of the following criteria conflicts with the criteria set forth in division
(C), the more restrictive standard shall apply.
      (1)   Street lighting shall be installed every 125 feet on center,
directly across the street from existing or planned street lights, in all new
developments through the incorporated town on CR 600 W and on Broadway. Refer
to §
154.091, Highway Corridor Overlay District, of this chapter. Additionally, a
streetlight shall be installed at all intersections along the perimeter of
proposed development project. The type of streetlight to be installed shall be
determined by the Town Engineer.

1.2 foot-candles, for collector street locations 0.8 foot-candles, and for
local street locations 0.6 foot-candles.
      (3)   All lighting shall be consistent with
Chapter 154, Appendix C, Lighting Drawings.
      (4)   All fixtures shall be mounted on standards or columns as specified
in division (C)(5) above, not to exceed 30 feet in height. Lighting fixture,
standards or columns shall be mounted in an approved concrete foundation in
compliance with specifications by the State of Indiana.
   (E)   Illuminated canopy requirements.  Lighting levels under canopies for
gas stations, convenience stores, drive-up banking centers, and similar
locations shall be adequate to facilitate the activities taking place on the
property, and shall not be used for the purpose of illuminating signs. Such
lighting shall be in compliance with the following requirements:
      (1)   Lighting fixtures.  Lighting fixtures on canopies shall comply with
either of the following requirements:
         (a)   All light fixtures mounted on the canopies shall be recessed so
that the lens cover is recessed or flush with the bottom surface (ceiling) of
the canopy, or
         (b)   The lighting of the canopy shall use indirect lighting through
which light is beamed upward and then reflected down from the underside of the
canopy by light fixtures that are shielded so that illumination is focused
exclusively on the underside of the canopy.
      (2)   Fixture location.  Lights shall not be mounted on the top or sides
of any canopy and the sides of the canopy shall not be illuminated. In no
instances shall this be interpreted as prohibiting the placement of signs on
the canopy which are illuminated consistent with the standards for sign
illumination in this section.
   (F)   Lighting of outdoor athletic/performance facilities.  Lighting for all
outdoor athletic and performance facilities and events shall provide adequate
light for the event or facility while minimizing light pollution and the
illumination of adjacent streets and properties.
      (1)   Play/performance area lighting.  Lighting fixtures for the playing
fields and/or performance areas shall be specifically mounted and aimed so that
their beams fall directly within the play/performance area and its immediate
surroundings and does not spill onto adjacent streets or properties.
      (2)   Dual lighting system.  The use of spotlights and/or floodlights to
illuminate the play/performance area shall be permitted. However, each facility
shall be designed and constructed with a dual lighting system which permits the
main lighting for the event (spotlighting, floodlighting, and the like) to be
turned off, with an alternate low level lighting system used for clean-up,
night maintenance and other activities.
      (3)   Exemptions.  Outdoor athletic fields and courts established as
accessory uses to single and two-family residences shall be exempt from these
requirements.
   (G)   Security lighting.  Security lighting shall be coordinated with other
lighting on the property to the extent possible and shall otherwise be in
compliance with the following requirements:
      (1)   Non-residential lighting fixtures.  All security lighting in non-
residential areas shall be shielded and specifically aimed so that illumination
is directed only to the intended area. The light source for any security
lighting shall include shields that prevent their light source or lens from
being visible from adjacent properties and/or streets. Security lighting
fixtures may be mounted on poles located no further than ten feet from the
perimeter of the area intended to be illuminated.
      (2)   Residential lighting fixtures.  Security lighting fixtures in
residential areas shall make use of indirect and reflected lighting techniques
to provide soft lighting under canopies, entry porches, or soffits.
   (H)   Lighting of building facades.  Building facades may be illuminated,
subject to the following requirements:
      (1)   Lighting fixtures.  Lighting fixtures shall be located, aimed, and
shielded so that light is directed only onto the building facade. Lighting
fixtures shall not be directed toward adjacent streets or roads.
      (2)   Lighting direction.  Lighting fixtures shall be designed to wash
the facade of the building with light (rather than providing a spot or
floodlight affect) and may be directed upward or downward onto the facade.
Exterior facade lighting shall be contained on the building facade or in the
landscape areas adjacent to the building and shall focus on entries and
architectural features.
   (I)   Sight lighting. Lighting for parking lots and other on-site lighting
not addressed elsewhere in this chapter shall be as follows:
      (1)   All light fixtures shall be fully recessed into the fixture
housing;
      (2)   All lighting fixtures and poles within a single development shall
be consistent in style, color, size, height, and design;

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
§ 154.160  PURPOSE, INTENT, USES, AND STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.  The purpose of these regulations is to provide
greater design flexibility in the development of land when consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan and the intent of the Zoning and Subdivision Control
Ordinances. Planned unit development regulations are intended to encourage
innovations in land development techniques so that unique opportunities and
circumstances may be met with greater flexibility. Planned unit developments
should be used to address unique environmental concerns, provide a unique mix
of land uses, and implement the Comprehensive Plan in ways not considered by
the established zoning districts. A planned unit development should not be used
if the proposed development can be created using established zoning districts.
   (B)   Uses.  All uses are subject to the discretion and approval of the Plan
Commission. Once uses are approved by the Commission, they are granted by
right. All land uses proposed in a planned unit development must be compatible
with the intent of the Comprehensive Plan and the characteristics of
surrounding land uses and zoning districts.
   (C)   Development requirements.  Development requirements for all proposed
planned unit developments shall be created by the applicant as part of the
preliminary plan submittal. All proposed development requirements are subject
to the review and approval of the Plan Commission and the Town Council.
Generally, the planned unit development shall provide standards for the
development that replace:
      (1)   The lot standards established by §§
154.040 and
154.041, Zoning Districts; and
      (2)   Each topic area regulated by §§
154.110 through
154.121, Development Standards.
   (D)   Rules and procedures.  All proceedings brought under this subchapter
are subject to the Rules and Procedures of the Plan Commission.
   (E)   Limitation of ordinance amendments.  Any initiative of the Plan
Commission to amend this chapter that would affect an approved planned unit
development before its completion shall not be enforced on the planned unit
development. New amendments to this chapter shall only apply to planned unit
developments that have been declared abandoned, or for which an approval has
expired.
   (F)   Origination of proposals.  Any applicant may propose a planned unit
development district in accordance with the procedures established in this
subchapter. A parcel or site proposed for a planned unit development may or may
not be under single ownership. However, if not under single ownership, the
multiple owners must have a contractual agreement: (1) not to develop the
parcels separately, but in accordance with a single, unified plan; and (2) in
which the separate owners have given their express intentions to enter into
such private agreements and to assure its completion as planned and to the
satisfaction of the Plan Commission. The Town Council may grant an extension of
such time for such a period as it deems in the public interest.

(Ord. 121410, passed 1-11-2011)
§ 154.166  MODIFICATIONS.
   (A)   Minor modifications.
      (1)   Administration.  The Administrative Officer may from time to time
approve minor modifications of the preliminary plan and/or final detailed plan

Notice of the hearing must be given as prescribed by this chapter.
(Ord. 121410, passed 1-11-2011)
§ 154.167  EXPIRATION, ABANDONMENT, AND EXTENSIONS.
   (A)   Expiration.  Approval of a final detailed plan shall expire after a
period of five years from the approval of the preliminary Plan, unless the

(Ord. 121410, passed 1-11-2011)
NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
§ 154.180  NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS.
   Upon adoption of this chapter some structures, lots, and uses that were
previously established and maintained consistent with all applicable
requirements of ordinances past may no longer comply with the regulations of
the zoning district in which they are located. For this reason, this subchapter
has been written to provide the rules, policies and regulations that apply to
all legal nonconforming structures, lots, uses and other legal nonconforming
situations.  This subchapter may be referred to as the "grandfather" clause. If
a structure, lot, or use was established legally under a previous ordinance, it
is described as "grandfathered" (legal nonconforming). These regulations are
intended to inform property owner(s) about the options for using and modifying
nonconforming properties and to support the eventual elimination of all
nonconforming structures, lots and uses rather than encourage their survival.
(Ord. 121410, passed 1-11-2011)
§ 154.181  NONCONFORMING STATUS.
   (A)   Illegal nonconforming described.  With the exception of structures,
lots and uses established prior to 1979 when the town enacted land use
controls, a structure, lot, or use that is nonconforming and that was
established or constructed prior to the adoption of this chapter and without an
approved improvement location permit or approval from the Board of Zoning
Appeals or Plan Commission is considered illegal nonconforming. An illegal
nonconforming situation shall be subject to actions and penalties allowed by
this chapter and all other applicable ordinances, and shall be altered to be in
compliance with all applicable standards and regulations of this chapter.
   (B)   Legal nonconforming described. Legal nonconforming situations differ
from illegal nonconforming situations in that the reason for the noncompliance
is caused by the enactment of a Zoning Ordinance or a change to the Zoning
Ordinance (including amendments to the Official Zoning Map). The structure, lot
or use has not changed, but due to the Zoning Ordinance enactment or change,
the property no longer complies with the standards of the zoning district in
which it is located. When this situation occurs, the property is deemed legal
nonconforming or "grandfathered". Legal nonconforming structures, lots and
uses, may continue in the manner and to the extent that they existed or were
used at the time the change in the Zoning Ordinance was enacted, provided they
are in compliance with this subchapter; however, should the legal nonconforming
structure(s), lot(s), and/or use(s) be altered in any way, including but not
limited to, the size or scope of the structures, lots, and/or use(s), such
legal nonconforming status shall immediately terminate.
   (C)   Effect on past variances, special exceptions, or other approvals. 
Structures, lots and uses, and other property features that are nonconforming
due to prior variance, special exception, or other approvals, shall not be
subject to the provisions of this subchapter, but shall be considered
conforming as long as they continue to comply with the terms, conditions, and
scope of their initial approval; however, such nonconforming status shall
terminate immediately if the structure(s), lot(s), and/or use(s) is modified in
any manner or is abandoned for a period of six continuous months.
   (D)   Effect on repairs and maintenance.  Work may be done for ordinary
repairs or replacement of walls, heating, fixtures, wiring, plumbing, and the
like provided that the nonconformities, such as setbacks, lot coverage, land
use, and the like, are not increased.
   (E)   Effect on unsafe structures.  Nothing in this subchapter shall be
deemed to prevent the strengthening, repairing, or restoring to a safe
condition of any structure that has been declared unsafe by the appropriate
official.
(Ord. 121410, passed 1-11-2011; Ord. 010819, passed 2-12-2019)
§ 154.182  NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   All lots legally established and recorded with the Hancock County Recorder
prior to the effective date of this chapter, as amended from time to time, that
no longer meet an applicable provision of this chapter, such as minimum area,
width, or depth, shall be deemed legal nonconforming lots of record. Legal
nonconforming lots of record may be built upon only if the proposed use is
permitted and all development standards of the applicable zoning district, as
prescribed by this chapter, are met.
(Ord. 121410, passed 1-11-2011)
§ 154.183  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Any structure, such as a primary structure, accessory structure, fence, and
the like, lawfully established prior to the effective date of this chapter, as
amended from time to time, that no longer meets the development standards, such
as setbacks, height, and the like, shall be deemed a legal nonconforming
structure.
   (A)   Continuation of nonconforming structures.  The continuation and
modification of nonconforming structures shall be consistent with the following
requirements.
      (1)   Increases in nonconformity.  No legal nonconforming structure shall
be enlarged or altered in a manner that increases its nonconformity without the
approval of a variance by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Any structure may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.
      (2)   Intentional alterations.  Any legal nonconforming structure that is
intentionally altered, moved for any distance, or replaced shall comply with
the regulations of the district in which it is located. Any legal nonconforming
structure that is intentionally altered, moved for any distance, or replaced
shall not have the discontinued legal nonconforming features resume.
      (3)   Accidental alterations.  Legal nonconforming structures that are
required to be altered or removed due to government action or damage from fire,
flood, other natural disaster, or criminal act may be restored to their legal
nonconforming condition. Such structures, if rebuilt or restored, shall be
identical or smaller in volume, height, setback, scale, and all other aspects
to that which was altered or removed.
   (B)   Effect on single-family residences in non-residential districts.  A
legal nonconforming single-family residence located in any non-residential
zoning district may be expanded by up to 50% of the pre-expansion living area,
one time in any five calendar year period provided the expansion is for the
purpose of continuing the residential use of the property.  For the purposes of
administering and enforcing this chapter, compliance with this chapter shall
only be required of the expanded portion of the residence. With respect to
building setbacks, the minimum setbacks for the expanded portion of the
residence shall be as established by the current zoning, unless a development
standards variance is obtained from the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 121410, passed 1-11-2011)
§ 154.184  NONCONFORMING SITE FEATURES.
   Any site feature or improvement, such as landscaping, dumpster enclosures,
parking space dimensions, and the like, lawfully established prior to the
effective date of this chapter, as amended from time to time, that no longer
meets the development standards shall be deemed a legal nonconforming site
feature.  The continuation and modification of nonconforming site features
shall be consistent with the following requirements.
   (A)   Increases in nonconformity.  No legal nonconforming site feature shall
be altered, removed, or otherwise modified in a manner that increases the
features nonconformity. Site features may be modified in a manner that
maintains or lessens the extent of the nonconformity.
   (B)   Site modifications.  If building expansions or other changes to the
property occur that require corresponding site feature improvements, the
affected features shall only be required to be modified to the extent necessary
to accommodate the property changes. The required installation of new site
features shall not require the entire site to be brought into compliance with
this chapter.  For example, parking lot landscaping would only be required for
new portions of a parking lot that was required to be expanded due to a change
in the use of the property, to the extent that the amount of landscaping in the
pre-existing parking areas will be unaffected.
(Ord. 121410, passed 1-11-2011)
§ 154.185  NONCONFORMING USES.
   Any lawful use of structures, land, or structures and land in combination
established prior to the effective date of this chapter, as amended from time
to time, that is no longer a permitted use in the district where it is located
shall be deemed a legal nonconforming use.  A legal nonconforming use may
continue provided that it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
conditions:
   (A)   Modification of structures.  No existing structure devoted to a legal
nonconforming use shall be enlarged, expanded, increased, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except as to change
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located, or as otherwise specified in this section.
   (B)   New structures.  No new structure shall be constructed in connection
with an existing legal nonconforming use of land.
   (C)   Expansion within structures.  Any legal nonconforming use may be
extended throughout any parts of an existing structure that were plainly
arranged or designed for such use on or before the effective date of this
chapter, as amended from time to time, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside the structure.
   (D)   Expansion on the property.  No legal nonconforming use of land shall
be enlarged, increased, extended to occupy a greater area of land, or moved in
whole or in part to any other portion of a lot that was occupied on or before
the effective date of this chapter.
   (E)   Expansion of non-conforming residential use.  A legal nonconforming
single-family residence located in any commercial, industrial, or institutional
zoning district may be expanded by up to 50% of the pre-expansion living area
one time in any five calendar year period provided the expansion is for the
purpose of continuing the residential use of the property. Required setbacks
for the expansion shall be either those established by the zoning on the
property, or those provided by the pre-expansion structure, whichever is less
restrictive.
   (F)   Change of use (to another nonconforming use).  If no structural
alterations are made, it is possible to change a nonconforming use to another
nonconforming use.  Nonconforming uses may be changed to another nonconforming
use (similar or dissimilar) with the approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
In addition to the statutory criteria for acting on a development standards
variance request, the Board may approve the change of use if it finds that the
proposed use is equally or more appropriate to the district in which it is
located than is the existing use. The Board shall consider development
standards applicable to the proposed use established by this chapter and may
make reasonable conditions pursuant to this chapter.
   (G)   Change in use (to a permitted use).  When a legal nonconforming use is
replaced by a permitted use, it shall thereafter comply with the regulations of
the district in which it is located, and the legal nonconforming use may not be
resumed.
   (H)   Discontinuation of use.  If a legal nonconforming use is intentionally
discontinued for six continuous months or longer, any subsequent use of such
land, structure, or land and structure in combination shall comply to the
provisions of this chapter, with the exception of uses that are required to be
discontinued due to a governmental action that impedes access to the premises
due to damage from fire, flood, other natural disaster.  Such exempt uses, if
restored, shall be identical in scale, lot coverage, and all other aspects to
that which was discontinued.
   (I)   Nonconforming structures and land in combination.  Where legal
nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in combination, an
intentional removal or alteration of the structure, or its use, that
establishes conformity shall also eliminate the legal nonconforming status of
the land. Legal nonconforming uses located in structures specifically
constructed or modified to suit only such uses are exempt from this provision
and may be resumed if the structure has not been intentionally altered to serve
other uses, used to house a permitted use, or used to house another
nonconforming use with the approval of a special exception by the Board of
Zoning Appeals as specified in this section.
(Ord. 121410, passed 1-11-2011)
§ 154.186  NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   Any sign, lawfully established prior to the effective date of this chapter,
as amended from time to time, that no longer meets the requirements of this
chapter shall be deemed a legal nonconforming sign.  For the purposes of this
subchapter, a sign shall include the sign face and any supports, poles, frames,
or other associated lighting, electrical, mechanical, and structural features. 
The continuation and modification of nonconforming signs shall be consistent
with the following requirements:
   (A)   Increases in nonconformity.  No legal nonconforming sign shall be
enlarged or altered in terms of face area, height, or any other aspect that
increases its nonconformity.  For the purposes of administering and enforcing
this chapter, a change in the sign faces message or content shall not be
considered to increase the signs nonconformity.
   (B)   Intentional alterations.  Any legal nonconforming sign that is
intentionally altered, moved for any distance, or replaced shall comply with
the regulations of the district in which it is located, and the discontinued
legal nonconforming features may not be resumed.
   (C)   Accidental alterations.  Legal nonconforming signs that are required
to be altered or removed due to government action or damage resulting from
fire, flood, other natural disaster, or a criminal act may be restored to their
legal nonconforming condition. Such signs, if rebuilt or restored, shall be in
compliance with the requirements of this chapter, or shall be identical in
scale and all other aspects to that which was altered or removed.
   (D)   Sign faces and messages.  The sign faces and/or message on a legal
nonconforming sign may be altered, replaced, repainted, and repaired provided
that the nonconformity of the sign is not increased, and that a static display
is not converted to an electronic message board. Otherwise, nothing in this
section shall be interpreted as requiring a sign to be brought into compliance
with this chapter if it is changed only to the extent that the face area is
changed, but not increased in size or altered in shape or made to be an
electronic message board.
   (E)   Temporary signs.  Any signs in existence at the time this chapter
becomes effective that were previously permitted as temporary signs may only
remain in use consistent with the requirements of this chapter. Any temporary
signs that are no longer permitted shall be removed within 30 days of the
effective date of this chapter. Any nonconforming temporary signs shall be
considered to be in violation of this chapter and shall be subject to the
provisions of §§

and/or designees) are designated to enforce the provisions, regulations, and
intent of this chapter. All remedies and enforcement shall comply with the
powers set forth in I.C. 36-7-4-1000 et al. and all other applicable state
laws.
   (B)   Violations.  Complaints made pertaining to compliance with provisions
of this chapter shall be investigated by the Administrative Officer, or his or
her designee. The Administrative Officer may include other officials, such as
the Town Engineer, Building Official, Police, or any of their designees in the
investigation. Action may or may not be taken depending on the findings of the
investigation. The degree of action will be within the sole discretion of the
Administrative Officer, and should reflect both what is warranted by the
violation as well as a consistent approach to the enforcement of this chapter.
   (C)   Inspections.  Investigations of property may be done by the
Administrative Officer, or his or her designee, from a right-of-way, from
adjacent property (with permission of that property owner(s)), or from the
property suspected of a violation once he or she has described the purpose of
the inspection to the owner(s), tenant, or occupant at the time of the
inspection.
   (D)   Entry.  In order to execute inspections, the Administrative Officer or
inspectors shall have the right to enter upon any premises at any reasonable
time for the purpose of carrying out his, her or their duties in the
enforcement of this chapter, unless the owner(s) or occupant of the premises
refuses to permit entry to the Administrative Officer or inspectors when entry
is sought pursuant to this section. In the event of such a refusal, the
Administrative Officer may petition any judge of a court of competent
jurisdiction for the issuance of an administrative search warrant. The petition
shall identify the premises upon which entry is sought and the purpose for
which entry is desired. The petition shall state the facts giving rise to the
belief that a condition which is in violation of this chapter on the premises,
or that a violation in fact exists and must be abated, and that the condition
or violation is not a lawful nonconforming use to the best of the affiant's
belief. Any warrant issued pursuant to the petition shall order the owner(s) or
occupant to permit entry to the Administrative Officer or inspectors for the
purposes stated therein.
   (E)   Responsibility.  The property owner(s) shall be held responsible for
all violations on his or her or their property.
   (F)   Types of violations.  The following items shall be deemed violations

§ 154.228  VIOLATION PROCEDURES.
   (A)   General procedures.  Unless otherwise provided for by this chapter,
there shall be a minimum of a three step procedure for the prosecution of
violations of this chapter. Intermediate steps, including additional notices of
violation and extensions of time limits for compliance may be used by the
Administrative Officer at his or her sole and unlimited discretion. However,
the general procedure for all violations shall follow the minimum steps set
forth below. The minimum steps are as follows:
      (1)   Notice of violation.  The Administrative Officer, or his or her
designee, shall issue a notice of violation to the property owner(s)
committing, in whole or in part, a violation. The notice of violation is a
warning to the violator(s) that a violation has been observed and that it must
be corrected within a specified time frame from the date of the mailing.
      (2)   Notice of penalty for violation.  The Administrative Officer, or
his or her designee, shall issue a notice of penalty for violation to the
property owner(s) committing, in whole or in part, a violation. The notice of
penalty for violations is a citation that states the penalty for the violation.
The notice of penalty for violation shall be mailed via Certified Mail, return
receipt requested by the Administrative Officer, or his or her designee. The
property owner(s) in violation will have a specified number of days from the
date of the mailing to pay all applicable penalty and must correct the
violation within the time period specified by the Administrative Officer, or
his or her designee, or face additional penalty and/or any other enforcement
action authorized by this chapter.
      (3)   Legal action.  If the property owner(s) in violation refuses to pay
the penalty, attorney's fees, court costs, and/or correct the violation within
the time frame specified by the notice of penalty for violation, the
Administrative Officer may refer the violation to the Plan Commission attorney
in order to pursue court action through a court of competent jurisdiction.
Additional penalty, attorneys fees, and liens against the property may also be
pursued until the matter is resolved.
   (B)   Monetary fines.  Monetary fines may be imposed at the discretion of
the Administrative Officer by issuance of the notice of fines for violations as
set forth above.
      (1)   Multiple violations.  Each day a violation exists shall constitute
a separate offense.
      (2)   Fine amount.  Each separate offense shall be subject to a maximum
fine specified by the adopted Fee Schedule assessed on a per day basis from the
date of compliance requested by the Administrative Officer in the notice of
violation.
         (a)   In addition to any fine imposed, any property owner(s) who
initiates any activity that requires an improvement location permit without
first obtaining such permit may be required to pay two times (2x) the normal
amount of the permit fee as an additional fine, consistent with the adopted Fee
Schedule.
         (b)   The amount of any fine shall be as determined by the
Administrative Officer.
      (3)   Payment.  The payment of any violation shall be by cash or
cashier's check and shall be delivered to the Administrative Officer who shall
forward the funds to the Clerk-Treasurer for deposit in the appropriate fund.
         (a)   The Administrative Officer, or his or her designee, shall issue
a receipt to the person making the payment.
         (b)   The Administrative Officer may, at his or her discretion, waive
the assessed fine for the timely correction of the violation.
   (C)   Appeals.  Any property owner(s) receiving a notice of violation and/or
fine(s) for violation may appeal the violation and/or fine to the Board of
Zoning Appeals. A written statement from the property owner(s) in violation,
either filing an Administrative Appeal consistent with this chapter, shall be
submitted to the Administrative Officer via Certified Mail at least three days
prior to the date any fine and/or compliance is due.
      (1)   Fines.  No additional fines shall accrue from the date of the
appeal until the Board of Zoning Appeals has made a ruling as to the violation
and/or fine.
      (2)   Additional notices.  No additional notices will be issued by the
Administrative Officer, or his or her designee, if the property owner(s) in
violation has (have) submitted an appeal.
   (D)   Legal remedies.  The Administrative Officer via the Plan Commission
attorney may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to invoke any
legal, equitable, or special remedy, for the enforcement of any ordinance or
regulation created under I.C. 36-7-4, as amended from time to time.
      (1)   Enforcement.  Implementation of the legal remedies set forth above
may be used to prosecute violations of the following:
         (a)   The Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision Control Ordinance, and any
other requirements adopted separately by the Town Council or adopted by their
reference in the Zoning or Subdivision Control Ordinance;
         (b)   All agreements with the Plan Commission or its designees that
have been established as written commitments in recordable form;
         (c)   All commitments made in accordance with I.C. 36-7-4 et al; and
         (d)   All conditions imposed in accordance with I.C. 36-7-4 et al.
      (2)   Injunction.  The Administrative Officer may bring an action in a
court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin a property owner(s) from violating
I.C. 36-7-4 et al. or any ordinance adopted under I.C. 36-7-4 et al.
      (3)   Removal of structures.  The Administrative Officer may also bring
an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for a mandatory injunction,
directing the property owner(s) to remove a structure erected in violation of
this chapter.
      (4)   Responsibility for prosecution expenses.  A defendant/respondent
shall reimburse the Office of the Plan Commission all expenses associated with
the prosecution of a violation of any provision of this ordinance, including
but not limited to any fines, attorney's fees, photocopying charges, mileage,
hours, or portions thereof, devoted to said prosecution by the Administrative
Officer or any employee of the town and any other cost incurred directly or
indirectly by any employee or elected official of the town related to said
prosecution.  However, only those costs of enforcement that are documented by
the Administrative Officer, and that have a relationship to the enforcement
action shall be paid by the defendant/respondent.
      (5)   Other parties eligible to seek enforcement.  An action to enforce a
written commitment made in accordance with I.C. 36-7-4 et al. may be brought in
a court of competent jurisdiction by:
         (a)   Rules and procedures provisions.  Any property owner(s) who is
entitled to enforce a commitment made in accordance with I.C. 36-7-4 et al.

         (b)   Specified parties.  Any other specially affected property owner
