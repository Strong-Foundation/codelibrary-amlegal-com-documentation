chapters and sections, shall be known and designated as the “Town of Otterbein
Code”, for which designation “code of ordinances”, “codified ordinances” or

same rules of construction, definition and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.

   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to

reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or division.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning, application
or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only, and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.

or application.

so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid

accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of
whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a statute stating that the provisions of an act are

§ 10.07 REFERENCE TO OTHER SECTIONS.
   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof, the

authority or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; on the effective date of that ordinance or following the
effective date, the rights, powers, duties or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date

(I.C. 1-1-6-1)
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any

intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted or substituted as will conform with the manifest

the error.

be a Saturday, Sunday or a state holiday, it shall be excluded.
§ 10.11 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to

contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected

thereof as may appear in the text of the proposed ordinance, a caption or title
shall be shown in concise form above the ordinance.

liabilities, proceedings and rights are continued; punishments, penalties or
forfeitures shall be enforced and imposed as if this code had not been enacted.
In particular, any agreement granting permission to utilize highway rights-of-

July 1, 2012 known as I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21, respectively, as amended
from time to time.
   (B)   On July 1, 2012, the town shall have a nepotism and a contracting with
a unit policy that complies with the minimum requirements of I.C. 36-1-20.2
(hereinafter “nepotism policy”) and I.C. 36-1-21 (hereinafter “contracting with
a unit by a relative policy”) and implementation will begin.
   (C)   The town’s nepotism policy is hereby established effective July 1,
2012 by adopting the minimum requirements provisions of I.C. 36-1-20.2, and
including all future supplements and amendments thereto which become law from
time to time, and making them a part hereof as if fully set out herein.
   (D)   The town’s contracting with a unit by a relative policy is hereby
established effective July 1, 2012 by adopting the minimum requirements
provisions of I.C. 36-1-21, and including all future supplements and amendments
thereto which become law from time to time, and making them a part hereof as if
fully set out herein.
   (E)   The Town Council finds that both I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21
specifically allow a unit to adopt requirements that are “more stringent or
detailed” and that more detailed are necessary.
   (F)   The Town Council further finds that a single member of the legislative
body cannot act for the body to make work assignments, compensation,
grievances, advancement or a performance evaluation without prior authority of
a majority of the body and therefore without such authority by the majority he
or she will not be in the direct line of supervision.
   (G)   The Town Council finds that a single member of governing bodies with
authority over employees in the town cannot act for the governing body to make
work assignments, compensation, grievances, advancement or a performance
evaluation without prior authority of a majority of the body, when a statute
provides that a majority is needed to act, and therefore, without such
authority by the majority, the single member will not be in the direct line of
supervision.
   (H)   All elected and appointed officials and employees of the town are
hereby directed to cooperate fully in the implementation of the policies
created by this section and in demonstrating compliance with these same
policies.
   (I)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, compliance
and certifications connected with the nepotism policy is a violation and may
result in the discipline, including termination, of an employee or a transfer
from the direct line of supervision or other curative action. An elected or
appointed official of the town who fails to abide by or cooperate with the
implementation, with the compliance and with mandated certifications of either,
the nepotism policy may be subject to action allowed by law.
   (J)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, compliance
and certifications connected with the contracting with unit by a relative
policy is a violation and may result in the discipline, including termination,
of an employee or a curative action. An elected or appointed official of the
town who fails to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, with the
compliance and with mandated certifications of either the nepotism policy or
the contracting with unit by a relative policy may be subject to action allowed
by law.
   (K)   The policies created by this section are hereby directed to be
implemented by any of the following actions: posting a copy of this section in
its entirety in at least one of the locations in the Town Hall where it posts
employer posters or other notices to its employees; providing a copy of this
section to its employees and elected and appointed officials; providing or
posting a notice of the adoption of this section; or any such other action or
actions that would communicate the polices established by this section to its
employees and elected and appointed officials. Upon any of taking these
actions, these policies are deemed implemented by the town.
   (L)   Two copies of I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21, and as supplemented or
amended, are on file in the office of the Clerk-Treasurer for the town for

§ 31.02 DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE POLICY.
   (A)   Overview. The town hereby makes a commitment to provide employees a
safe working environment, to ensure that employees, equipment and operating
practices comply with health and safety standards, and to maintain public
confidence in the town and its employees. Since the town values each employee,
the town offers employees assistance in dealing with alcohol and drug abuse
problems.
   (B)   Policy. The town requires all employees to report for work in a
condition that allows them to perform their duties in a safe and efficient
manner. Employees will not be permitted to work under the influence of alcohol
or with prohibited drugs in their systems thereby affecting job performance.
Violation of any provision of this section will be considered just cause for
disciplinary action up to and including discharge, even for a first offense. In
addition, refusal to adhere to any part of the policy may be considered an act
of insubordination and also may lead to disciplinary action up to and including
discharge. This section and related procedures may be modified by the town at
any time in order to comply with any applicable federal, state or local laws or
to better serve the needs of the town.
   (C)   Prohibited drugs.
      (1)   Prohibited drugs are defined as illegal substances, including
controlled substances as defined in the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. §
8120) and the Code of Federal Regulations (21 C.F.R. §§ 1308.11 through
1308.15) and prescription controlled substance which have not been prescribed
by a licensed physician or dentist for specific treatment purposes for the
employee.
      (2)   Abuse of prescription or over-the-counter drugs will also be
treated as a substance abuse problem under this section.
      (3)   This section prohibits the illegal use, sale, transfer,
distribution, possession or unlawful manufacture of narcotics, drugs or other
controlled substances while on the job or on town premises (including vehicles
used for town business). These include, but are not limited to, marijuana,
cocaine, crack, PCP, heroin, LSD, amphetamines, hallucinogens and barbiturates.
Any illegal substances found on such premises will be turned over to the state
police and may lead to criminal prosecution.
   (D)   Alcohol.
      (1)   The use of alcohol on the job or on town premises is prohibited,
unless such use is non-abusive and is part of an authorized official event held
off town premises. The use of alcohol in vehicles used for town business is
strictly prohibited.
      (2)   Alcohol possession applies to all open or unsealed alcoholic
beverage containers. Such containers are not allowed on the job or on town
premises, unless their possession is part of an authorized official event.
Possession of such containers in vehicles used for town business is never
authorized.
   (E)   Reporting violations.
      (1)   Employees must as a condition of employment, abide by the terms of
this section and report any conviction to the town under a criminal drug statue
for violations occurring on or off town premises when conducting town business.
Report of a conviction must be made to the town within five business days after
the conviction. The town will then notify the appropriate contracting officer
within ten days after receiving notice from either the employee or from another
source. (These requirements are mandated by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of
1988.)
      (2)   An employee who is involved with off the job illegal drug activity
may be considered in violation of this section. In determining whether
disciplinary action will be imposed for this activity, the town will consider
the circumstance of each incident, including but not limited to any adverse
effect the employee’s actions may have on its customers, other employees, the
public or the town’s reputation and image. Any questions regarding the
reporting of violations should be directed to the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (F)   Employee rehabilitation.
      (1)   Health maintenance is primarily a personal responsibility and it is
the individual’s responsibility to correct unsatisfactory job performance or
behavioral problems caused by alcohol or drug abuse. In an effort to assist
employees, the town will provide various means for employees and their family
members to remain aware of the dangers of substance abuse in the workplace and
to overcome drug and alcohol related problems.
      (2)   Employees with a personal, alcohol or drug related problem are
encouraged to volunteer to participate in an approved rehabilitation program
upon referral from the Employee and Family Assistance Program, before work
performance becomes affected.
      (3)   Participation in a rehabilitation program will not be considered a
barrier to employment nor a cause for disciplinary action. Employees will not
be disciplined merely because of participation in a rehabilitation program or
excused from the disciplinary consequences of conduct which is in violation of
this section or any other town policies or job requirements.
      (4)   Any employee identified through a town investigation as having a
substance abuse problem also may not avoid disciplinary action by requesting to
participate in an approved rehabilitation program.
      (5)   Circumstances in each case will be evaluated to determine the
course of action to be taken (i.e., whether the employee will be offered the
opportunity to participate in a rehabilitation program and/or will be subject
to discipline).
   (G)   Testing.
      (1)   The town will not ask employees to submit to random alcohol or drug
tests. Alcohol or drug tests may be required for employees in the following
circumstances:
         (a)   When unsatisfactory job performance or other employee behavior
is reasonable indicative of substance abuse;
         (b)   During and after participation in a drug or alcohol
rehabilitation program for a reasonable period of time as determined by the
town; or
         (c)   When required by law.
      (2)   If a supervisor identifies an employee with a behavior pattern and/
or job performance reasonably indicative of substance abuse, the supervisor
(with the concurrence of the next level of supervision) may recommend that the
employee have a fitness for duty examination by a physician designated by the
town. The physician will determine whether a fitness for duty examination is
necessary and whether alcohol or drug tests will be required.
      (3)   Pre-employment drug testing is part of the pre-employment physical.
The method of testing will be determined by the town. Applicants who test
positive for prohibited drugs in their systems will not be offered employment.
Any questions regarding re-application opportunities should be directed to the
Clerk-Treasurer.

§ 32.06 FIXED ASSET CAPITALIZATION POLICY.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      CAPITAL OUTLAY. Expenditures which benefit both the current and future
fiscal periods. This includes costs of acquiring land or structures;
construction or improvement of buildings, structures or other fixed assets; and
equipment purchases having an appreciable and calculable period of usefulness.
These are expenditures resulting in the acquisition of or addition to the
government’s general fixed assets.
      FIXED ASSET. Tangible assets of a durable nature employed in the
operating activities of the unit and that are relatively permanent and are
needed for the production or sale of goods or services are termed property,
plant and equipment or fixed assets. These assets are not held for sale in the
ordinary course of business. This broad group is usually separated into two
classes according to the physical characteristics of the items (e.g. land,
buildings, improvements other than buildings, machinery and equipment,
furniture and fixtures.)
      TANGIBLE ASSETS. Assets that can be observed by one or more of the
physical senses. They may be seen and touched and, in some environments, heard
and smelled.
   (B)   Assets.
      (1)   Land.
         (a)   The town will capitalize all land purchases, regardless of cost.
         (b)   Exceptions to land capitalization are land purchased outright,
as easements, or rights-of-way for infrastructure. Examples of infrastructures
are roads and streets, street lighting systems, bridges, overpasses, sidewalks,
curbs, parking meters, street signs, viaducts, wharves, and storm water
collection.
         (c)   Original cost of land will include the full value given to the
seller, including relocation, legal services incidental to the purchase
(including title work and opinion), appraisal and negotiating fees, surveying
costs for preparing the land for its intended purpose (including contractors
and/or town workers (salary and benefits)) such as demolishing buildings,
excavating, clean up, and/or inspection.
         (d)   A department will record donated land at fair market value on
the date of transfer plus any associated costs.
         (e)   Purchases made using federal or state funding will follow the
source funding policies and above procedures.
      (2)   Machinery and equipment.
         (a)   The definition of MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT is: an apparatus, tool
or conglomeration of pieces to form a tool. This toll will stand alone and not
become a part of a basic structure or building.
         (b)   This town will capitalize and tag items with an individual value
equal to or greater than $5,000. Machinery combined with other machinery to
form one unit with a total value greater than the above mentioned limit will be
one unit.
         (c)   Shipping charges, consultant fees, and any other cost directly
associated with the purchase, delivery, or set up, (including contractors and/
or town workers (salary and benefits)), which make such equipment operable for
its intended purpose will be capitalized.
         (d)   Improvements or renovations to existing machinery and equipment
will be capitalized only if the result of the change meets all of the following
conditions:
            1.   Total costs exceed $5,000;
            2.   The useful life is extended two or more years; and
            3.   The total costs will be greater than the current book value
and less than the fair market value.
         (e)   Examples include:
            1.   A work truck being equipped with screens, lights, or radios
for use as a single unit throughout its life expectancy is considered one unit.
            2.   If police cars are constantly changing light bars or radios to
other vehicles the town will capitalize each piece of equipment separately, if
it meets the required dollar amount.
            3.   A department’s computer (CPU, monitor, keyboard, and printer)
is considered one unit.
         (f)   A department will record donated machinery and equipment at fair
market value on the date of transfers with any associated costs.
         (g)   Purchases made using federal or state funding will follow the
source funding policies and above procedures.
      (3)   Buildings.
         (a)   A department will capitalize buildings at full cost with no
subcategories for tracking the cost of attachments. Examples of attachments are
roofs, heating, cooling, plumbing, lighting, or sprinkler systems, or any part
of the basic building. The department will include the cost of items designated
or purchased exclusively for the building.
         (b)   A department’s new building will be capitalized only if it meets
the following conditions:
            1.   The total costs exceeds $5,000; and
            2.   The useful life is greater than two years.
         (c)   A department improving or renovating an existing building will
capitalize the cost only if the result meets all of the following conditions:
            1.   The total cost exceeds $5,000;
            2.   The useful life is extended two or more years; and
            3.   The total cost will be greater than the current book value and
less than the fair market value.
         (d)   Capital building costs will include preparation of land for the
building, architectural and engineering fees, bond issuance fees, interest cost
(while under construction), accounting costs if material, and any costs
directly attributable to the construction of a building.
         (e)   A department will record donated buildings at fair market value
on the date of transfer with any associated costs.
         (f)   Purchases made using federal or state funding will follow the
source funding policies and above procedures.
      (4)   Improvements other than buildings.
         (a)   1.   The definition of this group is improvements to land for
better enjoyment, attached or not easily removed, and will have a life
expectancy of greater than two years.
            2.   Examples are walks, parking areas and drives, golf cart paths,
fencing, retaining walls, pools, outside fountains, planter, underground
sprinkler systems, and other similar items.
         (b)   Improvements do not include roads, streets, or assets that are
of value only to the public. For example, Main Street is a public street with
greatest value to the public. Roads or drives upon town-owned land that provide
support to our facilities are assets. A sidewalk down the road for public
enjoyment is an infrastructure improvement and is not capitalized. However,
sidewalks installed upon town-owned land for use by the public and for the
support of our facility are capital assets.
         (c)   The town will capitalize new improvements other than buildings
only if it meets the following conditions:
            1.   The total cost exceeds $5,000; and
            2.   The useful life is greater than two years.
         (d)   A department will capitalize improvements or renovations to
existing improvements other than buildings only if the result meets the
following conditions:

recorded at fair market value on the date of transfer with any associated
costs.
         (f)   Purchases made using federal or state funding will follow the
source funding policies and above procedures.
         (g)   HISTORICAL COST. The cash equivalent price exchanged for goods
or services at the date of acquisition. Land, buildings, equipment, and most
inventories are common examples of items recognized under the historical cost
attribute.
         (h)   ENTERPRISE FUNDS. Those funds to account for operations that are
(a) that are financed and operated in a manner similar to private business
enterprise, where the intent of the governing body is that the costs (expenses,
including depreciation) of providing goods or services to the general public on
a continuing basis be financed or recovered primarily through user charges; or
(b) where the governing body has decided that periodic determination of
revenues earned, expenses incurred, and/or net income is appropriate for
capital maintenance, public policy, management control, accountability and
other purposes.

owned water and sewage utilities. Operation of these utilities shall require
enterprise fund accounting and reporting.

expenditures as capital outlays within the fund from which the expenditure as
capital outlays within the fund from which the expenditure was made in

necessary to put the asset into position and ready for use. For purposes of
recording fixed assets of the town and its departments, the valuation of assets
shall be based on historical cost or where the historical cost is
indeterminable, by estimation for those assets in existence.
      (2)   The town’s municipally owned utilities shall record acquisition of
fixed assets in accordance with generally accepted principles. When an asset is
purchased for case, the acquisition is simply recorded at the amount of cash
paid, including all outlays relating to its purchase and preparation for
intended use. Assets may be acquired under a number of other arrangements
including:
         (a)   Assets acquired for a lump-sum purchase price;
         (b)   Purchase deferred payment contact;
         (c)   Acquisition under capital lease;
         (d)   Acquisition by exchange of non-monetary assets;
         (e)   Acquisition by issuance of securities;
         (f)   Acquisition by self-construction;
         (g)   Acquisition by donation or discovery.
      (3)   Some of these arrangements present special problems relating to the
cost to be recorded, for example, in utility accounting, interest during a
period of construction has long been recognized as part of the asset cost.
Reference to an intermediate manual will illustrate the recording of
acquisition of assets under the aforementioned arrangements. For purposes of
recording fixed assets of the utilities the valuation of assets shall recorded
on historical cost.
      (4)   In addition, an asset register (prescribed form 211) shall be
maintained to provide a detail record of the capital assets of the governmental
unit.
   (D)   Safeguarding of assets. Be it ordained that accounting controls be
designed and implemented to provide reasonable assurances that:
      (1)   Capital expenditures made by the town, its various departments and
utilities in accordance with management’s authorization as documented in the
minutes.
      (2)   Transactions of the utilities be recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
practices.
      (3)   Adequate detail records be maintained to assure accountability for
town and utility assets.
      (4)   Access to assets to be permitted in accordance with management’s
authorization.
      (5)   The recorded accountability for assets be compared to the existing
assets at least every two years and appropriate action be taken with respect to
any differences.

   The Town of Otterbein is committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace
and to promoting the health and well-being of its employees and residents, and
to protecting indoor air quality at all of our facilities. A tobacco-free
environment helps create a safe and healthy workplace. Smoking and secondhand

Town of Otterbein recognizes the hazards caused by tobacco use and exposure to
secondhand tobacco smoke.

prohibit smoking as listed below to provide a safe and healthy work environment
for all employees.

smoking, or carrying a lighted or smoldering cigar, cigarette, or pipe of any
kind.'

systems, including ecigarettes, e-pipes, e-hookahs, and e-cigars is prohibited
anywhere where smoking is prohibited.

handbook shall constitute the town fulfilling its requirement to inform
employees under I.C. 7.1-5-12-4(b).

prohibited.
   (D)   Cessation. The Town of Otterbein will help employees who want to quit
smoking by helping them access recommended smoking cessation programs and
materials (visit www.lung.org/stop-smoking for more information).

the manner provided by law and ordinance.
         (a)   The rates and charges will be billed to the tenant or tenants

         (c)   The owners of the properties served, which are occupied by

delinquent upon the following conditions:
            1.   The user has not breached any similar payment plan with the
utility within the preceding 12 months;

described below, is recorded in the office of the County Recorder, except in
the following circumstances:
         (a)   A fee is not enforceable as a lien against a subsequent owner of
property unless the lien for the fee was recorded with the County Recorder
before the conveyance to the subsequent owner. If the property is conveyed
before the lien can be filed, the town shall notify the person who owned the
property at the time the fee became payable. The notice shall inform the former
owner that payment, including penalty fees for delinquencies, is due not more
than 15 days after the date of the notice, if payment is not received within
180 days after the date of the notice, the amount due may be expensed as a bad
debt loss; or
         (b)   A lien attaches against real property occupied by someone other
than the owner only if the utility notified the owner within 20 days after the
time the utility fees became 60 days delinquent; however, the utility is
required to give notice to the owner if the owner has given the town utility
office written notice of the address to which the owner’s notice is to be sent.
A notice sent to the owner under this division (D) must be sent certified mail,
return receipt requested, to: the owner of record of real properly with a
single owner; or at least one of the real property with multiple owners; at the
last address of the owner for the property as indicated in the records of the
County Auditor on the dated of the notice. The cost of sending notice under
this division (D)(1)(b) is an administrative cost that may be billed to the
owner.
      (2)   If the water, wastewater, storm water, garbage collection or tall
grass and weed abatement fees, charges and penalties are not paid within the
time fixed by ordinance, they are delinquent. The Clerk-Treasurer, or his or
her designee, is charged with the responsibility to collect delinquent water,
wastewater, storm water, garbage collection and tall grass and weed abatement
fees, charges and penalties (the “delinquent fees”). The Clerk-Treasurer shall
review all delinquent accounts every month, or as necessary and attempt to

lien, pursuant to I.C. 36-9-23-34.
      (3)   In lieu of collection, the Town Council may write off delinquent
fees that are for less than $40, pursuant to I.C. 36-9-23-33(m).
      (4)   Filing a civil action: the Clerk-Treasurer may cause a civil action
to be filed in the name of the town to collect delinquent fees. A penalty of
10% of the amount of the delinquent fees attaches to the delinquent fees, and
the amount of the delinquent fees, the penalty and a reasonable attorney’s fee
may be recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the town, against the
owners, lessees or users of the property served by the utility or benefit by
the services provided, pursuant to I.C. 36-9-23-31 and 36-1-3-6.
      (5)   Collection through recording a notice of lien: the Clerk-Treasurer
may defer enforcing the collection of delinquent fees until the delinquent fees
have been due and unpaid for at least 90 days, or when any tall grass and weed
abatement fees, charges and penalties have been due and unpaid for at least 30
days. Thereafter, the Clerk-Treasurer may utilize the procedures as described
in I.C. 36-9-23-33 to collect the delinquent fees, summarized as follows.
         (a)   As often as the Clerk-Treasurer determines is necessary in a
calendar year, the Clerk-Treasurer shall prepare a notice of lien for each lot
or parcel of real property on which fees and penalties are delinquent, listing
the amount of fees, charges and penalties which are delinquent, together with
the costs of recording and service charges, on said notice of lien.
         (b)   The Clerk-Treasurer shall record each notice of lien with the
County Recorder, and shall then mail to each property owner on the notice of
lien a notice stating that a lien against the owner’s property has been
recorded. A service charge of $5, a County Auditor’s certification fee of $15,
the cost of recording the notice of lien and the costs of recording a release
of lien, shall be added to the amount due for each notice of lien.

Clerk-Treasurer shall certify to the County Auditor a list of the liens that
remain unpaid for collection in the next May.
         (d)   The Clerk-Treasurer shall release any recorded notice of lien
when the delinquent fees, and service, certification and recording fees
described above, have been fully paid.
         (e)   Upon receipt of the Clerk-Treasurer’s certified list described
above, the County Auditor shall enter on the tax duplicate for the town the
delinquent fees, penalties, service charges, recording fees and certification
fees, which are due not later than the due date of the next installment of
property taxes. The County Treasurer shall then include any unpaid charges for
the delinquent fees, penalty, service charge, recording fees and certification
fee to the owner or owners of each lot or parcel of property, at the time the
next cycle’s property tax installment is billed.
         (f)   After the Clerk-Treasurer’s certification of liens, the Clerk-
Treasurer may not collect or accept delinquent fees, penalties, service
charges, recording fees, or certification fees from property owners whose
property has been certified to the County Auditor.
         (g)   If the delinquent fees, penalty, service charge, recording fees
and certification fee are not paid, they shall be collected by the County
Treasurer in the same way that delinquent property taxes arc collected.
         (h)   At the time of each semiannual tax settlement, the County
Treasurer shall certify to the County Auditor all fees, charges and penalties
that have been collected. The County Auditor shall deduct the service charges
and certification fees collected by the County Treasurer and pay over the
Clerk-Treasurer the remaining fees and penalties due the town. The County
Treasurer shall retain the service charges and certification fees that have
been collected for deposit in the County General Fund.
         (i)   Delinquent fees, penalties and service charges that were not
recorded before a recorded conveyance shall be removed from the tax roll, and a
release of lien shall be recorded, for a purchaser who provides a verified
demand in writing to the Clerk-Treasurer and the County Auditor, which states
that the delinquent fees were not incurred by the purchaser as a user, lessee
or previous owner, and that the purchaser has not been paid by the seller for
the delinquent fees.
         (j)   The Clerk-Treasurer may at any time elect to record a release of
the notice of lien, paying the service charges, recording fees and
certification fees, decertifying the lien such that collection is not
undertaken by the County Auditor and County Treasurer, and seek to collect the
delinquent fees by filing a civil action in the manner described above.

§ 50.04 MOSQUITO CONTROL POLICY.
   The following Mosquito Control Policy, to be implemented and followed by the
town residents, is hereby adopted. An exemption request form is attached to
Ordinance 2014-0902, passed September 2, 2014.
   (A)   Mosquito control policy statement; objection to adult mosquito
control. The town policy regarding an objection to adult mosquito control by
truck-mounted, ultra-low volume (ULV) application of insecticide is as follows:
      (1)   An individual may have his or her owned or leased real property and
a surrounding buffer up to 300 feet on all sides of the property excluded from
ground based ULV adult mosquito control.
      (2)   Each individual requesting this exclusion must submit the request
in writing to the Town of Otterbein. The request must provide the address of
the property to be excluded and must be signed by the owner(s) or leasee(s).
This request will be acknowledged in writing by the Department.
      (3)   If the number of individual objectors, and the location of excluded
properties, precludes an effective mosquito control adulticide service in a
community, the service in that community will be suspended. Service may be
reinstated upon the written request of the community and approval by the
Department.
      (4)   A city, town or community association may request the Department to
rescind or modify a spray exclusion zone if the local authority believes the
exemption unfairly impacts other residents who desire adult mosquito control
service.
      (5)   The Department periodically will verify the continued occupancy or
ownership by objectors of properties excluded from ULV ground spraying to
determine if the objection continues.
      (6)   In the event of mosquito-borne disease or conditions that threaten
public health, the suspension of mosquito adulticide service in an area due to
objectors will be discontinued and the full range of mosquito control
procedures available will be utilized.
   (B)   A request for exemption from adult mosquito control services by the
Town of Otterbein will not be processed unless all of the information requested
has been supplied. The applicant has a right to inspect, amend, or correct this
information. This information may be generally available for public inspection.
This information is not routinely shared with state, federal or local
government agencies.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 51.001 PURPOSE.
   This chapter sets uniform requirements for discharge into the wastewater
collection and treatment system of the town. Its implementation enables the
town to meet the applicable effluent limitations, national standards of
performance, and other discharge criteria which are required or authorized by
regulating the quality and quantity of wastewater discharge into the town’s
systems. This chapter further provides for the issuance of permits and the
setting of user rates, charges and fees for the equitable distribution of
costs. The town will use common sense, good judgment and moderation in carrying
out the purpose of this chapter. Public cooperation and voluntary compliance
will be encouraged and prosecution recommended only when all other options have
been exhausted.

and charges shall be collected from the owners of each and every lot, parcel of
real estate or building that is connected with the town's sanitary system or
otherwise discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other
liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the sanitary sewage system of the
Town of Otterbein. Such rates and charges include user charges, debt service
costs, excessive strength surcharges and other service charges, which rates and
charges shall be payable as hereinafter provided and shall be in an amount
determinable as follows:
      (1)   Metered water users. The sewage rates and charges shall be based on
the quantity of water used on or in the property or premises subject to such
rates and charges, as the same is measured by the water meter there in use,
plus a base charge, as listed below, except as herein otherwise provided. For
the purpose of billing and collecting the charges for sewage service, the water
meters shall be read monthly (or period equaling a month) or estimated. The
water usage schedule on which the amount of said rates and charges shall be
determined is treatment rate and base rate.
      (2)   Unmetered water users. For residential single-family residence
users of the sewage works that are unmetered water users or accurate meter
readings are not available, the monthly charge shall be determined as an
average of single family dwelling units (4,300 gallons per month), except as
herein provided. Sewage service-bills shall be rendered once each month (or
period equaling a month). The rate shall include a base rate as listed below
plus an estimated treatment charge as outlined below. For nonresidential users
of the sewage works that are unmetered water users, the monthly charge shall be
determined by town on an individual basis. For the service rendered to the
town, the town shall be subject to the same rates and charges herein above
provided. Finally, in order to recover the cost of monitoring industrial wastes
the town shall charge the user the amount set forth in §
10.98, per sample. This charge will be reviewed and revised on the same basis
as all other rates and charges in this section.
      (3)   Surcharges. In order that the rates and charges may reflect the
costs of providing service rendered to users, the town shall base its charges
not only on the volume, but also the strength and character of the stronger
than normal domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and
dispose of. The town shall require the user to determine the strength and
content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly into
the sanitary sewage system, in such manner and by such method as the town may
deem practicable in order to determine the proper charge. The user shall
furnish a central sampling point available to the town at all times. Normal
sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a biochemical oxygen demand of
250 milligrams per liter of fluid, suspended solids in excess of 250 milligrams
per liter of fluid; or ammonia nitrogen in excess of 30 milligrams per liter of
fluid. Additional charges for treating stronger than normal domestic waste
shall be made as listed below.
      (4)   Schedule of rates and charges. The following rates and charges
apply to the use of and the service rendered by said sewage works. Phase I
rates shall go into effect starting with the January 1, 2024 billing, Phase II

   (D)   The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewage system and
obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the town shall be
determined by the town in such manner as the town shall reasonably elect, and
the sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates; except, as
is hereinafter provided in this section. The town may make proper allowances in
determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be
consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the town, that such
quantities do not enter the sanitary sewage system.
      (1)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the town
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the town, and the water used thereon or
therein is not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not
acceptable to the town, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise
measured or determined by the town. In order to ascertain the rate or charge
provided in this section, the owner or other interested party shall at his or
her expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices
or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the town for
determining of sewage discharge.
      (2)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids in the town’s
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the town, and in addition, is a user of
water from another source, which is not measured by a water meter, or is
measured by a meter not acceptable to the town, then the amount of water used
shall be otherwise measured or determined by the town. In order to ascertain
the rates or charges, the owner or other interested parties shall, at his or
her expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices
or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the town for
the determination of sewage discharge.
      (3)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate
or buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the
town’s sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of
water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in
each such case, for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be
averaged for each user and the base charge and the flow rates and charges shall
apply to each of the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate or
building served through the single water meter.
      (4)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewage system either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess
of 10,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the
town that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not
and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other interested
party shall, at his or her expense, install and maintain meters, weirs,
volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the town for the determination of sewage discharge.
      (5)   In the event two or more dwelling units such as mobile homes,
apartments or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water or other
liquids into the town’s sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly,
are users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water
meter, then in such case, billing shall be for a single service in the manner
set out elsewhere herein. A dwelling unit shall be interpreted as a room or
rooms or any other space or spaces in which cooking facilities are provided.
   (E)   In order that the rates and charges may reflect the costs of providing
service rendered to users, the town shall base its charges not only on the
volume, but also the strength and character of the stronger than normal
domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose of. The
town shall require the user to determine the strength and content of all sewage
and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly into the sanitary sewage
system, in such manner and by such method as the town may deem practicable in
order to determine the proper charge. The user shall furnish a central sampling
point available to the town at all times.
      (1)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a
biochemical oxygen demand of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid, suspended
solids in excess of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid; or ammonia nitrogen in
excess of 30 milligrams per liter of fluid. Additional charges for treating
stronger than normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis.
         (a)   Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids. There shall be an
additional charge of $0.54 per pound of suspended solids for suspended solids
received in excess of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid.
         (b)   Rate surcharge based upon BOD. There shall be an additional
charge of $0.54 per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for BOD received in
excess of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid.
         (c)   Rate surcharge based upon NH3. There shall be an additional
charge of $0.35 per pound of ammonia for NH3 received in excess of 30
milligrams per liter of fluid.
      (2)   The determination of suspended solids, five-day biochemical oxygen
demand and ammonia nitrogen contained in the waste shall be in accordance with
the latest copy of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage and
Industrial Wastes, as written by the American Public Health Association, the
American Water Works Association and the Water Pollution Control Federation,
and in conformance with “Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis
of Pollutants”, Regulation C.F.R. part 136, published in the Federal Register
on October 16, 1973.
   (F)   The owner of any lot, parcel of real estate or building connecting to
the sewage works shall, prior to being permitted to make a connection, pay a
connection charge as set forth in §
50.03(B)(2) for each connection. The Town Council now finds such a connection
charge to be a reasonable and equitable pro rata cost of construction of a
local or lateral sewer adequate to serve the property so connecting and the
cost of providing a connection to the sewer system.
   (G)   Such rates and charges shall be prepared, billed and collected by the
town in the manner provided by §
50.03.
   (H)   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain
fair and equitable and be in proportion to the cost of providing services to
the various users or user classes, the town shall cause a study to be made
within five years following the date on which this chapter goes into effect.
Such study shall include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the costs
associated with the treatment of excessive strength effluents from industrial
users, volume and delivery flow rate characteristics attributed to the various
users or user classes, the financial position of the sewage works and the
adequacy of its revenue to provide reasonable funds for the operation and
maintenance, replacements, debt service requirements and capital improvements
to the waste treatment systems. The town shall adjust its rates and charges to
reflect the results of the study. Thereafter, on an annual basis, within a
reasonable period of time following the normal accounting period, the town
shall cause a similar study to be made for the purpose of reviewing the
fairness, equity and proportionality of the rates and charges for sewage
services on a continuing basis. Said studies shall be conducted by officers or
employees of the town, or by a firm of certified public accountants, or a firm
of consulting engineers which firms shall have experience in such studies, or
by such combination of officers, employees, certified public accountants, or
engineers as the town shall determine to be best under the circumstances. The
town shall, upon completion of said study revise and adjust the rates and
charges, as necessary in accordance therewith in order to maintain the
proportionality and sufficiency of the rates.
   (I)   The town shall make and enforce such bylaws and regulations as may be
deemed necessary for the safe, economical and efficient management of the
town’s sewage system, pumping stations and sewage conveyance system, for the
construction and use of house sewers and connections to the sewage system, and
for the regulation, collection, rebating and refunding of such rates and
charges. The town is hereby authorized to prohibit dumping of wastes into the
town’s sewage system which, in its discretion, are deemed harmful to the
operation of the sewage treatment works of the town or to require methods
affecting pretreatment of said wastes to comply with the pretreatment standards
included in the national pollution discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit
issued to the sewage works.
   (J)   The rules and regulations promulgated by the town, after approval of
the Town Council shall, among other things, provide for an appeal procedure
whereby a user shall have the right to appeal a decision of the Administrator
of the user charge to the Town Council and that any decision concerning user
charges of the Town Council may be appealed to a court of competent
jurisdiction under the appeal procedures provided for in the Indiana
Administrative Adjudication Act.
   (K)   The Council is hereby further authorized lo enter into special rate
contracts with customers of the sewage works where clearly definable cost to
the sewage works can be determined, and such rate shall be limited to such
costs. Said contract shall be in compliance with Pub. L. No. 92-500 and 95-217.
   (L)   The Council shall not grant free service or use of the sewage
treatment system to any person, group or entity. It is not necessary for an
area or parcel of real estate to be annexed to the town to receive sewage
treatment.
(2008 Code, § 2.3.6) (Ord. 2010-2, passed 5-18-2010; Ord. 2016-0607B, passed 6-

§ 51.141 MULTIPLE USERS ON SINGLE METER.
   (A)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and
the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each such
case, for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be rates and
charges applied to each of the number of residential lots, parcels of real
estate or buildings served through the single water meter.
   (B)   In the event two or more dwelling units, such as trailers, apartments
or housekeeping rooms, discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into
the town’s sanitary system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water
and the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in such
case billing shall be for a single service in the manner set out elsewhere
herein, except that the minimum charge shall not be less than the number of
dwelling units times the minimum charge hereinbefore set forth.
      (1)   In the case of trailer parks, the number of dwelling units shall be
interpreted as the maximum capacity for trailers in said park, plus any other
dwelling units served through the meter.
      (2)   A dwelling unit shall be interpreted as a room or rooms or other
living space or spaces in which cooking facilities are provided.
(2008 Code, § 2.3.7)
§ 51.142 WATER USED FOR FIRE PROTECTION.
   Where a metered water supply is used for fire protection as well as for
other uses, the town may, in its discretion, make adjustments in the minimum
charge and in the sewer charges as may be equitable.
(2008 Code, § 2.3.8)
§ 51.143 SERVICE TO TOWN.
   For services rendered to the town, the town shall be exempt from water and
sewage fee in accordance with the water and sewage rate ordinances.
(2008 Code, § 2.3.9)
STRENGTH OF WASTES SURCHARGE
§ 51.155 LIABILITY FOR SURCHARGE.
   Each industrial or non-industrial user who discharges wastes into the
sewerage system shall be subject to a surcharge, in addition to the regular
sewer charges, based on both the biochemical oxygen demand (or on the chemical
oxygen demand where BOD cannot be determined) and the suspended solids content
of the wastes, if these wastes have a concentration of greater than the
following:
   (A)   A biochemical oxygen demand of 250 milligrams per liter; or where BOD
cannot be determined, then, in lieu of BOD, a chemical oxygen demand of 400
milligrams per liter; or
   (B)   A suspended solids content of 250 milligrams per liter.
(2008 Code, § 2.3.10)
§ 51.156 COMPUTATION OF SURCHARGE.
   The surcharge shall be determined as follows. The excess pounds of BOD (or
COD) and of suspended solids will each be computed by first multiplying the
customer’s billing sewage volume measured in units of 100 cubic feet for the
current billing period by the factor 0.0062321 and then multiplying this
product by the difference between: the concentrations measured in milligrams
per liter of the BOD (or COD) and of the suspended solids respectively in the
customer’s sewage; and the allowed concentrations set out in §
51.155. The surcharge for each constituent will then be determined by
multiplying the excess pounds of each constituent by the appropriate rate of
surcharge set out in §
51.157.
(2008 Code, § 2.3.11)
§ 51.157 RATES OF SURCHARGE.
   The rate of surcharge for each of the aforementioned constituents shall be
as follows:
   (A)   For biochemical oxygen demand (BOD): 12.8 cents per pound;
   (B)   For chemical oxygen demand (COD) where BOD cannot be determined: 12.8
cents per pound; and
   (C)   For suspended solids: 11.9 cents per pound.
(2008 Code, § 2.3.12)
§ 51.158 REVISION OF RATES OF SURCHARGE.
   Prior to May 1 of each year, the Clerk-Treasurer shall submit to the Town
Council a comparison on the calculated unit costs for removing BOD and
suspended solids from the wastewater treatment plant influent during the
previous calendar year with the unit charges currently in effect in order that
the Town Council may determine whether the current rates of surcharge are
adequate or should be changed by the Town Council.

§ 53.11 CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL PROGRAM.
   The Town of Otterbein, and the Otterbein Water Works, hereby adopt the State
of Indiana cross connection control rules as set forth herein, to protect the
public water supply system from water of questionable quality, waste or other
contaminants which may enter the water supply system from connections or
arrangements of piping and appurtenances due to a reversal of flow. The cross
connection control program set forth below shall be effective immediately upon
approval by the Town Council.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   To protect the public potable water supply served by the Water
Department from the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating,
within its customers internal distribution system, such contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow or back-siphon into the public water system.
      (2)   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-
connections, actual or potential, between its customers’ in-plant potable water
system, and non-potable systems.
      (3)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will effectively prevent the contamination or
pollution of all potable water systems by cross-connection.
   (B)   Authority.
      (1)   Under the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, and the statutes
of the State of Indiana, the water purveyor has the primary responsibility for
preventing water from unapproved sources, or any other substances, from
entering the public potable water system.

Council and Water Department, Rules and Regulations.
   (C)   Responsibility. The Water Superintendent shall be responsible for the
protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination
or pollution due to the backflow or backsiphonage of contaminants or pollutants
through the water service connection. If, in the judgment of the Water
Superintendent, an approved backflow device is required at the town's water
service connection to any customer's premises, the Water Superintendent, or his
delegated agent, shall give notice in writing to the customer to install an
approved backflow prevention device at each service connection to his or her
premises. The customer shall, within 90 days, install such approved device, or
devices, at his or her own expense, and failure or refusal, or inability on the
part of the customer to install said device or devices within 90 days, shall
constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such

         (m)   Commercial laundries and dye works, excluding coin-operated
laundromats;
         (n)   Sewage, storm water, and industrial waste treatment plants and
pumping stations;
         (o)   Waterfront facilities, including piers, docks, marinas, and
shipyards;
         (p)   Industrial facilities that recycle water; and
         (q)   Restricted or classified facilities (federal government defense
or military installations), or other facilities closed to the supplier of water
or to the Commissioner.
   (H)   Permits. The Department shall not permit a cross-connection within the
public water supply system unless it is considered necessary and that it cannot
be eliminated.
      (1)   Cross-connection permits that are required for each backflow
prevention device are obtained from the Department. A fee, as set forth in §
10.98, will be charged for the initial permit. No fee will be charged for the
renewal of a permit. Backflow prevention devices existing and installed on or
before the date of passage of this section shall not be required to pay a
permit fee.
      (2)   Permits shall be renewed annually from the date of inspection and
are non-transferable. Permits are subject to revocation and become immediately
revoked if the owner should so change the type of cross-connection or degree of
hazard associated with the service.
      (3)   A permit is not required when fixture isolation is achieved with
the utilization of a non-testable backflow preventer.
   (I)   Existing in-use backflow prevention devices. Any existing backflow
preventer shall be allowed by the Department to continue in service unless the
degree of hazard is such as to supercede the effectiveness of the present
backflow preventer, or results in an unreasonable risk to the public health.
Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in the case of a residential
installation converting to a business establishment, any existing backflow
preventer must be upgraded to a reduced pressure principle device, or a reduced
pressure principle device must be installed in the event that no backflow
device was present.
   (J)   Periodic testing.
      (1)   Reduced pressure principle backflow devices shall be tested and
inspected at least semi-annually.
      (2)   Periodic testing shall be performed by the Department's certified
tester or his delegated representative. This testing will be done at the
owner's expense.
      (3)   The testing shall be conducted during the Department's regular
business hours. Exceptions to this, when at the request of the owner, may
require additional charges to cover the increased costs to the Department.
      (4)   Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test will be
repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of the repair
the device will be re-tested at owner’s expense to insure correct operation.
High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the
backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately. In other
situations, a compliance date of not more than 30 days after the test date will
be established. The owner is responsible for spare parts, repair tools, or a
replacement device. Parallel installation of two devices is an effective means
of the owner insuring that uninterrupted water service during testing or repair
of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires such continuity.
      (5)   Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than
specified in division (J)(1) above, in cases where there is a history of test
failures and the Department feels that due to the degree of hazard involved,
additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional tests will be born by
the owner.
   (K)   Records and reports.
      (1)   Records. The Department will initiate and maintain the following:
         (a)   Master files on customer cross-connection tests and/or
inspections.
         (b)   Master files on cross-connection permits.
         (c)   Copies of permits and permit applications.
         (d)   Copies of lists and summaries supplied to the Commission.
      (2)   Reports. The Department will submit the following to the
Commission.
         (a)   Initial listing of low hazard cross-connections to the state.
         (b)   Initial listing of high hazard cross-connections to the state.
         (c)   Annual update lists of items (a) and (b) above.
         (d)   Annual summary of cross-connection inspections to the state.

property over or within the town's streets or rights-of-way, contrary to this
section.
      (2)   That the owner has seven days from the date of the mailing of the
notice to cause the property to be brought into compliance with this section;
and

violation; and
      (4)   That the owner will be billed following the provision of these
services at the codified service charge rate or at their actual cost plus
administrative costs; and

provided by local ordinance, and will have added to it any other administrative
costs incurred by the town in preparation of this certification, and these sums
will be placed on the tax duplicate for the property affected. Alternatively,

intention within seven days of mailing of the notice and request to be placed
on the agenda for the next regularly scheduled Town Council meeting. A majority
of any members present at the next Town Council meeting shall hear the property
owner's objection and vote either for or against the objection and the majority
shall prevail. In the event the Town Council denies the appeal, the property
